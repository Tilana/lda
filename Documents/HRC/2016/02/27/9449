<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report describes the work of the office in Guatemala of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights during 2006, under the mandate 
established by the Agreement of 10 January 2005 between the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of the Republic of Guatemala.  The 
office in Guatemala continued to observe the situation of human rights and to provide State 
institutions with advisory services and technical assistance geared towards implementation of the 
recommendations contained in its previous report (E/CN.4/2006/10/Add.1). 
</p>
<p> The office carried out its work in a context marked by social tension and continuing 
violence and general insecurity, as well as the prospect of a general election campaign in 2007.  
The office followed particularly closely the still volatile situation that hinders the full enjoyment 
of the right to life and makes it essential for the State to step up preventive measures and its 
investigation and punishment of threats to and violations of this right.  The office also carefully 
monitored the public security situation and its impact on human rights, the continuing challenges  
in efforts to combat impunity and strengthen the rule of law, the progress and difficulties in 
implementing the National Compensation Programme, the situation of the indigenous peoples 
and the climate of increasing political violence, as well as the situations of violence against 
women, of economic, social and cultural rights, and of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p> With the strengthening of the office in Guatemala in the course of 2006, it became 
possible to gather more detailed information on the situation of human rights in Guatemala, 
which facilitated the work of providing advisory services and technical cooperation to State 
institutions and civil society organizations.  The office provided technical advice to various 
national institutions, including Congress, the Presidential Human Rights Commission 
(COPREDEH), the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Prisons Department, the National 
Compensation Programme and the Office of the Human Rights Procurator.  It also assisted civil 
society in its interaction with the treaty-monitoring bodies and the special procedures, and with 
publication of their recommendations and monitoring of implementation. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner urges Guatemala to pursue its implementation of the 
recommendations put forward in 2005 and presents a further 18 recommendations relating to the 
legislative framework for the protection of human rights, public security, the rule of law and 
efforts to combat impunity, the situation of the indigenous peoples, political rights, violence 
against women, economic, social and cultural rights, human rights defenders, public policy in the 
area of human rights and the technical cooperation and advisory services provided by the 
OHCHR office in Guatemala. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 January 2005 the Agreement between the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Government of the Republic of Guatemala on the 
establishment of an office in Guatemala was signed.  The Agreement was approved by Congress 
on 31 May, ratified by the President on 23 June and officially communicated in writing to the 
High Commissioner on 16 September.  The OHCHR office in Guatemala officially started its 
work on 20 September 2005. 
</p>
<p>2. Under the Agreement and in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141 
of 20 December 1993, the OHCHR office in Guatemala is to observe the situation of human 
rights in order to advise State institutions and civil society. 
</p>
<p>3. This report aims to provide an overview of the work carried out in 2006 by the office in 
Guatemala in accordance with its mandate.  It contains comments on the current human rights 
situation and information on the advisory services and technical cooperation provided to assist 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the report for 2005. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  NATIONAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Government of Guatemala sought election to the Human Rights Council and, having 
been elected, made voluntary commitments to promote human rights.  It also contested a seat on 
the Security Council, but this was ultimately given to Panama.  In December the agreement 
between the Government of Guatemala and the United Nations to create the International 
Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) was signed.  Importantly, legislation was 
passed to consolidate human rights protection in Guatemala, as had been recommended, and 
there were other positive developments in respect of reparations for the victims of violations and 
the promotion of human rights within society. 
</p>
<p>5. The year was marked by social tension, including strikes by trainee teachers and by 
doctors.  Other conflicts centred on the granting of licences for the exploitation of natural 
resources and the ratification of the free trade agreement with the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>6. The problems of violence and security continued to be a source of concern for 
Guatemalan society in 2006.  To deal with the situation, the Government involved the armed 
forces in public security operations. 
</p>
<p>7. The election campaign started early and was accompanied by increased political 
violence.  There were splits in a number of political groupings and new alliances were formed, 
which affected elections to the executive committee of Congress and resulted in a failure to 
approve the 2007 budget, so that the 2006 budget remained in force. 
</p>
<p>8. Investigations into violations during the armed conflict, and in particular the presence of 
a commission of enquiry from the High Court of Spain, showed that there are continuing 
divisions within society. 
</p>
<p>9. The High Commissioner visited Guatemala in May and met the President and senior 
government officials, representatives of legislative and judicial bodies, representatives of civil  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>society and victims of human rights violations.  She also visited Rabinal (Baja Verapaz), where 
she had the opportunity to speak with victims of the armed conflict and see the progress and 
problems of the National Compensation Programme on the ground. 
</p>
<p>10. Visits were also made to Guatemala by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, Mr. Rodolfo Stavenhagen, the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Mr. Philip Alston, and the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.  These visits were facilitated by 
Guatemala&#8217;s open invitation to the extra-conventional mechanisms of the United Nations, and 
the High Commissioner congratulates the Government on its policy in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SITUATIONS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Right to life 
</b></p>
<p>11. The State of Guatemala continues to show ineffectiveness in protecting and guaranteeing 
fundamental rights, in particular the right to life.  In 2006 the number of violent deaths continued 
to increase, rising to 5,885,<b>1</b> exceeding the 5,338 killings in 2005 and the highest number in the 
last 10 years. 
</p>
<p>12. The inadequate protection of the right to life is a matter for concern.  Although no precise 
data exist that would make it possible to confirm whether there has been an increase in the 
number of extrajudicial executions or cases of &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;,<b>2</b> the large number of 
unresolved violent deaths is enough to show that Guatemala has encountered serious difficulties 
in safeguarding the right to life and effectively combating impunity. 
</p>
<p>13. The OHCHR office in Guatemala has received information on the direct involvement of 
State security officers in extrajudicial executions and it has also noted that the State has incurred 
indirect responsibility through the acquiescence of a number of its officers.  Impunity has created 
a climate in which the perpetrators of extrajudicial executions could feel sufficiently confident to 
step up their activities, which has increased people&#8217;s feeling of vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>14. The office noted the appearance of corpses bearing signs of torture and subsequent 
execution.  There are similarities in <i>modus operandi</i> as well as in the profile of the victims 
(generally young people from deprived areas of the capital) that would seem to indicate the 
practice of &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15. In the majority of cases, administrative or criminal investigations have thrown no light on 
the events or on the organizations responsible.  Lack of information makes it impossible to 
establish the true magnitude of the problem. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  According to the National Civil Police. 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  This is the term used in the national press for extrajudicial executions of individuals with a 
</p>
<p>police or criminal record, whose deaths are not investigated. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>16. The High Commissioner acknowledges the efforts of the Government of Guatemala to 
promote the right to life and other human rights.  At the same time, she calls for reinforcement of 
the State institutions that safeguard these rights, in particular the institutions of the justice 
administration system, to enable them to effectively safeguard these rights and freedoms.  The 
State&#8217;s efforts must be directed towards the prevention, investigation and punishment - as an 
inherent legal obligation - not only of the violations committed by its own officers but also of 
those arising in the context of, for example, organized crime or drug trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Public security 
</b></p>
<p>17. Faced with persistently high levels of violence, the State has still not managed to draw up 
a public security policy consistent with human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. The grave public security situation presents a considerable challenge to the National Civil 
Police (PNC).  Notwithstanding the efficacy of the Government&#8217;s attempts to purge the force and 
strengthen the disciplinary system, the institution suffers from serious problems such as violent 
deaths among police officers (according to official sources, 60 deaths as at 19 December), a poor 
civil intelligence system, insufficient officers, especially investigators, and low pay. 
</p>
<p>19. Increasing the PNC budget would not only enhance the status of the police in terms of 
remuneration and expedite the upgrading of vehicles, weapons, communications and 
infrastructure, but would also make it possible to improve the work of the institution and recruit 
more officers, maintaining the multi-ethnic composition of the force and encouraging more 
women to join.  It is also important to improve initial and in-service education.  The most crucial 
subjects to be covered if the institution is to be able to meet these challenges include dealing with 
lynchings, domestic violence and juvenile crime. 
</p><p>20. Although the peace agreements and their framework legislation provide for the 
strengthening of the PNC and the redefinition of the Army&#8217;s role in a democratic society, the 
policies implemented have tended to do the opposite, strengthening the Army at the expense of 
the police, without any tangible results in terms of public security or reduced violence. 
</p>
<p>21. Government Decision No. 178-2004 reduced the Army to 15,500 troops.  However, 
the Decision was amended in 2006 and it became instead a mobilization plan.  In March 2006 
the Public Security Special Reserve Corps was established to perform public security tasks.  
The Corps comprises some 3,000 ex-members of the military, which represents an 
effective 20 per cent increase in the size of the Army. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Rule of law and impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Justice and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>22. The justice system has continued with its modernization and reform programme. 
</p><p>23. Rota criminal courts were introduced in the capital (courts of the peace and courts of first 
instance operating round the clock); and the Supreme Court abrogated the decision by which the 
serious crimes courts were established and redistributed all serious crimes cases among the 
country&#8217;s criminal trial courts.  The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office continued its efforts to implement 
its Plan for Criminal Policy.  The adoption of a general instruction to combat trafficking in </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>persons, including illegal adoptions, was another positive step.  In addition, a strategic sectoral 
plan for criminal justice reform for the period 2006 to 2010 was prepared by the Coordinating 
Authority for the Modernization of the Justice Sector, which establishes action lines and outcome 
indicators for measuring impact in strategic areas such as access to justice and transparency. 
</p><p>24. Despite these efforts, impunity continues to undermine the credibility of the justice 
system and is the main obstacle to the effective enjoyment of human rights.  Criminal 
investigation capacity is still inadequate and does not give sufficient importance to the use of 
forensic evidence.  So the establishment of the National Institute of Forensic Science is an 
important step.  The programme for the protection of witnesses and parties to judicial 
proceedings does not have the resources or the proper legal framework to operate efficiently, 
which discourages people from cooperating with the justice system. 
25. The justice system is still too weak to confront organized crime and its powerful 
components, so the recent decision establishing the International Commission against Impunity 
in Guatemala to assist the authorities in their efforts is one of some importance. 
</p>
<p>26. Although the institutions of justice - in particular the judiciary and the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office - have extended their geographical coverage, geographical inaccessibility is 
a barrier that prevents many individuals from exercising their rights.  This applies particularly to 
non-criminal matters and the effective right to a second hearing.  As to linguistic accessibility, no 
global policy has yet been adopted.  Judicial institutions have tried in various ways to obtain the 
services of legal interpreters and translators, but provision remains inadequate.  In terms of 
cultural accessibility, institutions have been slow to include intercultural awareness in in-service 
training for justice system officials, and the use of cultural expert testimony<b>3</b> is still rare.  
Elimination of discrimination in the justice sector is another area where more work is needed - 
measures taken thus far have been isolated or sporadic. 
</p>
<p>27. Accountability has not yet taken root in the institutional culture of the justice sector.  
Although some institutions have strengthened their performance evaluation systems and their 
disciplinary and dismissal procedures, many acts demonstrating negligence or even criminal 
responsibility have gone unpunished.  In many cases people have no access to information on 
the progress of disciplinary proceedings or any right of appeal against the decisions made in 
such proceedings.  Greater efforts must be made to increase transparency in the justice sector, 
and institutions must show a genuine willingness to allow more effective social review.  The 
High Commissioner appreciates the serious monitoring efforts made by civil society institutions 
and organizations in the area of justice administration. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  Cultural expert testimony is scientific evidence of an anthropological nature that is used to 
</p>
<p>establish whether or not the behaviour of a person belonging to a specific cultural group is 
normal for the group or regarded as an offence. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Transitional justice 
</b>28. The Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights attached to the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, which investigates most cases of human rights violations related to the 
internal armed conflict, carried out various actions to improve its investigative work, including 
training officials in forensic anthropological investigation procedures and reviewing the handling 
of the cases before it.  However, no significant progress has been made in the identification and 
prosecution of perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>29. One case of enforced disappearance was brought to trial in which enforced disappearance 
was recognized as a continuing offence, but the decision was appealed.  The Special 
Investigations Unit of the Office of the Human Rights Procurator made progress with 
identification and prosecution in a case of enforced disappearance from the time of the armed 
conflict.  However, the Appeal Court upheld an application from the accused for exoneration 
under the National Reconciliation Act.  The High Commissioner is concerned at the broad 
interpretation given to this Act, which goes against the spirit of the Act and the legal framework 
for human rights in force in Guatemala.  One positive development was that, in the case being 
pursued by the High Court of Spain against former officials of various governments during the 
internal armed conflict, the ordinary courts complied with the High Court&#8217;s judicial requests, 
which led to the arrest of two of the accused with a view to extradition.  The Constitutional Court 
then ordered the court dealing with the extradition request to review the scope of the universal 
jurisdiction invoked by the High Court; the High Commissioner is concerned at attempts to 
restrict Guatemala&#8217;s duty of cooperation in judicial matters relating to the punishment of serious 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>30. Obstructive applications for <i>amparo</i> are still delaying cases of transitional justice.  In this 
connection, bill No. 3319 on the reform of <i>amparo</i> is still pending before Congress.  Another 
negative factor is the refusal of the Ministry of Defence to provide information on cases of 
human rights violations during the internal armed conflict, on the grounds that it is a State secret.  
In this connection the issuance of Government Decision No. 535-2006 on access to information 
held by public authorities is a positive step, though the decree does not address the issue of State 
secrets.  Bill No. 3165 on access to public information is still pending before Congress.  There 
have been attempts in certain sectors to revive draft legislation aimed at extending the 
jurisdiction of military courts to ordinary offences. 
31. In May 2006 the Presidential Human Rights Commission (COPREDEH), the Office of 
the Human Rights Procurator, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and two Congressional committees, 
the Human Rights Committee and the Peace and Demining Committee, agreed to work together 
to set up a national commission to search for victims of enforced disappearance.  A preparatory 
committee was subsequently set up which, on the basis of a proposal from the Office of the 
Human Rights Procurator and civil society organizations, drafted a preliminary bill to establish 
such a commission.  Entitled &#8220;Bill establishing the National Commission to Search for Victims 
of Enforced and Other Forms of Disappearance&#8221;, it was submitted as a draft law by the chairs of 
the Human Rights Committee and the Peace and Demining Committee to the Legislation 
Department of Congress on 14 December 2006.  The Presidential Human Rights Commission 
(COPREDEH) also urged the adoption of a government decision on the issue, and a bill to 
establish the legal concept of absence by reason of enforced disappearance is awaiting 
presentation to Congress. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>32. The National Compensation Programme continued its administrative restructuring, which 
is almost complete.  The implementation of this programme represents a considerable challenge 
for the State owing to its complex nature and the scale of the task of providing full reparation to 
victims.   The achievements of the Programme include operational redeployment in regional 
bureaux, training of staff hired to process reparation applications and special measures of 
financial compensation in various departments of the country.  The Programme directors also 
show real political commitment to the Programme, despite financial constraints.  However, little 
progress was observed in the implementation of non-financial measures of reparation or in the 
creation of a national register of victims.  Following a period of strained relations between the 
Programme and victims&#8217; representatives an agreement was reached in November 2006 (the third 
in one year) providing for, inter alia:  improved social communication strategies and programme 
transparency; bi-monthly progress reports; a comprehensive vision and policy for the 
Programme; progress with the national register of victims; speedier execution of the programme 
budget; and the establishment of a facilitation body.  The High Commissioner welcomes this 
agreement and urges that it be implemented in a climate of cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  States of alert 
</b></p>
<p>33. In 2006 the Government proclaimed four states of alert, which are a form of state of 
emergency.  The grounds for these proclamations, including &#8220;sustained climate of social 
confrontation&#8221;, &#8220;breaches of the peace and of State security&#8221; and &#8220;breaches of the peace and of 
State security constituting threats to the security of the residents of municipalities&#8221; are not the 
kind of emergency provided for under article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights or article 27 of the American Convention on Human Rights (Pact of San Jose, 
Costa Rica).  The state of emergency imposed is one whose legality is not determined in advance 
by Congress and is based on the 1965 Public Order Act, which predates the 1985 Constitution 
and is awaiting amendment.  The Government&#8217;s reports on these states of emergency do not 
show that the measures taken were those strictly required by the exigencies of the situation or 
that they were proportionate with the aims they were intended to achieve. 
</p>
<p>34. The use of force and firearms by law-enforcement officials must be exceptional and is 
not justified by states of emergency.  Operations which envisage the use of lethal weapons 
must be carefully planned and any deaths that occur, as happened at the Pav&#243;n prison 
on 25 September 2006 during the state of alert proclaimed in the municipality of Fraijanes, must 
be investigated promptly, thoroughly and impartially. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Situation of the indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Discrimination against the indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>35. Despite the Government&#8217;s efforts to combat the problem, discrimination against the 
indigenous peoples continues in its various forms.  In 2006 the Presidential Commission on 
Discrimination and Racism (CODISRA) registered 63 cases of discrimination, 22 of which were 
investigated by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office.  The fact that racism remains entrenched at all 
levels of society is a cause for concern.  The main areas in which shortcomings continue to be 
noted include:  social and political participation; strategies to improve the allocation of public 
expenditure; access to justice; and the design of development policy, especially in health and  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>education.  In November, the Vice-President published a study on the cost of racism which 
estimated that, in 2003, racism was responsible for losses in the amount of US$ 855 million, 
or 3 per cent of GDP.  This is an example of the structural impact of racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>36. Noteworthy among the positive actions undertaken by the Government are national 
public awareness and information campaigns launched by government institutions, in particular 
CODISRA, COPREDEH and the Office for the Defence of Indigenous Women (DEMI). 
Provision has also been made for the gradual recruitment of 300 indigenous people to civil 
service posts.  According to the Peace Secretariat, 151 have so far been recruited, 97 men and 
54 women, mostly to middle management.  The High Commissioner hopes that this policy will 
continue and that it will improve the proportion of indigenous people in the civil service.  In 
addition, the policy on co-existence and the elimination of racism and racial discrimination 
presented in November 2006 proposes to increase and restructure investment and public 
spending, promote access to production, finance and credit, expand the scope and quality of 
basic services and strengthen the institutional framework for the elimination of discrimination 
and racism.  Another important development is the establishment of five regional offices of 
CODISRA, which cover 24 linguistic communities. 
</p>
<p>37. With regard to the criminal prosecution of racial discrimination, only one case out 
of 79 reported by the State to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was 
settled in court during 2006, and the punitive damages awarded to the victim have not yet been 
paid.  In another racial discrimination case, the judiciary&#8217;s Disciplinary Affairs Unit ordered the 
temporary suspension of five judiciary staff as a disciplinary measure.  The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office intends to establish a special Anti-Discrimination office, to be staffed with a special 
prosecutor and four assistant prosecutors to handle cases at the national level.  In-service training 
in investigating the offence of discrimination should be provided to all staff of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>38. Specific legislation to combat racial discrimination has still not been enacted, and 
Guatemala has still not recognized the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination to consider individual complaints. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Recognition of legal pluralism 
</b></p>
<p>39. Although the Constitution of Guatemala and the 1989 ILO Convention concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (No. 169) recognize the indigenous 
peoples&#8217; legal system, there are still conflicting views on the issue in the national debate, with 
some refusing to recognize the system and others suggesting it should be seen as another method 
of alternative dispute resolution or incorporated into the formal legal system.  The effective 
implementation of legal pluralism is therefore necessary. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Political rights 
</b></p>
<p>40. It is worrying to note that there has been a sharp increase in political violence, which 
impairs the full enjoyment of political rights, including social participation in decision-making. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>41. During the year there were numerous attacks and threats against political leaders at all 
levels.<b>  </b>The Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) reported attacks on 19 of its 
leaders, and the Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza (UNE), 14.  Several political leaders have met 
violent deaths, including the governor of Solol&#225; and leading members of the Partido Patriota, 
Encuentro por Guatemala and UNE.  This violence bears all the signs of the involvement of 
organized crime and the drugs trade, as well as of internal power struggles. 
</p>
<p>42. So long as these acts remain unpunished, people are not encouraged to exercise their right 
to political participation, and this weakens the mechanisms of democratic participation in 
Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>43. The climate of violence and the part played by non-State actors in restricting political 
rights and participation pose new challenges to a State whose capacity to fight corruption, 
enforce regulations and control its political parties, as well as to investigate acts of political 
violence, has proved insufficient<b>.  </b>It is therefore essential to strengthen the institutions 
responsible for guaranteeing political participation, especially the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. 
</p>
<p>44. In view of the general elections to be held in September 2007, the High Commissioner 
calls attention to the inadequacy of safeguards allowing the free exercise of political rights.<b>  </b>The 
current situation sends disturbing signals both to those who wish to participate in politics and to 
those who hold elected office. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>45. The High Commissioner notes with concern that violence against women has increased 
in quantity and intensity, in both the private and the public spheres.<b>  </b>From 1 January to 
31 October 2006, for example, the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Women of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office received more than 8,000 complaints of sexual assault in the department of 
Guatemala City alone, while the National Civil Police (PNC) registered 582 violent deaths of 
women in 2006, most of them non-indigenous women in urban areas, representing an increase 
from 2005 (519 cases). 
</p>
<p>46. The Act on the Prevention, Punishment and Elimination of Domestic Violence (Decree 
No. 97-96) facilitates access to justice by simplifying complaints procedures, but complaints 
may be made only to seek application of protection measures for victims and the Act fails to 
prescribe criminal sanctions for perpetrators. <b> </b>Given this situation, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended to Guatemala that it should, 
inter alia, define domestic violence and sexual abuse as criminal offences.  
</p>
<p>47. The most extreme form of violence against women is femicide.<b>4</b>  The Guatemalan State&#8217;s 
most noteworthy action in this area has been to set up, in March 2006, the Commission to 
Combat Femicide to research and document the problem and, as a first step, to map its extent.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  This term is used in Guatemala, as defined by Mexican anthropologist Marcela Lagarde, to 
</p>
<p>describe the misogynistic murder of women that goes unpunished as a result of the State&#8217;s 
systematic failure to act. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>The Commission is coordinated by the Presidential Office for Women and comprises 
representatives of the three branches of government.<b>  </b>It is worrying to note that, despite the 
problem&#8217;s magnitude and very adverse effects on Guatemalan society, there are no reliable, 
uniform statistical data disaggregated by gender, age and social status. 
</p>
<p>48. The High Commissioner believes that the elimination of violence against women should 
be addressed by the State as a matter of priority at the legislative, judicial and policy levels. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Analysis of the budget from a human rights perspective 
</b></p>
<p>49. The High Commissioner analysed the current General Budget of Revenue and 
Expenditure of the State of Guatemala from a human rights perspective in order to evaluate the 
extent to which the State is complying with its international obligations to take steps to promote, 
realize and protect economic, social and cultural rights, especially those of the most vulnerable 
persons or groups. 
</p>
<p>50. The critical mass of resources allocated by the Government to the realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights is low in international terms, as can be seen from 
expenditures on education and health in the 2006 budget (2.8 per cent and 1.5 per cent of GDP 
respectively).  There are areas of human rights where there are major deficiencies and an extreme 
shortage of resources, which means the gaps in the realization of human rights are in danger of 
widening - or not narrowing - year after year.  Thus there are budget entries on the right to 
non-discrimination for the equivalent of 0.009 per cent of GDP for 2006, as well as allocations 
of less than 1 per cent of GDP for promoting and protecting women&#8217;s rights, cultural rights, the 
right to work and the right to social security. 
</p>
<p>51. The Millennium Development Goals are included in the national budget merely as a 
reference.<b>  </b>Only in the case of education is it possible to see a direct link between the Goals and 
the programmes carried out by the relevant ministry.<b>  </b>In the other sectors, such as child chronic 
malnutrition, no such link can be found. 
</p>
<p>52. By including certain human rights targets, the peace accords favoured an initial increase 
in social spending in the years following signature in 1996.  However, these targets have not 
been met every year with, particularly, serious shortcomings in the area of housing. 
</p>
<p>53. The budget of the Guatemalan State is very small in comparison to the country&#8217;s human 
rights needs because the State&#8217;s tax revenue is so low.  The fact that the tax burden is less than 
11 per cent of GDP severely limits the scope of publicly funded programmes for the 
advancement of human rights.<b>  </b>Social programmes are the first to be cut back to make up for 
shortfalls in State resources. 
</p>
<p>54. Some positive changes planned for 2007 risk being abandoned as a result of the failure to 
approve the 2007 budget.<b>  </b>This could represent a setback in the area of economic, social and 
cultural rights.<b>  </b>Moreover, no measures have been introduced to increase the tax burden. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Right to work and trade union rights 
</b></p>
<p>55. On 12 June the Government announced ratification of the 1999 ILO Convention 
concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of 
Child Labour (No. 182) and issued a government decision prohibiting the worst forms of labour 
for children under the age of 18 and establishing administrative sanctions for offenders.<b>  </b>The 
decision will enable inspectors from the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to monitor the 
presence of minors in mines, plantations and rural villages.  Nevertheless, there are still too few 
inspectors authorized to monitor child labour standards. 
</p>
<p>56. As indicated in the High Commissioner&#8217;s 2005 report, a decision of the Constitutional 
Court in August 2004 divested the Labour Inspectorate of its power to punish breaches of 
labour law, giving rise to a dispute between the labour inspectors and the courts over how to 
enforce sanctions for labour offences.  Since that time, proceedings for offences brought by 
the Ministry of Labour and Social Security have not been able to resolve disputes over labour 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>57. According to the Human Rights Defenders Protection Unit of the National Human Rights 
Movement, up to 31 October 2006 there were 226 attacks against human rights defenders, 
exceeding the number of attacks in 2005 (224).  The attacks take the form of threats and 
abductions, hit-lists, surveillance and criminal accusations against human rights defenders, as 
well as break-ins at the headquarters of organizations working with victims, especially victims of 
the internal armed conflict.<b>  </b>In 2006 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ordered 
five protective measures, compared with six in 2005 and eight in 2004.<b>  </b>Although the figures are 
indicative of a slight reduction, it should be noted that eight applications for protective measures 
filed this year are still pending. 
</p>
<p>58. The visit of a rogatory commission of the National High Court of Spain, which is 
investigating several former civil servants for human rights violations perpetrated during the 
armed conflict, exacerbated tensions between human rights defenders and groups close to the 
soldiers involved.  This polarization reached a critical pitch on 26 June, when the Guatemalan 
Military Veterans Association put out a paid advertisement threatening the human rights 
organizations.   
</p>
<p>59. Complaints of threats and attacks on human rights defenders have scarcely been 
investigated.  This fuels the perception that there is inadequate political will to protect defenders.  
Consequently, the High Commissioner stresses the need to strengthen policy on protection of 
human rights defenders in accordance with the Declaration adopted by the General Assembly 
in 1998. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/49/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>IV.  WORK OF THE OFFICE AND FOLLOW-UP TO RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Work of the office 
</b></p>
<p>60. In 2006 the office in Guatemala was strengthened through the recruitment of new staff, 
which made it possible to step up the field presence considerably.  Over the course of the 
year 42 observer missions were carried out in the 22 departments of Guatemala, accounting for a 
total of 109 days in the field.  Of the 148 complaints received, 139 were selected for follow-up 
because they concerned human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>61.   These visits enabled the office to establish direct contact with the authorities and with 
members of civil society at the local level, as well as to gather information needed to analyse 
trends in the human rights situation.  Such analysis is used to orient the technical cooperation and 
advisory services provided to State and civil society. 
</p>
<p>62. By means of press releases, speeches, opinion articles and interviews, the office has 
helped to generate debate on such topics of national importance as transitional justice and past 
crimes, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture, impunity, the rights of the 
indigenous peoples, violence against women and discrimination.  In addition, a documentation 
centre was set up which organized a series of human rights workshops for students from 
Guatemala&#8217;s three main universities.  The centre also belongs to the National Library Network 
and has more than 400 publications on human rights that are available to the public. 
</p>
<p>63. The office provided follow-up and technical advice to NGOs, in particular on the 
penitentiary system and the International Criminal Court.  It also advised civil society 
organizations in preparing alternative reports relating to the Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, thereby strengthening the capacities of civil society to 
interact with the treaty bodies.  In conjunction with the World Organization against Torture 
(OMCT), the office followed up the concluding observations of the Committee against Torture 
in coordination with civil society organizations and national institutions.  Together with the 
Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT), the Torture Victim Rehabilitation and 
Investigation Centre (RCT) and COPREDEH, the office in Guatemala organized activities to 
promote the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment for civil society, Congress and national institutions. 
</p>
<p>64. The office concluded an agreement with the Office of the Human Rights Procurator, to 
broaden cooperation between the two institutions.  Among other things, it provided technical 
advice in analysing the education reform from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>65. The office concluded an agreement with COPREDEH to provide it with technical 
assistance and advice in preparing Guatemala&#8217;s third periodic report to the Human Rights 
Committee and its initial report to the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families.  This year, reports submitted by Guatemala were 
examined by the Committee against Torture, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.  In 
addition, Guatemala submitted reports under the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>66. The office concluded an agreement with Congress and, in particular, worked with its 
executive committee and its Human Rights, Foreign Affairs, the Interior and Judiciary Reform 
Committees on topics related to the security and human rights agendas.  The office reported on 
the alignment of five bills with international treaties, three of which were promulgated. 
</p>
<p>67. The office provided technical advice to the Prisons Department on initiating 
implementation of the recently adopted Prisons Act. 
</p>
<p>68. The office provided advice to a preparatory committee of State institutions and 
representatives of civil society in preparing a bill establishing a national commission to search 
for victims of enforced and other forms of disappearance.  As a result, principles of international 
law were incorporated in the bill, notably the principle of victims&#8217; right to truth, justice and 
effective reparation.  The bill was submitted to the Legislative Department of Congress by the 
chairs of the Human Rights Committee and the Peace and Demining Committee on 
14 December 2006.  All that remains is for Congress to enact it in order to implement the 
High Commissioner&#8217;s recommendation.   
</p>
<p>69. The office provided technical assistance to the National Compensation Programme 
(PNR) in revising a preliminary bill on declarations of &#8220;missing by reason of forced 
disappearance&#8221;, which is awaiting presentation to Congress.  It also advised PNR on a legislative 
framework for individual documentation on a strategy for implementing the Special Provisional 
Act on Individual Documentation.  In addition, it provided advice on specific topics related to 
the restructuring of the Programme. 
</p>
<p>70. The office has identified several areas for cooperation with the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
with a view to extending its reinforcement activities.  Priority areas are the Office of the Special 
Prosecutor for Human Rights and improving investigation.  Advisory services were provided in 
drafting a general instruction on the criminal prosecution of offences related to illegal adoptions, 
which was adopted as General Instruction No. 13-2006 on 8 December 2006. 
</p>
<p>71. Together with the Office of the Human Rights Procurator and the Organization of 
American States (OAS), legal advice was provided to the working group convened by the 
congressional Committee on Indigenous Communities to consolidate the four existing proposals 
for legislation on consultation with the indigenous peoples into a single bill. 
</p>
<p>72. The office advised the Office for the Defence of Indigenous Women on drafting the 
second thematic report on indigenous women&#8217;s access to justice, which is currently awaiting 
publication.  It is hoped that the report will serve as an important tool in preventing the exclusion 
of indigenous women.  Assistance was provided to the Presidential Commission on 
Discrimination and Racism (CODISRA) in sketching out an anti-discrimination campaign to be 
launched in January 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Public policy 
</b></p>
<p>73. At the end of 2005 the Government of Guatemala presented its national human rights 
policy.  Among other things, the document envisages a comprehensive human rights plan 
worked out with civil society, and the formal establishment of the Inter-institutional Human 
Rights Forum for coordinating the implementation of public policy.  While some of the activities </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>under the national human rights policy have already begun, it has not been adopted by 
government decree in the Council of Ministers as expressly stipulated in the document in order 
to guarantee its validity and implementation.  The absence of such a framework has impeded the 
formal establishment of the Inter-institutional Forum and the elaboration of the comprehensive 
human rights plan, both of which are fundamental commitments of the policy.  Although no 
government decree has been issued, the Inter-institutional Forum held several meetings in 2006. 
</p>
<p>74. No substantial progress has been made on implementation of the National Human Rights 
Education Policy, also presented in 2005, since the institutions responsible for its 
implementation have not been working together.   
</p>
<p>75. As far as the 2005 recommendation is concerned, the High Commissioner considers these 
policies to be a good start in the formulation of a national plan of action for the promotion and 
protection of human rights along the lines of the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action:  a plan that favours participation and clearly defines specific objectives and measures, 
rights to be prioritized and vulnerable groups; a budget that guarantees sustainability; and a 
methodology for monitoring and evaluation containing a time frame, indicators and 
implementation parameters; without prejudice to coordination with other development plans and 
poverty-reduction strategies as required. 
</p>
<p>76. In 2001, the National Policy for the Advancement and Development of Guatemalan 
Women:  Equal Opportunity Plan 2001-2006 was submitted, but the breadth of its objectives and 
constraints on resources have hindered implementation.  During the course of this year, in 
addition to coordination and follow-up of actions under the Policy and the Plan, the Presidential 
Secretariat for Women has been conducting an external evaluation, to be completed in 2007.  
The High Commissioner hopes that this evaluation will provide an objective assessment of the 
coverage of the Policy so that a start can be made on a participatory process that guarantees its 
viability and efficacy. 
</p>
<p>77. With regard to the prevention of violence against women, the National Plan for the 
Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women 2004-2014 was approved 
in 2004.  The High Commissioner considers that this national plan would benefit from a larger 
allocation of financial resources for implementation. 
</p>
<p>78. In November 2006, the Executive presented a policy on coexistence and the elimination 
of racism and racial discrimination, which represents a positive advance in the fight against 
racism and discrimination, in that it endeavours to generate an integrated approach to action on 
the Government&#8217;s various policies, especially those with a direct impact in this area such as 
agricultural policy and policy on full rural development and decentralization. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Follow-up to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>79. In her previous report, the High Commissioner formulated a series of recommendations 
to the Government, Congress and the judiciary, as well as to civil society organizations, on the 
following topics:  prevention and protection, rule of law and impunity, economic and social 
policy, equality and non-discrimination, promotion of a culture of human rights, and the advisory 
services and technical cooperation of the OHCHR office in Guatemala.  The office has been 
supporting and monitoring implementation of the recommendations. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>80. The High Commissioner welcomes the approval by Congress of the Organized Crime 
Act (Decree No. 21-2006), the Act establishing the National Institute of Forensic Science 
(Decree No. 32-2006) and the Prisons Act (Decree No. 33-2006), as recommended.  These Acts 
strengthen the legal framework of the fight against crime and can be seen as a step forward with 
regard to security and justice, although some aspects of the Organized Crime Act impair human 
rights, such as exemption of undercover agents and controlled deliveries from judicial 
supervision.  The High Commissioner would, however, like to point out that it is important to 
take the necessary steps in terms of regulation, budget and institutional support to ensure 
implementation of these laws.  A failure by Congress to approve the budget for 2007 would 
seriously affect their implementation, as happened with the Department of Civil Intelligence, 
which was created in November 2005 but did not receive any budget allocations in 2006. 
</p>
<p>81. The High Commissioner also calls attention to the fact that other draft legislation on 
security and justice, notably laws on private security firms, weapons and munitions, access to 
information, and civil intelligence, has not been passed. 
</p>
<p>82. The High Commissioner observes that the State of Guatemala has yet to recognize the 
competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination under article 14 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and of the Committee for 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, under 
article 77 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families.  The High Commissioner notes that ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, recommended in the previous report and in the concluding observations of the 
Committee against Torture, is still pending before Congress. 
</p>
<p>83. With regard to the recommendation to establish effective programmes for the protection 
of human rights defenders, although there has been an increase in the number of staff in the 
COPREDEH Human Rights Defenders Protection Unit and work is under way to enhance the 
range of protection measures with the help of civil society and the competent national 
institutions, more needs to be done to strengthen the mechanisms for the protection of human 
rights defenders and make them more effective.  COPREDEH is urged to continue to promote 
opportunities for ongoing dialogue with human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The High Commissioner urges the State to take coordinated, consistent and effective 
action to implement all the recommendations made in the OHCHR report for 2005.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Legislative framework for the protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The High Commissioner urges Congress and the Government to refine the 
legislative framework for the protection of human rights, taking the necessary steps to 
ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the agreement creating the International 
Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Rome Statute of the  </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p><b>International Criminal Court, and to recognize the competence of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination and of the Committee on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Public security 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the Government to provide the National Civil 
Police (PNC) with the human and financial resources required for it to extend its 
geographical coverage and continue with personnel training and career development, 
including specific human rights training, and with enhancement of its civil intelligence and 
criminal investigation capacity.  She also urges PNC to develop efficient performance 
evaluation and accountability mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  Rule of law and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The High Commissioner urges the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to continue to 
implement its Plan for Criminal Policy, redouble its efforts to strengthen criminal 
investigation capacity and improve coordination with other security and justice 
institutions.  These efforts are needed in order to combat organized crime and to break up 
illegal groups and clandestine security organizations.  It is also a matter of priority to 
strengthen the programme for the protection of witnesses and parties to judicial 
proceedings.</b> 
</p>
<p>88. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the institutions of justice to implement the 
strategy for access to justice envisaged in the strategic plan of the Coordinating Authority 
for the modernization of the Justice Sector, prioritizing the strengthening of free legal aid 
and victim support, in-service training in the indigenous languages and culture, and 
effective provision for interpretation and translation in indigenous languages and for 
cultural expert testimony.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The High Commissioner urges courts to limit exoneration from liability under the 
National Reconciliation Act and to recognize the permanent nature of forced 
disappearance.</b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>The High Commissioner urges the Government to pursue its efforts to implement 
the National Compensation Programme.  It is encouraged to strengthen the legal and 
operational framework of the Programme so as to ensure its sustainability and financial 
independence, and the transparency and participatory nature of implementation, taking a 
comprehensive approach to reparation.  Congress is urged to approve the Act establishing 
a national commission to search for victims of enforced and other forms of disappearance, 
and to pass legislation establishing the legal concept of absence by reason of forced 
disappearance.</b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the Government and Congress to take all 
necessary steps to effectively implement the Act establishing the National Institute of 
Forensic Science (INACIF) and the Prisons Act, providing them with institutional support, 
and an adequate budget allocation, and approving their respective regulations.</b> </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>92. <b>The High Commissioner urges Congress to approve pending draft legislation on 
security and justice, including the laws on access to information, on private security 
companies and on weapons and munitions, and the amendments to the Amparo, Habeas 
Corpus and Constitutionality Act, and to amend the Public Order Act.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The High Commissioner urges the Government to implement its policy on the 
elimination of racism and racial discrimination.  She also urges Congress to allocate 
adequate financial resources to the policy and to pass a specific law against racial 
discrimination.  She urges the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to press on with the investigation 
and punishment of complaints of racial discrimination.</b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>The High Commissioner encourages Congress to move ahead with the adoption of a 
general code of procedure that recognizes legal pluralism and to amend the Judiciary Act 
to bring it into line with article 66 of the Constitution and ILO Convention No. 169.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Political rights 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The High Commissioner urges the strengthening of the oversight role of the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal, especially in the context of the forthcoming elections.  She 
also calls on State institutions to guarantee the full exercise of political rights, joining forces 
to prevent, investigate and punish political violence.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The High Commissioner urges the State to prioritize efforts to eliminate violence 
against women, in terms of legislation, public policy and the administration of justice.  She 
recommends that Congress should define domestic violence and sexual assault as offences 
and allocate resources for implementing the National Plan for the Prevention of Domestic 
Violence and Violence against Women 2004-2014.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of Guatemala should 
reorient resource allocation in the general budget from a human rights perspective and 
give priority to immediate action for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights.  
Special attention should be paid to critical areas that fall well short of the Millennium 
Development Goals, such as malnutrition, mother and child mortality, gender, health and 
education.  In this connection there is a need to raise taxes and review the tax collection 
and allowances system.</b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Guatemalan State should create a 
flexible and effective mechanism giving labour inspectors proper powers of enforcement in 
terms of investigation and punishment.</b> </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/49/Add.1 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
