<p>10 March 2010, and the renewed commitment to the implementation of the Convention 
expressed on this occasion by States, 
</p>
<p> <i>Profoundly concerned</i> that sexual violence and abuse against children occurs in all 
regions of the world in various forms that are all detrimental to child development and 
convinced that urgent and effective national action and international cooperation is needed,  
</p>
<p> <i>Profoundly concerned</i> <i>also</i> about the persistence of the practices of the sale of 
children, child slavery, the commercial sexual exploitation of children, child prostitution, 
sexual abuse and child pornography in many parts of the world, especially as fostered by 
the increasing use of the Internet and new technologies, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> about the high incidence and appalling levels of brutality of rape 
and other forms of sexual violence committed against children, in the context of and 
associated with armed conflict, including, in some instances, the use or commissioning of 
rape and other forms of sexual violence to humiliate, dominate, instil fear and disperse 
and/or forcibly relocate a population,  
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the need to treat all forms of sexual violence and sexual abuse against 
children as criminal acts, punishable by law, as well as the duty to provide access to just 
and effective remedies and specialized assistance to victims, including medical, 
psychological and legal assistance, as well as effective counselling and social services, in a 
manner that is age-, gender- and disability-sensitive, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all forms of sexual violence and abuse against children in 
all settings, including incest, sexual abuse and assault, sexual harassment, rape, child 
pornography and child prostitution, child sex tourism, trafficking in children, the sale of 
children for the purposes of sexual exploitation, acts of sexual violence and abuse against 
children that constitute torture, and related forms of gender-based violence, including 
female genital mutilation or cutting and early and forced marriages; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Urges</i> all States: 
</p>

eliminate all forms of sexual violence and sexual abuse against children in all settings; 
</p>
<p> (b) To ensure accountability and seek to end impunity of perpetrators of sexual 
violence and abuse against children in all settings, including in conflict and emergencies, 
and to investigate and prosecute such acts and impose appropriate penalties, commensurate 
with those for other serious crimes, recognizing that persons convicted of sexual violence 
against children should be prevented from working with children until such time as national 
mechanisms establish that they no longer pose a risk of harm to children; and, in this 
regard, encourages States to share relevant information, as appropriate, relating to 
conviction for offences of sexual violence against children, with a view to improving 
protection of children against such offences in other countries, as well as information on 
best practices on preventing convicted offenders from working with children, while 
safeguarding the child&#8217;s dignity and right to privacy; 
</p>
<p> (c) To give priority attention to the prevention of all forms of sexual violence 
and abuse against children by addressing its underlying causes, including through 
investment in education and awareness-raising to promote social change in attitudes and 
behaviours that condone or normalize any form of sexual violence against children, 
including harmful traditional practices;  
</p>
<p> (d) To increase their commitment to timely, sustained and adequate funding for 
the prevention and protection of children from sexual violence and abuse as well as their 
recovery and reintegration, including appropriate funding for the development of research </p>

intervention; 
</p>
<p> (e) To establish, maintain, strengthen or designate, in complementarity with 
effective governmental structures for children, independent children&#8217;s rights institutions, 
such as children&#8217;s ombudspersons or equivalents or focal points on children&#8217;s rights in 
existing national human rights institutions or general ombudsperson offices, that are 
sufficiently funded and accessible to children, which should play a key role in the 
independent monitoring of actions taken to prevent sexual violence and abuse against 
children and to promote the universal realization of rights of child victims of sexual 
violence and abuse; 
</p>
<p> (f) To protect children from all forms of sexual violence and abuse by all those 
who work with and for children, including in educational, care and detention settings, as 
well as by Government officials, such as the police, law enforcement authorities and 
employees and officials in detention centres or welfare institutions, including through 
provision of training and education to those who work with children, and to ensure that 
those working with children belonging to minorities and other vulnerable groups are aware 
of their specific needs and rights;  
</p>
<p> (g) To develop and establish, at national and community level, effective and 
child-sensitive counselling, complaint and reporting mechanisms that are confidential, age-
appropriate, gender-sensitive, disability-sensitive, integral, safe, well-publicized and 
accessible to all children, for reporting and addressing incidents of sexual violence and 
abuse, including in emergencies and conflicts;  
</p>
<p> (h) To provide access to immediate and, where possible, free care, recovery and 
social reintegration services for all child victims of sexual violence and abuse, without 
discrimination, that utilize an integrated and holistic approach including, inter alia, 
psychosocial support and education, so as to ensure their psychological recovery and full 
reintegration into society; 
</p>
<p> (i) To provide appropriate training and education to those who work with child 
victims of sexual violence and abuse, including not only educational, psychosocial and 
medical professionals, but also legal and law-enforcement professionals, including judges 
and police officers in charge of receiving complaints from child victims of sexual violence, 
in order to prevent further victimization; 
</p>
<p> (j) To address the gender dimension of all forms of sexual violence and abuse 
against children and incorporate a gender perspective in all policies adopted and actions 
taken to protect children against all forms of sexual violence and abuse, while 
acknowledging that girls and boys face varying risks from different forms of sexual 
violence at different ages and in different situations;  
</p>
<p> (k) To ensure the meaningful participation of children in all matters and 
decisions affecting their lives through their expression of their views, and that those views 
are given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity, including in all 
administrative and judicial proceedings, and that disability-, gender- and age-appropriate 
assistance is provided to enable the active and equal participation of all children;  
</p>
<p> (l) To ensure an active engagement of children in the development of measures 
of prevention, response and monitoring of sexual violence and abuse against them, 
including through the promotion and development of child-led initiatives;  
</p>
<p> (m) To develop, strengthen and implement well-coordinated cross-sectoral 
strategies or plans of action at the national and community levels to address violence 
against children, including sexual violence and abuse against children, within the context of 
comprehensive domestic child protection strategies, with realistic and time-bound targets, </p>

sexual violence against children; 
</p>

violence against children, while safeguarding their dignity and right to privacy and averting 
child stigmatization;

to but not in place of criminal sanctions, safe reintegration of convicted offenders and the 
collection and sharing of good practices;  
</p>
<p> (q) To share good practices on all issues related to the fight against sexual 
violence against children and to discuss these practices in regional and multilateral forums; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also urges </i>all States to strengthen international commitment, cooperation and 
mutual assistance, including at the level of relevant government ministries and law 
enforcement agencies, in preventing and protecting children from all forms of sexual 
violence and in ending impunity for sexual violence against children, including through 
research, policies, monitoring and capacity-building designed to promote the 
implementation of agreed international standards for preventing and protecting children 
from sexual violence, abuse and exploitation, including child pornography;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> States to pay special attention to the protection from sexual 
violence and abuse of marginalized and vulnerable children, such as children belonging to 
minorities, children with disabilities, migrant children, indigenous children, children 
working and/or living on the street, refugee, asylum-seeking and internally displaced 
children, in particular those who are unaccompanied, and children held in detention, and to

as by ensuring public awareness; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also</i> <i>urges</i> States to take measures to protect children from sexual 
exploitation in travel and tourism through, inter alia, encouraging appropriate corporate 
social responsibility strategies and the adoption of professional codes of conduct, as well as
