<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers visited Bulgaria 
from 9 to 16 May 2011, at the invitation of the Government. The visit was aimed at 
examining the policy and legal framework regulating issues relating to her mandate. She 
also sought to assess the independence and impartiality of judges, prosecutors and lawyers; 
the organization and functioning of the legal profession; the effectiveness and independence 
of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary; the level of access of the population to the justice 
system; and the respect of fair trial guarantees. She visited the capital Sofia and the city of 
Blagoevgrad. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with a wide variety of actors, including the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of the Interior; the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister 
of Justice; and the Deputy Minister of Justice and the Deputy Chief Prosecutor. She also 
met with judges and the court chairpersons at the Supreme Court of Cassation, the Supreme 
Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Judicial Council. She 
met officials from the General Directorate on Execution of Penalties of the Ministry of 
Justice, the recently established Centre for Prevention of Organized Crime and Corruption 
and the National Legal Aid Bureau.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited the temporary Centre of Accommodation in 
Busmanti (Sofia), the Sofia City Court and the regional and district courts in Blagoevgrad. 
She also met with the Ombudsman of Bulgaria; lawyers, judges and prosecutors; civil 
society representatives; researchers; academics; students; detainees; and other stakeholders, 
with a view to obtain the most complete and balanced vision of the situation of the judiciary 
in the country.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her deep appreciation and gratitude to the 
Government of Bulgaria for the opportunity to examine the situation of the judiciary and 
the cooperation extended for the preparation and undertaking of the visit. She also wishes to 
express appreciation to all stakeholders and interlocutors for their cooperation and time.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur begins the present report by summarizing recent developments 
in judicial reform and challenges related to the court system. She analyses the independence 
of the judiciary, including issues relating to the investigation and prosecution services; 
criminal investigation; the administration and oversight of the judiciary; the system of 
assessment and promotion of judges; the judicial budget and the assignment of court cases; 
the role and powers of the court chairperson; and women in the administration of justice. The 
Special Rapporteur also refers to a number of other issues that have an impact on the 
administration of justice and the independence of judges and lawyers, namely access to 
justice; legal aid; and capacity-building and training for judges, prosecutors and investigators. 
She concludes the report with recommendations for strengthening the judicial system and the 
independence and impartiality of judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Judicial reform 
</b></p>
<p>6. Legal and judicial reforms in Bulgaria have been influenced by European 
organizations, particularly by the Council of Europe and the European Union. Bulgaria 
framed its judicial reform in the context of the country&#8217;s full membership to the European 
Union in 2007, and took a number of steps to strengthen the functioning and independence 
of the judiciary. The Constitution was amended to recognize the functional immunity of 
judges and establish the permanent Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the related 
Inspectorate; the structure of the judicial system was determined, and subsequently defined </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>in the new Judiciary System Act; and the principle of random case assignments was 
introduced, and implemented thereinafter through an automated system. 
</p>
<p>7. The judicial reform framework has been complemented by the amendments to the 
Judiciary System Act adopted in December 2010. Those amendments focused on 
accountability, professionalism and structural improvements within the judicial system. 
Legal reform efforts, including amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
complemented the most recent amendment to the Judiciary System Act, which entered into 
force in January 2011.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Recent developments in the context of the membership of Bulgaria in 
</b></p>
<p><b>European organizations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Council of Europe 
</b></p>
<p>8. Bulgaria has been a member of the Council of Europe since 1992; that same year it 
became a party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms. Accordingly, Bulgaria allows all persons under its jurisdiction to 
have access to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to defend the rights and 
freedoms granted under the European Convention on Human Rights. Recent judgements of 
the ECHR, particularly under the pilot judgement procedure,1 have had a great impact on 
judicial reform in the country.2   
</p>
<p>9. In December 2010, as a follow-up to two cases being considered under the pilot 
judgement procedure,3 the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted an 
Interim Resolution on the execution of the judgments of the ECHR.4 In the resolution the 
Committee referred to the excessive length of judicial proceedings in 84 cases against 
Bulgaria and encouraged Bulgarian authorities to speed up judicial proceedings in such 
cases, to continue to monitor reform initiatives on the situation in the district courts located 
in regional centres, and to keep the Committee informed of progress made. The Committee 
also invited Bulgarian authorities to complete as soon as possible the reform introducing a 
remedy whereby compensation is granted for prejudice caused by the excessive length of 
judicial proceedings. In February 2012, the Government of Bulgaria submitted various 
plans of action indicating measures to execute the ECHR judgements, including remedies to 
address the excessive length of civil proceedings. The Special Rapporteur is further 
informed that amendments to the Judiciary System Act have subsequently been prepared 
and submitted for approval to the National Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. European Union 
</b></p>
<p>10. The influence of the European Union on judicial reform in Bulgaria is directly 
related to the country&#8217;s application for European Union membership in 1995, and the 
subsequent recommendation by the European Commission to open formal negotiations in 
</p><p>1999. Bulgaria joined the European Union on 1 January 2007. In December 2006, the 
European Commission established a mechanism for cooperation and verification of

<p>progress in Bulgaria to address specific benchmarks.5 This system, known as the 
Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), reports on progress made on the 
commitments made by Bulgaria in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against 
corruption and organized crime, and provides recommendations to the Government on a 
biannual basis. The most recent report was published in February 2012.6 
</p>
<p><b> B. The current judicial reform strategy 
</b></p>
<p>11. The most recent reform to the judiciary is the Strategy to Continue the Judicial 
Reform in the Conditions of Full European Union Membership (Judicial Reform Strategy), 
adopted on 23 June 2010 by the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria. The Strategy was drafted 
by the political office of the Ministry of Justice.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to highlight the importance of 
including all judicial actors, namely judges, court assessors, prosecutors and investigating 
magistrates, in this and future judicial reform efforts in order to create ownership of the 
judicial reform among all judicial stakeholders. In particular, the prosecution service, 
considered as part of the judiciary in Bulgaria, should be more prominently included in the 
current judicial reform strategy and in future judicial reform efforts. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes information provided by the Government indicating steps 
taken to ensure a participatory process to formulate the proposed amendments to the 
Judiciary System Act, including also professional and non-governmental organizations.  
</p>
<p>13. The Judicial Reform Strategy follows recommendations of the European 
Commission and the guidelines for reform in the judiciary outlined by the Stockholm 
Programme 2010-2014, regarding key aspects of rule of law in the European space.7   
</p>
<p>14. Pursuant to the strategy, the reform is aimed at achieving three strategic goals: (a) 
better management of the judicial system; (b) qualitative justice and placing the citizen&#8217;s 
point of view in the judicial reform debate; and (c) countering corruption in the judicial 
system. The strategic goals are complemented by the following five priority objectives: (a) 
improving the management of judicial institutions; (b) strengthening the institutions of the 
judiciary; (c) developing the potential of personnel and increasing the judges&#8217; integrity; (d) 
increasing the quality of justice and achieving the European standard of law enforcement by 
strengthening the supremacy of the law; and (e) ensuring dialogue between the judiciary 
and the citizens as a guarantee of trust. Furthermore, the strategy establishes six 
mechanisms to ensure its effective implementation and facilitate public participation. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the goals and priorities of the Judicial Reform 
Strategy, as well as the creation of several mechanisms for its implementation. She wishes 
to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to the importance of measuring progress towards the 
</p>
<p>achievement of such goals and priorities. Measuring the performance, integrity, 
transparency, accountability and capacity, as well as the human rights dimension, of the 
judicial system is, in her view, a precondition for the attainment of these strategic goals. 
</p>
<p>16. In the light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur considers that the United 
Nations Rule of Law Indicators Project may assist and complement efforts made by 
Bulgarian authorities to strengthen the rule of law and develop national rule of law

<p>strategies.8 In her view, this tool may be of valuable use for the Bulgarian authorities in the 
elaboration of benchmarks and progress indicators and in determining measures of 
immediate application, as well as those that require preliminary action, which are to 
accompany the strategy&#8217;s plan of action, in accordance with its provisions. It should be 
noted, however, that such measures are to be tailored to the national situation and are not a 
substitute for a detailed assessment of the capacity (i.e., material and human resources 
capacity and administrative and management capacity), performance, integrity, 
transparency and accountability of the judiciary in Bulgaria. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  The court system 
</b></p>
<p>17. The structure of the court system in Bulgaria is determined by chapter six of the 
Constitution, which establishes the competence of the Supreme Court of Cassation, the 
Supreme Administrative Court, courts of appeal, regional courts, district courts and military 
courts.9 The Constitutional Court, the jurisdiction of which is stipulated in chapter eight of 
the Constitution, is not formally part of the judicial system.10 
</p>
<p>18. The general system of courts of justice comprises the Sofia City Court, the district 
courts, the regional courts and the appellate courts. The courts of first instance are the 
district courts in civil and criminal matters, as well as the administrative courts. The courts 
of second instance are the regional courts and the Supreme Administrative Court. Although 
the main courts of first instance in civil and criminal matters are the district courts, in grave 
criminal offenses enumerated in the Code of Criminal Procedure, and in cases of serious 
financial, moral or public interest described in the Code of Civil Procedure, the regional 
courts play the role of courts of first instance and the appellate courts that of courts of 
second instance.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur visited the Sofia City Court, and a district and a regional 
court in Blagoevgrad. She wishes to recall the importance of ensuring that courts are 
adequately resourced so that they are able to function properly and uphold the principles of 
independence, impartiality, integrity, propriety, equality, competence and diligence. The 
Special Rapporteur also wishes to draw attention to the importance of having the court 
facilities well maintained, adequately equipped with desks, chairs and office supplies and 
accessible by persons with disabilities; and of ensuring adequate workspace so that there is 
no interference in personnel functions. This is a concern of particular importance with 
respect to the Sofia City Court. 
</p>
<p>20. The Constitution proscribes the establishment of extraordinary courts,11 but it 
authorizes the establishment of specialized courts.12 Specialized courts in Bulgaria include 
military and administrative courts. Furthermore, the Specialized Criminal Court and the 
Appellate Specialized Criminal Court were created to handle cases of corruption and 
organized crime and became operational in January 2012. Concern regarding the actual 
need for their establishment was expressed by a number of stakeholders, who also 
underscored the importance of ensuring that effective mechanisms to prevent improper 
influence are in place.

</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the many stakeholders who consider that the 
aforementioned courts were conceived as a mere replication of existing criminal courts, and 
that, in times of financial restraint, resources marshalled for their establishment could have 
been better used to reinforce existing courts by creating specialized units on organized 
crime and corruption within them. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the establishment of 
new courts should be complemented by measures to strengthen the capacity for pretrial 
investigations, while preventing politicization and ensuring respect for the principle of the 
natural judge and fair trial guarantees. 
</p>
<p>22. In this regard, the Government should redouble efforts to ensure full respect for 
procedural safeguards, judicial independence and impartiality. Other elements equally 
essential for the adequate functioning of the specialized courts include: allocating 
appropriate human and financial resources; underpinning the selection and appointment of 
specialized judges with the principle of transparency through appropriate safeguards against 
judicial appointments for improper motives; and defining properly the scope and internal 
organization of the specialized courts and prosecution offices. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes information provided by the Government indicating that the operationalization of 
these courts has recently been positively assessed by the European Commission. 
</p>
<p>23. Stakeholders highlighted that additional challenges affecting the courts include the 
publication of judicial decisions and the need to harmonize the law and unify the 
interpretation of the law through judicial decisions. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the publication of the official journal by the Supreme Administrative Court since 
1998 and invites the high courts to take measures to ensure the uniform and equal 
application of the law.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges to the independence and impartiality of the 
judiciary  
</b></p>
<p>24. Information received by the Special Rapporteur suggests that the judiciary has been 
struggling continuously to defend its independence, and that recently judges have faced 
challenges in the recognition of their crucial role. Information received also suggests a 
distorted public perception of the independence of the judiciary, as if this were a 
disproportionate claim of judges, instead of a basic principle of governance that is essential 
for upholding the rule of law and ensuring the realization of all human rights for all. 
</p>
<p>25. Other misconceptions are threatening to cast a shadow on judicial activity and the 
reform of the judiciary in Bulgaria. Some relate to the role of judges, which is to decide 
impartially and on the basis of existing legislation, even if such legislation is considered by 
the public as faulty. 
</p>
<p>26. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that the independence of the 
judiciary is to be upheld together with the basic principles of judicial conduct, and invites 
the Government and all stakeholders to raise awareness of the key values of an independent 
judiciary, together with the principles on judicial conduct, set forth in the Bangalore 
Principles of Judicial Conduct.13 She also calls upon the judiciary to continue building 
</p>
<p>  
 13 The Principles establish the standards for the ethical conduct of judges and provide both guidance to 
</p>
<p>judges as well as a framework in which the judiciary may regulate judicial conduct. The Principles 
are organized around the key values of independence, impartiality, integrity, propriety, equality, and 
competence and diligence. The Principles are formulated to assist executive and legislative branch 
officials, lawyers and members of the public to understand and support the judiciary. See 
E/CN.4/2003/65, annex. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>public trust and enhancing its ability to deliver justice on a daily, case-by-case basis, as its 
performance contributes to building public confidence in the integrity of the justice system 
as a whole.  
</p>
<p>27. Also of concern for the Special Rapporteur is information received during the visit 
indicating that a senior Government official made public appeals to the judiciary, calling on 
it to declare guilty a number of persons whose cases were at the time in the pretrial phase of 
criminal proceedings. Without prejudging the information received, the Special Rapporteur 
wishes to recall that the Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 13 (1984) 
on equality before the courts and the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent 
court established by law, affirms that it is a duty for &#8213;all public authorities to refrain from 
prejudging the outcome of a trial&#8214; (para. 7). In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
highlight that according to international standards, particularly those contained in the Basic 
Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the judiciary must decide matters 
impartially on the basis of facts and the application of law, without any restrictions, 
improper influence, inducement, pressure, threat or interference. The courts themselves 
shall decide whether they have jurisdiction to hear a matter. There must be no unwarranted 
interference with the judicial process, including the assignment of judges, by the other 
branches of the power of the State. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur wishes to invite the Government of Bulgaria to redouble 
efforts to focus on structural factors that may undermine judicial activity, and wishes to 
refer to a number of aspects that are directly related to the independence and impartiality of 
the judiciary in Bulgaria.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The investigation and prosecution services  
</b></p>
<p>29. The institution of the judiciary in Bulgaria comprises the courts, the prosecutor&#8217;s 
offices and the investigation services14. Judges, prosecutors and investigating magistrates 
are considered members of the judiciary, and enjoy the same constitutional and statutory 
guarantees of independence in their individual status and functional autonomy.15 
Furthermore, pursuant to the Constitution of Bulgaria, the structure of the State prosecution 
office corresponds to the structure of the court system.16 
</p>
<p>30. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur held consultations with various experts who 
highlighted a number of difficulties entailed by the fact that the prosecution and the 
investigation services, notably the latter, constitute integral parts of the judiciary, which has 
been criticized, inter alia, by the European Commission since 2002.17 There have also been 
tensions between members of the three institutions represented in the SJC, particularly 
between judges and prosecutors, rendering difficult the working environment for the 
Council and impacting detrimentally on its efficiency. 
</p>
<p>31. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was informed of constant criticisms against 
the courts for the excessive delays in processing cases and the low rate of convictions, 
particularly in cases involving organized crime. While in some instances the allegations 
could be corroborated by cases that have been brought before, and in some instances ruled 
on by, ECHR, a number of experts consulted by the Special Rapporteur highlighted that 
</p>
<p>  
 14 See article 128 of the Constitution. 
 15 Pursuant to article 117, paragraph 2, of the Bulgarian Constitution, the judiciary enjoys independence, 
</p>
<p>within the framework of the separation of powers.  
 16 Constitution of Bulgaria, art. 126, para. 1.  
 17 Commission of the European Communities, &#8213;2002 regular report on Bulgaria&#8217;s progress towards 
</p>
<p>accession&#8214;, Brussels, 9 October, 2002. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>public scrutiny usually leaves aside criticism regarding the stages of criminal investigation 
and prosecution, where the handling of cases is usually lengthier. Such criticism has had a 
negative impact on public perception regarding accountability and trust in the court system. 
According to some stakeholders, aspects of accountability and public confidence in the 
court system will improve if the issue of the separation of the institutions responsible for 
different stages of criminal proceedings&#8212;investigation, prosecution and adjudication&#8212;is 
mainstreamed within the Judicial Reform Strategy. Additionally, as pointed out by certain 
stakeholders, the SJC defends the interests of several institutions, namely the courts, the 
prosecution service and the investigation service. This renders difficult its role to insist on 
the proper reporting and accountability of these institutions. 
</p>
<p>32. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to 
the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, particularly to principles 10 and 12, which 
respectively recognize that the office of prosecutors shall be strictly separated from judicial 
functions and should contribute to the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur understands that a clearer separation of the courts from the 
prosecution and investigation services may entail a reform of the Constitution, and urges 
the Government to design a strategy to address the aforementioned concerns within the 
current judicial reform.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Criminal investigation  
</b></p>
<p>34. Several institutions in Bulgaria are responsible for criminal investigation. The 
involvement of three different institutions in criminal investigations, namely, the police, the 
investigation service and the prosecution, was a matter of criticism in the past, as this 
situation was considered to have resulted in lengthy investigative work. Under the new 
Code of Criminal Procedure, pretrial investigation is to be carried out by the investigating 
police under the authority of the Ministry of the Interior and the supervision of a 
prosecutor. The amendments to the Judiciary System Act of 2009 incorporated 
investigation departments within the district prosecution offices where investigating 
magistrates perform their functions. Since then, the investigation service has been 
integrated into the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and territorial investigation services have ceased to 
exist as independent bodies. 
</p>
<p>35. In accordance with the law, investigating magistrates shall conduct the investigative 
work, in particular regarding crimes committed by military and police personnel, and only a 
few categories of crimes, such as espionage and crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p>36. There is a need to insist on appropriate levels of cooperation and coordination 
between police officers and prosecutors, as during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit this was 
mentioned as a major obstacle to the efficient functioning of the criminal justice system in 
Bulgaria. In this regard, it should be noted that while the prosecution service forms part of 
the judiciary, the National Police is a centralized institution within the Ministry of the 
Interior.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur also received information indicating that there have been 
times where delays in criminal investigations that were not the responsibility of the courts 
were attributed to them by several uninformed actors. Consequently, judges and other 
actors within the justice sector feel that the courts are used as a scapegoat to hide structural 
problems concerning criminal investigation. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the recommendations made by the CVM to 
Bulgaria to continue the police reform and link it to a wider reform of pretrial 
investigations, which requires, inter alia, establishing effective operational cooperation with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>the prosecution and other authorities, applying the principle of joint teams in all cases of 
serious crime, and investing in equipment and specialized training. 
</p>
<p>39. The CVM reported weaknesses in the collection of evidence, in the protection of 
witnesses, and in investigative strategies, and highlighted that those deficiencies have yet to 
be properly analysed. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur concurs with the CVM 
recommendation to reform the management and structures of and the cooperation between 
the judiciary and other investigative bodies, including the police. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Administration and oversight of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>40. The SJC is the body responsible for the management and discipline of the judiciary, 
in accordance with article 130 of the Constitution.18 It appoints, promotes, demotes and 
dismisses judges, prosecutors and investigators19 and imposes disciplinary sanctions.20 It 
determines the number of judicial regions and the headquarters of the courts, the number of 
judges, prosecutors and investigators as well as the number of prosecution and investigative 
offices.  
</p>
<p>41. In 2007, a constitutional amendment introduced article 132a, which established an 
Inspectorate21 attached to the SJC tasked with overseeing the judiciary&#8217;s work with due 
respect for the independence of judges, prosecutors and investigators.22  
</p>
<p>42. The Inspectorate is mandated to refer matters to the appropriate authorities, 
reporting on these issues or making suggestions thereon.23 It can act either on its own 
initiative or pursuant to reports by stakeholders (private individuals, legal persons or State 
authorities).24  
</p>
<p>43. The Judiciary System Act governs the structure, power and functioning of the 
Inspectorate (see arts. 40-60). According to the Act, the SJC is a permanent acting body 
that represents the judicial power and secures its independence, determines its personnel, 
organizes its work, and manages its activities without interfering with the independence of 
its bodies (art. 16, para. 1).  
</p>
<p>44. The SJC Inspectorate undertakes inspections <i>motu proprio</i>, including unplanned or 
programmed annual checks of the work of individual judges, prosecutors and investigators. 
Following such inspections, the Inspectorate presents to the official concerned (judge, 
prosecutor or investigator), and to her or his hierarchical superior,25 a report containing 
findings and recommendations.26 The hierarchical superior of the concerned judge, 
prosecutor or investigator must inform the chief inspector on the implementation of the 
recommendations made, within a time frame set in the report.27  
</p>
<p>45. According to the Judiciary System Act, the SJC is a legal entity with a registered 
office in Sofia, and is represented by one of its elected members, determined by an SJC 
</p>

 21 The Inspectorate of the Supreme Judicial Council consists of a chief inspector and 10 inspectors, in 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>decision. It is composed of 25 members (3 members by law and 22 elected members), who 
are legal experts with outstanding professional and moral qualities and a minimum of 15 
years of judicial experience. The three members by law are the Chair of the Supreme Court 
of Cassation, the Chair of the Supreme Administrative Court and the Prosecutor General, 
who are all appointed by the President of Bulgaria. Of the 22 elected members, 11 are 
elected by the Parliament and 11 by the judiciary. Elective members have a five-year 
mandate without the possibility of re-election for two consecutive periods. 
</p>
<p>46. The Minister of Justice, who has no voting rights, chairs sessions of the SJC,28 drafts 
its agenda and plays an important organizational and technical role within the Council and 
the judiciary. In the absence of the Chair, any of the members designated by law may 
preside over the SJC sessions.  
</p>
<p>47. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, there remain a number of challenges that must be 
addressed in order for the SJC to perform its key role and fulfil its mandate as an 
independent body that oversees the performance of the judiciary while protecting its 
independence. These challenges start with its composition. Recently, two members of the 
SJC resigned in protest against some actions taken by the Council, which has prompted 
debate on the need for reform that could improve the accountability of the Council. In this 
respect, the Special Rapporteur was informed by several stakeholders that the selection and 
appointment of judges, which is a task of the SJC, is yet to be underpinned by transparency, 
equal opportunities for all candidates, and objective criteria. 
</p>
<p>48. Information received by the Special Rapporteur also indicates that senior 
appointments were made under the previous rules, despite the entry into force of the 
amendments to the Judiciary System Act in January 2011. As a result, these appointments 
are assessed by many stakeholders as faulty, lacking a real evaluation of the professional 
qualifications, managerial skills and personal integrity of candidates. Lack of investigation 
of allegations against judges and the inconsistent application of disciplinary measures were 
also reported to the Special Rapporteur. The CVM corroborated allegations of conflict of 
interest that were not routinely followed up, and reported weaknesses in asset declarations 
and verifications of magistrates and other senior civil servants.  
</p>
<p>49. Many stakeholders also fear that the adoption of new legislation could potentially be 
used as a means to prevent the completion of the term of the SJC membership. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur learned that since 1991, only once has the SJC membership 
been able to complete the term of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>50. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, measures to ensure that the SJC fulfils its 
important role include identifying ways and means to eliminate undue political and external 
influence on the SJC. 
</p>
<p>51. In addition, an electronic register came into operation in February 2012 to monitor 
timelines of investigation and inspections, prosecutors&#8217; rulings and remands in custody. 
Reportedly, administrative heads are to regularly check the register and take measures to 
prevent delays in investigations and breaches of procedural deadlines. It further provides 
the possibility for the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office to initiate inspections and conduct 
disciplinary proceedings if appropriate. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the initiative, but 
has not been provided with sufficient information to assess it, including with regard to the 
efficiency of the register. 
</p>
<p>  
 28 Constitution of Bulgaria, art. 130, para. 5. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. The system of assessment and promotion of judges  
</b></p>
<p>52. In principle, the system of assessment and promotion of judges in place in Bulgaria 
as conceived by law is in compliance with the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
Judiciary. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the system is based on 
objective factors, in particular ability, integrity, experience and the results of competitions, 
and that factors not linked to the professional merits of the judges concerned are not 
considered for purposes of promotion.29 
</p>
<p>53. The implementation of the aforementioned system, however, is in practice a matter 
of concern for several stakeholders, due to the apparent lack of a mechanism to ensure 
transparency in, and accountability for, decisions on assessment and promotion. 
Furthermore, several interlocutors within the judiciary expressed concern about the use of 
the process of secondment as a substitute for an objective and competitive system for the 
promotion of judges. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was informed of a practice 
according to which judges are placed temporarily in higher positions within the judiciary, 
and in some instances in separate organizations within the justice sector, modifying, or 
occasionally replacing, the regular progress of judges within the judicial career. 
</p>
<p>54. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was also informed of the coexistence of two 
methods for the initial appointment of judges: a system of selection and appointment of 
junior judges, which is based on competitive examinations and training, and a system of 
external appointments, which is used to fill 20 per cent of judicial vacancies. Jurists and 
lawyers must have worked for a specific period of time in the legal profession, depending 
on the level of court or prosecution office,30 to have the possibility to apply to be appointed 
through the external appointments system, which, unlike the competitive system established 
to appoint junior judges, does not include specific training. Stakeholders raised concerns 
about the different criteria applied in these two selection systems and drew the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s attention to the need to establish a mechanism to ensure that no undue or 
improper influences are allowed in the system of external judicial appointments. The 
Special Rapporteur invites all concerned national actors to look into these allegations and 
adopt the necessary measures to ensure that judicial appointments are objective and 
transparent and not made for improper motives, in accordance with principle 10 of the 
Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>55. In the light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur appeals to the Government to 
redouble efforts to ensure access to the judicial career through periodic competitive 
examinations; to introduce a competitive process and periodic evaluation for the promotion 
of judges; and to use a competitive process for filling temporary positions to which judges 
may apply with a view to being placed under secondment arrangements.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the SJC to adopt measures to eliminate the use of 
secondment as a substitute for promotion, and to ensure that objective criteria are 
introduced and implemented in the system of the assessment of judges. She invites the 
judiciary, together with the SJC, to examine these concerns and recommendations, as well 
</p>
<p>  
 29 Such improper factors might, for instance, include discrimination against a person on the grounds of 
</p>
<p>race, colour, sex, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or status.   
 30 A minimum of 3 years of service to be appointed as a judge or prosecutor with a regional court or 
</p>
<p>prosecution office, 8 years for a district court or prosecution office, 10 years for the appellate court or 
prosecution office and 12 years for the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative 
Court or the Supreme Prosecution Office of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Prosecution 
Office, pursuant to article 164 of the Judiciary System Act. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>as to take all necessary measures to prevent improper influence, trade-off and lobbying. 
Allegations of any such misconduct should be duly investigated. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges information provided by the Government 
indicating that numerous competitions for promotion, relocation and appointment of 
magistrates took place in the second semester of 2011 and the first months of 2012, and that 
SJC decisions in this regard were based on the competitions&#8217; results.  
</p>
<p><b> E. The assignment of court cases  
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts made by the judiciary in Bulgaria to 
establish an objective and impartial system that ensures the fair and equitable distribution of 
cases between or among the judges in each court. These efforts are in accordance with the 
Basic Principles on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, which recognize that the 
assignment of cases to judges within the court to which they belong is an internal matter of 
judicial administration (principle 14).  
</p>
<p>59. The current system is based on an automated programme, which allows the random 
assignment of cases to judges. A court may, by local rule, modify the random assignment 
system to provide the redistribution of cases, under specific circumstances. Examples of 
such cases in criminal law matters include cases involving the same criminal defendant, 
parties, family members or subject matter. In these cases, a judge who is assigned a case by 
local rule may request the court Chair to reassign a similar case to another judge. 
</p>
<p>60. During her visit, however, numerous stakeholders, including judges, expressed 
concern to the Special Rapporteur about the room for manipulation that the automated 
system may allegedly allow. She was also informed that joint inspections have been carried 
out over the past six months together with the Professional Qualification, Information, 
Technologies and Statistics Commission. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the 
Government to continue addressing these allegations and taking all necessary steps to 
strengthen the system of random allocation of cases. 
</p>
<p><b> F.  The role and powers of the court Chair  
</b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the role and powers of the judges who 
are appointed as court Chair. The criteria for being appointed to this function are unclear. 
One of the powers is to issue warrants to intercept telephone conversations (wiretapping) 
for the purpose of judicial investigation into crime. The authorization of this measure seems 
to be a common practice, which is almost automatically granted by the judge once the 
request is made, without any real control of the actual need for its imposition&#8212;and 
continuation&#8212;for the investigation purposes. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this power 
should be exceptional and analysed in the light of fair trial guarantees recognized at both 
the international and the European levels.  
</p>
<p>62. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that in several cases ECHR 
has held that telephone tapping amounts to &#8213;an interference by a public authority&#8214; with the 
</p>
<p>right to respect for correspondence and private life as guaranteed by article 8 of the 
European Convention.31 According to ECHR, in order to be justified, wiretapping should be 
</p>
<p>  
 31 Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights states: &#8213;1. Everyone has the right to respect 
</p>
<p>for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a 
public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is 
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>in accordance with national law, and necessary in a democratic society for one or more of 
the legitimate aims referred to in article 8, paragraph 2, of the European Convention on 
Human Rights, which are: national security, public safety, the economic well-being of the 
country, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals, and the 
protection of the rights and freedoms of others.32 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government revise the use of 
wiretapping, particularly in the light of its limited use as evidence in court proceedings. 
Information provided by stakeholders in this regard indicates that less than 2 per cent of the 
information gathered through wiretapping is ultimately used as evidence in court 
proceedings.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is especially concerned about information suggesting that, in 
some instances, the only evidence used to prove a person&#8217;s guilt is the recording of his or 
her conversations. She appreciates the information provided by the Government indicating 
that it is compulsory for the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to corroborate the evidence collected by 
wiretapping with other evidence. 
</p>
<p><b> G.  The judicial budget  
</b></p>
<p>65. The Bulgarian Constitution recognizes in article 117, paragraph 3, judicial budgetary 
autonomy, which is essential to ensure that the judiciary is free from external influence. By 
law, the SCJ is entrusted to discuss and accept the draft budget of the judicial system and 
oversee its execution.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur has taken note of the prerogatives of the SJC to (a) 
introduce changes in the budget expenditure of the judicial system authorities in the course 
of the implementation of the budget of the judicial system; and (b) determine the procedure 
to allocate the surplus in the event of over-implementation of the revenue from the 
activities of judicial authorities. 
</p>
<p>67. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the premises where the 
judiciary functions and the movable assets it uses, including furniture, are administered by 
the executive branch, namely, the Ministry of Justice. Stakeholders reported that this 
situation creates a certain dependency of the judiciary on the executive.  
</p>
<p>68. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this may hamper the independence of the judicial 
system. She is of the opinion that entrusting the administration of its funds directly to the 
judiciary or to an independent body responsible for the judiciary may reinforce its 
independence and prevent financial dependency, thereby avoiding tensions between the 
judicial and other branches of power. 
</p>
<p>69. A possible way to address this challenge consists in rendering the process of the 
allocation of resources to the judiciary more transparent and allowing the judiciary (or an 
independent body) to administer the premises where the courts function and assign, on the 
basis of need, the movable assets that are required for the efficient performance of the 
courts.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that the judiciary must participate in 
drafting its own budget, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>  
well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or 
morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&#8214;  
</p>
<p> 32 See, for example, <i>Malone v. UK </i>(Application No. 8691/79), Judgement of 2 August 1984 and <i>Halford 
v. UK </i>(Application No. 20605/92), Judgement of 25 June 1997.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>Justice. Likewise, the judiciary should also have the right to participate in deliberations on 
its budget in the legislature. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, budgetary allocations to 
fund the courts in the current fiscal year, or in the next financial year, may be reduced 
solely with the consent of the judiciary, or of an independent body representing it, at all 
times, including in times of crisis. She calls upon the Government to establish adequate 
safeguards in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Women in the administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur notes that the representation of women in the judiciary is 
adequate, particularly at the entry and middle levels of the career. The presence of women 
in higher positions, however, is still insufficient.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur devoted two of her previous reports to the issue of women 
in the administration of justice. She stressed the importance of developing a gender-
sensitive judiciary and ensuring an adequate representation of women therein.33 She would 
like to recall in that respect that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent 
legal profession and the integrity of the judicial system based on equal gender opportunities 
are essential prerequisites to effectively protect women&#8217;s human rights and ensure that the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice is free from discrimination on the grounds of gender.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to encourage judges, prosecutors and lawyers to 
promote equal access to justice, to combat gender stereotypes, and to apply non-
discriminatory treatment of women in the criminal justice system. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>74. During her visit to Blagoevgrad, the Special Rapporteur was informed about a 
number of good initiatives by courts to promote and ensure access to justice for all in 
Bulgaria. Examples of such good practices are the flexible arrangements made by judges at 
the district and regional courts in Blagoevgrad to travel periodically to remote locations 
with the aim to enable the participation in hearings of victims, witnesses and the accused. 
The Special Rapporteur invites the judiciary to consider promoting the formal 
establishment of such arrangements by the district and regional courts whenever the need to 
bring courts closer to the people is identified. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that 
the judiciary identify and share good practices among the courts at all levels and in all 
regions of Bulgaria, an initiative that can be conducted by the SJC.  
</p>
<p>75. Notwithstanding these initiatives, the Special Rapporteur received information on 
challenges to ensuring access to justice for certain minority groups, asylum seekers and 
irregular migrants. The need to make interpretation services for these groups available 
throughout the judicial proceedings was reported as a major concern.  
</p>
<p>76. In respect of persons belonging to certain minority groups, notably Roma, 
discriminatory practices were reported as barriers to access to justice, as some of the 
representatives of these groups informed the Special Rapporteur that the very presence of 
certain minorities is often challenged, and sometimes even denied in Bulgaria. They also 
reported that their lack of recognition has had detrimental consequences within the justice 
system, as they feel they have been left on the outskirts, without the real means to resort to 
the formal justice system. According to stakeholder reports, other barriers to accessing 
</p>
<p>  
 33 See A/HRC/17/30 and A/66/289.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>justice in Bulgaria are related to a lack of knowledge about the legal system, a lack of 
confidence in the judicial institutions, and excessive delays in deciding cases.  
</p>
<p>77. In the light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that access to 
justice is both a right in itself and a means of restoring the exercise of rights that have been 
disregarded or violated. As such, access to justice is an indispensable component of specific 
rights, such as the right to liberty and to personal safety, and is also closely linked to the 
right to effective judicial protection, which entails the recognition of the right to an 
effective remedy, the right to equality and the prohibition of discrimination, and fair trial 
guarantees. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur further recalls that the State is obliged to remove all 
obstacles (be they legal, social, cultural, economic or other) that prevent or hinder access to 
justice. She also wishes to stress that everyone under the jurisdiction of Bulgaria should be 
knowledgeable of her or his rights and of all mechanisms that are available to seek redress. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to encourage the Government to consider 
launching awareness-raising campaigns on access to justice, targeting groups in situations 
of vulnerability, notably minority groups. 
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Legal aid  
</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur praises efforts undertaken in Bulgaria for the improvement 
of access to legal aid, particularly in the criminal justice system, as this is an important 
means to reduce the length of pretrial detention, prison overcrowding and congestion in 
courts. A major step in this direction is the establishment of the National Legal Aid Bureau. 
The Bureau coordinates the provision of state-sponsored legal aid, which is provided in 
Bulgaria by lawyers affiliated to bar associations. 
</p>
<p>80. Legal aid in Bulgaria is aimed at covering the pretrial, trial and appeals stages of 
proceedings, mostly in criminal cases and to some extent in labour law cases. To benefit 
from free legal aid, a person under the jurisdiction of Bulgaria should demonstrate (by an 
oath or through witness statements) that her or his monthly income does not exceed 40 
euros. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern that legal aid appears to be 
conceived to help only those in extreme poverty, and under certain circumstances, those 
that are investigated for the alleged commission of serious crimes. She encourages the 
Government to ensure that legal aid serves the purpose of providing legal counsel and 
advice to all those who may need it and cannot afford it. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the conditions to ensure the 
adequate operation of the National Legal Aid Bureau, as this entity appears understaffed 
and underresourced. It reportedly has 30 staff members at its headquarters to coordinate all 
legal aid issues at the national level, and its annual budget is approximately 3 million euros. 
</p>
<p>82. Stakeholders, together with lawyers and representatives of bar associations, reported 
delays in the payment to lawyers who had provided legal aid and counsel and highlighted 
the detrimental implications that this may have for the appropriate functioning of the 
system of administration of justice. It was reported that in 2010 a number of lawyers 
affiliated to certain bar associations refused to take up cases where legal aid was required, 
due to major delays in the payment for legal aid services rendered by them in the past 
</p>
<p>83. In this regard, stakeholders, including lawyers, expressed concern regarding the lack 
of safeguards to ensure that lawyers withdraw cases only when there is a reason that can be 
substantiated under applicable law, such as the withdrawal of legal aid attorneys to avoid 
aiding illegal transactions, or the presentation of perjured testimony or an unwarranted 
defence to the courts. The Special Rapporteur concurs with stakeholders and recommends </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>that such reasons be clearly defined in the law with a view to ensure a legal aid system that 
is responsive to the actual needs, and calls upon the Government to establish safeguards to 
ensure that State-sponsored legal attorneys are remunerated on time for their services. 
</p>
<p>84. Lawyers also expressed concern about the limited contact they have with defendants 
in cases requiring State-sponsored legal aid, and highlighted the detrimental impact of such 
limitations on the coordination and preparation of the defence strategy for individual cases. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur invites the Government to give the utmost consideration to 
this issue, as an effective and inclusive system of legal aid contributes to the full 
implementation of the right to access to justice in Bulgaria. She also wishes to recall that 
adequate legal aid and counsel impact positively on other fair trial rights, as the unequal 
economic or social status of the litigants usually translates into the unequal possibility of 
defence in trial. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Capacity-building and training for judges, prosecutors and 
investigators  
</b></p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of Bulgaria for the priority it 
has given to training and continuous education with a view to strengthening the judicial 
system. She especially welcomes the establishment of the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 
to implement training for judicial actors, as in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view the 
</p>
<p>development of international human rights law education programmes for judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers is crucial to ensure a solid foundation for democracy and the rule 
of law. 
</p>
<p>87. The NIJ has built upon the achievements of the Magistrate Training Centre, a non-
governmental organization established in 1999. It became operational in January 2004 and 
was reorganized through the Judiciary System Act.34 The NIJ is an independent legal entity, 
with a functional relationship with both the Supreme Judicial Council and the Ministry of 
Justice, both of which elect a quota of its five-year managing board.35 It is funded from the 
budget of the judiciary and supplemented by those of its various programmes and projects. 
It is crucial for the NIJ to maintain its independence in practice and avoid improper political 
interference in its functioning and purposes. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur visited the NIJ and learned about its various initiatives. The 
NIJ currently implements three different training programmes: initial training; continuing 
training of judges, investigating magistrates and prosecutors; and training of court 
administration clerks. The initial training offered by the NIJ is of two types: (a) a 
compulsory initial training of nine months&#8217; duration for junior magistrates (junior judges or 
junior prosecutors) who have successfully passed the relevant competition is organized as 
soon as the magistrates assume their positions; (b) compulsory initial qualification courses 
are provided to further the qualification of the judges, prosecutors and investigators who are 
first-time appointees within the judiciary. In both cases, passing a written exam is a 
requirement at the end of the courses. The continuing training for judges and prosecutors is 
open to all sitting magistrates and focuses on current amendments to legislation, changes in 
jurisprudence, interdisciplinary topics and law of the European Union. 
</p>
<p>89. The NIJ is in the process of reorganizing the initial training programme for junior 
judges and prosecutors and adopting a two-year programme for the training of magistrates, 
</p>
<p>  
 34 See chapter 11 of the Judiciary System Act and the Regulation on the Organization of the Activities 
</p>
<p>of the National Institute of Justice, adopted by the SJC. 
 35 Five members of the NIJ are elected by the SJC and two members by the Ministry of Justice. </p>

</p>
<p>which is based on the priorities and aims of the Judicial Reform Strategy of Bulgaria. In 
this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to invite the NIJ to adopt a comprehensive 
approach in its trainings and to consider providing prosecutors and judges with specific 
training on international human rights law standards. 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the need to develop a system of 
incentives for career development among judges and prosecutors. Despite this challenge, 
the Special Rapporteur was also informed that a few Bulgarian judges are seconded to the 
ECHR. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>In Bulgaria, the judiciary comprises the court system, the prosecution service 
and the investigation service. The Constitution recognizes the principle of separation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of powers and the independence of the judiciary, including judicial budgetary 
</b></p>
<p><b>autonomy. The legal framework regulating the judiciary is comprehensive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>complies with international norms and human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Bulgaria has shown genuine efforts to reform the judiciary, ensure justice for 
all those under its jurisdiction and build trust in the judicial institutions. Its current 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategy for judicial reform is aimed at improving the management of the judiciary, 
</b></p>
<p><b>enhancing the delivery of justice, promoting the participation of citizens in the judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform debate and taking steps to counter corruption in the judicial system.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The plan of action for the Judicial Reform Strategy is aimed at measuring the 
performance, integrity, transparency, accountability and capacity, as well as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights dimension, of the judicial system as a precondition for the achievement 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the goals and priorities of current judicial reform efforts. Promising initiatives with 
</b></p>
<p><b>a positive impact on areas relating to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur include 
</b></p>
<p><b>the establishment of the National Legal Aid Bureau and the National Institute of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Justice. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Making the independence of the judiciary a reality in Bulgaria requires further 
consideration of structural factors within the justice system, such as clearly separating 
</b></p>
<p><b>the role and function of the prosecution and investigation service from the courts, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>a view to having a more specialized system of administration of justice. At the same 
</b></p>
<p><b>time, the investigation service should be separated from the judiciary. It also requires 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing the need to effectively grant to the judiciary or to the Supreme Judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council the administration of its budget and the movable assets the judiciary uses, 
</b></p>
<p><b>currently administered by the Ministry of Justice. Further efforts are also needed to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve the system of assessment and promotion of judges and prosecutors and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure a more transparent oversight of the performance of the judiciary, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through a reform of the system of election of the Supreme Judicial Council. Better 
</b></p>
<p><b>coordination among the three institutions in charge of criminal investigation, namely 
</b></p>
<p><b>the police, the prosecution and the investigation services, is also needed, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>improved coordination and cooperation among the judiciary, the police and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution service. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur also draws the attention of the Government to the 
importance of ensuring that justice mechanisms are accessible and affordable, 
</b></p>
<p><b>perceived as fair and considered effective and performing to an acceptable standard 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the users of the justice system. In the Special Rapporteur</b>&#8217;<b>s view, these aspects are 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential to building trust in the judiciary, therefore, she invites major actors within 
</b></p>
<p><b>the justice sector, including the Supreme Judicial Council, the Ministry of Justice, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution service and the judiciary, to make coordinated efforts, or agree to have </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent mechanisms, to measure the extent to which the users of the justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>system in Bulgaria are confident in the justice system. 
</b></p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Based on her findings, and with a view to contributing to the development of an 
effective system of administration of justice that ensures independence, impartiality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>integrity, equality and transparency, as a prerequisite for guaranteeing the enjoyment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights for all in Bulgaria, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations on judicial reform 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Consult and include all judicial actors, namely judges, court assessors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors and investigating magistrates, in current and future judicial reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts with a view to create ownership of the judicial reform among judicial actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Include more prominently the prosecution service in the current judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform strategy; consider taking steps to assess the possibility of clearly separating the 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation and prosecution services</b>&#8217;<b> roles and functions from the courts in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Bulgaria; and consider separating judges and prosecutors careers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Explore synergies and complementarities between the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rule of Law Indicators Project and the plan of action for the Judicial Reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>Strategy, particularly regarding the elaboration and revision of progress indicators 
</b></p>
<p><b>and measures to implement the plan of action. Special attention should be paid to 
</b></p>
<p><b>those actions aimed at measuring the performance, integrity, transparency and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability, as well as the human rights dimension, of the judicial system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Take all steps necessary to ensure full respect for procedural safeguards 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as the independence and impartiality of the Specialized Criminal Court and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Appellate Specialized Criminal Court, which are already operational. These courts 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be provided with appropriate human, financial and technical resources to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure their effective functioning; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Redouble efforts to focus on structural factors that may undermine 
</b></p>
<p><b>judicial activity, including strengthening criminal investigations and establishing a 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism of coordination and cooperation between the police and the investigation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the prosecution offices; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Include in current judicial reform efforts the recommendations made by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism to Bulgaria to address shortcomings 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding, inter alia, the integrity and independence of police action, evidence 
</b></p>
<p><b>gathering and witness protection;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Pursue its efforts to implement the plans of action submitted to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council of Europe in execution of European Court of Human Rights judgements, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>a view to address excessive delays in civil proceedings, and adopt the proposed 
</b></p>
<p><b>amendments to the Judiciary System Act to this end. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to enhance the independence of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Take all steps necessary to ensure a transparent process of allocation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources to the judiciary, allowing the judiciary or an independent body to 
</b></p>
<p><b>administer the premises where the courts function and assign, on the basis of need, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>movable assets that are required for the efficient performance of the courts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Recognize the rights of the judiciary to participate in drafting its own 
</b></p>
<p><b>budget, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice; to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate in deliberations on its budget in the legislature; and to manage its own 
</b></p>
<p><b>budget; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Take all steps necessary to ensure that the courts are adequately 
</b></p>
<p><b>resourced to function properly, and that they are adequately equipped, including with 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilities for persons with disabilities. Adequate workspace also needs to be provided 
</b></p>
<p><b>in order to avoid interference in personnel functions of the judges and the courts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Establish adequate safeguards to ensure that budgetary allocations to 
</b></p>
<p><b>fund the courts in the current fiscal year, or in the next financial year, may be reduced 
</b></p>
<p><b>solely with the consent of the judiciary or of an independent body representing it, at 
</b></p>
<p><b>all times, including in times of crisis; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Identify ways and means to eliminate undue political and external 
</b></p>
<p><b>influence on the Supreme Judicial Council. In this respect, the election process of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council should be reformed in order to enhance its transparency and integrity.   
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the judiciary:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To continue working to build public trust and enhance its ability to

</b></p>
<p><b>building public confidence in the integrity of Government;

</b></p>
<p><b>at all levels and in all regions;

</b></p>
<p><b>collected through it is always complementary to other evidence.

</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Supreme Judicial Council: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)  Strengthen effective implementation of the reformed Judiciary System

</b></p>
<p><b>examinations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Introduce competitive processes and periodic evaluation both for the

<p><b>A/HRC/20/19/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Adopt measures to eliminate secondment as a substitute for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of magistrates; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Reconsider or, in any case, carefully examine the system of external

<p><b>appointments, which is used to fill 20 per cent of judicial vacancies, with a view to 
</b></p>
<p><b>avoid judicial appointments for improper motives; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Establish a mechanism to ensure the fair and transparent application of 
</b></p>
<p><b>objective criteria for the assessment of judges.
