<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the situation of human 
rights in Haiti, Michel Forst 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In accordance with the mandate established by the Commission on Human Rights in 
its resolution 1995/70 and with Presidential Statement PRST/15/1, the Independent Expert 
on the situation of human rights in Haiti submits the present report to the Council at its 
twentieth session. 
</p>
<p> This year&#8217;s report to the Human Rights Council is in a more traditional format. The 
Independent Expert first considers the question of civil and political rights, in particular in 
respect of the workings of the courts and the police. He describes the situation in the prison 
service and the threats faced by persons deprived of their liberty, extended pretrial 
detention and conditions of detention at prisons, and points to the importance that should be 
given to the Office of the Ombudsman (Office de la Protection du Citoyen) and the role it 
plays. He also raises the subject of the Human Rights Section of the United Nations 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) as a topic for consideration. 
 The Independent Expert then addresses economic, social and cultural rights in Haiti 
and the importance of incorporating a human-rights-based approach in the rebuilding of the 
country. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert also points out the factors still threatening human rights as 
the humanitarian crisis draws to a close, in particular drawing attention to the situation of 
women who are still victims of gender-based violence, children separated from their 
families, orphans, child domestic servants, adoption, persons living with disabilities and the 
issue of forced return. He describes the impact of cholera on the perception of 
MINUSTAH.

</p>
<p> Lastly, the report presents the recommendations made by the Independent Expert, in 
three sections. In the first, the Independent Expert issues a number of recommendations 
related to the workings of State institutions, in particular the justice system, the police, the 
prison system and the Office of the Ombudsman. The second section addresses economic 
and social rights and how rights are taken into consideration during the country&#8217;s 
reconstruction. In the third part, he issues recommendations regarding the rights of 
vulnerable persons as the humanitarian crisis draws to a close.

<p>GE.<footnote name="1">3. The authorities, in cooperation with the Office of the Ombudsman and civil society 
organizations, could also make the Interministerial Delegate for the Rule of Law 
responsible for drawing up a national human rights plan, specifically taking into account 
the commitments made by the Government during the universal periodic review before the 
Human Rights Council. Such a plan, in which the Office of the Ombudsman and all actors 
in civil society could be involved, would set out the policy that the Government wishes to 
pursue to make human rights a reality. </footnote>2-13208 <b>3

Service Training College has been transformed into a modern documentation centre. The 
building now not only houses the library, but also a lecture hall, a computer room, three 
administrative offices, an archive room and a functions room that can receive around 100 
persons and service as a conference facility. </footnote> 6 
</p>
<p>  B. Prison system and extended pretrial detention ...............................................  27&#8211;<footnote name="3">8. As reflected in Security Council resolutions, helping to reform the Haitian National 
Police is at the heart of the tasks assigned to MINUSTAH. This process is in the hands of 
the National Police, which receives advice from MINUSTAH and the United Nations 
police (UNPOL). 
39. The work was carried out conscientiously, but the Independent Expert drew the 
attention of the country&#8217;s authorities to the need to implement the main recommendations 
issued regarding the vetting of the police force. Here too, purely technical handling of cases 
will not suffice. A strong signal must be sent to the police to demonstrate that combating 
impunity also means fighting it within their ranks, and that those officers not up to the 
standards of a democratic force will be dismissed. It is not a question of weakening the 
institution, but simply of making it clear that some previously tolerated behaviour is now 
unacceptable. The Haitian National Police is one of the pillars of a State based on the rule 
of law, and as such must set an example. It must be beyond reproach. </footnote>7 8

when they wish to bring charges. In respect of the administration of justice, the Independent 
Expert is thus issuing a series of recommendations. In particular, all prosecutors&#8217; offices 
and all courts of first instance should have special units to rule on violence committed 
against women. During his meetings with the Minister of Justice the Independent Expert 
recommended ensuring that the judicial authorities have sufficient training, in particular in 
respect of the provisions and means of applying international and regional human rights 
treaties. He recommends ending once and for all the practice whereby justices of the peace 
can exceed their mandates by issuing decisions in criminal cases, including rape, as such 
practices are conducive to impunity, weaken the criminal justice system and do not protect 
the right of women to receive compensation for damages. Lastly, he recommends ensuring 
that the police and justices of the peace quickly refer sex crimes to the public prosecutor, 
and that the principle should be reaffirmed that transactions conducted out of court are 
illegal.

<p> VI. Recommendations to the Government of Haiti and the international

Interministerial Delegate for the Rule of Law, reporting directly to the Prime Minister, in 
order to provide guidance and the necessary coordination between the different ministerial 
departments. Several ministries are directly affected by this issue, in particular the Ministry 
of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry of the Interior, but the issue of the rule of 
law also affects the ministries responsible for governmental action on the rights to 
education, health and housing. 
</footnote>14 19 </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.<footnote name="1">1. The Independent Expert pointed out that governing is also about sending political 
signals, and that the population needs to see that the rule of law is advancing in Haiti. The 
country needs real political action to enable it to go beyond the purely technical decisions 
that have been called for already for some time now. 
</footnote>2-13208 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with the mandate established by the Commission on Human Rights in 
its resolution 1995/70 and with Presidential Statement PRST/19/31, in which the Human 
Rights Council invited the new expert to undertake a mission to Haiti in the near future and 
submit a report to it, the Independent Expert submits the present report to the Council at its 
twentieth session. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report covers the period from March 2011 to March 2012, during which 
the Independent Expert undertook three missions to Haiti.1 The Independent Expert wishes 
to thank former President Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val and President Michel Martelly, former Prime 
Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and Prime Minister Gary Conille,<footnote name="2">012 in Port-au-Prince. </footnote> with whom he was able to 
meet, in some cases on numerous occasions, for the frankness and quality of their 
comments, and their invitations to participate in implementing a number of their projects. 
Similarly, he wishes to thank the members of the successive Governments and members of 
the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies with whom he was able to speak, notably about the 
ratification of international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert travelled to Bellad&#232;re, Gona&#239;ves and Saint Marc, and 
expresses his warm thanks to the many Haitians whom he met on his missions, as well as in 
Paris, New York, Brussels, Washington and Geneva. The quality of the meetings and 
discussions is a testament to the attachment of the Haitian diaspora to their homeland, their 
keen sense of solidarity and their wish to participate in their own way in the reconstruction 
of the country. 
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert also met with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General and Head of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), 
Edmond Mulet, and later Mariano Fern&#225;ndez, and their deputies, Nigel Fischer and Kevin 
Kennedy. He wishes to thank all the members of their teams, who afforded him effective 
support in terms of logistics, security and public relations. He also spoke regularly by 
telephone with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and several members of 
MINUSTAH in between missions, which allowed him to keep abreast of political, 
economic and security developments in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert thanks the officials of the main institutions of the United 
Nations, the Organization of American States, the Caribbean Community and Common 
Market (CARICOM) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). He also 
thanks the members of the diplomatic corps with whom he exchanged views on a number 
of occasions concerning the role and activities of the international community. 
</p>
<p>6. His particular thanks go to the ambassadors of the countries of the Group of Latin 
American and Caribbean States (GRULAC) and the Group of Friends of Haiti, with whom 
he was able to discuss and exchange views, notably in Port-au-Prince and New York, 
thanks to the kind services of the Ambassador of Brazil in Port-au-Prince and the 
Ambassador of Uruguay in New York. 
</p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert wishes to express his full gratitude once again to United 
Nations staff members, particularly national and international staff in the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>

 At the time of writing, Gary Conille had officially resigned and was handling pending questions until

<p>Section, who are invaluable partners in the execution of the mission entrusted to him by the 
Council. 
</p>
<p>8. Lastly, during his various missions to Haiti, New York, Miami and Geneva, the 
Independent Expert met with representatives of international and national NGOs, women&#8217;s 
organizations and farmers&#8217; associations. Civil society organizations constitute an incredibly 
valuable resource with remarkable creative potential and a capacity to take action on the 
ground that is doubtless underexploited. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Civil and political rights 
</b>9. The Independent Expert met with the campaigns of the two candidates in the second 
round of the Haitian presidential elections to emphasize the need to place the rule of law at 
the heart of the forthcoming reforms and to remind them that economic and social rights 
remained a key concern for the majority of Haitians. 
10. Since the election of President Michel Martelly, the Independent Expert has been 
pleased to note that the rule of law has been one of the four priorities of his mandate, 
alongside education, job creation and the environment. At his first meeting with the 
President, the topic of implementation of reforms was raised. During the discussions and 
telephone conversations that followed, very specific issues were addressed, in particular the 
implementation of certain recommendations that have featured for several years in the 
reports of the Independent Expert. The Independent Expert welcomes the serious nature and 
quality of the strategy adopted by the presidential team responsible for the rule of law and 
the clear vision of the steps required in order to make reform of the justice system a 
cornerstone for the country&#8217;s future. 
</p>

<p><b>6</b> GE.12-13208 
</p>
<p><b> A. Justice system 
</b></p>
<p>14. Just after the earthquake of 12 January 2010 which destroyed the main public 
buildings and claimed thousands of civil servants among its victims,3 the international 
community assessed the scale of aid the country required to quickly return the judiciary to 
operation and to make buildings and human and financial resources available to the judicial 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>15. On 4 January 2012, a presidential commission was established to study and propose 
appropriate measures for the reform of the justice system and to continue the work of the 
commission established by former President Ren&#233; Pr&#233;val. The Independent Expert had the 
opportunity to meet the president of the commission to discuss its calendar of work and the 
speed with which the commission would issue proposals. He was impressed by the quality 
and strategy of the approach adopted to implement the reform measures in the three laws on 
justice system reform that were passed in 2007. The work of the commission should be 
supported by the international community and the implementation of its proposals 
facilitated by the authorities of the country. 
</p>
<p>16. In that regard, the Independent Expert notes the importance of monitoring the 
effectiveness of the judiciary&#8217;s work through the judicial inspectorate. Indeed, the operation 
of the courts, registries and prosecution services, including the figures communicated on 
the number of inspections and performance analyses, must be checked in practice. The 
inspectorate must be headed by judges seconded for this purpose for a limited period, and 
not by officials of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security. 
</p>
<p>17. The Independent Expert drew the attention of the Minister of Justice to problems 
stemming from the fact that under the High Council of the Judiciary Act, the Council is 
responsible for the inspection of judges, while registries and prosecution services remain 
under the authority of the Minister. He also suggested that government commissioners and 
senior law officers should be firmly reminded of the need for regular, ongoing and effective 
supervision of the activities of the courts and judiciary, which will ensure their proper 
functioning while safeguarding the rights of persons before the law. Such supervision 
should be carried out by the senior law officer for investigating magistrates and by the 
government commissioner for deputy prosecutors and district judges. 
18. The Independent Expert&#8217;s attention had been drawn to the fact that the financing for 
the National Legal Aid System would not be extended. Thanks to funding provided by 
UNASUR,4 however, the programme was fortunately able to continue.5 The Independent 
Expert notes the value of being able to provide predictable funding for the legal assistance 
system, and thanks donors for the support already provided in that field, while emphasizing 
that, in time, the system must be assigned to the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b>  President of the Court of Cassation 
</b></p>
<p>19. During his meetings with the former President, and later, in his first meeting with 
President Michel Martelly, the Independent Expert mentioned how important this 
appointment was, as it provided for a separation of the executive and the judicial branches. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 At a press conference held on 12 January 2011, the Prime Minister recalled that the disaster had 
</p>
<p>caused 7.8 billion dollars of damage and that close to 17 per cent of the country&#8217;s civil servants had 
lost their lives.

 In November 2011, SYNAL employed some 250 Haitian lawyers working in 14 offices throughout 
</p>
<p>the country. Since the creation of SYNAL, over 9,000 cases have been dealt with. </p>


<p>GE.12-13208 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>20. Indeed, apart from his own ex officio powers, the President of the Court of 
Cassation is the keystone of justice system reform. He presides over the High Council of 
the Judiciary and can therefore initiate the programme for the certification and recruitment 
of judges. He also presides over the Governing Board of the Legal Service Training 
College. 
</p>
<p>21. The Independent Expert welcomes the decision made by President Martelly to 
appoint the President of the Court of Cassation in October 2011, which he supplemented 
with the appointment of four judges in February 2012. The 11 judges have held their first 
general assembly, formed the two section chambers and joint chambers, decided on their 
working days and elected a representative to the High Council of the Judiciary. During his 
first meeting with the President of the Court, the Independent Expert was able to see the 
seriousness and determination with which the judges were playing their part in restoring 
credibility to the Haitian Judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b>  High Council of the Judiciary 
</b>22. At the time of writing, the Minister of Justice and Public Security had announced the 
end of the certification process for the members of the High Council of the Judiciary, 
opening the way for this new entity to be established and begin operation as an 
administrative body for oversight, discipline and decision-making in the judicial branch. As 
part of the process to establish the members of the High Council of the Judiciary in their 
posts and to ensure its operation, the Ministry of Justice and the Court of Cassation have 
also established three technical committees to work on ways of transferring knowledge, the 
budget and the headquarters to the High Council of the Judiciary. 
</p>
<p>23. The Independent Expert has welcomed this news, and remains hopeful that the High 
Council of the Judiciary will be operational by the time this report is presented, and that, 
regarding funding for reconstruction work in particular, it will have competent staff and the 
funding required for it to operate with absolute independence, and to recruit judges without 
interference from the executive branch. 
</p>
<p>24. The Legal Service Training College held its first competitive examination to recruit 
candidates for initial training as judges, with strong support from the international 
community. Some 20 judges were recruited by competitive examination to the Legal 
Service Training College and were trained in France, where they received theoretical 
training and completed placements at various courts before receiving their diplomas and 
returning to Haiti. At the time of writing, these 20 young judges had not yet been appointed 
to courts. 
</p>
<p>25. The Legal Service Training College also aims to have a body of permanent teaching 
staff trained in pedagogy. For the first time, six judges were recruited to receive training in 
France on developing teaching sequences and directing study programmes, which will 
make it possible for a new training for trainers programme to be introduced in Haiti. 
</p>

<p><b>8</b> GE.12-13208 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prison system and extended pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>27. The prison administration6 reports that there are 7,190 persons in prison: 2,<footnote name="2">3
 Press conference held by the Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on 28 February 
</footnote>24 have 
been sentenced and 4,966 are awaiting trial. Almost 70 per cent of the total number of 
prisoners is thus being held in pretrial detention, most of them for an extended period. 
</p>
<p>28. The situation, however, differs considerably from one jurisdiction to another, both in 
terms of the amount of space allocated to persons deprived of their liberty and the number 
of persons held in pretrial detention. A comparison of the rates of pretrial detention in the 
16 establishments in the country reveals that rates vary between establishments, sometimes 
quite considerably.<footnote name="7">8. While the phenomenon is apparently becoming less widespread, there are still too 
many victims. The Independent Expert therefore is maintaining a number of 
recommendations, while reiterating that such measures complement one another, and that it 
is specifically by combining them that they will be most effective. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>29. Under the &#8220;Not One More Day in Prison&#8221; programme, a committee of judicial 
inspectors, national prison administration officials and other civil servants have been 
carrying out enquiries in the courts, at police stations and every prison in the country since 
February 2012. The aim is to identify cases of extended detention and to free those 
concerned on a case-by-case basis, without any real strategy being developed to tackle the 
problem. 
</p>
<p>30. During his most recent mission, the Independent Expert visited the women&#8217;s prison 
in P&#233;tionville, where nearly 90 per cent of the women are in pretrial detention, while only 
10 per cent have been sentenced. 
</p>
<p>31. Several explanations for this have been offered, suggesting that it is related to the 
types of offences committed, the number of cases tried in criminal courts and how the 
different jurisdictions work. The Independent Expert reiterates his recommendation that a 
detailed study should be carried out on extended pretrial detention in the country&#8217;s various 
jurisdictions in order to develop strategies and suggest responses adapted to each case, 
rather than national solutions that do not really take the situation in the different 
jurisdictions into account. 
32. The renovation of the National Penitentiary is now complete and improvements are 
visible, as the premises have been restored, but the situation remains tense due to 
overcrowding in the cells. Prisoners and those awaiting trail live in a space scarcely larger 
than 0.5 m2, which means that they have to take turns sleeping.8 The situation is a worrying 
one, and one qualified by the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as cruel, inhuman and degrading. 
</p>
<p>33. The Independent Expert also visited Gona&#239;ves, where political disturbances in 2004 
led to the destruction of the civil prison. Since then, the holding cells of the Cit&#233; de 
l&#8217;Ind&#233;pendance police station have been used as a prison. The cells are overcrowded and 
inadequate, with awful conditions of detention; heat and a nauseating smell emanate from 
the cells. Like the rest of the inmates, minors face a lack of access to health care and 
sanitation and a shortage of food; their economic and social rights are jeopardized. This 
situation should be addressed as a matter of urgency; it is not acceptable that persons who 
have been deprived of their liberty should be dealt with in such a manner in an 
establishment that was not designed for that purpose.

 Figures given on 26 January 2012 by MINUSTAH. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 As an example, 92 per cent of inmates are in preventive detention at the National Penitentiary, 
</p>
<p>compared to 45 per cent at Fort Libert&#233;, 48 per cent at Cap Ha&#239;tien, 54 per cent at Jacmel and 67 per 
cent at Cayes.

 UNDP recommends a minimum space of 4.5 m2. The ICRC states that in the most serious crises, each 
</p>
<p>detainee should have at least 2 m2. </p>


<p>GE.12-13208 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>34. Regarding economic and social rights, during meetings with the prison 
administration, MINUSTAH and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the 
serious health issues and the food supply problems in all penal establishments throughout 
the country were raised once more. The food supply is currently managed centrally by the 
prison administration, which, when combined with the difficulties of supplying and 
transporting foodstuffs and preparing meals, means that the distribution of meals is 
sometimes erratic. Rations are sometimes heavily cut, leaving the inmates hungry. At times, 
they contract diseases linked directly to the quality or quantity of the food. The Independent 
Expert should like to point out that while prisons are places of deprivation of liberty, all 
other rights must be guaranteed. It is unacceptable that, in addition to excessive periods of 
pretrial detention, persons deprived of their liberty should also be subjected to prison 
overcrowding and undernourishment. 
</p>
<p>35. On the other hand, the Independent Expert also visited the new Croix des Bouquets 
prison, where the architectural design, circulation, cells, common rooms and security have 
all been considered as for any construction project that conforms to the relevant 
international standards. The Independent Expert reviewed the future internal regulations for 
the establishment, which should become a model for other prisons by systematically 
addressing practical issues such as food, access to health care, and the separation of 
prisoners who have been sentenced and those awaiting trial, without neglecting in the 
slightest the essential matter of security. The only remaining concern is whether the 
capacity of the prison will be exceeded by the Haitian authorities. 
</p>
<p>36. Lastly, the Independent Expert notes the value of training for prison administration 
staff. In total, there are some 1,000 prison staff in Haiti for slightly more than 7,000 
prisoners, which, despite the efforts made, remains inadequate. 
</p>
<p>37. The Independent Expert has reminded the Haitian authorities that addressing the 
problem of prisons calls for a response that is political in nature &#8212; one transcending 
technical decisions &#8212; and that allows the Government to set out its intended policy on 
prisons. The Independent Expert suggests that a framework law on prisons should be 
adopted, the basic principle being that prison terms mean deprivation of liberty, but also a 
guarantee that all other rights set out in the Constitution of 1987, as well as in international 
instruments, are maintained. Such a law on prisons would then allow the issues of food 
supply, access to health care, maintaining family links and security to be addressed in 
another way, with the rights of detainees being guaranteed. The Independent Expert offers 
his time and further suggests that the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment should be included in the discussion. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Police 
</b></p>

<p><b>10</b> GE.12-13208 
</p>
<p>40. The Independent Expert calls upon the Government of Haiti to implement, with the 
necessary discretion and rigour, the recommendations on vetting police officers, and 
recommends that the High Council of the National Police meet to take decisions in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>41. The Independent Expert further recommends that the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General in Haiti and the Haitian authorities should make an unequivocal joint 
statement on continuation of the process so that it is understood by all that the reform of the 
National Police is desired by the Government, and has not been imposed from outside. 
</p>
<p>42. Security Council resolution 2012 (2011) also notes that the national plan for the 
reform of the Haitian National Police was drawing to a close in December 2011 and that a 
new five-year plan should be drawn up for 2012. Such a plan should include clear 
instructions for implementing the vetting process.

</b></p>
<p>43. Article 207 of the 1987 Constitution established an Office of the Ombudsman to 
protect all persons against any form of abuse by the authorities. Since being designated, 
Florence Elie has shown her determination to make this national institution into the haven it 
was intended to be in the Constitution. She has established regional offices to bring it closer 
to the people and has drawn up a strategy together with donors, MINUSTAH and the 
International Organization of La Francophonie. 
</p>
<p>44. In his first report to the Council (A/HRC/11/5, para. 31), the Independent Expert 
argued that the mandate of the Office of the Ombudsman should be extended and its 
capacity be strengthened with the establishment of a post of &#8220;Deputy Ombudsman&#8221;. 
Obviously, it is for the Office of the Ombudsman itself to determine how it is organized and 
what strategies to draw up. Nonetheless, the Independent Expert calls upon it to consider 
whether it is now appropriate to recruit a Deputy Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>45. The Independent Expert welcomes the adoption of the organic law on the Office of 
the Ombudsman by the Senate in March 2012, which establishes the scope and means of 
action of the Office, thus bringing it into line with the Paris Principles.9 
</p>
<p>46. It is now for the authorities to provide the Office of the Ombudsman with the budget 
it requires to do its work. The Independent Expert should like to point out that the Office is 
currently supported to a great extent by a number of international partners.10 According to 
the Paris Principles, though, adequate funding must be provided by the national authorities, 
with supplementary external funding possible for specific programmes. 
</p>
<p>47. When the Office submits its application for accreditation to the United Nations, the 
application must contain not only the formally required information, but also proof that the 
Office&#8217;s funding is included in the budget approved by the national parliament, with an 
indication of the portion covered and of items financed by donors. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 At the time of writing, the bill had been amended by the Chamber of Deputies and had been sent back 
</p>
<p>to the Senate for another reading.  
 
</p>
<p>10
 A coordination committee, chaired by the Office of the Ombudsman, has been set up with donors to 
</p>
<p>coordinate the development strategy and ensure an exchange of information. </p>


<p>GE.12-13208 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b>  MINUSTAH Human Rights Section 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Independent Expert has argued in favour of the MINUSTAH Human Rights 
Section gradually leaving the MINUSTAH logistic base and setting up a country office of 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in the 
city centre. The people and civil society organizations must have free access to the human 
rights unit, which must no longer be seen as part of the military presence. 
</p>
<p>49. Insofar as MINUSTAH is a comprehensive United Nations mission, this change 
must take place gradually, step-by-step, taking into account future decisions concerning the 
renewal of the Mission&#8217;s mandate. Ultimately, this will make it possible to establish a 
tangible, dual system of protection in Haiti like the one that exists in other countries, 
whereby the Office of the Ombudsman, acting as the national human rights body, provides 
protection at the national level, while at the international level OHCHR provides genuine 
oversight in a location close to the population, in the centre of Port-au-Prince. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>50. When the Council renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert, it invited him to 
bring his experience and expertise to bear and contribute &#8220;to the cause of human rights in 
Haiti, with a particular emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p><b> A. Concept of a State based on the rule of law and economic and social 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>51. In the field of economic, social and cultural rights, the Independent Expert has on 
numerous occasions pointed out that economic exclusion poses a threat to political stability 
in Haiti and that sustainable development is unthinkable without the strong and continuous 
support of the international community, allowing for a genuine strengthening of institutions 
&#8211; the sole guarantee that basic social services will be provided. 
</p>
<p>52. Establishing the rule of law cannot be done simply by defending civil and political 
rights through a reform of the courts and the criminal justice system, the police and the 
prison system. Establishing the rule of law12 also means ensuring that public institutions 
and services are functioning. Over and above the safety of persons and goods, such services 
must also provide for the enjoyment by all citizens of the economic, social and cultural 
rights listed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified 
by the Haitian parliament. The ratification reflects the will of the Haitian authorities to 
work for the realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of all Haitians, and to 
work in the long term against poverty and social exclusion. 
</p>
<p>53. Ratification of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
is an important step in broadening the scope of human rights protection, as it consolidates 
the foundation for a State based on the rule of law. It also paves the way for development 
cooperation beneficial to Haiti. Under this instrument, the international community is

</p>
<p>progress in the recovery and reconstruction of Haiti, as well as in Haiti&#8217;s social and economic 
development, including through effective international development assistance and increased Haitian 
institutional capacity to benefit from this assistance, is crucial to achieving lasting and sustainable 
stability&#8221;, and reiterates &#8220;the need for security to be accompanied by social and economic 
development&#8221;. </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.12-13208 
</p>
<p>committed to invest more to support the Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure equal access to 
education, health and a decent living standard, including water, food and adequate housing, 
which help to reduce poverty. 
</p>
<p>54. Furthermore, this important ratification supplements other international instruments 
to which the country is a party, including the Rio Conventions, the United Nations 
Millennium Declaration, the Convention against Discrimination in Education, agreements 
on the right to education, conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and 
the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (HABITAT). 
55. The Independent Expert points out that the rights to food,13 health,14 education,15 
work16 and adequate housing17 are also included in the Haitian Constitution of 1987. 
</p>
<p>56. The Independent Expert will continue to address all these subjects, with the 
involvement of the authorities at the highest level, United Nations agencies and Haitian 
civil society. To this end the Independent Expert has also proposed a series of thematic 
workshops on economic, social and cultural rights for the Haitian Government, with the 
participation of mandate holders of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
These seminars, organized in cooperation with UN-Women, will make it possible to work 
jointly with the Haitian authorities, United Nations specialized agencies and representatives 
of Haitian civil society on various economic and social rights. 
</p>
<p>57. The proposal has been well received. At the time of writing, the first seminar was 
scheduled to take place in the spring of 2012, with the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food. Others will follow, with other mandate holders, including those working on the rights 
to water, education, health and housing; this series may draw to a close with an event held 
with the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. 
</p>
<p>58. The Independent Expert welcomes the efforts made by the Haitian Government to 
revive the economy in urban and rural areas. He also invites humanitarian organizations 
and donors, together with the Government, to assess their impact on the local economy so 
as to ensure that the development is sustainable. Donors and humanitarian organizations 
must ensure the provision of basic necessities while at the same time working to reduce the 
country&#8217;s dependence on such external support. 
</p>
<p>59. To do so, programmes aimed at strengthening the economic autonomy of Haitians, 
in particular of women, must be set up. Such job creation must take place with wages that 
allow for a decent standard of living. The programmes must meet non-discrimination 
standards and ensure equal access for men and women. 
</p>
<p>60. The Independent Expert supports the efforts of the Government and donors to 
concentrate on the informal and semi-formal economies, even if it is crucial to develop 
more formal sectors. Supporting and training women who earn their living from informal 
activities must be a priority so as to develop their economic outlook and increase their 
economic independence.

<p><b> B. Place of rights in reconstruction 
</b></p>
<p>61. At the special session of the Human Rights Council held in Geneva at the request of 
the Government of Brazil on 27 January 2010, the Council adopted resolution A/HRC/S-
13/1, a robust resolution entitled &#8220;Support of the Human Rights Council for the recovery 
process in Haiti after the earthquake of 12 January 2010: a human rights approach&#8221;. Since 
then, the Independent Expert has made great efforts to ensure that human rights are at the 
heart of the reconstruction process in Haiti.18 With the support of several members of the 
Council, and at the request of the Independent Expert, a seminar was held in Port-au-Prince 
for the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. 
</p>
<p>62. In 2011, the Independent Expert was invited to several capital cities19 and addressed 
a number of meetings to inform the international community about the implications of the 
resolution adopted by the Council and to draw the attention of donors and international 
development agencies to the need to develop strategies using a rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p>63. The Independent Expert also intervened a number of times with cooperation and 
development agencies to ensure that appropriations and programmes would be channelled 
to Haiti. He would like to express his gratitude to the Governments and the agencies in 
question for their attention and their generous response. 
</p>
<p>64. The Independent Expert should like to recall that the rights-based approach is not a 
conceptual approach, but rather one that requires a change of paradigm, as it calls first and 
foremost for special attention to be paid to those who are the most vulnerable, women, 
children and disabled persons. It also systematically involves civil society organizations, in 
particular those representing women, farmers and vulnerable groups, in the reconstruction 
effort, and includes gender-specific analyses and concrete gender-equality targets in 
reconstruction plans and budgets. It also ensures that labour-intensive reconstruction 
programmes are not concentrated solely in economic sectors traditionally occupied by men. 
</p>
<p>65. The rights-based approach is aimed firstly at taking into consideration the needs and 
aspirations of Haitians themselves so as to restore a more decentralized and sustainable 
development capable of protecting the population against natural hazards. It is also an 
approach that makes it possible to ensure that reconstruction is equitable, specifically 
seeking equality between the wealthiest and the less prosperous regions, with the objective 
of creating a more fair society. 
</p>
<p>66. The Independent Expert followed with interest the discussions about the renewal of 
the mandate of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission or its replacement with a purely 
Haitian body. Whatever the final decision, which is for the Haitian authorities to make, the 
Independent Expert should like to recommend that the place of rights in the country&#8217;s 
reconstruction should figure explicitly in the founding text of any such body, and that 
measures should be taken to achieve this objective. The MINUSTAH Human Rights 
Section can assist in the training and the development of methodological tools for this 
project. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Violations of rights in the humanitarian crisis 
</b></p>
<p>67. Both in Port-au-Prince and outside the capital, the Independent Expert took part in 
several cluster meetings with humanitarian NGOs with the aim of making them aware of 
the rights-based approach to humanitarian work. During his talks in the different capitals he

<p> 
</p>

 See A/HRC/17/42, paras. 67&#8211;<footnote name="7">7. The Independent Expert welcomes the fact that many of his recommendations have 
been implemented and that specific programmes have been developed making it possible to 
prevent or contain this phenomenon. During his discussions with United Nations agencies, 
the question of how to collect statistics to document gender-based violence was raised once 
again. Decisions were taken in respect of the methodology to use to keep track of the 
problem and how it evolves over time and the way in which such violence is documented.

</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b>14</b> GE.12-13208 
</p>
<p>also raised this question. He regrets that a rights-based approach has still not been adopted 
by all those involved, in particular by humanitarian organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Persons living in camps 
</b></p>
<p>68. During his various missions the Independent Expert regularly visited several camps 
to check on developments there. According to figures from the International Organization 
for Migration (IOM), in March 2012 some 491,000 people, or 130,<footnote name="7">6. During a series of discussions on gender violence, women&#8217;s organizations reported 
that, compared with previous years, in 2011 violence against women and girls in the camps 
had clearly declined. The Unit for Combating Violence against Women of the National 
Police too reports a significant drop in complaints. 
</footnote>91 families, were still 
living in 660 camps in the regions most affected by the earthquake. According to the latest 
statistical study by IOM,<footnote name="20">See http://www.eshelter-cccmhaiti.info/pdf/DTM_V2_Report_September_French.pdf. </footnote> 36 per cent of the original populations of the camps have been 
living at locations for displaced persons since the height of the displacement crisis. 
</p>
<p>69. At the beginning of 2012 the pace of departure from the camps slowed considerably 
owing to the complexity of the urban displacement crisis, the housing shortage and poverty. 
The living conditions of homeless Haitians are still extremely difficult. Many are still living 
in shelters consisting of plastic sheeting which in the hurricane season are shaken by strong 
winds and flooded by the rains. Most (60 per cent) of the displaced population remains 
grouped in 61 &#8220;major&#8221; locations housing more than 500 families. Such sites account for no 
more than 8 per cent of all locations, thus confirming that there is a trend towards further 
concentration in the major camps, as already noted in previous reports. 
70. The Housing and Public Buildings Unit, set up as a joint initiative of the Office of 
the President and the Office of the Prime Minister, is operating, and the pace of relocation 
has picked up. A pilot relocation project known as the 16/6 project (named for 16 districts 
in three towns: Port-au-Prince, Delmas and P&#233;tionville) is making it possible for displaced 
people in six public areas to return to 16 communities currently being refurbished. 
</p>
<p>71. The Government&#8217;s resettlement strategy is now concentrating on clearing public 
areas, while efforts are being made to rebuild neighbourhoods damaged by the earthquake. 
The announced aim is to make such communities attractive by setting up a small-scale local 
economy, thus encouraging people to leave the camps. 
</p>
<p>72. During his previous mission, the Independent Expert welcomed the intention of the 
Haitian Government to meet the challenges of urbanization by declaring the Corail camp 
and the unofficial Canaan and Jerusalem sites to be of public interest, thus securing land 
rights and facilitating community planning in the areas in question. Nonetheless &#8212; 
notwithstanding the fact that the position is not an easy one and is unpopular &#8212; the 
Independent Expert supports the strategy put forward by the United Nations Human 
Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), under which basic services are to be provided on a 
permanent basis through local taxation. This means the residents of unplanned 
neighbourhoods become &#8220;taxpayers&#8221;, with the commune acting as a genuine service 
provider. A local &#8220;social contract&#8221; of this type, which must be based on the rights and 
responsibilities of both parties (citizens and municipal authorities), will in the end allow for 
the harmonious redevelopment of the locations in question. 
</p>
<p>73. As for the future of the unofficial camps and sites, the Independent Expert points out 
that in order to close camps that house families displaced by the earthquake, the future of 
existing camps must first be determined, quite apart from those covered by the 16/6 project 
mentioned above. It is important to avoid neglecting the camps that are not included in the 
presidential programme, and to set out a strategy for each camp. The Government should 
establish and communicate to the public the criteria it will use to determine which camps 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>GE.12-13208 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>should be closed, the complete list of camps to close, and those that may be redeveloped as 
new neighbourhoods, in line with the way the question is being handled in Corail. 
</p>
<p>74. Lastly, the Independent Expert recommends that relocation strategies for displaced 
persons should take into account the recommendations contained in the report submitted to 
the General Assembly in 2011 by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing (A/66/270). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>75. Since the beginning of the humanitarian crisis, gender violence has been the subject 
of a great deal of attention for the international community. The previous reports of the 
Independent Expert have dealt extensively with this question and have included 
recommendations. Several United Nations reports and national and international human 
rights organizations have documented the phenomenon of domestic abuse or family 
violence, the role of gangs in and around camps and the de facto impunity of those who 
abuse women. 
</p>

<p><b>16</b> GE.12-13208 
</p>
<p>Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings,21 drawn up by the United 
Nations and other international organizations, is a tool that should be more extensively 
disseminated, as it contains a large number of specific recommendations that remain 
applicable to the situation in Haiti. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Children 
</b></p>
<p>82. The situation of children has been largely documented by Haitian civil society 
organizations and international organizations. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) continues to provide excellent technical assistance, documentation, 
identification, family reunification and shelter, care and protection. 
</p>
<p>83. The Independent Expert should like to commend the work carried out by the new 
management team of the Social Welfare and Research Institute, which has a clear vision of 
the strategies to draw up and implement to fulfil the mission entrusted to the Institute in its 
founding text.22 Its financial and human resources are, however, inadequate and it would be 
worth allocating additional resources under the budget appropriations bills. 
</p>
<p>84. The measures recommended in the previous report have been implemented, 
guaranteeing effective supervision of illegal children&#8217;s institutions and the closure of those 
that do not conform to legal requirements. The number of undeclared centres has fallen, a 
survey of centres has been completed and a database set up, allowing the quality of care and 
accommodation to be monitored, as well as the risk of abuse for commercial purposes or 
trafficking. The Independent Expert calls on international organizations and donor countries 
to no longer fund centres that function outside the law. 
</p>
<p>85. The Independent Expert recalls once more that adoption must take place in a 
carefully structured context, and only when all the necessary guarantees are in place, and 
that it must not be considered a humanitarian gesture. He regrets, however, that Haiti has 
still not ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect 
of Intercountry Adoption. An organization responsible for international adoption must be 
established within the legal framework envisaged to replace the laws of 1974, which are no 
longer appropriate. It would also be helpful if the countries of adopting families would 
cease putting pressure on the Haitian Government to resume adoptions until the envisaged 
legal framework has been adopted. 
</p>
<p>86. The Independent Expert recalls that, according to the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, 2,400 Haitian children were internationally adopted following the earthquake, 
which is double the number adopted from Haiti in 2006 and 6 per cent of total global 
intercountry adoptions, from a population of only 10 million.23 A significant number of 
these adoptions took place outside any legal framework. Despite measures taken by the 
Government to tackle the problem, credible accounts continue to report trafficking in 
children through institutions that take on children at a very young age and place them in 
cr&#232;ches before presenting them to candidate adoptive parents.

<p><b> D. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>87. Since the earthquake of 12 January 2010, the Independent Expert has constantly paid 
attention to the issue of persons with disabilities, and has commended the work of several 
NGOs.24 He was also able to meet with the Secretary of State for the Integration of Persons 
with Disabilities on several occasions to discuss the measures that should be implemented 
to ensure that public policy takes into account the discrimination faced by persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>88. In his meetings in the various capital cities with the agencies responsible for 
reconstruction, the Independent Expert regretted that the applicable standards for buildings 
were not always taken into account, despite the fact that the reconstruction of Port-au-
Prince presents a unique opportunity to demonstrate that the discrimination suffered by 
persons with disabilities is a thing of the past. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Forced return 
</b></p>
<p>89. Having received information from several countries on the situation of Haitians 
forced to return, and at the request of the Haitian authorities, the Independent Expert 
decided to publish a specific report on this issue (A/HRC/20/35/Add.1). The aim is not to 
call into question the legitimate concerns of States regarding the control of migration flows, 
but rather to inform the Human Rights Council of the reality of this situation and the 
measures taken by States expelling Haitians, by documenting the legal issues, and 
specifically means of appeal against expulsion. The report also aims to demonstrate the 
impact of forced returns of Haitians on Haitian society, particularly on families living in 
extremely precarious situations. It also studies the impact, in terms of security, of returning 
Haitians who may be dangerous once they have served prison sentences in countries of 
emigration. 
</p>
<p>90. The Independent Expert reiterates the recommendations contained in his report of 
2010 (A/HRC/14/44/Add.1, paras. 41&#8211;42), in which he asks all States to adopt a flexible 
and generous attitude towards Haitians seeking refuge in other countries. He recommends 
that all States should ensure that returns, when they must take place, are carried out in 
compliance with the relevant legal obligations and in such a way as to place no additional 
burden on the country. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Cholera 
</b></p>
<p>91. At the end of 2011, almost 514,000 cases of cholera had been registered and just 
over 6,900 persons had died since the beginning of the epidemic.25 Fortunately, though, the 
mortality rate had fallen from 2.4 per cent at the end of 2010 to 1.3 per cent at the end of 
2011. Despite the stabilization in the number of cases registered in recent months, 
epidemiologists note that new peaks cannot be ruled out, if only due to the number of 
families living in camps, where health and hygiene conditions are deteriorating as 
humanitarian agencies withdraw. The lack of latrine maintenance, repair and drainage 
services is conducive to the spread of cholera. While the majority of humanitarian agencies

<p>are withdrawing, the Haitian State is still having difficulty taking control with a supply of 
drinking water to vulnerable areas, including the camps, where the services of the cholera 
treatment centre are literally disappearing. 
</p>
<p>92. The Independent Expert recalls that long-term funding is not yet available and that 
short-term funds have been exhausted. A humanitarian appeal for 231 million dollars for 
2012 under the Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP) has generated only low levels of 
funding. 
</p>
<p>93. The public controversy over who was responsible for introducing the strain of 
cholera to Haiti is growing. Complaints registered by the families of victims are increasing, 
and the number of persons who request certificates of cholera infection at health-care 
establishments is constantly rising. The Independent Expert has neither the authority nor the 
mandate to offer an opinion on the origin of the disease. However, he wishes to point out 
that silence or denial will do nothing to promote a good understanding of the activities of 
MINUSTAH in a context marked by several distressing episodes of sexual assault in which 
MINUSTAH military personnel have allegedly been implicated. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Combating impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Case of Jean-Claude Duvalier 
</b></p>
<p>94. At the beginning of 2012, the investigating judge announced the decision to return 
Jean-Claude Duvalier to a criminal court to be tried for the crimes of corruption and 
misappropriation of public funds, dismissing 22 complaints of crimes against humanity 
filed by victims who had joined together in an action group against impunity. 
95. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, MINUSTAH and the 
Independent Expert have all voiced their criticism of this decision, demonstrating a 
common understanding of the situation. Nonetheless, all possible legal assistance has been 
provided to the judicial authorities by the United Nations, following the offer made by the 
High Commissioner to share OHCHR expertise with the Haitian judicial authorities and to 
assist them in investigating and establishing the facts. Several special procedures mandate 
holders26 have also responded to the Independent Expert&#8217;s appeal to contribute their legal 
expertise and share their experiences of addressing similar situations in other countries, in 
particular with regard to enforced disappearances and crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>96. The victims and their families have decided to appeal against the decision of the 
investigating judge, and will doubtless exhaust the domestic remedies available in Haiti 
before turning to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>97. The case has evoked powerful emotions, in the country as abroad, and everyone&#8217;s 
thoughts must turn first and foremost to the victims and their families, who are still waiting 
for the Haitian judicial system to bring those responsible to justice. They are waiting for 
true recognition that these were crimes against humanity. They are waiting for justice to be 
done, and for some effort to be made to keep what happened from being forgotten, in the 
same way as in other countries that have experienced similarly dark periods, for example in 
Latin America, Africa and the rest of the world, and that have managed to develop a

<p>mechanism for transitional justice. It would be worthwhile reviewing the way in which 
such countries have addressed such problems. 
</p>
<p>98. The Independent Expert wishes in that regard to draw the attention of the members 
of the Human Rights Council to an interesting initiative proposed by UNASUR aimed at 
establishing a human rights training and research institute in Haiti. The institute could be 
twinned with the MERCOSUR International Centre for the Promotion of Human Rights, 
located within the Navy School of Engineering (Argentina) known as ESMA. This institute 
could, with the support of the international community, engage in memorial activities and 
work on public education, serve as a host centre for photographic archives, organize 
conferences, and training seminars and serve as a meeting place on international human 
rights law and the concept of crimes against humanity.
