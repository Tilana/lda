<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/3, 
</p>
<p>renewing the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, 
</p>
<p>including its causes and consequences, for three years. Following a brief overview of the 
</p>
<p>activities carried out by the mandate holder, the Special Rapporteur, Urmila Bhoola, then 
</p>
<p>focuses on one of the priority areas as identified in her first report to the Council 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/53): the duty of States and responsibility of business to eliminate contemporary 
</p>
<p>forms of slavery from supply chains. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the mandate  
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur conducted official country visits to the Niger and Belgium 
</p>
<p>from 11 to 21 November 2014 and from 19 and 26 February 2015, respectively, and her 
</p>
<p>mission reports are issued as addenda to the present report. She would like to reiterate her 
</p>
<p>gratitude to the Government of the Niger and the Government of Belgium for the 
</p>
<p>cooperation extended before and during the visit and looks forward to continued 
</p>
<p>cooperation on the issues pertaining to her mandate. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to 
</p>
<p>thank all those States that have extended to her an invitation for a visit. 
</p>
<p>3. Since the presentation of her report to the Council in September 2014, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has held consultations with various stakeholders and participated in several 
</p>
<p>events relevant to the mandate, with those most prominent presented below.  
</p>
<p>4. On 10 September 2014, she made concluding remarks at a Council side event 
</p>
<p>entitled &#8220;Religions and Slavery: What role for religions in the fight against contemporary 
</p>
<p>forms of slavery?&#8221;, supported by the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See and the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Observer Mission of the Order of Malta to the United Nations Office at Geneva.  
</p>
<p>5. On 1 December 2014, she delivered a keynote speech via video message at a 
</p>
<p>conference entitled &#8220;Child Labour and Responsibility of European Consumers&#8221;, organized 
</p>
<p>in Vienna on the occasion of the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery by the 
</p>
<p>Academic Council on the United Nations System.  
</p>
<p>6. From 22 to 23 January 2015, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Global Care 
</p>
<p>Advocacy Workshop, held under the auspices of the Asia Pacific Forum on Women in Law 
</p>
<p>and Development, the Institute for Development Studies and Action Aid International in 
</p>
<p>Bangkok, where she chaired a session on the role of the mandate in eradicating domestic 
</p>
<p>servitude.  
</p>
<p>7. From 17 to 19 March 2015, the Special Rapporteur participated at the 
</p>
<p>second international legal conference on contemporary forms of slavery, organized at the 
</p>
<p>University of Granada, Spain, and provided an inaugural address.  
</p>
<p>8. From 25 to 27 March 2015, she presented a paper on the role of the special 
</p>
<p>procedures and human rights treaty bodies in addressing criminal justice for slavery at a 
</p>
<p>policy retreat on &#8220;Eradicating modern slavery: What role for international criminal 
</p>
<p>justice?&#8221;, organized by the United Nations University, the Freedom Fund, the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations and the Journal of International Criminal 
</p>
<p>Justice in New York. Prior to that, from 22 to 24 March 2015, the Special Rapporteur held 
</p>
<p>consultation meetings with the Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking, and Humanity 
</p>
<p>United in Washington, D.C. She also met with the International Corporate Accountability 
</p>
<p>Roundtable, Human Rights First, the United States Agency for International Development 
</p>
<p>and the Bureau of International Labor Affairs. </p>


<p>9. The Special Rapporteur also delivered a keynote speech at the fourth international 
</p>
<p>seminar on contemporary forms of slave labour, which was held at the Universidade 
</p>
<p>Estadual Paulista, Franca, Brazil, from 5 to 8 May 2015. 
</p>
<p>10. On 18 June 2015, the Special Rapporteur provided an introductory statement via 
</p>
<p>video message at a Council side event on the role of the United Nations in combating the 
</p>
<p>intersection of caste and gender in the area of forced and bonded labour, sponsored by 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch, the International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>and Racism, the Minority Rights Group, Anti-Slavery International and Franciscans 
</p>
<p>International and organized in association with the International Dalit Solidarity Network. 
</p>
<p>11. In relation to the present thematic report, on 2 April 2015, the mandate holder 
</p>
<p>organized an expert meeting on eradicating contemporary forms of slavery from supply 
</p>
<p>chains in Geneva. 1  The meeting brought together more than 20 leading experts from 
</p>
<p>international organizations, businesses, employer organizations, trade unions, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations, investor groups, foundations and academia. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur wishes to thank the expert participants for their valuable contributions to the 
</p>
<p>consultation and follow-up thereto.  
</p>
<p>12. While taking note of the previous initiatives undertaken by mandate holders relating 
</p>
<p>to human rights violations in the context of supply chains,2 in the present report, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur focuses, inter alia, on legal and policy frameworks and stakeholder initiatives to 
</p>
<p>ensure that businesses, in relation to their supply chains, respect human rights and eradicate 
</p>
<p>contemporary forms of slavery, understood for the purpose of the present report primarily 
</p>
<p>as forced labour, debt bondage and the worst forms of child labour, through increased 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence and effective remediation.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Enforcing State and business accountability for ending 
contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains  
</b></p>
<p>13. Following egregious violations of health and building safety standards that resulted 
</p>
<p>in fatal accidents, such as the 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh leading to 
</p>
<p>death of over 1,100 garment workers,3 additional attention has been given to increasing 
</p>
<p>State and corporate accountability for violations of human rights, including labour rights, in 
</p>
<p>global value or supply chains.4 In this context, the recent commitment by leaders of major 
</p>
<p>global economies at the recent Group of Seven (G7) Summit to take action to address 
</p>
<p>human rights in global supply chains is welcome and needs to be followed up by concrete 
</p>
<p>actions.5

</p>
<p>report (Children&#8217;s Rights and Business Principles, p. 9) explains that the value chain of a business 
</p>
<p>&#8220;encompasses the activities that convert inputs into outputs by adding value. It includes entities with 
</p>
<p>which the business has a direct or indirect business relationship and which either a) supply products 
</p>
<p>or services that contribute to the business&#8217;s own products or services [a &#8216;supply chain&#8217;], or b) receive 
</p>
<p>products or services from the business&#8221; (conventionally known as a production chain).

<p><b> A. International and regional normative framework for the duty of States 
</b></p>
<p><b>to protect the right not to be subjected to slavery and slavery-like 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices  
</b></p>
<p>14. The right to be free from slavery is a peremptory norm of international law from 
</p>
<p>which no derogation is permitted and creates an <i>erga omnes </i>obligation on all States to 
</p>
<p>protect this right. It is entrenched in the Slavery Convention of 1926 and has been 
</p>
<p>incorporated into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 4), the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 8 (1))6 and the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 11 
</p>
<p>(1)).  
</p>
<p>15. In the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and 
</p>
<p>Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956, the protection of the right is extended 
</p>
<p>to include &#8220;institutions and practices similar to slavery&#8221;, i.e. debt bondage, serfdom, servile 
</p>
<p>marriage and delivering a child for exploitation. Child economic exploitation and child 
</p>
<p>hazardous labour are further prohibited in the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights (art. 10 (3)) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 32). In 
</p>
<p>the International Labour Organization (ILO) Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 
</p>
<p>1999 (No. 182), the elimination of the worst forms of child labour is called for, which are 
</p>
<p>defined as including all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and 
</p>
<p>trafficking of children, debt bondage, serfdom and forced or compulsory labour as well as 
</p>
<p>hazardous work (art. 3). 
</p>
<p>16. While in the Slavery Convention reference is made to forced labour and States are 
</p>
<p>called on to take all necessary measures to prevent compulsory or forced labour from 
</p>
<p>developing into conditions analogous to slavery (art. 5), forced labour was not defined until 
</p>
<p>the ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29). The right not to be subjected to forced 
</p>
<p>labour is now enshrined in a number of other international instruments, including in the 
</p>
<p>ILO Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105), the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights (art. 8 (3)) and the International Convention on the Protection 
</p>
<p>of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 11 (1)). In the 
</p>
<p>ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (1998), the elimination of 
</p>
<p>all forms of forced or compulsory labour and the effective abolition of child labour is 
</p>
<p>required.  
</p>
<p>17. The Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29),7 outlines 
</p>
<p>measures for prevention and elimination of forced labour and emphasizes the need for 
</p>
<p>victim protection and access to appropriate and effective remedies, such as compensation. 
</p>
<p>One of the preventive measures it sets out is &#8220;supporting due diligence by both the public 
</p>
<p>and private sectors to prevent and respond to risks of forced or compulsory labour&#8221; (art. 2 
</p>
<p>(e)). The non-binding ILO Recommendation 203,8  providing practical guidance on the 
</p>
<p>Protocol, while not referring specifically to supply chains, contains a provision on 
</p>
<p>preventive measures, in which States are called on to provide guidance and support to 
</p>
<p>employers and businesses to take effective measures to identify, prevent, mitigate and 
</p>
<p>account for how they address the risks of forced or compulsory labour in their operations or 
</p>
<p>in products, services or operations to which they may be directly linked (section 4 (j)). The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 In the Covenant and the Universal Declaration, it is stipulated that no one shall be held in servitude, 
</p>
<p>although in neither of the instruments is that term defined.  
</p>
<p> 7 At the time of writing, the Protocol was not yet in force but had been ratified by the Niger on 14 May 
</p>
<p>2015.  
</p>
<p> 8  Recommendation on Supplementary Measures for the Effective Suppression of Forced Labour, 
</p>
<p>adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 103rd session, Geneva, 11 June 2014. 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>Protocol is largely aligned with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: 
</p>
<p>Implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework (see below), 
</p>
<p>although it is limited because, inter alia, it focuses only on forced labour and not on all 
</p>
<p>human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>18. At the regional level, States&#8217; obligation to eradicate contemporary forms of slavery 
</p>
<p>is enshrined in a number of human rights instruments. Under article 4 of the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 
</p>
<p>slavery, forced labour and servitude are prohibited. In article 5 of the African Charter on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, it is stated that, inter alia, slavery and slave trade shall be 
</p>
<p>prohibited. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, in its article 15, 
</p>
<p>enshrines the protection of children from all forms of economic exploitation and from 
</p>
<p>performing any hazardous work. Slavery, involuntary servitude, slave trade and traffic in 
</p>
<p>women, as well as forced labour, are prohibited under the American Convention on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (art. 6). In article 10 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights all forms of slavery, 
</p>
<p>servitude and forced labour are prohibited. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Causes and prevalence of contemporary forms of slavery in supply 
</b></p>
<p><b>chains and examples of sectors at risk  
</b></p>
<p>19. Globalization has created unprecedented opportunities for corporations to extend 
</p>
<p>their operations across national borders, including to developing countries, in order to 
</p>
<p>source the cheapest products and maximize profit. The demand for cheap labour meets a 
</p>
<p>ready supply of workers from vulnerable groups: indigenous people, minorities, those 
</p>
<p>considered to be from the &#8220;lowest castes&#8221; and migrants, especially those in an irregular 
</p>
<p>situation. Women workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation in certain sectors 
</p>
<p>given the nexus of gender discrimination and inequality.  
</p>
<p>20. Global enterprises with supply chains that are long and complex and involve 
</p>
<p>complicated networks of subsidiaries, franchisees, suppliers, contractors and subcontractors 
</p>
<p>are more likely to be faced with challenges related to contemporary forms of slavery. While 
</p>
<p>the first tier of supply chains is less susceptible to the risk of contemporary forms of 
</p>
<p>slavery, the lower levels have been shown to be at risk of products or raw materials being 
</p>
<p>sourced from home-based or small workshops in the informal economy and made in 
</p>
<p>situations of debt bondage, forced labour or the worst forms of child labour.  
</p>
<p>21. Although more research into the scope and prevalence of contemporary forms of 
</p>
<p>slavery is required, various small-scale studies (for example, on the garment, conflict 
</p>
<p>mineral, seafood, sporting goods, handmade carpet and tea industries) show that products 
</p>
<p>from the informal sector enter global supply chains and are also part of domestic economies 
</p>
<p>in the developing world, often in the most labour-intensive sectors. 9  Human rights 
</p>
<p>violations in the sourcing of conflict minerals, for example, have received much attention,10 
</p>
<p>but more research is required to identify the scope and prevalence of contemporary forms 
</p>
<p>of slavery in supply chains of specific commodities and particular sectors. The sectors 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See, for example, FairFood International, &#8220;Caught in a Trap &#8211; the story of poverty behind Asian 
</p>
<p>shrimp sold in European supermarkets&#8221; (2015). Available at www.fairfood.org/wp-
</p>
<p>content/uploads/2015/04/Caught-in-a-trap.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 10 For example, in relation to the sourcing of conflict minerals, where the public furore resulted in the 
</p>
<p>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for 
</p>
<p>Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (adopted in 
</p>
<p>May 2011 and amended in July 2012). </p>


<p>mentioned in the present report are therefore not meant to be a comprehensive list, but an 
</p>
<p>indication of where contemporary forms of slavery have been reported to occur.11 
</p>
<p>22. According to ILO data from 2012, 5.5 million of the 20.9 million of persons in 
</p>
<p>forced labour are children12 and an estimated 5&#8211;15 per cent of those are working in supply 
</p>
<p>chains, with the figure significantly higher if domestic supply chains are also taken into 
</p>
<p>account. The lowest tiers in the informal economy are particularly at risk of involving the 
</p>
<p>worst forms of child labour. In 2012, the number of children involved in hazardous work 
</p>
<p>that directly endangers their health, safety and moral development, often understood as a 
</p>
<p>proxy for the worst forms of child labour, was said to be 85 million in absolute terms.13 
</p>
<p>While reliable data on those sectors most susceptible to using such work are difficult to 
</p>
<p>obtain, cases of the worst forms of child labour were found in sectors that correspond to 
</p>
<p>those with a high risk of contemporary forms of slavery occurring in supply chains, 
</p>
<p>including agriculture (i.e., farming of raw materials such as sugar, cotton, cocoa and 
</p>
<p>tobacco), construction, mining and quarrying, and garments and textiles.14  
</p>
<p>23. In agriculture, contemporary forms of slavery have reportedly occurred in many 
</p>
<p>countries, involving crops such as sugar cane, cut flowers, fruit and vegetables, tropical 
</p>
<p>nuts and commodities, for example, palm oil, cotton, 15  cocoa, tobacco and beef. 16 
</p>
<p>Production in the sector often relies on temporary or migrant labour and is characterized by 
</p>
<p>complex contracting and subcontracting chains, as well as smallholder farming in some 
</p>
<p>cases. Much of the work on remote farms and plantations is typified by excessive working 
</p>
<p>hours, lack of compliance with labour laws, weak or non-existent labour inspections and 
</p>
<p>corruption. Competition to produce at the lowest cost enhances the risk of contemporary 
</p>
<p>forms of slavery being involved in agriculture, especially debt bondage in impoverished 
</p>
<p>rural communities and among vulnerable categories of workers, such as indigenous people, 
</p>
<p>minorities, migrants, women and children.  
</p>
<p>24. In the garment and textile sectors, reports indicate a significant risk of contemporary 
</p>
<p>forms of slavery occurring in the complex subcontracting that characterizes the industry in 
</p>
<p>many parts of the world, including the sometimes home-based and informal workshops 
</p>
<p>operating on the margins of the formal economy. Subcontractors such as these are often 
</p>
<p>overlooked both by labour inspections and due diligence systems, making workers in these 
</p>
<p>supply chains particularly vulnerable to exploitation given the quick turnaround time to 
</p>
<p>meet orders from global fashion brands and consumer needs. Contemporary forms of 
</p>
<p>slavery have often been cited as occurring in global supply chains of international brands.17  
</p>

<p> 15 Various advocacy initiatives have addressed forced labour in cotton-picking in Uzbekistan. See, for

<p>25. Despite the various measures taken to eradicate the worst forms of child labour from 
</p>
<p>the carpet industry, these forms were reported to continue to exist in handmade carpet 
</p>
<p>production units in South Asia, in which carpets are produced for export mainly to the 
</p>
<p>United States of America.18 Various studies have reported the existence of contemporary 
</p>
<p>forms of slavery and labour exploitation in the construction industry19 and forced labour in 
</p>
<p>the manufacturing of electronic goods has also been the subject of recent research.20  
</p>

<p><b> C. Steps taken by States to comply with their duty to ensure business 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability for ending contemporary forms of slavery in supply 
</b></p>
<p><b>chains 
</b></p>
<p>28. States have an obligation under international human rights law to respect, protect 
</p>
<p>and fulfil the human rights of all persons in their territory and/or jurisdiction. This includes 
</p>
<p>the duty to protect individuals and groups against human rights abuses committed by 
</p>
<p>private actors, such as business enterprises. The Human Rights Committee, in paragraph 8 
</p>
<p>of its general comment No. 31 (2004) on the nature of general legal obligations on States 
</p>
<p>Parties to the Covenant, stipulates the need for States to exercise due diligence to prevent, 
</p>
<p>punish, investigate or redress the harm caused by private persons or entities.  
</p>
<p>29. The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,25 unanimously endorsed by 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council in 2011, validate the duty of States to protect against and redress 
</p>
<p>business-related human rights harms, and it is stipulated therein that this is to be done 
</p>
<p>through effective policies, legislation, regulations and adjudication (principle 1). State 
</p>
<p>duties include setting out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in 
</p>
<p>their territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations (principle 
</p>
<p>2).  
</p>
<p>30. In the context of contemporary forms of slavery, this duty to protect could translate 
</p>
<p>into a smart mix of measures to ensure that businesses engage in their responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect human rights, including through undertaking human rights due diligence throughout 
</p>
<p>their supply chains and remediating the adverse impact of their operations on human rights. 
</p>
<p>At the very minimum, States should ensure that businesses realize the implications of 
</p>
<p>purchasing products or services that have in any way been linked to forced labour or other 
</p>
<p>contemporary forms of slavery. To date, States have adopted diverse approaches to 
</p>
<p>addressing this issue, which include ensuring criminal, civil and tort liability for business-
</p>
<p>related human rights violations, setting up mechanisms to regulate such compliance in trade 
</p>
<p>and consumer protection and addressing it in government procurement. Disclosure and 
</p>
<p>transparency can also feature as legal obligations rather than being limited to voluntary 
</p>
<p>corporate social responsibility initiatives.26 
</p>
<p>31. In the most recent development, in March 2015, the Parliament of the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom passed the Modern Slavery Bill, which includes a specific part on transparency in 
</p>
<p>supply chains and imposes obligations on businesses to disclose the steps, if any, they are 
</p>
<p>taking to address contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains.27 The duties imposed in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 In the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which operationalize Protect, Respect and 
</p>
<p>Remedy: a Framework for Business and Human Rights, the different roles and responsibilities of 
</p>
<p>States (first pillar) and businesses (second pillar) to address their impact on human rights and the 
</p>
<p>access to remedy for business-related human rights abuse (third pillar) are clarified. 
</p>
<p> 26 For a detailed analysis of different regulatory frameworks, see International Corporate Accountability 
</p>
<p>Roundtable report, &#8220;Human Rights Due Diligence: The role of States&#8221; (2012) (http://icar.ngo/wp-
</p>
<p>content/uploads/2012/12/Human-Rights-Due-Diligence-The-Role-of-States.pdf).  
</p>
<p> 27 It is widely acknowledged that the provisions for transparency in supply chains were inserted largely 
</p>
<p>owing to advocacy conducted by the Ethical Trading Initiative, a multi-stakeholder partnership of 
</p>
<p>businesses, trade unions and non-governmental organizations, covering over 70 companies and in 
</p>
<p>2015 reaching nearly 10 million workers across the globe. </p>


<p>the Modern Slavery Act 28  can be enforced in civil proceedings undertaken by the 
</p>
<p>authorities. Under the Act, company disclosures must be signed by a company director, 
</p>
<p>creating clear accountability. Regulations are currently being prepared to operationalize the 
</p>
<p>provisions for transparency, based on consultations. In some of the submissions for the 
</p>
<p>consultations, it was suggested that a threshold be introduced that would bring even small 
</p>
<p>companies within the ambit of the Act, which would require companies to reveal business 
</p>
<p>relationships in the lower tiers of their supply chains and set clear criteria for disclosures in 
</p>
<p>their reports; it was also suggested that reports be featured on a government website. The 
</p>
<p>Act has, however, received criticism for creating a loophole that allows United Kingdom-
</p>
<p>based companies to effectively &#8220;hide&#8221; their supply chains if the goods produced do not 
</p>
<p>enter the United Kingdom.29  
</p>
<p>32. In the context of transparency, the most often cited legislation is the California 
</p>
<p>Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010,30 which came into effect on 1 January 2012. 
</p>
<p>Under the Act, all retailers and manufacturers with annual global revenues of over US$100 
</p>
<p>million doing business in California, whether or not they have their headquarters there, are 
</p>
<p>required to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct 
</p>
<p>supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale. While an important development, the law 
</p>
<p>is judged to be insufficient because it only requires companies to report on what, if 
</p>
<p>anything, they are doing to address contemporary forms of slavery, using five specific 
</p>
<p>categories: verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability and training, and no 
</p>
<p>specific preventive actions need to be taken nor does it call to improve conditions for those 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to abuse in the supply chain.31  
</p>
<p>33. In 2014, the draft Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery 
</p>
<p>Act of 201432 was introduced into the United States Congress. The Act, not yet adopted, 
</p>
<p>contains, inter alia, reporting requirements for businesses relating to the disclosure of 
</p>
<p>conditions amounting to forced labour, slavery, human trafficking and the worst forms of 
</p>
<p>child labour in supply chains. At the time of writing the present report, a draft law on 
</p>
<p>business human rights due diligence in supply chains was pending before the Senate in 
</p>
<p>France,33 after having been adopted by the National Assembly in the first reading in March 
</p>
<p>2015.  
</p>
<p>34. The Brazilian Ministry of Labour maintains a record of people and corporations 
</p>
<p>found to be using slave labour, which has been termed the &#8220;dirty list&#8221;, established by 
</p>
<p>ministerial decree of 2003. The database was used by public and private companies that 
</p>
<p>applied commercial and financial sanctions. The list grew to include 52 employers of slave 
</p>
<p>labourers in 2003 to 609 as of July 2014. However, in December 2014, the Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>granted an injunction to an association of construction companies, suspending the &#8220;dirty 
</p>
<p>list&#8221;. To date, attorneys from the Federal Government have not been able to re-establish the 
</p>
<p>database. Another challenge to the list was launched following the Labour Prosecutor&#8217;s

</p>
<p>supply chain34 and litigation has ensued which includes a challenge to the constitutionality 
</p>
<p>of the &#8220;dirty list&#8221;. Also in Brazil, the Sao Paulo State Law to Combat Slave Labour, also 
</p>
<p>known as the Bezerra Law, seeks to regulate the disclosure of slave labour.35 
</p>
<p>35. At the United States federal level, under the Trafficking Victims Protection 
</p>
<p>Reauthorization Act of 2005, the Department of Labor&#8217;s Bureau of International Labour 
</p>
<p>Affairs is mandated to, inter alia, create and maintain a List of Goods Produced with Child 
</p>
<p>Labor or Forced Labor.36 In addition, a list of products using forced or indentured child 
</p>
<p>labour is also produced by the Bureau of International Labour Affairs and intended to 
</p>
<p>ensure that United States federal agencies do not procure goods made by this labour.37 
</p>
<p>Under the Trade and Development Act of 2000,38 the Secretary of Labor is mandated to 
</p>
<p>issue beneficiary country initiatives to implement their international commitments to 
</p>
<p>eliminate the worst forms of child labour. These transparency initiatives primarily provide 
</p>
<p>information for government procurement but also assist investors and consumers.  
</p>
<p>36. Executive Order 13627 on strengthening protections against trafficking in persons in 
</p>
<p>federal contracts, issued in September 2012, targets contemporary forms of slavery in 
</p>
<p>government procurement. 39  Under the Executive Order, federal contractors, sub-
</p>
<p>contractors, and their employees are prohibited from engaging in misleading or fraudulent 
</p>
<p>recruitment practices; charging employees recruitment fees; and destroying, concealing, 
</p>
<p>confiscating or otherwise denying an employee access to their identity documents, such as 
</p>
<p>passports or drivers&#8217; licences (section 2 (1)(A)(i)&#8211;(iii)). Under the Order, contractors and 
</p>
<p>subcontractors are further required to agree to fully cooperate, by contractual agreement, in 
</p>
<p>providing reasonable access to enforcement agencies to conduct audits, investigations and 
</p>
<p>other actions to assess compliance with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 
</p>
<p>(section 2 (1)(B)). The Federal Acquisition Regulation 40  that needed to be updated 
</p>
<p>following the Executive Order and related requirements in the Ending Trafficking in 
</p>
<p>Government Contracting Act (set forth in the National Defense Authorization Act for 
</p>
<p>2013)41 entered into force in March 2015, hence it is difficult to comment on its impact in 
</p>
<p>practice.  
</p>
<p>37. The United States Tariff Act of 1930 is also relevant to supply chains and goods 
</p>
<p>produced using forced labour. In section 1307 of the Tariff Act, the import of goods 
</p>
<p>produced with prison labour and forced labour is specifically prohibited: &#8220;All goods, wares, 
</p>
<p>articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in any 
</p>

</p>
<p>38. Restrictions on trade that has negative human rights impact is particularly relevant to 
</p>
<p>addressing slavery and slavery-like practices in supply chains. The Alliance to End Slavery 
</p>
<p>and Trafficking, and Humanity United have recently supported initiatives in the United 
</p>
<p>States Congress to strengthen human rights provisions in trade agreements. This followed a 
</p>
<p>proposed amendment to the Trade Act of 2015 42  to prohibit an international trade 
</p>
<p>agreement from receiving fast-track benefits if it involves a country that is not meeting 
</p>
<p>minimum standards in combating human trafficking.43  
</p>
<p>39. Although the assessment of the efficacy of these legislative developments in practice 
</p>
<p>is beyond the scope of the present report, they provide a snapshot of the issues that impact 
</p>
<p>on the challenge of States to regulate the human rights conduct of businesses operating 
</p>
<p>supply chains outside domestic economies. In these cases, risks and violations are often off-
</p>
<p>shored, resulting in lack of redress under domestic laws, but having significant impact on 
</p>
<p>the human rights situation in developing economies. This results in challenges to effectively 
</p>
<p>address business-related human rights harms in supply chains and requires sustainable and 
</p>
<p>holistic solutions that involve all stakeholders in the supply chain. 
</p>
<p><b> D. International framework for the responsibility of businesses to respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights  
</b></p>
<p>40. In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, every individual and every organ of 
</p>
<p>society is required to strive to contribute to the universal and effective recognition and 
</p>
<p>observance of human rights for all. While it is commonly accepted that under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights, there is as yet no 
</p>
<p>international legal duty for them to protect human rights. Human rights due diligence, i.e. a 
</p>
<p>continuous process of identifying and addressing the human rights impact of a company 
</p>
<p>across its operations and products, and throughout its supplier and business partner 
</p>
<p>networks,44 is therefore the primary standard used to assess business compliance with its 
</p>
<p>human rights responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>41.  Under principle 12, of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>which in their second pillar clarify the business responsibility to respect human rights, this 
</p>
<p>responsibility applies to all internationally recognized human rights, understood, at a 
</p>
<p>minimum, as those expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the ILO 
</p>
<p>Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. All businesses are required to 
</p>
<p>avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities, 
</p>
<p>address such impacts when they occur and seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights 
</p>
<p>impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business 
</p>
<p>relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts (principle 13). Under 
</p>
<p>principle 12 in conjunction with principle 13 (which refers to &#8220;business relationships&#8221; that 
</p>
<p>are understood to include relationships with business partners, entities in the value chain, 
</p>
<p>and any other non-State or State entity directly linked to its business operations, products or 
</p>
<p>services, i.e. entities in its supply chain beyond the first tier and indirect as well as direct

<p>business relationships), 45  it is made clear that there is a responsibility on the part of 
</p>
<p>businesses to effectively address contemporary forms of slavery in their supply chains.  
</p>
<p>42. In order to meet their responsibility to respect human rights, businesses need to, as 
</p>
<p>per principle 16, adopt human rights policy statements, the criteria for which are set out in 
</p>
<p>this principle. The responsibility to respect also requires ongoing human rights due 
</p>
<p>diligence to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for human rights impacts (principles 
</p>
<p>17&#8211;21). The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights also state that, where 
</p>
<p>businesses identify that they have caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts, 
</p>
<p>they should have processes in place to enable remediation (principle 15).46  
</p>
<p>43. The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide conceptual and 
</p>
<p>operational clarity for the two human rights principles of the Global Compact Initiative,47 a 
</p>
<p>broad-based multi-stakeholder initiative addressed to business, launched in 2000. The 
</p>
<p>Global Compact brings together Governments, employers, civil society groups and trade 
</p>
<p>unions, as well as other stakeholders, on the basis of 10 universally accepted principles of 
</p>
<p>human rights, labour, environment and the fight against corruption. The principles are 
</p>
<p>drawn from key United Nations and ILO standards, with contemporary forms of slavery 
</p>
<p>figuring prominently among the categories of human rights and labour rights (principles 1, 
</p>
<p>2, 4 and 5). Since the Global Compact&#8217;s launch, more than 12,000 participants, including 
</p>
<p>over 8,000 businesses from 145 countries, have joined. The high number of the initiative&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>participants is commendable, but the most obvious gap of Global Compact is in terms of a 
</p>
<p>follow-up mechanism for monitoring and implementation, since businesses need only to 
</p>
<p>communicate annually on progress made in implementing the 10 principles.  
</p>
<p>44. The first initiatives at the international level to address conduct of businesses 
</p>
<p>emerged in the 1970s. In 1977, ILO adopted the Tripartite Declaration of Principles 
</p>
<p>concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy (subsequently amended in 2000 and 
</p>
<p>2006). It commits Governments, employers&#8217; and workers&#8217; organizations and multinational 
</p>
<p>enterprises to respecting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Covenants adopted by the General Assembly. In 2014, the ILO Governing Body adopted an 
</p>
<p>implementation strategy for a new follow-up mechanism to the Declaration48 (which is not 
</p>
<p>yet aligned with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) envisaging public-
</p>
<p>private initiatives and technical cooperation, as well as awareness-raising, capacity-
</p>
<p>building, country-level support, research and information-gathering.  
</p>
<p>45. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines 
</p>
<p>for Multinational Enterprises49 were adopted in 1976 and updated five times, most recently 
</p>
<p>in May 2011 to include a new chapter on human rights and business consistent with the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In the Guidelines, explicit reference is 
</p>
<p>made to the responsibilities of multinational enterprises in relation to their supply chains.50 
</p>
<p>A system of national contact points &#8212; a non-judicial mechanism that the adhering countries

<p>resolution of issues that arise from alleged non-observance of the Guidelines (so called 
</p>
<p>specific instances mechanism).51 In dealing with specific instances, which are not legal 
</p>
<p>cases, national contact points must make an initial assessment to determine if the issues 
</p>
<p>raised merit further examination, assist in resolving the instances through offering good 
</p>
<p>offices, and make the results of the procedure publicly available. Despite the value of this 
</p>
<p>grievance mechanism, which is accessible to any interested party, the national contact point 
</p>
<p>system has been criticized by civil society on multiple counts and specific 
</p>
<p>recommendations have been provided to strengthen it.52 Business compliance with other 
</p>
<p>guidelines, for example the Dhaka Principles for Migration with Dignity that relate to 
</p>
<p>reducing exploitation from the moment of the recruitment process is critical to reducing the 
</p>
<p>incidence of forced labour and other contemporary forms of slavery at all levels of supply 
</p>
<p>chains.53 
</p>
<p><b> E. Business and stakeholder initiatives to address contemporary forms 
</b></p>
<p><b>of slavery in supply chains 
</b></p>
<p>46. Global brands and other transnational corporations operating complex supply chains 
</p>
<p>that span multiple jurisdictions have increasingly adopted voluntary codes of conduct to 
</p>
<p>address contemporary forms of slavery in their operations, as well as those of their 
</p>
<p>suppliers, prompted mainly by reputational risk. The voluntary codes cover a wide variety 
</p>
<p>of issues, from social and environmental to human rights and anti-corruption. Policies that 
</p>
<p>clearly prohibit forced labour are now commonplace in codes across companies of different 
</p>
<p>sizes and operating in different regions and sectors. A key recent innovation is the 
</p>
<p>development of policies that address recruitment and hiring in labour supply chains by 
</p>
<p>banning private employment or recruitment agencies supplying workers to facilities in their 
</p>
<p>supply chains from charging recruitment fees to those workers.54  
</p>
<p>47. Despite their important role in complementing the normative framework, voluntary 
</p>
<p>codes of conduct are often bald statements without any independent monitoring 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and leave numerous gaps in protection if they do not apply to all entities, 
</p>
<p>especially informal sector and home-based suppliers and subcontractors. However, an 
</p>
<p>increasing number of steps are being taken to implement voluntary codes, involving a 
</p>
<p>diverse set of strategies, typically starting with some form of compliance assessment 
</p>
<p>conducted at workplace level in businesses&#8217; supply chains. These are commonly called 
</p>
<p>&#8220;social audits&#8221; and frequently address other standards in addition to human rights issues, 
</p>
<p>depending on the codes upon which they are based.  
</p>
<p>48. While businesses continue to rely on social audits as a key element of their human 
</p>
<p>rights due diligence programmes and to assess their own facilities and those of their 
</p>
<p>business partners, many believe that auditing has had a limited impact on identifying and 
</p>
<p>eliminating contemporary forms of slavery from supply chains. New strategies are therefore 
</p>
<p>required that move beyond auditing and include proactive independent investigations and 
</p>
<p>robust independent verification, which incorporate consultations with workers with due 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 51 To date, approximately 300 instances have been addressed by national contact points, covering a 
</p>
<p>range of issues, including human rights, employment and industrial relations. See 
</p>
<p>http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/database/. 
</p>
<p> 52 See, for example, OECD Watch, <i>Remedy Remains Rare </i>&#8211;<i> An analysis of 15 years of NCP cases and 
</i></p>
<p><i>their contribution to improve access to remedy for victims of corporate misconduct</i> (2015) 
</p>
<p>(http://oecdwatch.org/publications-en/Publication_4201). 
53   See also, for example, the ILO Fair Recruitment Initiative and the International Organization for 
</p>
<p>Migration initiative on ethical recruitment.  
</p>
<p> 54 For example, the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition has adopted a &#8220;no fees&#8221; policy for its 
</p>
<p>members. </p>


<p>regard to confidentiality and privacy. Consumer and trade union advocacy can play an 
</p>
<p>important role in ensuring the involvement of workers and their representatives in such 
</p>
<p>processes. Largely as a result of stakeholder criticism, some companies have already 
</p>
<p>piloted new protocols that prioritize the confidential testimony of workers and attempted to 
</p>
<p>develop more robust investigative techniques, sometimes in partnership with civil society.55 
</p>
<p>49. Company-level grievance mechanisms, which range from complaints boxes to 
</p>
<p>telephone hotlines, are being created to identify human rights violations and other forms of 
</p>
<p>abuse. Their effectiveness is often dependent on information exchange between business 
</p>
<p>peers and companies often rely on multi-stakeholder initiatives to develop efficient 
</p>
<p>systems. 
</p>
<p>50. Another strategy in tackling the risk of contemporary forms of slavery in supply 
</p>
<p>chains relates to transparency and reporting,56 on the one hand, and traceability, on the 
</p>
<p>other. In both cases, pressure from regulators, civil society actors and investors has pushed 
</p>
<p>companies not only to disclose information about business relationships in supply chains, 
</p>
<p>but to implement measures to track products and materials from finished goods to the 
</p>
<p>commodities level to promote &#8220;clean&#8221; production at every step of the way. However, 
</p>
<p>opinion remains divided on the effectiveness of these initiatives in improving conditions for 
</p>
<p>workers and, in particular, for addressing contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>51. Certification has arisen as another key approach from increased consumer, trade 
</p>
<p>union and other civil society awareness. The most well-known is the Fairtrade Mark, which 
</p>
<p>can be found on a wide range of products &#8212; over 27,000 &#8212; and certifies that those 
</p>
<p>products meet internationally agreed Fairtrade Standards, including those relating to child 
</p>
<p>labour and labour rights. 57  In another example, the GoodWeave 58  certification label 
</p>
<p>provides assurance that no child labour was used in the manufacture of rugs.   
</p>
<p>52. Given the complexity and span of supply chains, identifying and eradicating 
</p>
<p>contemporary forms of slavery can be successful only if sustainable and effective multi-
</p>
<p>stakeholder partnerships and initiatives involving the authorities, businesses, trade unions, 
</p>
<p>consumers and other stakeholders, each acting from their own areas of expertise to enforce 
</p>
<p>mutually agreed goals, are formed. Such initiatives are frequently international in scope, 
</p>
<p>given the breadth of transnational operations. Some focus on a single sector, industry or 
</p>
<p>commodity,59 while others are cross-sectoral.60 Others focus on a single issue like child or 
</p>
<p>forced labour,61 while many typically address a cross-section of labour and human rights 
</p>
<p>issues alongside the environment and general principles of ethical business.62  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 55 For example, Apple, Hewlett Packard, Patagonia, Gap Inc., Coca Cola, the Arcadia Group and Philip 
</p>
<p>Morris International. 
</p>
<p> 56 Voluntary commitments to transparency are, for example, required by companies that use the 
</p>
<p>framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative.  
</p>
<p> 57 www.fairtrade.net. 
</p>
<p> 58  www.goodweave.org. 
</p>
<p> 59 For example, the Fair Wear Foundation or Fair Labour Association, both of which address apparel 
</p>
<p>only.  
</p>
<p> 60 Such as Social Accountability International and the Ethical Trading Initiative. The latter developed a 
</p>
<p>Base Code guiding its members to comply with ILO standards (e.g. fair recruitment, humane working 
</p>
<p>conditions, decent work and a living wage) as a means of preventing forced labour and other 
</p>
<p>contemporary forms of slavery (see www.ethicaltrade.org/eti-base-code). 
</p>
<p> 61 Including the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation and the International Cocoa 
</p>
<p>Initiative. Both participate in the Child Labour Platform, a thematic membership&#8208;based work stream 
of the Human Rights and Labour Working Group of the Global Compact, opened to companies, other 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies, trade unions, business associations and other relevant stakeholders, and 
</p>
<p>focused on child labour, particularly in supply chains.  
</p>
<p> 62 For example, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Responsible Jewellery Council.  </p>


<p>53. An example of good practice is the multi-stakeholder public-private platform Project 
</p>
<p>Issara63 initiated by Anti-Slavery International to tackle modern slavery in South-East Asia, 
</p>
<p>with an initial focus on forced labour in the export-oriented industries of Thailand that 
</p>
<p>affect global supply chains. Another well-known example of a multi-stakeholder private-
</p>
<p>public initiative is the National Pact for the Eradication of Slave Labour in Brazil, which 
</p>
<p>brings companies together to combat slave labour with the assistance of ILO, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations (including Rep&#243;rter Brasil and Ethos) and support from the 
</p>
<p>Government. Over 400 companies and trade associations had signed the pact as of May 
</p>
<p>2014, including large companies such as Walmart Brazil, committing not to do business 
</p>
<p>with people and companies involved with slave labour.64  
</p>
<p>54. Multi-stakeholder initiatives help to address questions of credibility and 
</p>
<p>effectiveness that have surrounded business-only and corporate social responsibility 
</p>
<p>strategies. They offer a more inclusive model as they involve various stakeholders and thus 
</p>
<p>provide a long-term solution to addressing risks to contemporary forms of slavery in supply 
</p>
<p>chains. Those multi-stakeholder platforms that are genuinely premised on social partnership 
</p>
<p>and involve trade unions have the additional benefit that they can ensure collaboration 
</p>
<p>across a number of initiatives including public-policy advocacy and grievance resolution.  
</p>
<p>55. Investors have also begun to play an increasing role in requiring human rights due 
</p>
<p>diligence.65 Furthermore, civil society actors have been at the forefront of challenges to 
</p>
<p>contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains66 and civil society &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221; 
</p>
<p>of companies has resulted in some businesses responding positively by adopting or 
</p>
<p>adjusting their policies and practices.67 A welcome initiative in the reporting context is the 
</p>
<p>recently launched United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework, which 
</p>
<p>provides guidance for companies to report on how they respect human rights.68 
</p>
<p><b> F. Corporate legal liability and access to remedies in cases involving 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains  
</b></p>
<p>56. States have a duty under international human rights law to ensure the right to a 
</p>
<p>remedy, including equal and effective access to justice and adequate, effective and prompt 
</p>
<p>reparations for human rights violations. For victims of gross violations of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law, such as slavery and slavery-like practices, full and effective reparation 
</p>
<p>may take the following forms: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and 
</p>
<p>guarantees of non-repetition.69 In the third pillar of the Guiding Principles on Business and

<p> 65 The Interfaith Centre on Corporate Responsibility &#8220;No fees&#8221; Initiative targets the risk of debt bondage 
</p>
<p>faced by migrant workers resulting from fee-charging for recruitment and employment services and 
</p>
<p>uses the strength and influence of investors to target 12 companies in the palm oil and seafood sectors 
</p>
<p>to clearly demonstrate their commitment to respect human rights (www.iccr.org/no-fees-initiative). 
</p>
<p> 66 A well-known example is the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which mobilized consumers in the 
</p>
<p>Campaign for Fair Food and led to successful prosecutions for slavery on tomato farms in the United 
</p>
<p>States. 
</p>
<p> 67 For example, after a report by the Fair Labor Association that Nestl&#233; was using child labour in its 
</p>
<p>cocoa supply chain, the company strengthened its Nestl&#233; Cocoa Plan, adopting all recommendations. 
</p>
<p>(The case is cited together with other examples in the International Corporate Accountability

<p>number of international and regional instruments. See also Basic Principles and Guidelines on the 
</p>
<p>Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights </p>


<p>Human Rights, clear guidance is set out on &#8220;access to remedy&#8221;, delineating respective roles 
</p>
<p>for both States and business.  
</p>
<p>57. Prior to that, principle 22 in the second pillar states that where businesses identify 
</p>
<p>that they have caused or contributed to adverse human rights impacts, they should provide 
</p>
<p>for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes. Where businesses have 
</p>
<p>not caused or contributed to harm but it is directly linked to their operations, products or 
</p>
<p>services by a business relationship, they are encouraged to take a role in providing 
</p>
<p>remediation. In terms of operational principles under the third pillar, the Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>on Business and Human Rights, call on companies to establish or to participate in effective 
</p>
<p>operational-level grievance mechanisms for those adversely impacted by them, so that 
</p>
<p>grievances can be addressed early and remediated directly (principle 29). Such mechanisms 
</p>
<p>are typically administered by enterprises, alone or in collaboration with other relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. They can be important complements to wider stakeholder engagement and 
</p>
<p>collective bargaining processes, but cannot substitute for either, and can also make it 
</p>
<p>possible to prevent harm from compounding or escalating. To ensure their effectiveness, 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights state that the operational-level 
</p>
<p>grievance mechanisms should be legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, transparent, 
</p>
<p>rights-compatible, a source of continuous learning, and based on engagement and dialogue 
</p>
<p>(principle 31). There are already some good practice examples of operational-level 
</p>
<p>grievance mechanisms.70 
</p>
<p>58. As part of its duty to protect against business-related human rights abuses, the State 
</p>
<p>is required to take appropriate steps to ensure that those affected have access to effective 
</p>
<p>remedy when abuses occur within their territory and/or jurisdiction and to reduce barriers 
</p>
<p>that could lead to a denial of this access. In the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, it is indicated that this is to be achieved primarily through State-based judicial 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and non-judicial grievance mechanisms, which are complementary in nature 
</p>
<p>(principles 25&#8211;27). States are also encouraged to consider ways to facilitate access to 
</p>
<p>effective non-State based grievance mechanisms that can have the benefit of reduced costs, 
</p>
<p>increased speed of access and transnational reach, where States may be more limited. These 
</p>
<p>may be non-judicial business, industry or multi-stakeholder mechanisms; or they may be 
</p>
<p>regional or international human rights bodies (see principle 28).  
</p>
<p>59. For victims of contemporary forms of slavery, including those in supply chains, 
</p>
<p>remedies may include compensation, medical and psychological care, free legal aid and 
</p>
<p>social services, effective measures aimed at the cessation of continuing violations and 
</p>
<p>alternative livelihood support measures. However, the right to an effective remedy for 
</p>
<p>many workers, in particular the most vulnerable in supply chains, remains largely elusive 
</p>
<p>and redress for corporate human rights violations is hampered by many barriers, including 
</p>
<p>the high costs of litigation and a lack of a free legal aid. Moreover, the victims, especially if 
</p>
<p>not members of trade unions, may not be aware that their rights have been violated. In 
</p>
<p>extreme instances, workers may be enslaved and physically unable to enforce their rights.71  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law. 
</p>
<p> 70 See for instance, International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association for an 
</p>
<p>example in the global oil and gas industry (&#8220;Operational level grievance mechanisms: good practice 
</p>
<p>survey&#8221;, www.ipieca.org/publication/operational-level-grievance-mechanisms-good-practice-survey). 
</p>
<p> 71 For a comprehensive account of barriers to access to remedies, see Gwynne Skinner and others, <i>The 
</i></p>
<p><i>Third Pillar: access to judicial remedies for human rights violations by transnational businesses</i> 
</p>
<p>(2013, International Corporate Accountability Roundtable). The report seeks to understand which 
</p>
<p>barriers are most insurmountable for victims of abuses of human rights by transnational business and 
</p>
<p>to provide recommendations for each of the jurisdictions examined regarding how the States can 
</p>
<p>better fulfil their duty to reduce these barriers. On the right to an effective remedy, see also the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR initiative on enhancing accountability and access to remedy in cases of business </p>


<p>60. Given the gravity of slavery and slavery-like practices as gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, judicial remedies are a key form of securing accountability for business-related 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses. Access to justice for victims in this context is, however, often 
</p>
<p>constrained by legal rules limiting the liability of a corporation for human rights violations 
</p>
<p>not directly arising from its business operations. This is a problem in global supply chains 
</p>
<p>whereby the business enterprise sourcing the product is not directly implicated in the 
</p>
<p>exploitation that occurs lower down the supply chain, but is complicit as a result of failing 
</p>
<p>to comply with its human rights due diligence obligations. Also, vicarious liability rules 
</p>
<p>prevent corporate liability for management conduct in many instances which arise in the 
</p>
<p>disarticulation in the supply between the global retailer and the many small subcontractors 
</p>
<p>at the lowest tier.  
</p>
<p>61. In the context of supply chains, a lack of extraterritorial jurisdiction affects access to 
</p>
<p>remedies for contemporary forms of slavery and other human rights violations, which are 
</p>
<p>committed outside the territory in which a business is domiciled. In this context, the United 
</p>
<p>States Supreme Court held, for example, in <i>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</i>,<i> Co</i>., that the 
</p>
<p>presumption against the extraterritorial application of United States law applies to the Alien 
</p>
<p>Tort Statute,72 and this can only be overcome if the claim &#8220;touches and concerns&#8221; the 
</p>
<p>territory of the United States &#8220;with sufficient force&#8221; to displace the presumption against 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial application.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Some challenges and gaps to ensuring the accountability of States and 
</b></p>
<p><b>businesses for contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains  
</b></p>
<p>62. Despite notable improvements in recent years, gaps in legal and regulatory 
</p>
<p>protection for the human rights of victims of contemporary forms of slavery exist in a 
</p>
<p>number of countries. This has a significant impact on enforcing corporate legal liability.73 
</p>
<p>In many cases, States also lack an integrated approach to criminal, labour and human rights 
</p>
<p>laws, which impedes law enforcement and prevents effective investigation and prosecution 
</p>
<p>of abuses. Where the legislative framework does exist, in some instances this is affected by 
</p>
<p>lengthy legal proceedings and corruption, including bribery, which means that access to 
</p>
<p>remedy is slow and victims are reluctant to come forward as a result.  
</p>
<p>63. In other cases, some legal jurisdictions are part of the problem, exacerbating the 
</p>
<p>vulnerability of workers to contemporary forms of slavery. This is the case in countries 
</p>
<p>where laws tie migrant workers to specific employers, preventing them from leaving 
</p>
<p>without the employer&#8217;s authorization. In some countries, for example, certain categories of 
</p>
<p>workers are not guaranteed their right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and 
</p>
<p>thus not allowed to form or join trade unions or hold office within them, which adds to their 
</p>
<p>vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>64. It also remains a challenge for transnational businesses with complex supply chains 
</p>
<p>to conduct human rights due diligence on all levels of their supply chains, particularly 
</p>
<p>where they have no direct business relationship with subcontractors.74 The same applies for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p> 74 In the commentary to principle 17 of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, it is 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that, where businesses have large numbers of entities in their value chains it may be </p>


<p>labour supply chains, the informal economy and the production, harvesting or extraction 
</p>
<p>that occurs at the commodities level of the global economy.  
</p>
<p>65. A key gap is the lack of research and data in identifying the exact scope and 
</p>
<p>prevalence of contemporary forms of slavery in specific supply chains and related to 
</p>
<p>particular commodities, as well as its prevalence in the informal sector, which could enable 
</p>
<p>strengthened and targeted policy and normative response and practical strategies. More 
</p>
<p>research and data is also needed on domestic supply chains.75  
</p>
<p>66. Global businesses have the capacity and resources to address, jointly with relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, the root causes of contemporary forms of slavery, particularly structural 
</p>
<p>issues relating to discrimination, poverty and inequality and should use this leverage more 
</p>
<p>prominently.76 There is also the need for increased dialogue and cooperation among all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders working on the issue of contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains, also 
</p>
<p>within the international community, in order to combine their efforts to ensure its 
</p>
<p>eradication, including in relation to the 2016 International Labour Conference general 
</p>
<p>discussion on the issue of decent work in global supply chains.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The present report provides an indication of some of the challenges in enforcing 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability of States and businesses for preventing, mitigating and redressing 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains. The framework emerging from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations system has provided greater clarity on how to operationalize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility of business to respect human rights, including through conducting 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights due diligence, and the obligations of States to address business-related 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights abuses. The passing of national laws, which reflect an increasing global 
</b></p>
<p><b>concern with transparency, reporting and human rights due diligence obligations that 
</b></p>
<p><b>add to the accountability tool belt, is to be applauded. So are the </b>businesses&#8217;<b> human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights policy commitments, although loopholes exist in terms of their enforcement, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the important role played in the combat against contemporary forms of slavery in 
</b></p>
<p><b>supply chains by other stakeholders, including civil society actors, such as non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organisations, trade unions, foundations and consumers, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>international organizations and the media. While these developments are notable, 
</b></p>
<p><b>important gaps still exist in terms of effective access to justice and adequate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prompt remediation for victims of contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Against this backdrop, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations to States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States should ratify all relevant international instruments prohibiting 
</b></p>
<p><b>slavery and slavery-like practices, including the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), align their domestic legislation with international 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>unreasonably difficult to conduct due diligence for adverse human rights impacts across them all. If 
</p>
<p>so, business enterprises should identify general areas where the risk is most significant, whether due 
</p>
<p>to certain suppliers&#8217; or clients&#8217; operating context, the particular operations, products or services 
</p>
<p>involved, or other relevant considerations, and prioritize these for human rights due diligence.  
</p>
<p> 75 In this context it is noteworthy that the Freedom Fund has provided a grant to Focus on Labour 
</p>
<p>Exploitation (FLEX) to develop a Modern Slavery Accountability Database, an online database of 
</p>
<p>national laws and regulations on individual and corporate accountability for modern slavery.  
</p>
<p> 76 The Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
</p>
<p>enterprises, in its report, addressed the role business can play in the finalization of the proposed 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals (A/HRC/29/28). </p>


<p><b>standards, criminalize all contemporary forms of slavery and provide adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>penalties for violations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States should develop, enact and update a national action plan on 
</b></p>
<p><b>business and human rights in accordance with the guidance provided by the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
</b></p>
<p><b>enterprises. Measures outlined in the national action plan should take full advantage 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the leverage home States have in order to effectively prevent, address and redress 
</b></p>
<p><b>extraterritorial human rights harms of businesses domiciled in their territory and/or 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdiction; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To support effective implementation of domestic laws, States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen their institutional frameworks and enforcement mechanisms across 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant structures, including labour inspectorates, the judiciary and prosecution, 
</b></p>
<p><b>through provision of continued capacity-building, awareness-raising and adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>human and financial resources; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) In addition to adoption and effective enforcement of human rights and 
</b></p>
<p><b>labour laws, such as those ensuring the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
</b></p>
<p><b>association and providing for minimum labour standards, States bear a fundamental 
</b></p>
<p><b>duty to address the preventive aspect of contemporary forms of slavery through 
</b></p>
<p><b>tackling its root causes, including poverty, discrimination, stigmatization, inequality 
</b></p>
<p><b>and social exclusion of groups most vulnerable to slavery and slavery-like practices, 
</b></p>
<p><b>by adopting a human-rights based approach and incorporating a gender perspective;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States must ensure that those affected by business-related human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuse, including victims of forced labour and other contemporary forms of slavery, 
</b></p>
<p><b>have the right to an effective remedy by taking appropriate steps to ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness of judicial mechanisms, providing effective and appropriate non-judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>grievance mechanisms, facilitating access to effective non-State-based grievance 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and reducing barriers that could deny access to remedy for victims;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) States are strongly encouraged to adopt effective legislation requiring 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparency in supply chains, human rights due diligence throughout supply chains, 
</b></p>
<p><b>public reporting and disclosures of businesses, as well as measures relating to 
</b></p>
<p><b>procurement practices, and to guarantee its implementation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) States should explicitly prohibit fraudulent and abusive recruitment 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices that are one of the main causes of contemporary forms of slavery in supply 
</b></p>
<p><b>chains and adopt measures to regulate recruitment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) States should invest in research and collection and analysis of data on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>scope and prevalence of contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains, specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>commodities, sectors, the informal economy and in domestic production as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>foundation for effective policy and strategy formulation by both public and private 
</b></p>
<p><b>sector actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Special attention of States should be given to the risk of contemporary 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of slavery in the informal economy, including by identifying at risk sectors and 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducting effective labour inspections;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) States should consider different strategies to promote voluntary 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives, especially multi-stakeholder public-private partnership platforms, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>include Governments at all levels, civil society actors, including trade unions, business 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives and other stakeholders. These are crucial to effectively and holistically 
</b></p>
<p><b>address contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains and can, inter alia, foster 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue on policies to best tackle its root causes, provide an institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>to develop and implement supply chain strategies, grievance mechanisms and </b></p>


<p><b>remediation, advocacy on legal and public policy reform, as well as to promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>certification and independent investigation. Community- and area-based approaches, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which do not target a single crop or commodity, are a key form of a partnership. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>In relation to businesses, the Special Rapporteur recommends the following: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Businesses should adopt human rights policy commitments and conduct 
</b></p>
<p><b>continuous human rights due diligence in line with the framework established in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and include the findings of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>latter in their policies and procedures aimed at eliminating contemporary forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>slavery from supply chains; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Human rights policy commitments and supporting policies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures should be complemented by effective implementation which moves beyond 
</b></p>
<p><b>auditing, and includes third party independent monitoring, proactive investigations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>random unannounced assessments that prioritize confidential consultation with 
</b></p>
<p><b>workers and strategies linked to prevention of unethical recruitment in supply chains;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) All </b>businesses&#8217; <b>human rights policies and procedures and the systems to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement them should integrate measures reaching beyond the first tier in supply 
</b></p>
<p><b>chains and include clear guidelines and indicators to assist those operating at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>lower tiers and in the informal economy to identify human rights violations, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary forms of slavery, and ensure compliance with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Transparency in supply chains is important for ensuring corporate 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability for human rights abuse. Businesses should publicly report on action 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaken to address their human rights impacts, including preventive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>corrective measures, and share lessons learned and strategies for improvement;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Businesses should provide for or cooperate in remediation by 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing or participating in an operational-level grievance mechanism, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperate with State-based judicial and non-judicial grievance mechanisms. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach adopted by businesses in providing for a timely and effective remedy should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be community-based and inclusive of, for example, public and/or non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>service providers with expertise in working with victims of contemporary forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>slavery;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Gaps in national legislation and underdeveloped regulatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>infrastructure can pose significant risks for contemporary forms of slavery in supply 
</b></p>
<p><b>chains. To address this, businesses, working in partnership with business peers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other stakeholders or though representative industry and employer organizations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should engage public policy actors and regulators to encourage adoption of a relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal framework and effective law enforcement. Businesses, together with other 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders, also have an important role to play in addressing the root causes of 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary forms of slavery; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Business should engage in capacity-building to ensure management and 
</b></p>
<p><b>staff, as well as the relevant business partner, awareness-raising on the nature and 
</b></p>
<p><b>risks of contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains and the strategies for its 
</b></p>
<p><b>eradication.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to make the following recommendations to 
</b></p>
<p><b>other stakeholders: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) International organizations and the donor community have an important 
</b></p>
<p><b>role to play in providing a forum for stakeholder dialogue and partnership to address </b></p>


<p><b>contemporary forms of slavery in supply chains and to empower communities. They 
</b></p>
<p><b>are encouraged to assist the States and other actors, if needed, by providing technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance for research, capacity-building, remediation and for addressing root causes 
</b></p>
<p><b>through human rights-based development and poverty reduction programmes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Investors should use their leverage to exercise pressure on businesses to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect human rights, raise awareness of the risks of slavery and slavery-like practices 
</b></p>
<p><b>in supply chains, build capacity, invest in research and data collection and analysis, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and ensure that businesses establish relationships with other relevant actors, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>through multi-stakeholder platforms;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Consumers should play a more active role in scrutinizing the origin of 
</b></p>
<p><b>products and promoting ethical sourcing and other fair trade initiatives; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Trade unions and their confederations have a key role to play in 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring that the human rights of workers are complied with by States and 
</b></p>
<p><b>businesses; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Other civil society actors, including foundations, and academia, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>media should continue to conduct research, investigate and report on human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations in supply chains, highlight areas of non-compliance with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights norms and standards and call for an effective and prompt action by 
</b></p>
<p><b>those responsible.
