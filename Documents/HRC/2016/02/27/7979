</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1.  The Moroccan authorities receive with satisfaction the Report of the Special 
Rapporteur on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 
drafted following his visit to Morocco, conducted from the 15th, to the 22nd of September 
2012, and thank him for his positive assessments of the cooperation of the Moroccan 
authorities for the success for his mission in Morocco. They also express their satisfaction 
with the fact that the Special Rapporteur could measure the will of the authorities to open 
up to an independent examination of the situation of human rights in Morocco, and note the 
irreversible and strategic commitment of the Kingdom to the consolidation of human rights, 
including the eradication of torture. 
</p>
<p>2. Within the framework of the continous interaction of the Moroccan authorities with 
the Special Rapporteur, particularly with regard to the follow-up of the recommendations 
proposed to the authorities, received in a spirit of co-operation and partnership, the 
Kingdom of Morocco would like to make some comments and remarks concerning the 
assessment of the situation of human rights in Morocco put forward by the Special 
Rapporteur (I), the recommendations made (II), and the follow-up of the implementation of 
the observations and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur (III).  
</p>
<p><b>I. Evaluation of the situation of human rights in Morocco 
</b></p>
<p>3. Concerning the evaluation of the situation reported by the Special Rapporteur 
through his visit to Morocco, the Moroccan authorities have some remarks on the overall 
assessment as it was stated in the report, then on the understanding of the institutional 
system and interpretation of the substantive law of our country. It appears then that certain 
reported allegations are unfounded. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. </b>The Moroccan authorities&#8217; assessment of the overall evaluation of the 
<b>Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Moroccan authorities  regret the fact that  a part of the allegations is directly 
reported and exposed, without any cross-checking, and especially without taking account of 
the context and the legal and institutional environment of the country, which has 
significantly developed since the accomplishment of its transitional justice experience, and 
its commitment within the framework of the consolidation of the rule of law and 
democratization, and also, since its effective and continuous opening up to the U.N. human 
rights mechanisms, particularly within the framework of the periodic reviews conducted by 
treaty bodies, such as the Committee against Torture (CAT) in November 2011. 
</p>
<p>5. Brief replies or clarifications, however, were given at various official meetings, 
particularly at the preparatory meeting for the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, on the sidelines of 
</p>
<p>the Regional Seminar on the Prevention of Torture, held on the 9th and 10th of June 2012, 
in which he took part as a transitional justice expert, during the reception meeting at the 
beginning of the visit, and during the various official thematic meetings with the major 
officers in charge. 
</p>
<p>6. The Moroccan authorities noted sometimes an &#8220;amalgam&#8221; between the situation of 
human rights during the &#8220;years of lead&#8221; in which serious, massive and/or systematic 
violations of human rights were committed, and the current situation, inserting 
considerations dating back to the first period, whereas the violations made at that time 
could not be compared with those relating to current allegations.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>7. Therefore, the Moroccan transitional justice experience, its success, the new era that 
it has generated and the concrete implications as regards the protection of human rights 
brought about were not stated in their real dimension. In fact, this experience strongly 
impacted even the momentum of legislative and institutional reforms in the mid-1990s, 
namely the adoption in 2002 of Act n&#176;22-01 on the Criminal Procedure Code, and the 
adoptionn in 2006 of Act n&#176; 43-04 on torture amending and supplementing the Criminal 
Code. At the institutional level, this development was marked by the deep-reaching 
reorganization to which the Advisory Council for Human Rights 1 (currently CNDH2) was 
subjected, the creation of Diwan el-Madhalim3 in 2001, the creation of CNDH, the 
Mediator Institute and the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights, in 2011. The new 
Constitution has consolidated this process of reforms, including the issues relating to the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur, especially the adoption of Act n&#176;35-11 dated October 
17th, 2011 supplementing the Criminal Procedure Code, aiming at reinforcing the 
conditions of fair trial and other rights established by the new Constitution. 
</p>
<p>8. Concerning the claim that not all the victims or families of victims have received 
compensation4, the Special Rapporteur seems to reduce the Moroccan experience to 
compensation. The Moroccan authorities wish to recall that the overall process underwent 
two phases. The first phase is marked by the institution, as of 1999, of an independent 
arbitration body in charge of compensating the victims of forced disappearance and 
arbitrary detention, whose mandate was limited to the financial compensation for victims. 
7780 individuals benefited from compensation within this framework5. Also, in so far as 
compensation alone cannot ensure a true remedy for the damages suffered, and to meet the 
expectations of the associations of victims and their families, as well as human rights 
NGOs, a truth commission, namely the Equity and Reconciliation Commission6 (IER), was 
established in 2004, upon a recommendation of CCDH in this regard; and this is the second 
phase of the process. 
</p>
<p>9. It was appointed to elucidate the cases of serious violations of human rights in 
Morocco during the period extending from 1956 to 1999,. Its mandate covered a large 
range of serious, massive and/or systematic violations: forced disappearance, arbitrary 
detention, infringement of the right to life, torture, forced exile, disproportionate use of 
police force during social protest movements.  
</p>
<p>10. With regard to the 22.000 applications received, IER opened individual files which 
were all examined. The cases falling within IER material and temporal scope of 
competence were the subject of arbitral compensation decisions as well as 
recommendations on other methods of remedy, namely medical and psychological 
rehabilitation, social reintegration and the settlement of the administrative and financial 
situation of victims. Also, within the framework of financial compensation, IER established 
criteria7 and accounting units, on the basis of the type of violations suffered, the principle of 
equality and solidarity between the victims having suffered the same violations, as well as 
the gender approach.

 6 Instance Equit&#233; et R&#233;conciliation 
 7 The first criterion relates to the deprivation of liberty; the other criteria refer to the duration of 
</p>
<p>violations suffered, detention conditions, &#8220;related&#8221; violations (torture, ill treatment), sequelae, and 
</p>
<p>even the loss of revenue or opportunities.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>11. As of February 15th, 2013, 18.032 people benefited from compensation, insofar as 
they met the specified criteria8. To date, 188 files on cases in which IER and the follow-up 
committee established death in detention have not been compensated yet, either because the 
relevant beneficiaries did not provide the required documents for the examination of their 
file, or because the beneficiaries condition the acceptance of compensation by handing-over 
the remains of their relatives. 
</p>
<p>12. Hence, IER attempted to do justice to the maximum number of victims and remedy 
the damages they suffered. The program of individual remedy was carried out9. As for the 
community remedy program, it lies within the more general scope of empowerment of the 
populations of the areas concerned and the safeguard of remembrance, according to a 
participative and inclusive approach. This program is still underway although it has been 
largely implemented. Indeed, reparation was designed and developed within the framework 
of a comprehensive approach whose major dimensions are the recognition of victims, 
liability of State bodies, the establishment of truth and the duty of remembrance. The 
Moroccan experience cannot be reduced to financial compensation, which is only one 
aspect of (individual) remedy.  
</p>
<p>13. The Moroccan authorities would like also to recall that IER was designed as an 
extra-judicial transitional justice mechanism. It was appointed to determine the liability for 
the State and its bodies, and not individual liability, in a spirit of consolidation of reforms 
and reconciliation. This process, however, by no means excluded the right of victims, their 
families or beneficiaries to take legal action. It should be noted that adopting amnesty laws 
likely to support the impunity of public agents involved in this period was never 
considered. 
</p>
<p>14. Also, concerning the issue raised by the Special Rapporteur about the fact that the 
work of IER did not break the cycle of the <i>de facto </i>impunity of the perpetrators of the 
violations committed during the 1956-1999 period, the Moroccan authorities wish to recall 
that, within the framework of the implementation of the relevant IER recommendations, 
Morocco engaged in the development of an integrated national strategy for the  fight 
against impunity, considering that the eradication of impunity requires,, in addition to legal 
reforms, the development and installation of public policies in the sectors of justice, 
security and law enforcement, education and life-long training, as well as active 
involvement of the society as a whole. This strategy should be founded on the international 
law of human rights, conducting first the alignment of the penal legislation with the 
international commitments of the country. 
</p>
<p>15. In this respect, it should be recalled that a new policy of security forces governance 
has been conducted since 200610, through the upgrading, clarification and publication of the 
statutory texts on the attributions, organization, decision-making processes, procedures and 
systems of supervision and evaluation of the entire set of law enforcement and security 
</p>
<p>  
 8 Amount of compensation allocated : 813.345.215,00 MAD (96.300.000,00$ US) 
 9 Within the framework of the follow-up of the implementation of ERC recommendations, relating to 
</p>
<p>individual and community remedies, for 2012, the financial compensation for the victims of serious 
violations of human rights committed in the past, amounted to 26.214.822 MAD for the benefit of 
358 beneficiaries, divided into three sections (1st section mounts to 11.774.324 MAD for the benefit 
of 131 beneficiaries, 2nd section amounts to 13.372.785 MAD for the benefit of 181 beneficiaries and 
one 3rd section in the course of payment of an amount of 1.067.713 MAD for the benefit of 46 
beneficiaries). The medical coverage of the victims of serious violations of the human rights resulted 
in the allowance of a budget of 4.000.000 MAD, an amount annually allocated to CNOPS.  
</p>
<p> 10 An cooperation agreement and of partnership was concluded between the CCDH (current CNDH) and 
the Ministry from the Interior and the opening of the public debate on the sedentary governorship. </p>

</p>
<p><b> 2. Understanding the institutional system and interpretation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>substantive law  
</b></p>
<p>16. The Moroccan authorities wish to present some clarifications regarding the 
understanding of the institutional system and interpretation of the substantive law of the 
country as to both substantive and procedural aspects. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.1 Institutional system 
</b></p>
<p><i> 2.1.1 Reform of justice  
</i></p>
<p>17. In the framework of a deep-reaching and comprehensive reform of justice, a High-
level body in charge of establishing a national dialogue on this reform was appointed on 
May 8th, 2012 by His Majesty King Mohammed VI. The objectives of this reform are the 
reinforcement of judicial independence, from the perspective of the implementation of the 
new provisions of the Constitution, concurrently with the development of training. 
</p>
<p>18. Following the appointment of the High-level Body, the National Dialogue was 
launched on a series of reform lines, initially through a program of regional conferences 
involving all stakeholders. These regional conferences were an opportunity for the various 
justice professionals, namely the representatives of magistrates, registry staff and lawyers, 
to directly contribute in an interactive way to this dialogue through debates open onto all 
priority issues raised in reform lines. Ten conferences were organized between June 2012 
and February 2013. They addressed topics such as the reinforcement of judicial 
independence, modernization of criminal policy, criminal justice and the reinforcement of 
the guarantees of fair trial, improvement of access to justice, upgrading the legal and 
judicial professions, as well as raising the moral standard of justice.  
</p>
<p>19. In addition, a study day on &#8220;Justice and the Media&#8221; is scheduled for the 23rd of 
February 2013 in Rabat. Also, a meeting between the Minister of Justice and Liberties and 
the officials of the jurisdictions of the Kingdom is planned for the 21st and 22nd of 
February 2013 in Rabat. The National Dialogue will lead to the adoption of a National 
Charter with clear objectives, priorities, programs and funding resources, as well as 
rigorous implementation and evaluation mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><i> 2.1.2 Innovative role of the National Council of Human Rights 
</i></p>
<p>20. The Moroccan authorities would like to underscore the particularly innovative role 
played by CNDH since its inception in March 2011, within the framework of visiting the 
entire set of places of deprivation of liberty, as highlighted by the Special Rapporteur. 
CNDH published two very important reports in a short period of time on the visits it 
organized and conducted in places of detention of liberty. The first is entitled &#8220;The crisis of 
prisons, a shared responsibility: 100 recommendations for the protection of the rights of 
prisoners&#8221;, published on October 31st, 2012. It deals with the situation of prisons in 
</p>
<p>Morocco11, based on the visit of more than 15 correctional facilities throughout the country 
between January 31st, and June 19th, 2012. The second report, &#8220;Mental health and human 
</p>
<p>rights: the pressing need for a new policy&#8221;12, was published on September 11th, 2012,

<p>taking stock of the current conditions of health care within psychiatric hospitals provided to 
people suffering from mental diseases. 
</p>
<p>21. The authorities and bodies concerned showed great receptivity vis-&#224;-vis these 
reports. The General Delegation for Prison Administration and Reintegration (DGAPR), 
after the presentation of the conclusions of CNDH on the situation of prisons, thoroughly 
studied all the recommendations that fall within the scope of its competence. It immediately 
strove to find the means of solving the problematic points raised by CNDH. In this 
connection, DGAPR organized two study days for reflection and debate in December 2012, 
attended by CNDH, the Inter-ministerial Delegate for Human Rights, Mohammed VI 
Foundation for the Reintegration of Detainees, in the presence of CNDH members, 
Regional Directors and Directors of Facilities, as well as the medical doctors affiliated to 
these facilities. The objective of these two study days was to think about ways of 
implementing the recommendations contained in the first CNDH report and overcoming the 
difficulties regarding prison management, taking account also of the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur with regard to the follow-up of his Report. Two publications were prepared for 
this reason in January 2013 for the entire staff of DGAPR.  
</p>
<p>22. The publication of CNDH Report on the situation in psychiatric facilities made it 
possible to give a fresh momentum to the reform process of the legislative framework 
regulating these facilities, dating back to 1959 and currently outdated. One of the 
recommendations of CNDH in this regard relates to the need for the preliminary draft law 
on the matter to be the object of true and broad prior consultations with all stakeholders in 
order to provide an adequate legal system. In this setting, a national day of dialogue and 
advocacy, bringing together health professionals, representatives of the sectors, bodies and 
associations involved in the field of mental health, is planned to be held on the 27th of 
February 2013 in Rabat. 
</p>
<p>23. CNDH also paid visits to Child Protection Centers (CSE13) and intends to publish a 
report in order to improve the situation of the children placed in these centers, which will be 
published in due course. These visits were organized according to a participative approach 
involving all official actors (at central and local levels), NGOs, children and families, 
taking into account the gender approach. They aimed at evaluating and analyzing the 
conformity of the legislative and institutional framework governing the placement of these 
children in such centers with the international standards and guidelines. (See para. 84 on 
CSE). 
</p>
<p>24. CNDH also took up the issue of legal medicine. It entrusted a national expert with 
the mission of drafting a memorandum on the situation of legal medicine in order to 
analyze the legislative and regulatory texts governing this profession, identify the 
challenges related to the practice of this discipline and to recommend solutions conducive 
to a homogeneous, coherent and scalable institutional framework for the medico-legal 
activity, in order to meet the requirements of efficiency, safety and equality of citizens 
before justice. This mission has already held discussions with the Ministry of Justice and 
Liberties, the Ministry of Health and the Interior Ministry, visited courts, hospitals and 
municipal hygiene offices in 7 cities, and organized on the 15th of February 2013 a study 
day with different government departments and NGOs. The final report is being drafted and 
should be adopted before the end of the month of February 2013.

<p><i> 2.2.1 Ratification of OP-CAT 
</i></p>
<p>25. The Bill n&#176; 124-12 on the approval of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (OP-CAT) was 
presented and adopted, in conformity with Article 55 of the Constitution, at the Council of 
Ministers&#8217; meeting, held on the 12th of November 2012. It was then presented before the 
</p>
<p>House of Representatives, which approved it on the 12th of February 2013 and has just 
been submitted for approval to the Lower House of Parliament, House of Counselors. The 
Bill will be subsequently promulgated by the King, in conformity with Article 50 of the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>  Implications of the ratification of OP-CAT  
</p>
<p>26. Well before initiating the process of OP-CAT ratification, a wide-ranging public 
debate was organized in Morocco to meet the conditions of effective implementation of this 
instrument, and focus on the most suitable option concerning the national mechanism for 
the prevention of torture (NMP), drawing on the experiences and good practices of States 
having already set up this type of mechanism.  
</p>
<p>27. Many meetings and events on this topic are held regularly. On the 9th and 10th of 
June 2012, a regional brainstorming workshop on the prevention of torture in the context of 
democratic transitions, organized jointly by the Inter-ministerial Delegation for Human 
Rights, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Association for the 
Prevention of Torture, during which the various experiences and options related to the 
ratification of OP-CAT were examined by experts from different backgrounds. The African 
national institutions had met before in Rabat on the 7th and 8th of September 2011 within 
the framework of the high-level conference on the role of national human rights institutions 
in the prevention of torture in Africa. A final Declaration had been adopted in which the 
representatives reiterated their commitment to implementing the program &#8220;A continent 
</p>
<p>united against torture&#8221;, through the reinforcement of the role of the national institutions of 
human rights as regards the prevention of torture, and encouraging the States to ratify the 
Optional Protocol. In 2009, an international Seminar organized by CCDH (now CNDH) 
brought together the entire set of Moroccan stakeholders concerned with this issue, 
members of the United Nations Sub-committee for the Prevention of Torture, the French 
Inspector General of Prisons and other representatives of national prevention mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>28. Currently, CNDH is a de facto and de jure mechanism for the prevention of torture, 
within the framework of its attributions provided under Articles 10 and 11 of the Dahir on 
the Act establishing the Council. It is in this capacity that the latter conducted the recent 
visits to prisons, psychiatric facilities and child protection centers. Nevertheless, in the 
framework of the concrete implementation of OP-CAT, CNDH is engaged in a process of 
dialogue and consultations, in close coordination with the relevant authorities, including 
DIDH, to further reinforce its responsibilities in this field and set up the adequate structures 
that would enable the Institution to play the role of a true NPM. 
</p>
<p>29. The relevant authorities, in turn, are aware of the importance of the new progress 
made as regards the visits to detention facilities in the country within the framework of the 
ratification of OP-CAT. Following the Council of Ministers&#8217; adoption of the bill on the 
approval of OP-CAT, a note issued by DGAPR was addressed to all Directors of Facilities 
on the 28th of November, 2012 in order to further sensitize prison staff to human rights in 
general and to the contents of the Protocol in particular. </p>

<p><i> 2.2.2  Definition of torture  
</i></p>
<p>30. Act n&#176; 43-04 on torture modifying and supplementing the Criminal Code adopted in 
2006 came to settle this issue through a definition which includes, as the Special 
Rapporteur on Torture pointed out, the major elements contained in the first Article of the 
Convention against Torture, with particularly deterrent sentences.  Nevertheless, this issue 
is still the object of reflection within the framework of the Criminal Code reform in order to 
consolidate the alignment of the definition adopted by Moroccan law with the provisions of 
the Convention. 
</p>
<p>  Complicity 
</p>
<p>31. Concerning the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment according to which the definition 
of the Criminal Code does not cover complicity or explicit or tacit consent on the part of 
law enforcement or security personnel or any other person acting in an official capacity, the 
Moroccan authorities recall, nevertheless, that the current provisions apply to the public 
servants in the event that such act is committed by, at the instigation of, or with the express 
or tacit consent of these servants. Indeed, under Article 224 of the Criminal Code, shall be 
deemed civil servant, for the application of criminal law, any person who, under any 
denomination and any level, is entrusted with a position or even temporary mission, 
remunerated or free, and contributes in this capacity to the service of the State, public 
administrations, municipalities, public corporations or a public interest service. 
</p>
<p>32. The Moroccan legislator has also extended the scope of the people likely to be the 
object of sanction and lawsuits for the crime of torture, insofar as the accomplice is 
sentenced to the same penalty as the culprit. Thus, whoever intentionally assists or 
facilitates the perpetration of the crime of torture in any way whatsoever shall be regarded 
as accomplice and shall be punished as the main perpetrator. It should be noted that the 
public servant who is informed of torture and does not take action accordingly is 
himself/herself also considered as the main perpetrator; the multiplicity of accomplices is 
an aggravating circumstance of the penalty which can reach 20 years. Moroccan law 
sanctions torture in all circumstances, and does not admit any mitigating circumstances or 
exonerating discharges (Article 231 of Criminal Code).  
</p>
<p>33. In order to reinforce the penal provisions in force on torture, it is planned within the 
framework of the revision of the Penal Code to establish new provisions criminalizing in a 
separate way the crimes of torture committed by public servants and those committed by 
other people. 
</p>
<p><i> 2.2.3 Issue of confessions  
</i></p>
<p>34. With regard to the allegations raised about the use of force, even torture to force the 
suspects to sign their statements during investigations conducted by the criminal police14, 
the Moroccan authorities recall that in accordance with the provisions of Article 67 of the 
Criminal Procedure Code, any person remanded in custody has the right to refuse signing 
the minutes of the hearing; in this case, the judicial police officer is required to note the 
refusal and to mention the reasons thereof. 
</p>
<p>35. Moreover, aware of the relative conclusive effect of confessions, since the 
Constitution introduced in 2011 the right to keep silent, and due to the recent modifications 
of the Criminal Procedure Code introduced by Act n&#176;35-11 for better guaranteeing the 
rights of the people suspected of offences, investigators usually focus their investigations 
on the collection of material evidence, relying on the skills of the forensic police. In 
</p>
<p>  
 14 Para. 27 of SRT Report  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>addition, Article 287 of the Criminal Procedure Code stipulates that &#8220;the judge can base his 
decision only on evidence exposed in the debates and discussed orally after hearing both 
parties before him&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>36. Finally, the Ministry of Justice and Liberties has undertaken to ensure the video 
recording of all statements made to the police during investigations and interrogations, 
within the framework of the National Dialogue&#8217;s recommendations on the reform of justice. 
</p>
<p><i> 2.2.4 Access to lawyer 
</i></p>
<p>37. With regard to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment that &#8220;Testimonies &#8230; indicate 
that, in practice, they are often denied access beyond the legal time frame&#8221; and that &#8220;It 
</p>
<p>appears that in the majority of cases, lawyers meet their clients only at the first hearing 
before the judge.15&#8221;, the Moroccan authorities specify that Act n&#176;35-11 of October 17th, 
2011 introduced substantial modifications as to the guarantee of such access. 
</p>
<p>38. Indeed, concerning the possibility for suspects to communicate as detainees with 
their lawyers, since the modification introduced to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
especially Article 66 thereof, this possibility is stipulated as a general rule before the end of 
half the initial period of custody, and hence remains quite possible right from the beginning 
of the arrest. 
</p>
<p>39. Act n&#176; 35.11 expressly establishes fundamental guarantees such as the immediate 
notification of suspects of the reasons for their arrest in a language that they understand, the 
right to keep silence; the right to benefit from legal assistance; and the right to appoint their 
own lawyers.  
</p>
<p>40. From now on, immediately after the remand in custody of a person, the criminal 
police should notify the lawyer of the person arrested and inform the chairman of the bar 
about the event. And if the person in custody requests the designation of a lawyer in the 
framework of legal assistance, the chairman of the bar is informed to conduct such 
designation. 
</p>
<p>41. Contact with the lawyer is carried out before the end of half the time limit of 
custody. It may be delayed by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, upon the request of the 
criminal police officer, but the delay may not exceed 12 hours after half the time limit of 
custody for ordinary offences. In the event of a terrorist offence, this duration is increased 
to 48 hours as of the end of the initial duration of custody (96 hours), and may not exceed 
48 hours. This exception mechanism is justified by the nature of the offence itself, 
particularly to prevent information and pieces of evidence from circulating and 
compromising proper investigation. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Evaluation of practices 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Moroccan authorities wish to specify the current practices regarding the method 
of monitoring detention sites, as they exist to date, and as they arise not only from the legal 
and institutional framework in force, but also from the current dynamics, particularly the 
visits paid to detention sites, investigations and/or medical examinations. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.1 Visits to detention places (or facilities) 
</b></p>
<p>43. In general, the number of visits to detention facilities is increasing, whatever the 
nature of the authority or body performing such visits. Their multiplication and regional 
</p>
<p>  
 15 Para. 27 of RST Report </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>ramification (proximity) illustrate the will of the Moroccan authorities to reinforce the 
mechanisms of protection and control concerning these premises, with a view to eradicating 
all forms of torture or ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>44. The provisions of Article 45 of the Criminal Procedure Code oblige prosecutors at 
the various courts to conduct periodic visits to detention premises during both the 
preliminary investigation and the detention pending trial to check the causes of detention 
and the conditions thereof. 
</p>
<p>45. It should be recalled that suspects are remanded in custody in police force buildings 
under the supervision of the General Directorate of National Security (DGSN), or within 
the territorial brigades under the supervision of the Royal Gendarmerie. These premises are 
subjected to the monitoring of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, particularly by means of the 
</p>
<p>Detention Register, which records the identity of the person in custody, the reason for 
custody as well as the time of the beginning and end of custody. This information is 
systematically communicated to the judicial authorities during their visits to detention 
facilities. The judge in charge of enforcing sentences, within the scope of his 
responsibilities, can also consult these registers in order to make sure that they are kept 
properly. 
</p>
<p>46. With regard to the visits conducted by the judicial authorities, in 2010, 1392 visits 
were performed; in 2011, 1236 and in 2012<b>, </b>they witnessed a significant increase 
amounting to 2375 visits.  
</p>
<p><b> 3.2 Investigations and medical examinations regarding torture allegations  
</b></p>
<p>47. Concerning the assessment of the Special Rapporteur that courts and prosecutors do 
not comply with the obligation to initiate an ex officio investigation whenever there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that confessions have been obtained through the use of 
torture, or to order an immediate and independent medical examination if they suspect that 
the detainee has been subjected to ill-treatment16, the Moroccan authorities recall that the 
Criminal Procedure Code (Articles 40 and 49) obliges the legal authorities to open an 
investigation about the complaints and grievances received concerning acts of torture and 
ill-treatment. In addition, the provisions of Article 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code 
expressly stipulates that the Public Prosecutor of the Kingdom, the Prosecutor of the 
Kingdom, the investigating judge or the magistrate in charge of the case shall order a 
medical examination insofar as a request for this purpose has been submitted to them by the 
person who claims to have been tortured or subjected to ill-treatment or by their councils, 
or ex officio. If the magistrates do not order such examinations, it is because, generally, 
detainees raise such ill treatment only several months later, which makes investigations 
difficult. In 2012, legal authorities ordered 32 medical examinations. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. </b>Allegations stated in Special Rapporteur&#8217;s Report<b> 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Moroccan authorities noted a certain number of reported allegations, some of 
which are unfounded; others seem to arise from a biased assessment of the situation. 
</p>
<p><b> 4.1 Unfounded allegations  
</b></p>
<p>49. The points developed hereafter refer to allegations that the Moroccan authorities 
consider unfounded, and regret the fact that they are reported without taking account of the 
</p>
<p>  
 16 Para. 27 of SRT Report </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>clarifications provided by the various departments and officials in charge, or exposed 
without any cross-checking. 
</p>
<p><i> 4.1.1 </i>&#8220;Unknown places of detention&#8221; </p>
<p>50. Within the framework of the evaluation of the situation by the Special Rapporteur, 
and concerning the repeated use of the expression &#8220;unknown places of detention&#8221; &#8221;, it 
</p>
<p>should be recalled that the Moroccan authorities clearly explained on several occasions 
during the visit, that there are no &#8220;unknown places of detention&#8221; in Morocco anymore. The 
places that existed in the past were identified and recorded within the framework of the 
process of transitional justice. Several of these places constitute an integral part of the 
various programs of rehabilitation in the framework of the implementation of IER 
recommendations on community remedy and the safeguard of memory. 
</p>
<p>51. Places of deprivation of liberty are those stipulated and governed by the law, an 
exhaustive list of which was communicated for the visit of the Special Rapporteur, and for 
which unimpeded access was guaranteed. All these places are controlled by the magistrates 
of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>52. In addition, the Moroccan authorities wish to maintain that the assessment of the 
Special Rapporteur concerning the existence of &#8220;unknown places of detention&#8221;, in spite of 
</p>
<p>the conclusions following from the visits of members of Parliament and CNDH, and the 
Public Prosecutor of Rabat, in May 2011&#8221; concerning &#8220;DGST headquarters&#8221; in T&#233;mara17, is 
unacceptable owing to the fact that it calls into question the credibility of the national 
mechanisms and institutions of control. It is also a rather paradoxical assessment in the 
sense that the Special Rapporteur himself notes the importance and increasing credibility of 
CNDH as a protection mechanism, and hence of control, with regard to detention sites. 
</p>
<p>53. Moreover, concerning the focus of the Special Rapporteur on the presumed abuses 
of the security services particularly intelligence services within the framework of terrorism 
cases or offenses against state security, the Moroccan authorities recall that the security 
services endowed with the responsibilities of the criminal police force in Morocco are the 
DGSN (police force), the Royal Gendarmerie (GR), and, since the adoption of Act 35-11 in 
2011n the DGST, and that these various services can be required to work together, each 
within the scope of its competence.  
</p>
<p>54. Generally, intelligence is under the supervision of the DGST while the exploitation 
of intelligence is under the supervision of the police officers of the DGSN, including the 
National Brigade of Judicial Police (BNPJ), within the framework of terrorism cases and 
offenses against state security. DSGN remains to date mainly in charge of arresting people 
suspected of infringements.  
</p>
<p>55. The Moroccan authorities recall, in addition, that the Constitution establishes good 
&#8220;Security Governance&#8221; (Article 54), a structuring concept which tends to reconcile the 
</p>
<p>requirements related to the security of the citizens and the respect of human rights. The 
efforts made by security services in general to mainstream the culture of human rights 
within their services are significant, particularly in training and continuous training of 
various professionals, prevention of torture, the fight against impunity, management of 
social movements and humanization of detention conditions.

</p>
<p><i> 4.1.2 Seriousness of reported treatments  
</i></p>
<p>56. The Moroccan authorities note that many descriptions of ill treatments, even acts of 
torture are reported with different degrees of seriousness. Certain allegations refer to very 
serious facts and treatments, including sexual violence in various forms, with regard to the 
populations in the Southern Provinces as well as irregular migrants. In addition, as regards 
demonstrations, facts are reported which would have involved the death of a demonstrator. 
</p>
<p> a. Sexual violence and other serious acts 
</p>
<p>  Regarding terrorism 
</p>
<p>57. Concerning the allegation relating to &#8220;sexual assaults against detainees&#8221; or &#8220;threat of 
sexual assaults&#8221;18 raised by prisoners convicted within the framework of terrorism cases, 
the Moroccan authorities wish to underline the fact that within the framework of the powers 
of CNDH as regards the visits to detention sites, and with regard to the report published by 
the Council in September 2012 concerning the situation in prisons in Morocco, an objective 
description of the situation of prisoners could be established. Indeed, taking into 
consideration the number of prisons visited, the number of detainees heard, as well as the 
major allegations, including old ones, that these prisoners raise to the Council, it turns out 
that the allegations relating in general to sexual violence are unfounded sheer lies. 
Moreover, these allegations have always been the subject of investigations by the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office whenever it is informed about the seriousness of such facts, and it turns 
</p>
<p>out that sexual violence is not substantiated. By way of example, a case in point is that of 
the prisoners of Toulal Prison in Mekn&#232;s, who claimed to have been &#8220;assaulted&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;raped&#8221;. Informed by these prisoners&#8217; lawyer about such allegations, CNDH suggested 
</p>
<p>referring the matter to the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, which was done. The latter opened then an 
investigation and ordered a medical examination which was conducted by three doctors on 
November 22nd, 2011. The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office dismissed the case insofar as the results of 
</p>
<p>the expert examination showed the unfounded character of these allegations. 
</p>
<p>  Regarding the population in the Southern Provinces  
</p>
<p>58. Concerning the &#8220;credible testimonies relating to torture and ill-treatment in the 
Prison of La&#226;youne, including rape, severe beating and isolation up to several weeks&#8221;19, 
they are sheer unfounded allegations. Whenever this kind of allegations is brought to the 
attention of the officers in charge of Laayoune Prison, investigations are systematically 
conducted. 
</p>
<p>59. In addition, the treatment of the prisoners in this prison does not reveal any 
discrimination, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. Indeed, Article 51 
of Act N&#176;23.98 on correctional facilities stipulates that &#8220;prisoners should not undergo any 
</p>
<p>discrimination based on considerations relating to race, color, nationality, language, 
religion, opinion or social status&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>60. The Moroccan authorities maintain also that there is no complaint of rape among the 
complaints filed at the Regional Commission of Human Rights of Laayoun, regarding the 
allegations of violations of human rights in prison. Indeed, CNDH has not received any 
complaint from any prisoner of this facility, complaining about any sexual assault, since the 
creation of the Commission in December 2012. The same holds the administrative office 
existing in the city since 2007 in the era of CCDH.

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5

<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>61. As for complaints on ill-treatment filed at the office of the Public Prosecutor of 
Laayoune, it turns out that none of them refers to sexual violence. In addition, it should be 
specified that the local prison of Laayoune is the subject of regular visits paid by the 
judicial authorities and the regional Commission of monitoring prisons in Laayoune, during 
which the prisoners do not hesitate to express their complaints and grievances directly to 
such authorities. In 2012, the Prison of Laayoune was the object of 24 visits carried out by 
judicial authorities, 05 visits carried out by the regional Commission of monitoring prisons 
and 08 visits carried out by the regional Commission of CNDH.  
</p>
<p>62. Concerning the other particularly serious allegation reported by the Special 
Rapporteur on &#8220;the alleged abandonment of victims in rural areas after subjecting them to 
</p>
<p>violence&#8221;, the Moroccan authorities consider that this is an unfounded allegation, reported 
</p>
<p>without hearing both sides, and that this allegation does not refer to any dated event or 
specific situation on which the authorities could have presented clarifications. Moroccan 
authorities and national institutions, including CNDH, national and international NGOs, 
treaty bodies complaint mechanisms, such as Special Procedures, have never received any 
allegations, information or testimonies whatsoever concerning &#8220;abandonment in rural 
</p>
<p>areas&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>  Regarding migration 
</p>
<p>63. Concerning the allegation that sub-Saharan migrants trying to go to Europe via the 
Strait of Gibraltar or Ceuta and Melilla would undergo &#8220;beating and sexual violence&#8221;20, and 
relating to the allegation that Morocco would proceed to &#8220;illegal and collective expulsions 
</p>
<p>of hundreds of migrants to Algeria and Mauritania, where they are allegedly subjected to 
torture and ill-treatment, including by being abandoned in no man&#8217;s land&#8221;21 the Moroccan 
authorities regret that these very serious allegations are reported without hearing both sides; 
the authorities maintain also that it does not refer to any specific or dated event on the 
subject of which the authorities would have readily presented clarifications. 
</p>
<p> b. Death of a demonstrator  
</p>
<p>64. Concerning the allegation that &#8220;Security forces were reported to have attacked 
protestors on many occasions, leading to at least one death and many injuries&#8221;22, and that 
&#8220;One protester was severely beaten by police officers and died from his injuries on June 
</p>
<p>2nd, 2011&#8221;23, the Moroccan authorities maintain that this case was the subject of a judicial 
investigation ordered by the Public Prosecutor, when he was referred to  by the family on 
the 2nd of June 2011, claiming that the death was caused by an excessive use of force by 
law enforcement agents in the context of the demonstration which took place in the city of 
Safi on the 29th of May 2011. The Prosecutor was informed of the death of the person at 
the hospital on the same day and ordered an autopsy and several investigation actions to 
determine the causes of such death. CNDH was also referred to in this case and sent an 
inquiry committee. Considering the fact that justice was referred to, CNDH transmitted its 
report to the Minister of Justice and Liberties and the Interior Minister. The Minister of 
Justice and Liberties confirmed the submission of this report to the investigating judge in 
charge of this file.

<p><b> 4.2 Allegations based on a &quot;biased&quot; assessment of the situation  
</b></p>
<p><i> 4.2.1 General detention conditions  
</i></p>
<p> a. Correctional facilities  
</p>
<p>65. The Moroccan authorities underscore that DGAPR launched major projects for the 
construction of modern correctional facilities in conformity with international standards 
relating to the respect of human rights, and the safeguard of the dignity of prisoners, to 
replace these decayed prisons and providing educational, cultural, medical, and sport 
centers, in order to cover the judicial map of the Kingdom. The authorities regret that the 
entire set of these efforts is occulted by the problem of overpopulation of which the 
authorities are aware, given that such overpopulation has negative consequences on the 
space allocated to each prisoner, frequency of showers and walks. The number of prisoners 
in the last four years increased from 59.212 to 70.758 (December 2012), i.e. an increase of 
19.5%.  
</p>
<p>66. Today, for a capacity of 45.000 places, the number of prisoners is approximately 
70.000 prisoners. Also, the rate of overpopulation was of 44%24 in December 2012 (70758 
prisoners). 
</p>
<p>  Transfer of prisoners 
</p>
<p>67. Concerning the transfer of prisoners, and with regard to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
assessment that &#8220;the officers in charge of the centers [of detention] were obviously ready 
</p>
<p>and prepared for his visit, in particular by moving certain prisoners&#8221; (para. 43), the 
</p>
<p>Moroccan authorities state that the transfer of prisoners is conducted frequently, 
particularly when DGAPR receives the list of the final judgments established by the 
Ministry of Justice, twice per month. On the basis of this list a commission at the level of 
the central departments of DGAPR meets to decide the distribution of convicted prisoners, 
according to gender, age, physical and mental health condition, penal situation, history and 
family residence. These criteria are rigorously established by the legislator in order to make 
it possible for the prisoner to benefit from a penitentiary system conducive to his/her 
reintegration. In addition, it should be noted that the prisoner himself, his family or even 
through an association, can ask for transfer to a given prison. In this case, his file is 
examined by the Office of transfers (central administration) which rules on this request. 
</p>
<p>68. The transfers of prisoners that took place before the visit of the Special Rapporteur 
were conducted according to these procedures and do not constitute in any case an 
exception or a particular measure in connection with the visit. Also, in 2012, 27.231 
transfers took place; that is a monthly average of 2270 transfers, in September 2012, 2480 
transfers were carried out in accordance with the average.  
</p>
<p>  Medical care and food of prisoners 
</p>
<p>69. Concerning the assessment relating to &#8220;the absence of independent medical care&#8221;, 
&#8220;lack of medical equipment&#8221; (particularly with regard to dental care) and &#8220;insufficient or 
</p>
<p>  
 24 Average area per prisoner is calculated so that: Total living area of detention (dormitories)/total 
</p>
<p>population. The total area of dormitories is 118 138.87 m2/Number prisoners (70758); currently 
average area per prisoner is 1.67 m2. The rate of overpopulation is calculated by comparison to the 
desired area (3 m 2 pas held): total area 118138.87/3 = 39380 to deduct from the total population,  
that is  70758-39380=31378, which corresponds to 44% OF OVERPOPULATION 
(31378x100/70758 = 44)  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>even non-existent psychiatric medical care&#8221;25, the Moroccan authorities regret that the 
efforts made by DGAPR in this regard are not taken into account. With regard to the 
independent character of medical care services, the authorities maintain that the care 
provided within the medical departments of correctional facilities depend inevitably on the 
prison authorities. All the care is provided by general practitioners or specialists affiliated 
to DGAPR or officially appointed by DGAPR, who work in all autonomy and 
independence, in conformity with the ethics of the profession. All the prisoners have access 
to medical care upon their request, taking appointment with nurses or upon the initiative of 
the nurse who notes a deterioration of the general condition or any symptom shown by a 
prisoner or upon the initiative of the doctor according to the initial medical file. Treatment 
and medical check-up are prescribed if required. According to their examination by the 
general practitioner, prisoners are referred to specialized doctors licensed by the General 
Delegation. In the event of an emergency, the patients are referred to the emergency section 
of the Hospital.  
</p>
<p>70. The quality of medical equipment depends on the structure and age of the prisons. 
Indeed, certain prisons dating back to the colonial period cannot be equipped suitably for 
lack of space, which can affect the quality of medical care, in spite of the good will and the 
efforts of the officers in charge of these prisons. Since its inception in 2008, the General 
Delegation strives to improve medical equipment of correctional facilities, and to recruit 
more doctors and nurses. Since 2008, 21 dentist surgeries were created in correctional 
facilities, which were added to the 19 existing surgeries which were renovated and re-
equipped. Currently, only 6 correctional facilities do not have a dentist surgery for lack of 
space. 
</p>
<p>71. As to the assessment of the food provided to prisoners26, the allocation of meals was 
increased in 2008 from 5 to 14 MAD a day per prisoner, but it remains insufficient because 
of the increase in prison population. The food brought by the families is authorized in 
accordance with the law. The equipment of kitchens depends, like medical equipment, on 
the age of certain prisons. As for the quantitative and qualitative control of food, the food 
provided to prisoners is subjected to two types of controls, internal and external. 
Correctional facilities are subjected to unexpected controls and inspection of the services of 
the National Office of Food Security (ONSSA) which is in charge of the quality control of 
the meals served in all spaces of collective catering. 
</p>
<p>  Complaints of prisoners 
</p>
<p>72. In 2012, 140 complaints were received by the Administration, through various 
organizations. These complaints are transmitted to the Administration either by NGOs (19), 
CNDH (94), the Ministry of Justice and Liberties (11), the prisoners themselves (6), the 
families (2) or the judicial authorities (1); the complaints reported by the newspapers are 
also taken into account (7). At the reception of the complaint, an administrative inquiry is 
launched at the level of the establishment  concerned.  
</p>
<p>  Disciplinary measures 
</p>
<p>73. With regard to the assessment that the methods of control of disciplinary measures, 
particularly the resort to isolation as a punishment, and the applicable mechanisms of 
complaints remain fuzzy, and that solitary confinement would be very frequent and that this 
isolation would be &#8220;the primary, and often only, disciplinary measure applied, without 
</p>
<p>resort to less harmful and more progressive disciplinary steps&#8221; (Para 50), the Moroccan

</p>
<p>authorities state that it is important to distinguish between placing the detainee in a 
disciplinary cell and isolation strictly speaking. The first results from a disciplinary action 
decided by a collegial body of the administration of the concerned establishment, and 
governed by Act n&#176; 23-98; this sanction may not exceed 45 days. The facts constituting a 
disciplinary fault as well as measures in question are provided under Articles 53 to 62 of 
Act n&#176; 23-98. Cell isolation is considered only for security or health-related reasons: it is 
rather a preventive measure for safety reasons or when the health condition of prisoners 
constitutes a threat to their lives or that of others. This measure, in turn, is subjected to the 
entire set of conditions which guarantee the safety and health of the prisoner. The prisoner 
subjected to prison isolation benefits from the traditional prison regime (right to visits, 
walks,&#8230;). 
</p>
<p>74. Moreover, disciplinary measures, when considered, are not limited to the placement 
in a disciplinary cell, but can involve several types of sanctions such as the prohibition of 
purchases or direct visits, cleaning work, or the obligation to repair the damage which the 
prisoner would have caused. Also, the placement in disciplinary cell in 2012 accounted for 
only 37% of disciplinary measures. It should be noted that disciplinary registers are 
controlled by the judicial authorities within the framework of the visits to prisons, including 
the judges in charge of sentence enforcement. 
</p>
<p>75. To date, a reflection initiated by DGAPR focuses on the possibility of modifying the 
legislative measures governing disciplinary measures, as to the duration of the placement in 
disciplinary cells, application of regionalization in conflict resolution, and a better 
adaptation of the disciplinary measure according to the type of infringement and the 
seriousness of the act in question. 
</p>
<p>  Facilities of death-row inmates 
</p>
<p>76. Concerning the assessment of the Special Rapporteur of the prison system and the 
material conditions in prisons, particularly hard for death-row inmates or detainees serving 
life imprisonment27, the Moroccan authorities maintain that the prisoners sentenced to 
capital punishment, 115 to date, are the subject of special attention taking into account the 
nature of the sentence they serve, in the 12 correctional facilities, including the central 
prison of K&#233;nitra. 
</p>
<p>77. This category of prisoners benefit from an individual cell, and are entitled to a walk 
in the morning and afternoon in the courtyard of their district, every day throughout the 
week. They are also subjected to a particular follow-up by the medical personnel who take 
care of their physical and psychological well-being28. Showers are located in a special area 
and are available for them once a week. They benefit from education and literacy programs; 
some of them received diplomas of primary education, secondary education, and even 
university degrees29. They take part, according to their wish, in cultural, entertainment and 
sports activities organized in the facility.  
</p>
<p>78. They are visited by their families; these visits are for some prisoners less frequent 
due to the distance separating them from the location of their families or the lengthy 
sentences they are serving. It seems that the reduced frequency of family visits of these 
prisoners is especially due to the &#8220;despair&#8221; of relatives having lost any hope that such 
</p>
<p>prisoners would be released. Local associations and NGOs play here a great role of support 
  
</p>
<p> 27 Para. 52 of SRT report 
 28 Since 2008, 4.239 medical examinations were conducted for the benefit of death-row inmates within 
</p>
<p>the facility and/or in  public hospitals. 
 29 66 death-row inmates benefit from literacy courses, academic training, and professional training since 
</p>
<p>2008. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5

</p>
<p>and accompaniment. It should be noted, however, that these prisoners may benefit from 
pardon measures30.  
</p>
<p>79. They can communicate with the outside world through the land telephone provided 
in the facility, receive books and magazines of the library of the facility or from outside, in 
addition to the possession of television and radio sets. Like the other prisoners, they receive 
the mail, supplies, and anything else authorized by the law.  
</p>
<p>  Women serving prison sentences 
</p>
<p>80. With regard to the assessment that the rate of overpopulation concerning detained 
women would be higher than that in the districts for men with &#8220;an apparent lack of space 
</p>
<p>for women with children&#8221;31, the Moroccan authorities specify that women account for 
approximately 2.5% of the prison population. If they are indeed in a situation of 
overpopulation (in the sense that they outnumber the places initially planned for them), it is 
primarily within large prisons that these women in general prefer not to leave so as to 
remain near their families. 55% of these women are in preventive detention, and 24% are in 
Sal&#233; or Casablanca. Since 2012, 2 prisons were exclusively dedicated to women, 
independent from men&#8217;s prison, and are managed by female directors (in Casablanca and 
</p>
<p>Toulal). These facilities do not record any problem of overpopulation. In addition, a block 
reserved for women with children, with an accommodation capacity of 700 places, meeting 
modern standards is currently under construction at the Prison of Casablanca. 
</p>
<p>81. Finally, within the framework of a visit of His Majesty the King in August 2012 to 
the prison of Casablanca, 100 women benefited from a royal pardon and were released and 
92 benefited from a reduced sentence.  
</p>
<p>  NGOs visits 
</p>
<p>82. As for the assessment relating to the issue of  visits conducted by NGOs whose 
scope of activity remains &#8220;very limited&#8221; and &#8220;conditioned by the approval of DGAPR&#8221;32, 
the Moroccan authorities recall that Article 84 of Act N&#176;23-98 provides that visits can be 
carried out upon the authorization of the Delegate General. The modification of this Article 
is currently considered with a view to facilitating the activities of NGOs in this regard. On 
the other hand, it should be noted that the scope of activity of NGOs which are authorized 
to pay visits is not restricted, in the sense that any association wishing to support or develop 
the educational welfare of prisoners or to bring a spiritual or moral comfort or material aid 
to them is welcome33. Furthermore, certain members of these NGOs are also members of 
the Regional Commissions of monitoring prisons, which exist within each <i>wilaya</i>, 
prefecture or province34, and pay visits to prisons without restrictions35. Article 621 of the 
Criminal Procedure Code stipulates that the monitoring Commission entitled to visit 
correctional facilities, reports its observations and criticisms to the Ministry of Justice and 
Liberties, and points out the abuses to be stopped as well as the improvements to 
accomplish. 
</p>

<p> b. Psychiatric institutions 
</p>
<p>83. Concerning the assessment of the Special Rapporteur on Torture relating to the fact 
that the &#8220;perpetrators of minor infractions are handed over to the administrative authority if 
</p>
<p>proven to be exempt from criminal liability, which excludes them from medical monitoring 
and the necessary treatment&#8221;, and that there are &#8220;situations where persons with mental 
illnesses remain incarcerated for excessive periods&#8221;36, the Moroccan authorities specify that 
there is currently a project  for the construction and equipment of special units with a 
capacity of 25 beds per unit, which will make it possible soon to increase the capacity of 
caring for patients suffering from mental disorders, responsible for minor offences, who 
remain currently detained within the correctional facilities for a long time, due to the lack 
of psychiatry beds. 
</p>
<p> c. Child Protection Centers 
</p>
<p>84. Child protection centers (CSE) are socio-educational facilities affiliated with the 
Ministry of Youth and Sports, which accommodate children upon court order, pursuant to 
the Criminal Procedure Code, namely children in conflict with the law (children suspected, 
indicted or convicted of a criminal offense), and children in difficult situations (children 
aged 12 to 18 years, placed under detention warrant pursuant to Articles 471 and 481 of 
Criminal Procedure Code). 
</p>
<p>85. In the framework of its responsibilities as regards visits of detention  places, CNDH 
(see para. 22) conducted visits to the entire set of CSE in the country. It was the occasion to 
establish an assessment of the current conditions with regard to children placed in these 
centers. At the time of the visit, 742 children were placed in 17 visited facilities37.  
</p>
<p>86. The Moroccan authorities recall that the adoption of the new Criminal Procedure 
Code in 2003 represents a true step forward as to the protection of children in difficult 
situations and the children in conflict with the law. Indeed, the new approach of the Code 
aims at the protection of the child, whether such a child is a victim of an offense, a 
perpetrator of an offense, or a child in a difficult situation. As regards criminal justice for 
minors, the reform of the Criminal Procedure Code made it possible to record important 
headway as regards the protection of the best interests of the child, in conformity with the 
measures and guarantees stated under Article  3.1 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, particularly thanks to the increase of the age of criminal responsibility to eighteen 
years, the establishment of a judge in charge of sentence enforcement  specialized in 
minors, replacement of police custody by the measure of retention of minors, legal 
assistance, the introduction of the system of release on probation and the reduction of the 
duration of prison sentences applicable to minors. Moreover, the Criminal Procedure Code 
contains exclusive provisions for children in conflict with the law, intended to adapt the 
functioning of justice to children.  
</p>
<p>87. Concurrently, the Mohammed VI Foundation for the Reintegration of Prisoners, 
strongly contributed, within the framework of partnerships with the ministries concerned 
and other public, associative and private actors, to the improvement of the conditions of 
reception and care for the children placed in CSE, and their family, school and socio-
professional reintegration. Several infrastructures were upgraded; the socio-educational 
programs were improved through the installation of adequate equipment and staff training. 
</p>
<p>  
 36 Para. 60 of SRT Report 
 37 393 children in difficult situation (abandoned children, children on the street, young mothers), and 
</p>
<p>349 children in conflict with the law (having committed offenses against people, property, security 
and public life). 110 children are less than 12 years, 216 children from 12 to 14 years, 214 children 
from 14 to 16 years, and 202 children from 16 to 18 years; 468 boys (63%) and 274 girls (37%) </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>The centers opened onto their environment: a good number of children attend school 
courses or trainings in external public or private institutions; spaces for parents were set up 
in certain centers in order to consolidate family ties. 
</p>
<p>88. Concerning credible information about corporal punishments which would have 
been inflicted by a staff member of the CSE visited by the Special Rapporteur, the 
Moroccan authorities recall, as reported, that an inquiry was indeed opened whose results 
are under examination by the competent authorities. 
</p>
<p>89. In addition, the Moroccan authorities recall that the Kingdom of Morocco signed, on 
the 28th of February 2012, the 3rd Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, which establishes a procedure of communications. Once ratified, it will allow the 
children victims of violations of their rights to have access to international  recourses. 
</p>
<p><i> 4.2.2 Terrorism 
</i></p>
<p>90. Concerning the allegation reported by the SRT according to which ill-treatments 
would be systematic during the arrest and detention in cases of terrorism and offenses 
against national security, and that the registration of suspects is delayed before being 
presented to a judge, the Moroccan authorities consider that this assessment should have 
been moderate. Act n&#176;35-11 of October 17th, 2011 amending the Criminal Procedure Code 
came to considerably reinforce the guarantees of people suspected of offenses, including 
terrorist infringements. Like common law cases, the people arrested in cases of terrorism or 
offenses against state security are subjected to identical treatment in conformity with the 
regulations of the Criminal Code and Penal Procedure in force according to the types of 
offenses and related sentences. 
</p>
<p><i> 4.2.3 Migrants 
</i></p>
<p>91. Beyond the very serious allegations reported on migrants (see para. 63), the 
Moroccan authorities maintain in general that, for the issue of migrants in Morocco, no 
reference was made in the report to the challenges and constraints facing the Kingdom of 
Morocco as regards the management of the migration phenomenon, on the one hand, and 
the efforts made by the authorities in terms of protection, repatriation methods, and 
voluntary return operations, which were exposed by the authorities during the visit, on the 
other hand. 
</p>
<p>92. Measures of expulsion from the national territory for irregular stay in Morocco 
(Article 21 of Act 02-03) applies only within the framework of the measures of escorting to 
the border by an individual and justified decision of the administration, as a legal act 
supported by all the legal and procedural guarantees (Article 23).  
</p>
<p>93. In the legal sense of the term, the measure of escorting to the border is to be 
dissociated from the measure of expulsion, which has the character of an exceptional 
measure, and can be rendered against foreign people whose presence in the national 
territory constitutes a serious threat to state security, safety or public order (Articles 25 and 
27 of Act 02-03). It should be noted that the land borders of Morocco with Algeria are long 
and constitute the infiltration point of almost all foreign candidates to irregular 
immigration. The borders with Mauritania are also long, but do not represent a major 
challenge regarding the issue of migration, taking into account the limited number of 
attempts at illegally crossing this border. 
</p>
<p>94. Escorting migrants back to the border, ensuring the respect of dignity and human 
rights of the migrant subjected to a legal measure of escorting to the border, as well as the 
rights of defense, particularly with regard to the exhaustion of the possibilities of appeal 
against the decision of removal, is carried out by the transport of the migrant to the last 
point of his/her irregular entry to the national territory.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>95. The protection of physical integrity, basic rights and dignity of migrants in Morocco, 
independently of their situation of stay and their nationality, is a central objective of the 
National Strategy for the Fight against Human Trafficking. Also, for the operational 
implementation of this strategy, stress is particularly laid on the humanitarian dimension 
giving consideration to the rights of the people concerned, first as victims of trafficking 
networks, in accordance with applicable international conventions in this regard, and 
secondly within the framework of a close cooperation with specialized international 
agencies, namely the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the High 
Commissioner for Refugees  (UNHCR) as well as the authorities of the migrants&#8217; countries 
</p>
<p>of origin. 
</p>
<p>96. In general, within the framework of a humanized management of migration 
problems, the National Strategy for the Fight against Human Trafficking encourages the 
facilitation and organization of assisted voluntary return of  undocumented migrants to their 
countries of origin, by air, in coordination with the diplomatic and consular services of the 
countries concerned, and the office of the IOM in Rabat. Thus, since 2004 to date, more 
than 11.000 migrants extirpated from the networks of human trafficking benefited from this 
massive program. In other cases, though with an irregular status, the integration of people 
in the Moroccan society was facilitated, insofar as many people, candidates to irregular 
immigration intending to reach Europe, now prefer to remain and settle down in Morocco. 
</p>
<p>97. Local or international NGOs working in the field of the protection of the rights of 
migrants in Morocco are very active.  The organization of Doctors without Borders (MSF) 
has recently noted the improvement of the situation particularly in terms of access to health 
care and hospitals, especially in the areas with strong migratory flow (Nador, Oujda&#8230;). 
</p>
<p><i> 4.2.4 Management of demonstrations 
</i></p>
<p>98. The law enforcement forces of the Kingdom make remarkable and continuous 
efforts as to the rational management of demonstrations in the context characterized by 
extended areas of freedom as well as socio-economic constraints and difficulties. In 
general, the Moroccan authorities point out, concerning the demonstrations organized by 
the February 20th Movement during the year 2011, that most of them were not authorized 
by the local authorities which are supposed to deliver a prior authorization in this 
connection. These demonstrations, nevertheless, were tolerated by the public authorities 
insofar as they arose in a particular context and they were peaceful demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>99. The use of force constitutes the exception rather than the rule as regards the 
management of demonstrations in public space. When these forces intervene, as a general 
rule, law enforcement action is conducted strictly within the law. In fact, Act N&#176; 72-00 of 
July 23rd ,2002 on public gatherings, regulates strictly and precisely the resort to force to 
disperse gatherings in public space. In addition, the Penal Code allows law enforcement 
agents to intervene whenever the law is not respected (unauthorized demonstrations, 
damaging public property, infringement of law and order, etc&#8230;). 
</p>
<p>100. Law enforcement agents in these cases issue warnings, and in the event of refusal, 
they are legally obliged to use force to restore order. In this case, they operate with 
restraint, in accordance with the principle of proportionality.  
</p>
<p>101. The follow-up of the situation and the figures regarding the management of 
demonstrations make it possible to characterize the suitable reaction on the part of the 
authorities as well as the professionalism of security services: more than 40.000 major 
manifestations were organized nationwide between 2011 and 2012 mobilizing nearly 2 
million and half people. Only less than 1% of the interventions involved restoring order by 
the use of force, for which strict instructions were each time given to guarantee of 
proportionate, adequate and restrained use of force. No fire arms were used, contrary to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>what is implied in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment of the situation, and no human life 
</p>
<p>was lost related to this specific context, in spite of the allegations stated in this regard, nor 
was there any case of torture proven with respect to demonstrators. 
</p>
<p>102. Concerning particularly the allegation that the authorities resort to &#8220;excessive use of 
force in repressing demonstrations and in arresting protestors or persons suspected of 
participating in demonstrations calling for self-determination of the Sahrawi population&#8221; 
and that &#8220;during the transport to or upon arrival at the police station arrestees are beaten, 
</p>
<p>insulted and forced to reveal the names of other protestors&#8221;, the Moroccan authorities recall 
that unauthorized demonstrations in the southern provinces are managed in the same 
manner as those which are held in the other regions of Morocco as described above. 
</p>
<p><i> 4.2.5 Trial relating to the events of Gdeim Izik 
</i></p>
<p>103. Concerning the trial of persons within the framework of the events relating to the 
dismantling of the Gdeim Izik camp in November 2010, and to the statement that &#8220;the 24 
</p>
<p>Sahrawi civilians are being tried before a military court for their alleged role in the violent 
clashes&#8221;38, the Moroccan authorities state that these people are not sued &#8220;for their alleged 
</p>
<p>role in the violent clashes&#8221; but for very precise criminal charges in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>provisions of the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>104. The competence of the Military Tribunal for the crimes with which these people are 
charged is perfectly in conformity with the national legislation in force and international 
standards in this regard. Indeed, Article 3 of the Military Code of Justice stipulates in its 
Subparagraph 4 that any person, whatever their status, who commits a crime against the 
members of the Royal Armed Forces and similar forces shall be tried before the Permanent 
Court of Armed forces. 
</p>
<p>105. In addition, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights does not 
prohibit the trial of civilians by military or special tribunals39. For this reason, the 
Committee of Human Rights strives to make sure that such trials fully comply with the 
regulations of Article 14 of the Covenant and that the guarantees under this Article are 
neither limited nor modified by the military or exceptional character of the court in 
question. 
</p>
<p>106. In this specific case, the Moroccan authorities maintain that the Permanent Court of 
Armed Forces is not an exceptional court, but rather a specialized court, chaired by a civil 
magistrate assisted by a jury of four assessors. As a specialized court, established by the 
law, it has full jurisdiction. It is   integrated in the Moroccan legal system. It is subjected, 
like other courts of the Kingdom, to the principles and standards of procedure as recognized 
at the international level, offering all the guarantees of a fair trial with the explicit 
possibility stipulated under Article 109 of the Code of Military Justice to appeal to the 
Court of Cassation. 
</p>
<p>107. Moreover, the proceedings of the trial, which began on February 1st, 2013, confirm 
the respect of the standards and norms of a fair and impartial trial. Indeed, the hearings 
were public and were attended by many national and international observers (Defenders of 
human rights, members of Parliament, CNDH, representatives of foreign diplomatic 
missions, national and international journalists); the translation of the debates was ensured 
in various languages by several interpreters. The rights of defense were fully guaranteed, 
and the witnesses were heard.

</p>
<p>108. Concerning the allegations of torture, it should be noted that neither the defendants 
nor their lawyers, who accompanied them before the investigating judge, have at any time 
requested to resort to a medical examination to determine the truthfulness of their 
assertions, knowing that Article 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code requires the 
investigating judge to take action in the event that he should note indices, or upon the 
initiative of the defendant himself, or the defense. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Recommendations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>109. The Moroccan authorities thank the Special Rapporteur for all the recommendations 
made, which lie within the scope of the global process of reforms. Nevertheless, certain 
recommendations call for comments and remarks, which the Moroccan authorities wish to 
express within the framework of the continuous interactive dialogue with the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>110. Concerning the <b>recommendations which lie within the scope of the overall 
process of reforms</b>, most of them are already implemented by the Moroccan authorities, 
particularly the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; consultation of all the stakeholders within the framework of the establishment of a 
NPM when the ratification of OP-CAT is completed; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; reinforcement of cooperation between the State and civil society;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; taking account of the particular categories of vulnerable people to be protected 
(women, minors, migrants, people suffering from mental diseases);  
</p>
<p>&#8226; efforts to reduce prison overpopulation and the general improvement of detention 
conditions, as well as the continuous efforts as regards prison policy; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; reinforcement of judicial or extra-judicial control of various detention sites; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; training and sensitizing law enforcement personnel with regard to the prevention of 
torture and any form of ill-treatment; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; reinforcement of capacities as regards legal medicine. 
</p>
<p>111. The recommendations below also lie within the scope of the structuring reforms and 
strategic projects initiated by the Kingdom of Morocco: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; reform of the penal system on the basis of a new criminal policy as regards 
incriminations, sanctions, liabilitiy and guarantees of fair trial, taking account of the 
provisions of the new Constitution and the international standards of human rights;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; reinforcement of good Security Governance on the basis of the provisions of the new 
Constitution relating to fundamental rights and liberties; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; consolidation of responsibilities and reinforcement of resources for all national 
mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights, including in the field 
of the eradication of torture and any form of ill-treatments. 
</p>
<p>112. Concerning the recommendations which call for observations from the Moroccan 
authorities, while remaining within the framework of the overall process of reforms, it is 
worth mentioning that regarding :  
</p>
<p>&#8226; the recommendation relating to the practice of solitary confinement and secret 
detention (N&#176;88-c), the Moroccan authorities maintain that the disciplinary measures 
are not incompatible with Article 23 of the Constitution, as long as these measures 
guarantee the safety of the person and/or they have an educational objective. 
However, it is currently planned to modify the legislative measures relating to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>disciplinary actions imposed by the prison authorities against detainees, in order to 
decrease the maximum period of placement in disciplinary cell. In addition, there is 
no secret detention in Morocco. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the recommendation relating to the prosecution meeting the burden of proof with 
regard to the report established by the judicial police (N&#176;88-e) and the establishment 
of an independent mechanism of criminal investigation and lawsuits which would 
not have any link with the body in charge of investigation or lawsuits (N&#176;88-g), it 
should be noted that the Moroccan penal system is based on the principles of oral-
hearings and adversarial  system, and that within this framework, the burden of 
proof rests with the applicant. In addition, this system hinges on the principle of the 
appropriateness of lawsuits, whereby the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office remains the body in 
charge of following up the investigations and/or lawsuits. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; the recommendation relating to the legal proceedings about all the cases of 
violations committed in the past (88-j), it should be recalled that the IER was 
designed as an extra-judicial transitional justice mechanism to determine the liability 
of  the State and its bodies, rather than individual liability, in a spirit of 
consolidation of reforms and reconciliation. This process by no means excluded the 
right of victims, their families or beneficiaries to take legal action. 
</p>
<p>113. Concerning paragraph N&#176;97: 
</p>
<p>It should be recalled first of all that all the positive developments noted by the Special 
Rapporteur, as to both the normative framework and public policies as regards human 
rights in Morocco, relate to the entire set of regions of the Kingdom. Indeed, the 
reinforcement of institutions in charge of the promotion of human rights and the 
commitment to building an institutional culture of human rights, which makes it possible to 
prevent and prohibit torture and ill-treatments are also valid for all the regions of the 
Kingdom. All the recommendations contained in paragraph 97 refer to actions already 
started by the Moroccan Government, which the authorities are committed to continuing 
and consolidating. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regarding the recommendation relating to the investigations of torture and ill-
treatments  allegations, before and after demonstrations and in the prison of 
Laayoune (97-a), the Moroccan authorities recall that whenever allegations of 
torture or ill treatments are raised and submitted to the authorities concerned, the 
latter conduct the necessary investigations systematically, appropriately and as soon 
as possible. As for the demonstrations organized in the Southern Provinces, they are 
subjected to the same rules as those organized elsewhere in the country. Also, and 
for the purpose of preserving law and order, the Moroccan legislator allows the use 
of force for the dispersion of any demonstration which would constitute a threat to 
public safety. However, the authorities ensure that any resort to the use of force must 
be at the same time necessary and proportional to the seriousness of the situation. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regarding the recommendation on the jurisdiction of the military tribunal to 
reconsider over civilians (N&#176;97-b), the Moroccan authorities recall that the 
Permanent Court of Armed forces is not an exceptional court strictly speaking, but a 
specialized  court, chaired by a civil magistrate assisted by a jury of four assessors . 
As a specialized court, established by the law, it enjoys full jurisdiction. It is 
integrated in the Moroccan legal system. It is subjected, like the other courts of the 
Kingdom, to the principles and standards of procedure as recognized at the 
international level, ensuring all the guarantees of a fair trial with the explicit 
possibility under Article 109 of the Code of Military Justice to appeal to the Court of 
Cassation. Concerning the opening of impartial investigations to establish the facts 
in this case, it is necessary to point out that a parliamentary inquiry was opened </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>shortly after the events. In addition, CCDH as well as many national and foreign 
NGOs carried out missions of investigation into this matter. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regarding the recommendation relating to the reinforcement of  means for the 
protection of internationally recognized human rights (N&#176;97-c), the Moroccan 
authorities recall that the Kingdom of Morocco has already committedly opened up, 
with no reservations or restrictions, to the Special Procedures of the UN Human 
Rights Council. This opening-up was confirmed by a letter addressed by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation to the High-Commissioner for Human 
Rights. In this respect, it should be recalled that the Security Council was pleased in 
its Resolution 2044 of April 24th, 2012 about the measures which Morocco took to 
honour its commitment of ensuring access without reservation or restrictions for all 
mandate holders of  the UN Human Rights Council the Special Procedures.  
</p>
<p>Within this framework, three Special Procedures visited Morocco in one year, from 
September 2011 to September 2012 (the Independent Expert in the Field of Cultural Rights, 
the Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law  and in practice, 
and the Special Rapporteur on Torture), which is a very high average at the international 
level. Moreover, the Kingdom has just addressed an invitation to the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, Especially in 
Women and Children, for the year 2013. It also contacted two other Special Procedures 
(water and suitable housing) who expressed their regrets for not being able to pay a visit to 
Morocco in 2013, due to their heavy schedule.  
</p>
<p>In addition, several NGOs visited the Southern Provinces in recent years on different 
occasions, particularly Human Rights Watch in 2008, Amnesty International in 2011, and 
2012, Frontline Defenders, the Kennedy Center for Human Rights and Justice, the 
Leadership Council for Human Rights, as well as the International Women's Media 
Foundation. As for the NGOs present in the  southern provinces, it should be noted that 
their number is highly significant. The civil society in this area is very active and takes part 
in many international activities, especially the sessions of the Human Rights Council in 
Geneva. CNDH, through its two regional commissions, and the local and national 
authorities, moreover, are fully engaged with associations in the area through various 
mechanisms and programs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Regarding the recommendation relating to the proposal that the entire area would 
benefit from the establishment of an intergovernmental regional mechanism (N&#176; 97-
d), the Moroccan authorities   recall, as the Special Rapporteur recognized it in his 
report, that the continuous reinforcement of the national mechanisms of the 
protection and promotion of human rights on the one hand, and the constructive, 
active and positive interaction with the United Nations Special Procedures on the 
other hand, represent the unique means to ensure the best guarantee for the respect 
of human rights in general and the fight against torture in particular over the entire 
national territory. The resort to any other means is politically unacceptable, legally 
inappropriate and operationally ineffective. In addition, it should be recalled that 
Morocco is already engaged in a process of establishing a national mechanism for 
the prevention of torture under the terms of OP-CAT. 
</p>
<p>Finally, Morocco remains open, in consultation with the other States of the region, to 
initiate any reflection aiming at introducing a regional, Arab or Maghrebian, 
intergovernmental mechanism of human rights protection and promotion, following the 
example of other experiences of regional, European or inter-American, systems, in the field 
of the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.5

</p>
<p><b> III.  Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>114. The Kingdom of Morocco is committed in a strategic and irreversible way to the 
respect and promotion of human rights. For this reason, its opening up to the entire set of 
U.N. mechanisms, including the Special Procedures, determines the approach that 
authorities intend to adopt in implementing the recommendations. The Moroccan 
authorities are currently finalizing an Action Plan for the implementation of the 
recommendations issued by all U.N. human rights mechanisms. In addition, the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur to Morocco made it possible to give a new momentum to the national 
efforts concerning the issues relating to the eradication and prevention of torture. 
</p>
<p>  The National Action Plan  
</p>
<p>115. Following the periodic examination before the Committee Against Torture in 
November 2011, and the Universal Periodic Review in May 2012, the Inter-ministerial 
Delegation for Human Rights, in close coordination with all the Government departments 
and National Institutions concerned, elaborated a National Action Plan for the 
implementation of the recommendations issued by all U.N. human rights mechanisms , in 
order to allow for a rational, coherent and comprehensive implementation of these 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>  The measures taken since the visit of the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>116. Aware of the importance of the issues relating to detention and deprivation of liberty 
conditions in the broad sense, the Moroccan authorities continued the efforts as regards the 
improvement of detention conditions, knowing that the visit of the Special Rapporteur 
contributed to reinforcing this momentum.  
</p>
<p>117. Thus as regards the modernization and renovation of custody places, and taking 
account of the preliminary observations of the Special Rapporteur during his visit to 
Morocco, more efforts were deployed in order to sustain and generalize modernization and 
renovation in order to continue the improvement of detention conditions. In recent months, 
the generalized program for the development and upgrade of custody places of DGSN was 
extended and concern today 81% of these buildings; the projects concerning the other 
buildings are being completed. In addition, out of 133 commands in the country, 101 rooms 
for lawyer visits have been arranged to date, as well as 110 spaces specifically dedicated to 
minors. 
</p>
<p>118. Within the framework of the preparation of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, 
several awareness and information days on international instruments and mechanisms for 
the protection of human rights were organized involving the Government departments and 
national institutions concerned, namely the Interior Ministry , for law enforcement agents, 
including Royal Gendarmerie, taking into consideration the detention places under the 
responsibility of judicial police, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, taking into consideration 
the Centers of child protection, DGAPR taking into consideration prisons, DIDH within the 
framework of its missions of Inter-miniterial coordination of the Government&#8217;s policy in 
the field of human rights, and also CNDH taking into consideration its responsibility as 
regards visits to the places in question. The interactivity between the various parties 
continued beyond the visit of the Special Rapporteur and was reinforced by the publication 
of the reports of CNDH and the results of the visit of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>119. The Moroccan authorities will communicate to the Special Rapporteur a progress 
report on the implementation of the recommendations within the framework of its positive 
and constructive interaction with the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.
