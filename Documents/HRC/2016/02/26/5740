Complementary Standards, with a mandate to elaborate, as a matter of priority and necessity, 
complementary standards in the form of either a convention or additional protocol(s) to the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, filling the 
existing gaps in the Convention and also providing new normative standards aimed at combating 
all forms of contemporary racism, including incitement to racial and religious hatred,

would be no renegotiation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, </p>

parts of the first session of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the 
Elaboration of Complementary Standards to the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and expressing the collective desire of the international 
human rights system and the need to enhance the momentum of this process with a view to 
ensuring the timely fulfilment of the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the need for an international human rights regime that provides adequate 
protection for victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as 
well as appropriate remedies while combating all forms of impunity in this regard, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Endorses </i>the road map adopted by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights 
Council on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards during the second part of its first 
session as a guiding framework document for all future work in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the Chairperson-Rapporteur to ensure that a draft text is circulated in a 
timely manner to all stakeholders, consistent with the said road map, in order to engage in the 
elaboration of complementary standards to the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination from the second session onwards; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides</i> that all future sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee shall be convened in a 
consolidated period of 10 consecutive working days;
