<p><b>Resolution 7/1.  Human rights violations emanating from Israeli military 
attacks and incursions in the Occupied Palestinian 
territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied 
Gaza Strip 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also </i>by the rights of all peoples to self-determination and the 
</p>
<p>inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by the use of force, as enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming </i>the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming also </i>the applicability of international human rights law to the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that the Israeli military attacks and incursions in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied Gaza Strip, 
</p>
<p>constitute violations of international humanitarian law and of the human rights of the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian people therein and undermine international efforts, including the 
</p>
<p>Annapolis Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian State, aimed at invigorating the peace process and establishing a viable, 
</p>
<p>contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State by the end of 2008, 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><i>Recognizing also </i>that the recent Israeli attacks and incursions in the occupied 
</p>
<p>Gaza Strip have led to a considerable loss of life and injuries among Palestinian 
</p>
<p>civilians, including women, children and infants, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Condemns </i>the persistent Israeli military attacks and incursions in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied Gaza Strip, 
</p>
<p>which resulted in the loss of more than 125 lives and hundreds of injuries among 
</p>
<p>Palestinian civilians, including women, children and infants; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Expresses </i>its shock at the Israeli bombardment of Palestinian homes and the 
</p>
<p>killing of civilians therein and at the Israeli policy of inflicting collective punishment 
</p>
<p>against the civilian population, which is contrary to international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>and calls for bringing the perpetrators to justice; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls for </i>the immediate cessation of all Israeli military attacks throughout 
</p>
<p>the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the firing of crude rockets, which resulted in 
</p>
<p>the loss of two civilian lives and some injuries in southern Israel; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also calls for </i>urgent international action to put an immediate end to the 
</p>
<p>grave violations committed by the occupying Power, Israel, in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including the series of incessant and repeated Israeli military 
</p>
<p>attacks and incursions therein and the siege of the occupied Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Reiterates </i>its calls for immediate protection of the Palestinian people in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory in compliance with international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Urges </i>all parties concerned to respect the rules of international human rights 
</p>
<p>law and international humanitarian law and to refrain from violence against civilian 
</p>
<p>populations; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>report to the Council, at its next session, on the progress made in the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the present resolution. </p>
