DIRECTORS’ REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
 
The  Directors  present  their  report  on  the  consolidated  entity  (referred  to  hereafter  as  the  Group)  consisting  of  Jindalee 
Resources Limited and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during the year ended 30 June 2016. 
 
Directors 
 
The following persons were directors of Jindalee Resources Limited during the whole of the financial year and up to the date 
of this report unless noted otherwise: 
 
Lindsay Dudfield    
Justin Mannolini  
Patricia Farr 
 
Principal activities 
 
The principal activity during the year of Jindalee Resources Limited was mineral exploration.  During the year there was no 
change in the nature of this activity. 
 
Financial results 
 
The consolidated loss of the Group after providing for income tax for the year ended 30 June 2016 was $1,056,621 (2015: 
loss $609,984). 
 
Dividends 
 
No dividends have been declared since the end of the previous financial year and no dividends have been recommended by 
the Directors. 
 
Significant changes in the state of affairs 
 
During the year there has been no significant change in the state of affairs of the Group. 
 
Operations and financial review 
 
The principal activity of the Group is mineral exploration. The Group holds interests in tenements in Tasmania prospective 
for magnesite and in Western Australia for gold, diamonds, base metals and iron ore, both wholly owned and through joint 
ventures where the Group’s interests are mostly free carried to completion of a Bankable Feasibility Study.  The Group also 
has indirect interests in uranium, gold and base metals through investee companies. 
 
In line with the Company’s business strategy, during the period management also evaluated numerous advanced projects in 
both Australia and overseas, with a view to securing an opportunity capable of growing the Group and creating wealth for 
Shareholders, and this continues to be our primary focus. 
 
The net assets of the Group have fallen by $1,033,921 from $6,809,453 at 30 June 2015 to $5,775,532 at 30 June 2016 
principally due to changes in the market value of available for sale financial assets.  
 
The Directors believe the Group is in a strong financial position to continue its exploration endeavours.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Events since the end of the financial year 
 
On 30 June 2016 the Company announced to the ASX changes to its board structure effective 1 July 2016, with Lindsay 
Dudfield  stepping  down  as  Executive  Chairman  and  continuing  in  the  role  of  Managing  Director  and  Non-Executive 
Director Justin Mannolini assuming the position of Non-Executive Chairman.   
 
Other than the matter outlined above, there has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of 
this report any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the Directors, to affect 
significantly the operations, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in future financial years. 
 
Likely developments and expected results of operations 
 
The Directors are not  aware of any developments that  might have a  significant  effect on the  operations of the Group  in 
subsequent financial years not already disclosed in this report. 
 
Environmental regulation 
 
The Group is subject to significant environmental regulation in respect of its exploration activities.  Tenements in Western 
Australia  are  granted  subject  to  adherence  to  environmental  conditions  with  strict  controls  on  clearing,  including  a 
prohibition on the use of mechanised equipment or development without the approval of the relevant government agencies, 
and with rehabilitation required on completion of exploration activities. These regulations are controlled by the Department 
of Mines and Petroleum. 
 
Jindalee Resources Limited conducts its exploration activities in an environmentally sensitive manner and the Group is not 
aware of any breach of statutory conditions or obligations. 
 
Greenhouse gas and energy data reporting requirements 
 
The  Directors  have  considered  compliance  with  both  the  Energy  Efficiency  Opportunity  Act  2006  and  the  National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 which requires entities to report annual greenhouse gas emissions and energy 
use.  The  Directors  have  assessed  that  there  are  no  current  reporting  requirements  for  the  period  ended  30  June  2016, 
however reporting requirements may change in the future.

As at the date of this report, the Group did not have an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Board considers 
that  due  to  the  Group’s  size,  an  Audit  Committee’s  functions  and  responsibilities  can  be  adequately  and  efficiently 
discharged by the Board as a whole, operating in accordance with the Group’s mechanisms designed to ensure independent 
judgement in decision making. 
 
Retirement, election and continuation in office of directors 
 
Mr  Justin  Mannolini  is  the  director  retiring  by  rotation  who,  being  eligible,  may  offer  himself  for  re-election  at  Annual 
General Meeting. 
   
AUDITED REMUNERATION REPORT 
 
The  directors  are  pleased  to  present  Jindalee  Resources  Limited  2016  remuneration  report  which  sets  out  remuneration 
information for the Company’s non-executive directors, executive directors and other key management personnel. 
 
The report contains the following sections:

(b) 
 
The Company does not have a formal remuneration policy and has not established a separate remuneration committee. Due 
to the early stage of development and small size of the Company a separate remuneration committee was not considered to 
add  any  efficiency  to  the process of  determining  the  levels  of  remuneration for directors  and key  executives. The  Board 
considers that it is more appropriate to set aside time at a Board meeting each year to specifically address matters that would 
ordinarily  fall  to  a  remuneration  committee  such  as  reviewing  remuneration,  recruitment,  retention  and  termination 
procedures and evaluating senior executives remuneration packages and incentives.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
In addition, all matters of remuneration will continue to be in accordance with the Corporations Act requirement, especially 
with regard to related party transactions. That is, none of the directors participate in any deliberations regarding their own 
remuneration or related issues. 
 
Independent external advice is sought from remuneration consultants when required, however no advice has been sought 
during the period ended 30 June 2016. 
 
The Corporate Governance Statement provides further information on the Company’s remuneration governance. 
 
(c) 
 
In determining executive remuneration, the Board aims to ensure that remuneration practices are:
Executive remuneration policy and framework
  Competitive and reasonable, enabling the Company to attract and retain key talent 
  Aligned to the Company’s strategic and business objectives and the creation of shareholder value 
  Transparent and easily understood, and 
  Acceptable to shareholders.
Relationship between remuneration and the Group’s performance
All executives receive consulting fees or a salary, part of which may be taken as superannuation, and from time to time, 
options.    Options  issued  to  directors  are  subject  to  approval  by  Shareholders.    The  Board  reviews  executive  packages 
annually  by  reference  to  the executive’s performance  and  comparable  information  from  industry  sectors  and other  listed 
companies in similar industries. 
 
Board  members  are  allocated  superannuation  guarantee  contributions  as  required  by  law,  and  do  not  receive  any  other 
retirement benefits.  From time to time, some individuals may choose to sacrifice their salary or consulting fees to increase 
payments towards superannuation. 
 
All remuneration paid to directors and specified executives is valued at the cost to the Group and expensed.  Options are 
valued using the Black-Scholes methodology. 
 
(d) 
 
The policy setting the terms and conditions for the executive directors, was developed and approved by the Board and is 
considered appropriate for the current exploration phase of the Group’s development.  Emoluments of Directors are set by 
reference to payments made by other companies of similar size and industry, and by reference to the skills and experience of 
directors.    Fees  paid  to  directors  are  not  linked  to  the  performance  of  the  Group.    This  policy  may  change  once  the 
exploration phase is complete and the Company is generating revenue.  At present the existing remuneration policy is not 
impacted by the Group’s performance including earnings and changes in shareholder wealth (dividends, changes in share 
price or returns of capital to shareholders).  The Board has not set short term performance indicators, such as movements in 
the  Company’s  share  price,  for  the  determination  of  director  emoluments  as  the  Board  believes  this  may  encourage 
performance  which  is  not  in  the  long  term  interests  of  the  Company  and  its  shareholders.    The  Board  has  structured  its 
remuneration arrangements in such a way it believes is in the best interests of building shareholder wealth in the longer term.  
The Board believes participation in the Company’s Employee Share Option Plan motivates key management and executives 
with the long term interests of shareholders.

such information with regards to Company dealings directly to the Company Secretary promptly to allow the Company to notify the ASX within the required reporting 
timeframes.

NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JINDALEE RESOURCES LIMITED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Principles of Consolidation
Basis of Preparation/Accounting
(c)  
 
The financial statements have been prepared on an accruals basis and is based on historical costs and does not take into 
account changing money values or, except where stated, current valuations of non-current assets. Cost is based on the fair 
values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. 
 
In  applying IFRS, management is required to  make  judgements, estimates  and assumptions that affect the application of 
accounting  policies  and  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  income  and  expenses.    The  estimates  and  associated 
assumptions  are  based  on  historical  experience  and  various  other  factors  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
The  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.    Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are 
recognised  in  the  period  in  which  the  estimate  is  revised  if  the  revision  affects  only  that  period,  or  in  the  period  of  the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
 
Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which ensures that the resulting financial information satisfies the 
concepts of relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events is 
reported.  These accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the period. 
 
The  significant  accounting  policies  set  out  below  have  been  applied  in  the  preparation  and  presentation  of  the  financial 
statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 and the comparative information. 
 
(d) 
 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary of Jindalee Resources Limited 
(“Company” or  “Parent Entity”)  as at 30  June 2016  and the results of all  subsidiaries for the  year then ended.   Jindalee 
Resources Limited and its subsidiary together are referred to in the financial statements as the Group or consolidated entity. 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial 
and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights.  The existence and 
effect  of  potential  voting  rights  that  are  currently  exercisable  or  convertible  are  considered  when  assessing  whether  the 
Group controls another entity. 
 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.  They are de-consolidated 
from the date that control ceases. 
 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. 
 
Intercompany  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on  transactions  between  Group  companies  are  eliminated.  
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred.  
Accounting  policies  of  subsidiaries  are  changed  where  necessary  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  policies  adopted  by  the 
Group. 
 
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of financial position respectively. 
Investments  in  subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  at  cost  in  the  parent  entity  information  disclosures  of  Jindalee  Resources 
Limited. 
 
Changes in ownership interests 
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity 
owners  of  the  Group.    A  change  in  ownership  interest  results  in  an  adjustment  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  the 
controlling  and  non-controlling  interests  to  reflect  their  relative  interests  in  the  subsidiary.    Any  difference  between  the 
amount  of  the  adjustment  to  non-controlling  interests  and  any  consideration  paid or  received  is  recognised  in  a  separate 
reserve within equity attributable to owners of Jindalee Resources Limited. 
When  the  Group  ceases  to  have  control,  joint  control  or  significant  influence,  any  retained  interest  in  the  entity  is 
remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.  The fair value is the initial

carrying  amount  for  the  purposes  of  subsequently  accounting  for  the  retained  interest  as  an  associate,  jointly  controlled 
entity or financial asset.  In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that 
entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.  This may mean that the 
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. 
 
If the ownership interest in a jointly-controlled entity or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is 
retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to 
profit or loss where appropriate. 
 
(e) 
 
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, and deposits repayable on 
demand with a financial institution.  The cash and cash equivalents balance primarily consists of funds on term deposit with 
original  maturity  at  time  of  purchase of  three  months or  less  that  are  readily  convertible  to  known amounts  of  cash and 
which are subject to minimal risk of changes in value. 
 
(f) 
 
Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for doubtful 
debts.  Current receivables for GST are due for settlement within 30 days and other current receivables within 12 months.  
Cash  on  deposit  in  respect  of  environmental  bonds  is  not  due  for  settlement  until  rights  of  tenure  are  forfeited  or 
performance obligations are met. 
 
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Debts which are known to be uncollectible are written 
off by reducing the carrying amount directly.  An allowance account (provision for doubtful debts) is used when there is 
objective  evidence  that  the  Group  will  not  be  able  to  collect  all  amounts  due  according  to  the  original  terms  of  the 
receivables.   Significant  financial  difficulties  of  the  debtor,  probability  that  the  debtor  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  financial 
reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade 
receivable is impaired.  The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.  Cash flows relating to 
short-term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. 
 
The amount of the impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income within 
other expenses.  When a trade receivable for which an impairment allowance had been recognised becomes uncollectible in 
a subsequent period, it is written off against the allowance account.  Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited against other expenses in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
 
(g) 
 
Interest revenue is recognised on a proportional basis taking into account the interest rates applicable to the financial assets. 
All revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax. 
 
Revenue in relation to joint venture agreements is recognised over the period the services are rendered.  Revenue from the 
sale of investments is recorded when all risks and rewards relating to the assets are posted to the third party. 
 
(h) 
 
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
 
Depreciation is calculated using the diminishing value and prime cost methods and is brought to account over the estimated 
economic lives of all property, plant and equipment.  The rates used are based on the useful life of the assets and range from 
10% to 40%.   
 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. 
 
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount.

JINDALEE RESOURCES LIMITED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Impairment of Assets
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each reporting date. 
 
(i) 
 
The  Group  assesses  at  each  reporting  date  whether  there  is  an  indication  that  an  asset  may  be  impaired.    If  any  such 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount.  An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is 
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets and the asset’s values in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value.  In such cases 
the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs.  When the carrying amount of an 
asset or cash-generating unit exceeds it’s recoverable amount, the asset or cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is 
written down to its recoverable amount. 
 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  Impairment losses 
relating  to  continuing operations  are  recognised  in  those  expense  categories  consistent with  the function of  the  impaired 
asset unless the asset is carried at revalued amount (in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease). 
As  assessment  is  also  made  at  each  reporting  date  as  to  whether  there  is  any  indication  that  previously  recognised 
impairment  losses  may  no  longer  exist  or  may  have  decreased.    If  such  indication  exists,  the  recoverable  amount  is 
estimated.  A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the  asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment  loss was recognised.   If that is the case  the carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.  That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had the impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.  Such 
reversal is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at the revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated 
as a revaluation increase.  After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s 
revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 
 
(j) 
 
The  Groups policy  with  regards  to  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure,  including  the  costs  of  acquiring  licences  and 
permits, are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets on an area of interest basis.  Under this method exploration and 
evaluation expenditure is carried forward on the following basis:
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure
i)  Each  area  of  interest  is  considered  separately  when deciding  whether, and  to  what  extent,  to  carry  forward  or
write off exploration and evaluation costs.
ii)  Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure related  to  an  area  of  interest  is  carried  forward provided  that  rights  to
tenure of the area of interest are current and that one of the following conditions is met:
-
-
such evaluation costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the 
area of interest or alternatively, by its sale; or
exploration and/or evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a 
reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and active and 
significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Trade and Other Payables
Exploration  and  evaluation  costs  accumulated  in  respect  of  each  particular  area  of  interest  include  only  net  direct 
expenditure. 
 
(k) 
 
Trade payables and other payables are carried at cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group 
prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments in 
respect  of  the  purchase  of  these  goods  and  services.    The  amounts  are  unsecured  and  usually  paid  within  30  days  of 
recognition.

Employee Entitlements
(l) 
 
The  Group’s  liability  for  employee  entitlements  arising  from  services  rendered  by  employees  to  reporting  date  are 
recognised  in  other  payables.    Employee  entitlements  expected  to  be  settled  within  one  year  together  with  entitlements 
arising from wages and salaries, and annual leave which will be settled within one year, have been measured at their nominal 
amount and include related on-costs. 
 
The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of 
expected  future  payments  to  be  made  in  respect  of  services  provided  by  employees  up  to  the  reporting  date  using  the 
projected unit credit method.  Consideration is given to the expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee 
departures and periods of service.  Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on 
national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash 
outflows. 
 
(m) 
 
Share based payments 
Under AASB 2 Share Based Payments, the Group must recognise the fair value of options granted to directors, employees 
and consultants as remuneration as an expense on a pro-rata basis over the vesting period in the statement of profit or loss 
and other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to equity.  
  
The  Group  provides  benefits  to  employees  (including  directors)  of  the  Group  in  the  form  of  share  based  payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (“equity-settled transactions”).  
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees (including directors) is measured by reference to fair value at 
the date they are granted. For Options the fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes model. 
 
(n)
Share Based Payment Transactions
Earnings Per Share
(i)  Basic Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing the operating loss attributable to the equity holder of the Group 
after income tax by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial period.
(ii)  Diluted Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in determination of basic earnings per share by taking into account 
amounts unpaid on ordinary shares and any reduction in earnings per share that will arise from the exercise of options 
outstanding during the period.
Contributed Equity
Income Tax and Other Taxes
(o) 
 
Issued and paid up capital is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received by the Group.  Any transaction costs 
arising on the issue of ordinary shares are recognised directly in equity as a reduction of the share proceeds received. 
 
(p) 
 
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from 
or paid to the taxation authorities.  The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or 
substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
 
Deferred income tax is provided on  all temporary  differences  at  the statement of financial  position date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
24
NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JINDALEE RESOURCES LIMITED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except: 
 

When the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss; or 
 
When the taxable temporary difference is associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interests in joint 
ventures,  and  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary  difference  can  be  controlled  and  it  is  probable  that  the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except: 
 

When the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or 
 
When the deductible temporary difference is associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interest in joint 
ventures, in which case a deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary 
difference  will  reverse  in  the  foreseeable  future  and  taxable  profit  will  be  available  against  which  the  temporary 
difference can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer  probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to  allow all  or part of the deferred 
income tax asset to be utilised. 
 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each statement of financial position date and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in profit or loss. 
 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation 
authority. 
 
Goods & Services Tax 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
  Where the  GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not  recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as 
applicable; and
  Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the statement of financial position. 
 
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flow arising from 
investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are classified as operating 
cash flows. 
 
Commitments  and  contingencies  are  disclosed  net  of  the  amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the  taxation 
authority.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
(q) 
 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group and that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. 
 
Accounting for capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure 
The  Group’s  accounting  policy  is  stated  at  Note  2(j).    There  is  some  subjectivity  involved  in  the  carrying  forward  as 
capitalised  or  writing  off  to  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income  exploration  and  evaluation 
expenditure,  however  management  give  due  consideration  to  areas  of  interest  on  a  regular  basis  and  are  confident  that 
decisions to either write off or carry forward such expenditure fairly reflect the prevailing situation. 
 
Share-based payments 
The Group measures share-based payments at fair value at the grant date.  The fair value is determined using a Black-
Scholes model or other valuation technique appropriate for the instrument being valued. 
 
Deferred tax balances 
Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are not recognised in the financial statements as management considers that 
it is currently not probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise those tax losses.  Management reviews 
on a regular basis the future profitability of the group to consider if tax losses should be recognised and to ensure that 
any tax losses recognised will be utilised. 
 
Impairment of available for sale financial assets 
The  Company  determines  an  impairment  loss  on  the  available  for  sale  investments  held  when  there  has  been  a 
significant  or  prolonged  decline  in  fair  value  below  original  cost.  Management  exercises  judgement  in  determining 
what is ‘significant’ or ‘prolonged’ by evaluating, among other factors, whether the decline is outside the normal range 
of  volatility in the asset’s  price, a deterioration  in the financial health of the company whose securities are held, or 
problems with the investee company’s operational or financing cash flows. 
 
(r) 
 
Financial Instruments 
The Group has exposure to interest rate risk which is the risk that the Group’s financial position will be adversely affected 
by movements in interest rates.  Interest rate risk on cash and short term deposits is not considered to be a material risk due 
to the short term nature of these financial instruments. 
 
The Group has no monetary foreign currency assets or liabilities. 
 
Loans and receivables 
Loans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an 
active  market.    They  are  included  in  current  assets,  except  for  those  with  maturities  greater  than  12  months  after  the 
reporting date which are classified as non-current assets. 
 
Available for sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets, comprising principally marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives that are either 
designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.  They are included in non-current assets unless 
management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the reporting date.  Investments are designated as 
available-for-sale if they do not have fixed maturities and fixed or determinable payments and management intends to hold 
them for the medium to long term. 
 
Recognition and derecognition 
Regular  purchases  and  sales  of  financial  assets  are  recognised  on  trade-date  –  the  date  on  which  the  Group  commits  to 
purchase or sell the asset.  Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not 
carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.    Financial  assets  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  and/or  loss  are  initially 
recognised  at  fair  value  and  transaction  costs  are  expensed  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive
Investment and other financial assets

income.  Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or 
have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
 
When  securities  classified  as  available-for-sale  are  sold,  the  accumulated fair value  adjustments  recognised  in  equity  are 
included in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as gains and losses from investment securities 
 
Subsequent measurement 
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.   
Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value.   
 
Details on how the fair value of financial instruments is determined is disclosed in Notes 19 and 22. 
 
Impairment 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial 
assets is impaired.  In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the 
fair value of a security below its cost is considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired.  If any such evidence 
exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost 
and  the  current  fair  value,  less  any  impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  –  is 
removed from equity and recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.  Impairment losses 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income on equity instruments classified as available-
for-sale are recognised in equity. 
 
(s) 
 
Provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present 
obligation at the reporting date.  The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
 
(t) 
 
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of 
the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. 
 
(u)   Leases  
 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group as lessee are 
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are 
charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

Management  has determined that the  Group has one reportable  segment, being mineral  exploration in Australia.  As  the 
Group  is  focused  on  mineral  exploration,  the  Board  periodically  monitors  the  Group  based  on  actual  versus  budgeted 
exploration expenditure incurred on the Group as a whole.  This internal reporting framework is most relevant to assist the 
Board with making decisions regarding the Group and its ongoing exploration programmes and activities, while also taking 
into consideration the results of exploration work that has been performed to date.

Employee Share Option Plan 
Jindalee  Resources  Limited  Employee  Share  Option  Plan  (“ESOP”)  was  established  to  encourage  all  eligible  directors, 
executive officers and employees who have been continuously employed by the Group to have a greater involvement in the 
achievement of the Group’s objectives and to provide an incentive to strive to that end by participating in the future growth 
and prosperity of the Group through share ownership. 
The ESOP allows the Group to issue free options to eligible persons.  The options can be granted free of charge and are 
exercisable at a fixed price in accordance with the rules of the ESOP.  All options on issue are fully vested at grant date. 
Set out below are summaries of options granted under the plan:

19.  FINANCIAL AND CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
(a)  Capital Risk Management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern. 
In managing its capital, the Group’s primary objective is to ensure its continued ability to provide a consistent return for its 
equity shareholders.  In order to achieve this object, the Group seeks to maintain a capital structure that balances risks and 
returns at an acceptable level and also to maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital 
and strategic investment needs.  In making decisions to adjust its capital structure to achieve these aims, either through new 
share issues, or sourcing of debt, the Group considers not only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and 
strategic objectives. 
There have been no significant changes to the Group’s capital management objectives, policies and processes in the year nor 
has there been any change in what the Group considers to be its capital. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents (Note 9) and equity attributable to equity holders of 
the Group, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings (accumulated losses) as disclosed in Notes 15, 16 and 
17 respectively. 
 
(b) 
Details  of  the  significant  accounting  policies  and  methods  adopted,  including  the  criteria  for  recognition,  the  basis  of 
measurement  and  the  basis  on  which  income  and  expenses  are  recognised,  in  respect  of  each  class  of  financial  asset, 
financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 2 of the financial statements.

Interest Rate Risk Exposure
19.  FINANCIAL AND CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) 
 (e) 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk arises from assets bearing variable interest rates.  The weighted average interest 
rate on cash holdings was 3.00% at 30 June 2016 (2015: 3.00%).  All other financial assets and liabilities are non interest 
bearing.  The net fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities approximates their carrying value. 
The Group invests its surplus funds on deposit with Australian banking financial institutions, namely the National Australia 
Bank and ANZ Bank.  For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of AA- 
are accepted.   
The table below summarises the impact of an increase/decrease in interest rates received on cash deposits held at year end on 
the Group’s pre-tax profit for the year and on equity.  The analysis is based on the assumption that rates increased/decreased 
proportionally by 10% with all other variables held constant.
Impact on profit and equity 
Increase of 10% 
Decrease of -10%
(f)  Price Risk 
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk.  This arises from investments held by the Group and classified in the 
statement of financial position as available for sale.  The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk. 
To manage its price risk arising from investments in equity securities, the Group diversifies its portfolio. 
The table below summarises the impact of an increase/decrease in prices of securities held at year end on the Group’s pre-
tax  profit  for  the  year  and  on  equity.    The  analysis  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  prices  of  all  securities 
increased/decreased by 10% with all other variables held constant.

(g)  Liquidity Risk 
The  liquidity  position  of  the  Group  is  managed  to  ensure  sufficient  liquid  funds  are  available  to  meet  our  financial 
commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner.  The Board reviews the Group’s liquidity position on a regular basis 
including cash flow statements to determine the forecast liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity levels.  Note 14 
details the Group’s current obligations. 
There are no unused borrowing facilities from any financial institution.

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments are outlined below: 
 
Cash 
The carrying amount is fair value due to the liquid nature of these assets. 
 
Receivables/payables 
Due to the short term nature of these financial rights and obligations, their carrying amounts are estimated to represent their 
fair values. 
 
Available for sale financial assets 
The current bid price as at 30 June 2016 is used to determine the carrying value of the available for sale financial assets and 
any movement is taken to the reserve. An impairment loss of available for sale financial assets is taken to the statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 
The  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  must  be  estimated  for  recognition  and  measurement  or  for 
disclosure purposes. 
Refer to Note 22 for further details. 
 
20.  CONTINGENCIES 
 
Contingent Liabilities 
 
Claims of Native Title 
To date the Group has been notified by the Native Title Tribunal of native title claims which cover some of the Group’s 
licence holdings. Until further information arises in relation to the claims and its likelihood of success, the Group is unable 
to assess the likely effect, if any, of the claims. 
 
Performance Bonds and Security Documents 
In  support  of  titles  granted  to or  operated by  the Group,  various  securities  are  submitted  to  the  Department  of  Mines  & 
Petroleum.  These consist of unconditional performance bonds and securities or Form 32 security documents.  The Company 
has no liability outstanding. 
 
There are no other contingencies of the Group at balance date.

22.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities of the Group approximate their fair values.  Fair values of financial 
assets and liabilities have been determined for measurement and / or disclosure purposes. 
Fair value hierarchy 
The Group classifies assets and liabilities carried at fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the 
inputs  used  in  determining  that  value.  The  table  following  analyses  financial  instruments  carried  at  fair  value  by  the 
valuation method. The different levels in the hierarchy have been defined as follows: 
Level 1:   quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2:   inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
(as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3:   inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To the members of Jindalee Resources Limited
Report on the Financial Report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Jindalee Resources Limited, which comprises 
the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the 
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from 
time to time during the financial year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a 
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 
and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the 
financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. In Note 2(a), the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 
Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with International 
Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s 
preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness 
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion.
