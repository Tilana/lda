PRESS RELEASE                                                   November 2, 2005
HALO RESOURCES LTD. STAKES CLAIMS IN
                             NORTH-CENTRAL MANITOBA
VANCOUVER,  BC, NOVEMBER 2ND, 2005 - MR. MARC  CERNOVITCH,  PRESIDENT AND CEO OF
HALO RESOURCES LTD. (TSX.V: HLO, OTC.BB: HLOSF, FSE: HLR) is pleased to announce
that Halo has staked and submitted  for  recording 21 mining  claims  comprising
approximately 4,300 hectares in the Sherridon area in North-Central Manitoba.
The claims are located  approximately  70 kilometres north of Flin Flon Manitoba
in the immediate  vicinity of the historic  Sherritt Gordon Mine. Halo considers
the area to be under-explored  and represents a unique  exploration  opportunity
for the potential  discovery of high-grade  Volcanogenic  Massive Sulphide (VMS)
deposits similar to those found in the nearby Snow Lake area of Manitoba.
Halo has  submitted an  application  to record the claims with the office of the
Mining  Recorder.  There is a 30 day period from submission of the staked claims
to the formal recording of the claims. All claims are subject to inspection.
Halo is actively  analyzing  strategic  opportunities for the development of the
area  comprising  the claims,  including  the sourcing of a potential  strategic
alliance, joint venture or sale transaction.
Halo is a  Canadian-based  resource  company  focused on the acquisition of near
production base and precious base metal deposits.  Currently the Company owns or
has an interest in 3 projects:  Duport, which is an advanced stage gold project;
Bachelor  Lake,  which is a gold  exploration  project,  and a letter  of intent
regarding  Quarter  Moon,  which is a grass roots gold  project.  The Company is
operated by an  experienced  management  team and backed by a strong  network of
mining  financiers.  The Company's  growth  strategy is to develop a diversified
portfolio of advanced mining projects.
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD
/s/ Marc Cernovitch, President and CEO
