<p>The violence in the Syrian Arab Republic mutated from unrest in March 2011 into 
</p>
<p>internal disturbances and the emergence of a non-international armed conflict in February 
</p>
<p>2012. The conduct of an ever-increasing number of actors is characterized by a complete

<p>the brunt of the suffering inflicted by the warring parties. 
</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Commission of Inquiry has persistently drawn attention

</p>
<p>the major trends and patterns of human rights and humanitarian law violations perpetrated 
</p>
<p>from March 2011 to January 2015, and draws from more than 3,556 interviews with 
</p>
<p>victims and eyewitnesses in and outside of the country, collected since September 2011. 
</p>
<p>Taking stock of international actions and inaction, the report is intended to re-
</p>
<p>emphasize the dire situation of the Syrian people in the absence of a political solution to the

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The violence in the Syrian Arab Republic evolved from unrest in March 2011 into 
</p>
<p>internal disturbances and the emergence of a non-international armed conflict in February 
</p>
<p>2012. The conduct of an ever-increasing number of actors is characterized by a complete 
</p>
<p>lack of adherence to the norms of international law. 
</p>
<p>2.  Since the outset, civilians have borne the brunt of the suffering inflicted by the 
</p>
<p>warring parties. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed. Half of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>population have fled their homes, becoming refugees or internally displaced persons. The 
</p>
<p>current needs outstrip the existing humanitarian response. Many people are hard to reach, 
</p>
<p>making basic and essential protection efforts virtually impossible. 
</p>
<p>3. Since its establishment, the Commission of Inquiry
1
 has persistently drawn attention 
</p>
<p>to atrocities committed across the country. In the present report, the Commission charts the 
</p>
<p>major trends and patterns of human rights and humanitarian law violations perpetrated from 
</p>
<p>March 2011 to January 2015, and draws from more than 3,556 interviews with victims and 
</p>
<p>eyewitnesses in and outside of the country, collected since September 2011.  
</p>
<p>4. As access to the Syrian Arab Republic has been denied by the Government, the 
</p>
<p>Commission relied primarily on first-hand witness accounts to corroborate its findings. 
</p>
<p>Photographs, video recordings, satellite imagery, forensic and medical records formed the 
</p>
<p>basis of the Commission&#8217;s conclusions. The correspondence between the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic and the commission is annexed to the present report 
</p>
<p>(see annex I).  
</p>
<p>5. The Commission presents its findings on violations of international law committed 
</p>
<p>in the Syrian Arab Republic between 15 July 2014 and 15 January 2015 (see annex II). The 
</p>
<p>legal and factual findings made are based on 380 interviews conducted in the region and 
</p>
<p>from Geneva. They should be read in conjunction with the commission&#8217;s previous reports.2 
</p>
<p>The standard of proof used in previous reports remains applicable.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Victim protection 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. From unrest to war 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>6. The violations committed at the outset of the unrest in 2011 continue to be 
</p>
<p>perpetrated. This fact underlines the impunity with which the Government continues to 
</p>
<p>operate.  
</p>
<p>7. As protests erupted in Dara&#8217;a city in March 2011, government forces opened fire on 
</p>
<p>demonstrators. As the protests spread across the country, they were met with a violent, 
</p>
<p>often lethal response from the Government. The Government maintained that the protesters 
</p>
<p>fired at their forces, and provided a list of security forces allegedly killed at the protests.  
</p>
<p>  
1 The commissioners are Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro (Chairperson), Karen Koning AbuZayd, Vitit 
</p>
<p>Muntarbhorn and Carla del Ponte. 
</p>
<p> 2 S-17/2/Add.1, A/HRC/19/69, A/HRC/21/50, A/HRC/22/59, A/HRC/23/58, A/HRC/24/46, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/65 and A/HRC/27/60. </p>


<p>8.  As the unrest evolved into armed violence in late 2011, the Government intensified 
</p>
<p>its ground assaults on restive areas. The murder and torture of civilian residents and 
</p>
<p>captured armed individuals formed part of the earliest ground attacks. By 2012, as the 
</p>
<p>country moved towards civil war, government forces
3
 had committed a number of mass 
</p>
<p>killings of civilians during ground assaults. 
</p>
<p>9. By late 2012, government forces had changed tactics and rarely engaged in ground 
</p>
<p>attacks. This appeared motivated by the fact that ground attacks provided the infantry, 
</p>
<p>which was majority Sunni, with opportunities to defect and by the increased capacity of 
</p>
<p>armed groups to attack government units. 
</p>
<p>10.  Nevertheless, the mainstays of government attacks on restive areas have remained 
</p>
<p>static. They include (a) the encirclement of an area, including the setting up of checkpoints 
</p>
<p>at all access points; (b) the imposition of a siege, including preventing the flow of food, 
</p>
<p>medical supplies, and sometimes water and electricity, into the town or area; (c) the 
</p>
<p>shelling and aerial bombardment of the besieged area; (d) the arrest, and often 
</p>
<p>disappearance, of wounded persons attempting to leave the besieged area to seek medical 
</p>
<p>treatment no longer available inside and of those attempting to break the siege, usually by 
</p>
<p>smuggling in food and medical supplies. Victims have often described the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>strategy as that of &#8220;tansheef al bakhar&#8221;, or draining the sea to kill the fish.  
</p>
<p>11. Over the past four years, the Government has implemented this strategy with relative 
</p>
<p>consistency. The sieges imposed by the Government have become longer and, 
</p>
<p>consequently, more harsh. The earliest siege, that of Dara&#8217;a city, which began in late April 
</p>
<p>2011, lasted for under two months. The siege of Homs city began in mid 2011 and was only 
</p>
<p>lifted when the city fell in May 2014. Residents of Yarmouk camp in Damascus city have 
</p>
<p>been besieged since May 2013. Infants have died as a result the Government&#8217;s &#8220;surrender 
</p>
<p>or starve&#8221; siege strategy. 
</p>
<p>12. In 2011 and 2012, widespread arrests were conducted in a number of different 
</p>
<p>circumstances, including ground searches. By 2013, most were made at checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>Arrests targeted males between the ages of 15 and 60 years, and were often arbitrary, 
</p>
<p>accompanied by ill-treatment and torture. They also led to disappearances.4 By 2014, 
</p>
<p>Syrians were going to extraordinary lengths to avoid checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>13. The Government&#8217;s use of indiscriminate shelling and aerial bombardment has been 
</p>
<p>informed by its use of a variety of weaponry. The Government began hostilities by 
</p>
<p>employing artillery shells, mortars and rockets against restive and sometimes besieged 
</p>
<p>areas. By mid 2012, the use of cluster munitions, thermobaric bombs and missiles was 
</p>
<p>documented, often used against civilian objectives, such as schools and hospitals. The 
</p>
<p>Government has also used incendiary weapons. 
</p>
<p>14. The first reported use of barrel bombs was in August 2012 in Homs city. It was not, 
</p>
<p>however, until mid 2013 that government forces began an intense campaign of barrel 
</p>
<p>bombing of Aleppo city and governorate.5 Throughout 2013, 2014 and into 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Government has made liberal use of barrel bombs. These makeshift explosive containers 
</p>
<p>have caused thousands of civilian casualties. Barrel bombs are regularly dropped on 
</p>
<p>crowded areas, such as bakery lines, transportation hubs, apartment buildings and markets. 
</p>
<p>Aid distributions have also been targeted.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 The term &#8220;government forces&#8221;, unless specified otherwise, includes the Syrian Armed Forces, 
</p>
<p>intelligence forces and associated foreign and local militias, including Hezbollah, the shabbiha, 
</p>
<p>popular committees and National Defence Forces. 
</p>
<p> 4 A/HRC/25/65, annex IV. 
</p>
<p> 5 Ibid., annex VI. </p>


<p>15. In April 2014, the Government dropped barrel bombs containing chemical agents, 
</p>
<p>likely chlorine, on locations in Idlib and Hama governorates. The first attributed finding of 
</p>
<p>use of chemical weapons by a warring party was noted, but did not spur greater action to 
</p>
<p>end the conflict.  
</p>
<p>16. Throughout the duration of the violence in the Syrian Arab Republic, government 
</p>
<p>forces have relied on paramilitary groups and militias; initially the <i>shabbiha</i>, and now the 
</p>
<p>National Defence Force. It has benefited from the intervention of foreign fighters, including 
</p>
<p>Hizbullah and Iraqi Shia militias. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Anti-government armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>17. After the armed confrontations in Jisr Ash-Shugur (Idlib) in June 2011, organized 
</p>
<p>armed groups emerged in Homs, Idlib and Rif Damascus, made up of defectors and local 
</p>
<p>fighters.  
</p>
<p>18. Some defectors organized themselves into the Free Syrian Army (FSA). While 
</p>
<p>increasingly organized armed groups identified themselves as FSA, it remained unclear 
</p>
<p>whether the FSA leadership, based in Turkey, had effective command and control over 
</p>
<p>ground forces. After 2012, hundreds of groups of varying sizes emerged. The multiplicity 
</p>
<p>of actors exacerbated the violence and further endangered civilian life.  
</p>
<p>19. While the Government focused on key urban centres and lines of communication, 
</p>
<p>the armed opposition made gains in the countryside of restive governorates. Their presence 
</p>
<p>in civilian areas and their initial attacks on isolated checkpoints and army convoys triggered 
</p>
<p>ever more violent assaults by the Government. 
</p>
<p>20. Armed groups, then under the banner of the FSA, tortured and executed suspected 
</p>
<p>government agents, members of the <i>shabbiha</i>, and collaborators. During the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>assault on Homs city in February 2012, armed groups killed captured soldiers.  
</p>
<p>21. As the armed violence mutated into a civil war in February 2012, armed groups 
</p>
<p>continued to attack government-held neighbourhoods and areas. The Damascus 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods of Jaramana and Bab Tuma have been the object of indiscriminate shelling 
</p>
<p>by anti-government armed groups for more than two years. These unlawful attacks continue 
</p>
<p>to date. 
</p>
<p>22. Armed groups continued to take hostages to force prisoner exchanges or for ransom. 
</p>
<p>Some groups have held hostages for long periods of time, as in the ongoing case of women 
</p>
<p>and children abducted from eastern Latakia in August 2013. Almost all of those held 
hostage have been civilians belonging to communities or living in areas supportive of the 
</p>
<p>Government. 
</p>
<p>23. Anti-government armed groups have also besieged towns and villages. The sieges 
</p>
<p>have generally been shorter lived and employed on far fewer localities than those of the 
</p>
<p>Government. Since armed groups expanded their control over the northern countryside of 
</p>
<p>Aleppo in July 2012, they have imposed a siege on two Shia enclaves, Nubul and Zahra. 
</p>
<p>24. The first foreign fighters, mostly Libyans, arrived in the Syrian Arab Republic in 
</p>
<p>2011. The presence of more extreme elements was seen in the numerous suicide bombings 
</p>
<p>that initially targeted State security services in 2011 and 2012.  
</p>
<p>25. The more extreme anti-government armed groups, notably Jabhat Al-Nusra, have 
</p>
<p>flourished as the conflict continues. This is largely owing to their operational efficiency and 
</p>
<p>stable financial capacity, which have attracted fighters from other groups.  </p>


<p>26. In 2014, terrorist groups used suicide and car bombs in Homs and Hama 
</p>
<p>governorates. Unlike the earlier bombings of 2011 and 2012, most of which were directed 
</p>
<p>against military targets, the bombings in 2013 and 2014 targeted civilians.  
</p>
<p>27. In late 2014, there was an increase in ground attacks on villages that were home to 
</p>
<p>minority groups perceived to be supporting the Government.  
</p>
<p>28. Anti-Government armed groups lost momentum when the Government, assisted by 
</p>
<p>Hizbullah, began to regain control of Al Qusayr (Homs) in June 2013. Since then, the 
</p>
<p>groups have continued to lose ground owing to a lack of regular and consistent support, 
</p>
<p>inadequate unity and cohesion, and increased infighting, in particular after the emergence 
</p>
<p>of the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS)6 in April 2013. 
</p>
<p>(i)<i> Jabhat Al-Nusra 
</i></p>
<p>29. The emergence of Jabhat Al-Nusra as an offshoot of Al-Qaida in Iraq was 
</p>
<p>announced in January 2012. Owing to its tactical efficiency and consistent logistic 
</p>
<p>capabilities, the group rapidly gained prominence among the other anti-government armed 
</p>
<p>groups, increasingly attracting both extremist backers and foreign fighters. 
</p>
<p>30. While Jabhat Al-Nusra has made extensive use of car bombs and suicide bombings 
</p>
<p>against military targets, such as military and security forces, it has also detonated bombs in 
</p>
<p>civilian areas, particularly in Homs city in 2014. Jabhat Al-Nusra has also launched ground 
</p>
<p>attacks on civilian localities. Acting in concert with other armed groups, it participated in 
</p>
<p>the massacres of civilians in Rif Damascus in December 2013, and in Hama on 24 
</p>
<p>December 2013 and 9 February 2014.  
</p>
<p>31. In April 2013, the leadership of Jabhat Al-Nusra rejected a merger with ISIS. After 
</p>
<p>months of intense confrontations, Al-Nusra was driven out of its strongholds in Dayr az 
</p>
<p>Zawr in July 2014, losing significant oil resources and tribal support.  
</p>
<p>32. Relations between Jabhat Al-Nusra and other armed groups remained largely 
</p>
<p>collaborative. However, the Al-Qaida affiliate recently attacked a number of western-
</p>
<p>backed armed factions in Idlib governorate, absorbing their equipment, fighters and 
</p>
<p>territory.  
</p>
<p>(ii)<i> Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham  
</i></p>
<p>33.  In April 2013, following the breakdown of its alliance with Jabhat Al-Nusra, ISIS 
</p>
<p>developed into a well-organized, dominant armed force in control of extensive territory in 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, posing a significant threat to peace and stability. 
</p>
<p>34.  In 2014, the conflict was marked by the rapid rise and expansion of ISIS, which took 
</p>
<p>over large parts of the north-east in the Syrian Arab Republic. It has recently made inroads 
</p>
<p>in Hama and Homs governorates. In June 2014, ISIS proclaimed itself a &#8220;caliphate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. This terrorist group has gained control over significant economic resources and, with 
</p>
<p>them, a stable source of funding. By using tactics that instil terror among the civilian 
</p>
<p>population, and providing basic services, it has fostered loyalties among local communities 
</p>
<p>in the areas it controls.
 
 
</p>
<p>36. ISIS operates a harsh, rigid administrative system that comprises the Al-Hisbah 
</p>
<p>morality police, the general police force, courts and entities managing recruitment, tribal 
</p>
<p>relations and education.7
 
 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 Also referred to as &#8220;Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant&#8221; (ISIL). 
</p>
<p> 7 See A/HRC/27/CRP.3, para. 16. </p>


<p>37. ISIS inflicts severe penalties against those who transgress or refuse to accept their 
</p>
<p>self-proclaimed rule. This includes hundreds of public executions, mainly of males, 
</p>
<p>followed by the display of bodies in an effort to terrorize and force the submission of 
</p>
<p>civilian communities living under their control. ISIS has also publicly amputated limbs as 
</p>
<p>punishment for theft and lashed residents for smoking and trading during prayer times.  
</p>
<p>38. ISIS has carried out executions of captured soldiers and fighters from other armed 
</p>
<p>groups. It has also killed civilians during attacks, such as on the Al-Shaar gas fields (Homs) 
</p>
<p>in July and on Al-Sheitat villages in Dayr az Zawr in August 2014.  
</p>
<p>39. Where ISIS has occupied areas with diverse ethnic and religious communities, 
</p>
<p>minorities have been forced to either assimilate or flee. It forcibly displaced Kurds from 
</p>
<p>towns in Ar Raqqah as early as July 2013. As recently as November 2014, it evicted Kurds 
</p>
<p>living in Al Bab (Aleppo). It has also destroyed Christian churches and Shia shrines in its 
</p>
<p>areas of control.  
</p>
<p>(iii) People&#8217;s Protection Units  </p>
<p>40. In mid-2012, as armed groups surged in the west and south of the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic, the Government withdrew from Kurdish majority areas in an effort to deploy its 
</p>
<p>forces where they were most needed. In their place, the People&#8217;s Protection Units (YPG) 
</p>
<p>took control. 
</p>
<p>41. In January 2014, the YPG established an administration in the Kurdish regions of 
</p>
<p>the northern part of the Syrian Arab Republic. They have engaged in hostilities with 
</p>
<p>government forces, anti-government armed groups and ISIS to defend areas under its 
</p>
<p>control. Supported by international coalition airstrikes, the YPG recently regained control 
over Ayn al-Arab (Kobane).  
</p>
<p>42. The YPG has recruited children &#8211; both boys and girls &#8211; for use in hostilities. In a 
</p>
<p>letter dated 30 September 2013 addresed to the Commission, the YPG stated that its policy 
</p>
<p>was not to use children under the age of 18. Underage fighters, however, were involved in 
</p>
<p>YPG military operations against ISIS in Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) in September and October 
</p>
<p>2014.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Unknown perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>43.  Throughout the conflict, there have been attacks for which no party has claimed 
</p>
<p>responsibility and which had no clear strategic or military objective beyond the purpose of 
</p>
<p>spreading terror among the civilian population. Among these are the chemical weapons 
</p>
<p>attacks on Al-Ghouta (Rif Damascus) on 21 August 2013 and Khan Al-Assal (Aleppo) on 
</p>
<p>19 March 2013. 
</p>
<p>44. In Al-Ghouta, significant quantities of sarin were used in a well-planned attack 
</p>
<p>targeting civilian-inhabited areas, causing mass casualties. The evidence available 
</p>
<p>concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used indicated that the perpetrators 
</p>
<p>likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the 
</p>
<p>expertise and equipment necessary to safely manipulate large amounts of chemical agents. 
</p>
<p>The chemical agents used in Khan Al-Assal bore the same unique hallmarks as those used 
</p>
<p>in Al-Ghouta. Other allegations of chemical weapons on a significantly smaller scale were 
</p>
<p>also recorded. The Commission&#8217;s evidentiary threshold was not met with regard to the 
</p>
<p>perpetrator for these incidents.  
</p>
<p>45. There have been multiple cases where improvised explosive devices were set off in 
</p>
<p>both government- and armed group-controlled areas and for which it was not possible to 
</p>
<p>identify the party responsible.  </p>


<p>46.  There have been abductions and disappearances for which no ransom demands were 
</p>
<p>issued and no claims of responsibility made. In December 2013, four human rights activists 
</p>
<p>were kidnapped from their office in Dumah (Rif Damascus). Their fate and whereabouts 
</p>
<p>remain unknown. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Consequences of the failure of the State to protect civilians 
</b></p>
<p>47. The human cost of the ongoing conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic is 
</p>
<p>immeasurable. The Syrian State has manifestly failed to protect its citizens from mass 
</p>
<p>atrocities. War crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed on a massive 
</p>
<p>scale. Many Syrians have suffered multiple violations and abuses from different actors. The 
</p>
<p>scale of human suffering has grown as the conflict has escalated.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Civilians 
</b></p>
<p>48. Civilians and persons hors de combat, in particular fighting-age men, have been the 
</p>
<p>primary victims of violence since the unrest began in the Syrian Arab Republic in March 
</p>
<p>2011. Women and children have also been targeted. Men and women who sought to aid the 
</p>
<p>wounded or those in need of humanitarian assistance have been arrested, detained, tortured 
</p>
<p>and killed for &#8220;collaborating&#8221; with the armed opposition. 
</p>
<p>49. Government forces have directed attacks against the civilian population. The attacks 
</p>
<p>have included widespread shelling and bombardment of civilian-inhabited localities and the 
targeting of civilians for arrest, detention and disappearance on the basis of their association 
</p>
<p>or perceived opposition to the Government. The coordination and active participation of 
</p>
<p>government institutions indicates that the attacks are conducted as a matter of State policy. 
</p>
<p>As part of this widespread attack on the civilian population, government forces have 
</p>
<p>perpetrated murder, torture, rape and acts of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>50. Where frontlines have stalled, the Government has employed a strategy of 
</p>
<p>controlling the population, combining long-lasting sieges with continuous air and ground 
</p>
<p>bombardment. Civilians are targeted on the basis of their perceived opposition to the 
</p>
<p>Government. Merely living in or originating from certain neighbourhoods leads to 
</p>
<p>targeting. In a particularly brutal military campaign, the Government intensified its 
</p>
<p>widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population of Aleppo in October 2013 
</p>
<p>to punish and terrorize civilians for supporting or hosting armed groups in an apparent 
</p>
<p>strategy to erode popular support for those groups. Government forces are now employing a 
</p>
<p>similar strategy in Ar Raqqah, with total disregard for the distinction between civilian and 
</p>
<p>military targets.  
</p>
<p>51. Anti-government armed groups have intentionally targeted civilian localities either 
</p>
<p>in retaliation for government operations or owing to perceived support of those localities 
</p>
<p>for the Government. Minority groups considered to be harbouring government loyalties or 
</p>
<p>perceived as benefiting from government support have also been attacked by non-State 
</p>
<p>armed groups.  
</p>
<p>52. Since its emergence in April 2013, ISIS has committed acts of violence against the 
</p>
<p>civilian population under its control in Ar Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah and north-
</p>
<p>eastern Aleppo governorates.
 
ISIS, a structured group, directs and organizes these acts of 
</p>
<p>violence against civilians, evincing an organizational policy. As part of this attack, ISIS has 
</p>
<p>carried out public executions to instil terror among the civilian population, ensuring 
</p>
<p>submission to its authority.  
</p>
<p>53. Arbitrary restrictions and obstacles to the delivery of aid continue to be imposed by 
</p>
<p>all sides to the conflict, with devastating consequences for civilians in areas that are hard to 
</p>
<p>reach. Humanitarian aid has been instrumentalized for military gain. The bureaucratic </p>


<p>hurdles imposed by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic are a calculated 
</p>
<p>obstruction of aid to civilians living in areas under non-State armed group control. The 
</p>
<p>conditions imposed by armed groups on the delivery of humanitarian assistance use civilian 
</p>
<p>suffering as a retaliatory measure.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Fighting-age males 
</b></p>
<p>54. Since March 2011, males perceived to be of fighting age, including minors, have 
</p>
<p>been targeted in military assaults, shelling and by sniper fire, for arrest and detention, and 
</p>
<p>recruited for participation in hostilities. As the conflict has escalated, males of fighting age 
</p>
<p>have emerged as the main targets of violence. According to the Statistical Analysis of 
</p>
<p>Documentation of Killings in the Syrian Arab Republic commissioned by the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, some 85.1 per cent of the victims 
</p>
<p>documented were are male.  
</p>
<p>55. Government forces have engaged in mass arrest campaigns leading to the enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance of fighting-age men in areas that have fallen under their control, and men 
</p>
<p>residing in or travelling to government-held areas. Their families are often too afraid to 
</p>
<p>approach the authorities to enquire about the whereabouts of their relatives.8 Those who 
</p>
<p>enquired have faced a refusal to disclose information about the fate of the disappeared or 
</p>
<p>were compelled to pay large bribes to learn of the whereabouts of relatives. Men who were 
</p>
<p>detained were often subjected to sexual violence as a tactic to punish, humiliate and 
</p>
<p>degrade. 
</p>
<p>56. Victims of ISIS public executions are usually men or boys accused of being 
</p>
<p>affiliated with other armed groups or of violating ISIS edicts. Captured hors de combat 
</p>
<p>government soldiers have been executed en masse. Young boys are also used as 
</p>
<p>executioners, trained to carry out suicide bombing missions and deployed in active 
</p>
<p>hostilities.  
</p>
<p>57. Boys and men are at constant risk of being targeted or instrumentalized by the 
</p>
<p>parties to the conflict. Government forces, ISIS, and the YPG have all pursued a concerted 
</p>
<p>effort to conscript young men into their ranks. Minors have been recruited and used by all 
</p>
<p>parties to the conflict, at times systematically.  
</p>
<p>58. Men of fighting age are not granted any of the protections afforded to civilians by 
</p>
<p>any of the parties. Whether subjected to violations by government forces or ISIS, the 
</p>
<p>evidence collected indicates that Sunni Muslim men are disproportionately overrepresented 
</p>
<p>among the victims in the Syrian conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>59. The lives of Syrian women have been radically altered by four years of conflict. 
</p>
<p>With Syrian men killed, disappeared or unable to move for fear of arrest at checkpoints, 
</p>
<p>there has been a drastic increase in female-headed households. Unaccompanied by men and 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to physical assaults, women and girls have been put at risk of arrest or abduction 
</p>
<p>by government forces and by anti-government armed groups. In Aleppo, Hama, Homs and 
</p>
<p>Dara&#8217;a governorates, women cited a fear of sexual violence in their decisions to flee their 
</p>
<p>homes.  
</p>
<p>60. An increasing number of cases of sexual violence has been documented through 
</p>
<p>targeted investigations and cooperation with broad social and medical networks. Women 
</p>
<p>and girls were found to have been raped and sexually assaulted in government detention 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 A/HRC/25/65, para. 48. </p>


<p>facilities, in particular in the investigation branches of the Military Intelligence Directorate 
</p>
<p>and prisons administered by the General Security Directorate in Damascus. State officials 
</p>
<p>have perpetrated rape, a crime against humanity.  
</p>
<p>61. Many victims of sexual and gender-based violence spoke out once they had been 
</p>
<p>released from detention, while others took time to relay their experiences of violations 
</p>
<p>perpetrated in secret or cloaked in silence or taboo. Underreporting and delayed reporting 
</p>
<p>of sexual violence continues to be endemic. Contemporaneous medical documentation is 
</p>
<p>rare, and is hampered by the denial of medical assistance to detainees in custodial contexts, 
</p>
<p>where most sexual violence is committed. Many of the women interviewed had been 
</p>
<p>displaced and sought shelter in neighbouring States. They are in desperate need of 
</p>
<p>psychosocial support, which must be maximized to help victims of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>62. Lack of access to medical care has affected the prenatal and postnatal health of 
</p>
<p>women and their children. Women in labour have not been allowed through government 
</p>
<p>checkpoints and have often been forced to give birth under dangerous circumstances. In 
</p>
<p>areas under siege, women have given birth in unsterile conditions and without pain 
</p>
<p>medication.  
</p>
<p>63. Armed groups, including Ahrar Al-Sham and Jabhat Al-Nusra, have targeted women 
</p>
<p>and children on the basis of their gender, to be taken as hostages for use in prisoner 
</p>
<p>exchanges. Yazidi women, abducted from Iraq, have been brought into the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic and sold (and re-sold) in markets or distributed to ISIS fighters as war booty. Kept 
</p>
<p>as slaves, they are subject to horrific and repeated sexual violence. Girls and women in 
</p>
<p>ISIS-controlled areas live in fear of forced marriage to the fighters. 
</p>
<p>64. The imposition by ISIS of a strict interpretation of sharia law previously unseen in 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic &#8211; setting out edicts on all aspects of life, from dress to movement, 
</p>
<p>employment and religious observance &#8211; has restricted basic freedoms, particularly for 
</p>
<p>women. Women and girls over the age of 10 must be fully covered when venturing 
</p>
<p>outdoors. Women and girls are not permitted to be in the company of men outside of their 
</p>
<p>immediate family. Failure to abide by these rules is punishable by lashing. Punishments 
</p>
<p>may be carried out by the Al-Hisbah morality police, but increasingly they are the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the all-female brigade Al-Khans&#8217;aa. ISIS has executed women, as well as 
</p>
<p>men, on charges of adultery. Instances of women being stoned to death have been 
</p>
<p>documented. Such public displays of brutality are utilized to instil fear among women for 
</p>
<p>disobeying ISIS edicts. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Children 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Commission has witnessed the deterioration of children&#8217;s rights in the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic. Children have been killed, injured and maimed, suffering the direct 
</p>
<p>consequences of the indiscriminate violence of government forces. They have also been 
</p>
<p>affected by displacement, loss of relatives and the trauma of witnessing acts of violence. 
</p>
<p>66. Intelligence and security agencies have detained young children since 2011. Held in 
</p>
<p>the same cells as adults, children are exposed to sexual violence and subjected to the same 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment and torture as adult detainees. In detention, children have also witnessed 
</p>
<p>violent torture and death. 
</p>
<p>67. As the unrest developed into an armed conflict, government forces began to use 
</p>
<p>children as part of coordinated military operations to locate armed group fighters prior to 
</p>
<p>attack or act as informants, exposing them to retaliation and punishment.  
</p>
<p>68. With approximately 5,000 schools destroyed in the Syrian Arab Republic, the 
</p>
<p>resulting sharp decline in children&#8217;s education continues to be articulated as one of the 
</p>
<p>greatest concerns among those interviewed. Government forces attack schools in the </p>


<p>context of their military operations. According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, 160 
</p>
<p>children were killed in attacks on schools in 2014. Regular armed forces have also used 
</p>
<p>schools for military purposes, depriving children of education and exposing educational 
</p>
<p>facilities to attack.  
</p>
<p>69. Some children who have been displaced or sought refuge in neighbouring States 
</p>
<p>have been out of school for two to three years, increasing the risk of radicalization among 
</p>
<p>adolescent youth. Armed groups have taken advantage of children who are displaced and 
</p>
<p>detached from their communities. Children have been recruited, trained and used in active 
</p>
<p>combat roles. Doctors working in field hospitals regularly treat minors injured in combat. 
</p>
<p>The use of schools by armed groups for military purposes has endangered children and led 
to their injury and death. Anti-government armed groups have systematically targeted 
</p>
<p>schools and schoolyards, killing, injuring and maiming children.  
</p>
<p>70. ISIS has instrumentalized and abused children on a scale not seen before in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian conflict. It has established &#8220;cubs camps&#8221; across areas under its control, where 
</p>
<p>children are taught how to use weapons and trained to be deployed as suicide bombers. In 
</p>
<p>September and October 2014, minors were part of ISIS forces during its assault on Ayn al-
</p>
<p>Arab (Kobane). Children have been deliberately targeted for indoctrination and 
</p>
<p>instrumentalized by ISIS. ISIS has also used schools for military purposes, endangering 
</p>
<p>children and preventing their access to education.  
</p>
<p>71. The YPG has abducted children and accepted children into their ranks. Despite an 
</p>
<p>international commitment to the contrary, they have deployed children in active hostilities. 
</p>
<p>72. More than half of Syrian school-age children, up to 2.4 million, are out of school as 
</p>
<p>a consequence of the occupation, destruction and insecurity of schools. With increasing 
</p>
<p>numbers of children being recruited to fight, the vulnerability and lack of protection of 
</p>
<p>children in the Syrian Arab Republic today will have long-lasting consequences. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Detainees 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Commission has collected numerous accounts of torture and deaths in custody 
</p>
<p>in government prisons across the Syrian Arab Republic occurring between March 2011 and 
</p>
<p>January 2015, supporting its finding of the crime against humanity of torture and murder. 
</p>
<p>The widespread and systematic use of torture was documented in multiple facilities in 
</p>
<p>Damascus, including Military Security branches 215, 235 (also known as Palestine branch) 
</p>
<p>and 227; the Damascus Political Security Branch; the Air Force Intelligence branches at 
</p>
<p>Harasta and at Mezzeh military airport; the Harasta Military Hospital and Sednaya prison. 
</p>
<p>The documented physical injuries of victims were consistent with their accounts of severe 
</p>
<p>torture inflicted as a method of interrogation, or to degrade and humiliate. Torture also 
</p>
<p>included rape and sexual violence. Conditions of detention were characterized by a lack of 
</p>
<p>food, water, space, sleep, hygiene and medical care, and the denial of life-saving medicine. 
</p>
<p>Detainees were often stripped on arrival and held for long periods in their underwear. The 
</p>
<p>collected information indicates the existence of a State policy implemented across 
</p>
<p>governorates.  
</p>
<p>74. There were multiple reports of deaths in custody at the Air Force Intelligence branch 
</p>
<p>at Mezzeh military airport, Military Security branches 215 and 235 and Sednaya prison. 
</p>
<p>Families of detainees were frequently directed to the Al-Qaboun Military Police to obtain 
</p>
<p>information on detained relatives and then to Tishreen Military Hospital. In most cases, 
</p>
<p>however, bodies were not returned. State authorities issued fabricated death certificates 
</p>
<p>with the apparent intent to disguise the cause and location of death and to prevent any 
</p>
<p>official record of the use of torture. By misrepresenting the circumstances of death in an 
</p>
<p>effort to conceal detainee abuse, government authorities have bolstered a system of 
</p>
<p>widespread and systematic torture and unlawful killing.  </p>


<p>75. ISIS inflicts severe physical or mental pain or suffering on civilian populations in 
</p>
<p>areas under its control, in particular through its public lashing and amputations, as part of a 
</p>
<p>widespread and systematic attack on the civilian population. There has been a rise in torture 
</p>
<p>and the cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of the civilian population in Ar Raqqah, 
</p>
<p>Dayr az Zawr and Aleppo governorates. Torture has also been committed systematically 
</p>
<p>against captured FSA and YPG fighters. ISIS fighters beat and killed those held in its 
detention centres in Ar Raqqah and Aleppo governorates during interrogations. Beatings 
</p>
<p>included whipping detainees with cables. Former detainees in ISIS detention facilities in Ar 
</p>
<p>Raqqah governorate reported being held in overcrowded, insect-infested cells. Detainees 
received inadequate food and were not permitted to communicate with anyone outside the 
</p>
<p>facility.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Sick and wounded persons 
</b></p>
<p>76. The deliberate deprivation of care for those viewed as adversaries has aggravated the 
</p>
<p>scale of human suffering in the Syrian Arab Republic. Since the first days of unrest, 
</p>
<p>protesters wounded in demonstrations have been prevented their access to hospitals. As the 
</p>
<p>conflict escalated, many civilians injured in indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks 
</p>
<p>died, unable to reach medical care. Security forces have arrested and detained wounded 
</p>
<p>persons seeking treatment, claiming that bullet or shrapnel wounds were evidence of 
</p>
<p>participation in opposition activities. Doctors and nurses have been forced to withhold 
</p>
<p>treatment under violent threat. The sick and wounded have been targeted with sniper fire 
</p>
<p>and during military assaults on medical facilities. Health care has become militarized to the 
</p>
<p>extent that many in need elect not to seek medical assistance in hospitals for fear of arrest, 
</p>
<p>detention, torture or death.
 
 
</p>
<p>77. The demise of impartiality has been one of the defining characteristics of this 
</p>
<p>conflict. Across the Syrian Arab Republic, government forces have refused to allow 
</p>
<p>deliveries of essential medicines and surgical supplies. As an immediate consequence, field 
</p>
<p>hospitals lack basic necessities and can offer only rudimentary medical treatment. In 
</p>
<p>continuing a policy of denying medical care on the grounds that it may be used to treat 
</p>
<p>injured combatants, government authorities act in direct breach of binding international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law obligations to ensure that wounded and sick persons are collected and 
</p>
<p>cared for, and to ensure the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>78. There is a rising number of persons with disabilities due to the use of explosives, 
</p>
<p>particularly in densely populated urban areas. The increased use of landmines and 
</p>
<p>improvised explosive devices by all parties to the conflict has led to the injury and maiming 
</p>
<p>of a large number of victims. The weapons used by government forces, in particular barrel 
</p>
<p>bombs, cause severe injuries, including the loss of limbs and deep cuts from shrapnel.
 
Many 
</p>
<p>of the victims who survive barrel bombings are maimed. 
</p>
<p>79. Many of the witnesses interviewed suffered from injury, impairment or chronic 
</p>
<p>disease. For the vast majority, their disabilities had resulted directly from the conflict. 
</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities face specific hardships. They have suffered from a drastic 
</p>
<p>curtailment in access to adequate services as a result of the conflict. Instances of persons 
</p>
<p>with mental and physical disabilities unable to flee or being killed in hostilities in Ayn al-
</p>
<p>Arab (Kobane) in September 2014 have been documented. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Medical personnel and humanitarian aid workers 
</b></p>
<p>80. The collapse of the Syrian public health system over the past four years has been 
</p>
<p>accelerated by the loss of medical personnel. Ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors and 
</p>
<p>medical volunteers have been attacked, arrested, unlawfully detained and disappeared. </p>


<p>Anti-terrorism laws issued on 2 July 2012 effectively criminalized medical aid to the 
</p>
<p>opposition. Laws 19, 20 and 21 contravene the customary international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>rule that &#8220;under no circumstances shall any person be punished for carrying out medical 
</p>
<p>activities compatible with medical ethics, regardless of the person benefiting therefrom&#8221;.9 
</p>
<p>As a result, the health-care system has been severely affected in the course of military 
operations carried out by government forces, as well as through a deliberate and systematic 
campaign to persecute medical staff treating anyone perceived to be opposing the 
</p>
<p>Government.  
</p>
<p>81. Hospitals and medical facilities have been systematically targeted, leading to the 
</p>
<p>death and wounding of medical personnel. Across the country, between July 2014 and 
</p>
<p>January 2015, at least 10 hospitals were attacked by government airstrikes, some 
</p>
<p>repeatedly, often killing doctors and nurses working inside.  
</p>
<p>82. ISIS and anti-government armed groups have detained medical personnel, violating 
</p>
<p>customary humanitarian law prohibiting the punishment of persons for carrying out medical 
</p>
<p>activities. The abduction of humanitarian and medical personnel has prompted medical staff 
</p>
<p>to flee for fear of arrest. Doctors and nurses have also fled owing to the restrictions imposed 
</p>
<p>on their professional activities by ISIS.  
</p>
<p>83. Violence targeting humanitarian workers and facilities continues to obstruct the 
</p>
<p>efforts of humanitarian agencies to deliver aid to those Syrians most in need. Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>workers have been deliberately targeted, preventing them from delivering aid and curtailing 
</p>
<p>the activities of humanitarian agencies.  
</p>
<p><b> 9. Internally displaced persons and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>84. Since the start of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic, more than 10 million 
</p>
<p>Syrians have fled their homes. This amounts to almost half of the country&#8217;s population, 
</p>
<p>now deprived of their basic rights to shelter and adequate housing, security and human 
</p>
<p>dignity. Many are victims of human rights violations and abuses and are in urgent need of 
</p>
<p>protective measures and support. 
</p>
<p>85. More than 3 million people, most of them women and children, have fled the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic. Neighbouring countries, in particular Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq, 
</p>
<p>have borne the primary responsibility of hosting one of the largest exoduses in recent 
</p>
<p>history. A further 6.5 million people are believed to be internally displaced. An estimated 
</p>
<p>10.8 million are in need of humanitarian assistance inside the Syrian Arab Republic, with 
</p>
<p>4.6 million living under siege or in hard-to-access areas.  
</p>
<p>86.  Palestinians in the Syrian Arab Republic have emerged as a particularly vulnerable 
</p>
<p>group. Targeted by government forces in Yarmouk and Khan Al-Sheeh camps in 
</p>
<p>Damascus, in Handarat camp in Aleppo and in Dara&#8217;a camp, Palestinians often have 
</p>
<p>nowhere to seek refuge. Neighbouring States have restricted entry to some Palestinians and 
</p>
<p>imposed discriminatory measures, in violation of their asylum and non-refoulement 
</p>
<p>obligations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Civilian protection measures 
</b></p>
<p>87. There has been a total failure of civilian protection in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>Civilians are systematically targeted by all parties to the conflict, resulting in egregious 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 Additional Protocols I (art. 16 (1)) and II (art. 10 (1)) to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. </p>


<p>atrocities. As a direct consequence of the conduct of warring parties, humanitarian space 
</p>
<p>continues to shrink markedly, amplifying the human cost of the conflict.  
</p>
<p>88. Persons deprived of their freedom, particularly those detained in connection with the 
</p>
<p>unrest and armed conflict, are rarely informed of the charges against them, have no access 
</p>
<p>to fair and impartial tribunals, to effective remedy or to due process protections overall. 
</p>
<p>Impartial humanitarian actors are not granted access to the vast majority of detention 
</p>
<p>facilities operated by the Government or non-State armed groups.  
</p>
<p>89. Civilians and others who are not, or who are no longer, taking part in a conflict or 
</p>
<p>other situations of violence, in particular persons or groups exposed to specific risks, such 
</p>
<p>as children, women, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and the displaced, similarly have 
</p>
<p>few protections in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>90. With access to many parts of the country severely restricted, international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian agencies are unable to carry out protection visits to detention facilities or 
</p>
<p>conduct needs assessments in areas hosting large numbers of internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>91. The government authorities, who are implicated in the commission of gross 
</p>
<p>violations and continue to perpetrate crimes pursuant to State policy, have demonstrated 
</p>
<p>their resolve in refusing to engage with impartial humanitarian actors. Legislation adopted 
</p>
<p>since the start of the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic has criminalized essential 
</p>
<p>humanitarian activities, including the impartial provision of medical care. Attacks on 
</p>
<p>humanitarian aid workers and the detention of human rights defenders has drastically 
</p>
<p>hampered efforts by actors seeking to alleviate the suffering of victims of the conflict and 
</p>
<p>those working to protect civilians. Siege warfare and denial of humanitarian access has 
</p>
<p>made basic protection efforts in many areas virtually impossible.  
</p>
<p>92. None of the armed actors has made any apparent effort to review its targeting 
</p>
<p>practices in order to reduce or prevent civilian casualties. The parties continue to conduct 
</p>
<p>hostilities in an indiscriminate, often disproportionate and unlawful manner. They take few 
</p>
<p>precautions and do not appear to take remedial action to reduce civilian casualties, 
</p>
<p>including independent investigations into incidents resulting in civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p>93. Non-State armed groups have fragmented, making sustained coordination and 
</p>
<p>advocacy on civilian protection measures difficult. Without known and trusted 
</p>
<p>interlocutors, humanitarian actors have not been able to maintain adequate channels to carry 
</p>
<p>out meaningful dialogue on civilian protection measures. As a result, persons deprived of 
</p>
<p>their liberty and persons in need of medical care, humanitarian and food assistance have 
</p>
<p>few protections. The spread of ISIS and the escalation of hostilities have resulted in the 
</p>
<p>cessation of all humanitarian aid deliveries to areas under their control.  
</p>
<p>94. The body of evidence collected by the Commission unequivocally demonstrates the 
</p>
<p>belligerent parties&#8217; disregard for human life and protections accorded to civilians. Increased 
</p>
<p>civilian protection must be a central pillar of any political, humanitarian or diplomatic 
</p>
<p>dialogue with the warring parties, aiming to increase the humanitarian space within the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic. Beyond the borders of the Syrian Arab Republic, concerted 
</p>
<p>international action is urgently needed to address the humanitarian protection needs of the 
</p>
<p>refugee population in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>95. The armed conflict has been characterized by massive, recurrent violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights and international humanitarian law that demand urgent international and national 
</p>
<p>action. This was recognized by the Security Council in its resolution 2139 (2014), in which 
</p>
<p>the Council stressed the need to end impunity and reaffirmed the need to bring perpetrators </p>


<p>to justice. Despite the consensus reached in that resolution, no concrete measures are yet in 
</p>
<p>place to ensure accountability. 
</p>
<p>96. The Commission has repeatedly called upon the Security Council to refer the 
</p>
<p>situation to the International Criminal Court or to an ad hoc international tribunal. It has 
</p>
<p>also endeavoured, wherever possible, to use its information to identify those responsible for 
</p>
<p>crimes and other violations and to help to ensure perpetrators are held accountable.10  
</p>
<p>97. More than 3,500 victim and eyewitness accounts have been collected, documenting 
</p>
<p>war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as other violations of human rights and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law. These interviews have been preserved for future sharing 
</p>
<p>and referral to justice mechanisms, whether international or national. In all cases, 
</p>
<p>interviewees were asked to provide their explicit consent for the Commission to use the 
</p>
<p>information provided in its reports and/or to share pertinent details with current and future 
</p>
<p>accountability mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Identification of alleged perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>98. At the end of each mandate, the Commission compiles a confidential list of alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrators. Alleged perpetrators have been identified based on verified accounts of 
</p>
<p>witnesses and victims. 
</p>
<p>99. All information relating to the identity of potential perpetrators, either individuals or 
</p>
<p>entities, is recorded, including name, affiliation, rank, source and exact circumstances of the 
</p>
<p>alleged incident or incidents in which the individual or group was allegedly involved. A 
</p>
<p>review is conducted to determine whether information linking identified perpetrators to 
</p>
<p>crimes or violations has been corroborated to the Commission&#8217;s standard of proof. 
</p>
<p>100. An individual or entity is placed on the final list when there are &#8220;reasonable grounds 
</p>
<p>to believe&#8221; that a crime or violation has occurred and the individual or unit listed was 
</p>
<p>involved in the manner described. A number of unit commanders and armed group leaders 
</p>
<p>have been listed on the basis of their command responsibility. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Categories of alleged perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>101. In March 2015, the Commission will deliver a fifth list of alleged perpetrators to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Previous documents have included 
</p>
<p>commanders of army and security units, including heads of detention facilities and other 
</p>
<p>individuals operating under the command of the Government or in its support, and 
</p>
<p>commanders of non-State armed groups, including the so-called &#8220;emirs&#8221; of radical groups, 
</p>
<p>once their responsibility for crimes and violations has been established in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the Commission&#8217;s standard of proof.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The search for justice  
</b></p>
<p>102. As the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic has yet to be referred to the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court , the Commission acknowledges that other options to pursue 
</p>
<p>criminal justice must be explored. Given that the Court would focus on persons allegedly 
</p>
<p>most responsible, the majority of additional cases would have to be taken up by other 
</p>
<p>international or national mechanisms. As the use of foreign fighters by extremist groups has 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 See A/HRC/22/59, annex XIV. </p>


<p>proliferated, many States have shown a willingness to investigate and prosecute their own 
</p>
<p>citizens suspected of committing crimes in the Syrian conflict. 
</p>
<p>103. After monitoring national proceedings for more than three years, the Commission 
</p>
<p>has determined that Syrian national courts are not, at this time, an effective mechanism 
</p>
<p>through which to pursue justice. The Commission has yet to identify evidence that Syrian 
</p>
<p>courts have either the will or capacity to fulfil international obligations to prosecute 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of serious international crimes.  
</p>
<p>104. The Counter-terrorism Court, regular criminal courts, ad hoc military field courts 
</p>
<p>and various local religious courts in areas controlled by the Government appear to operate 
</p>
<p>in an arbitrary manner without fair trial guarantees. Similarly, religious courts operating in 
</p>
<p>areas under the control of non-State armed groups, including ISIS and Jabhat Al-Nusra, fail 
</p>
<p>to operate in a manner consistent with international standards, resulting in miscarriages of 
</p>
<p>justice.  
</p>
<p>105. The Counter-terrorism Court and field military courts seem to rely almost 
</p>
<p>exclusively on forced confessions and information acquired through torture to obtain 
</p>
<p>convictions. As a result, the Commission is concerned that the Syrian criminal justice 
</p>
<p>system currently violates international rights to due process and fair trial, exacerbating and 
</p>
<p>compounding the suffering of victims of the armed conflict.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Assistance to national prosecutions 
</b></p>
<p>106. To further promote accountability, the Commission has shared information &#8211; where 
</p>
<p>the consent of the interviewee was obtained &#8211; with the justice systems of States willing to 
</p>
<p>exercise their national jurisdiction over crimes committed in the Syrian Arab Republic. As 
</p>
<p>foreign fighters return home from battlefields in the country, there has been an increase in 
</p>
<p>requests from these States over the past six months. 
</p>
<p>107. Some States have also indicated a willingness to assert universal jurisdiction to 
</p>
<p>pursue criminal investigations against suspected perpetrators, including foreign nationals, in 
</p>
<p>the armed conflict. In the event that a State were to gain custody over such perpetrators and 
</p>
<p>their national courts were to meet international fair trial standards, the Commission would 
</p>
<p>be willing to share its information upon request.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Additional measures in the search for justice 
</b></p>
<p>108.  In its resolution 2178 (2014), the Security Council emphasized the need for States to 
</p>
<p>address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism. The Commission supports the 
</p>
<p>call made by the Council in that resolution for States to consider a full range of measures to 
</p>
<p>combat the root causes of extremism through education, public policy and engagement with 
</p>
<p>communities at risk of recruitment.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Shared responsibility 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Failure to reach a political solution  
</b></p>
<p>109. Although a number of initiatives have been introduced to put an end to the four-year 
</p>
<p>old conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, to date they have fallen short of achieving a 
</p>
<p>political solution. Notable among those was the six-point peace plan presented by the Joint 
</p>
<p>Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States on the Syrian Crisis, </p>


<p>Kofi Annan, on 27 March 2012. The plan principally called upon the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic to engage in an encompassing political process, to cease military 
</p>
<p>hostilities and to allow humanitarian aid to areas affected by the fighting. Shortly 
</p>
<p>afterwards, in April 2012, the United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic was appointed with the aim of monitoring the declared ceasefire to which the 
</p>
<p>Government and armed opposition had initially committed. On 16 June, the mission was 
</p>
<p>suspended when hostilities resumed.  
</p>
<p>110. The final communiqu&#233; of the Action Group for Syria (Geneva communiqu&#233;), issued 
</p>
<p>in June 2012,11 remains one of the most serious attempts to resolve the conflict politically. 
</p>
<p>It provides a road map for a peaceful transfer of power through the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>transitional governing body with executive powers. After his appointment in August 2012, 
</p>
<p>the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States, 
</p>
<p>Lakhdar Brahimi, immediately called for the implementation of the terms of the Geneva 
</p>
<p>communiqu&#233;. After months of negotiations and a persistent diplomatic push by the United 
</p>
<p>States of America and the Russian Federation with the parties to the conflict, a conference 
</p>
<p>(&#8220;Geneva II&#8221;) was held in Montreux, Switzerland, on 23 January 2014. Negotiations broke 
</p>
<p>down after two rounds of talks between the Government and the opposition, mostly 
</p>
<p>represented by the Syrian National Coalition (SNC). The main issue of contention centred 
</p>
<p>on priorities on the negotiation agenda, given that the Government insisted on addressing 
</p>
<p>terrorism before engaging on issues pertaining to the transitional government, which the 
</p>
<p>SNC rejected. 
</p>
<p>111.  The prospects for a political solution have been further complicated by the 
</p>
<p>multiplication of armed actors on the ground. The drastic territorial expansion of ISIS 
</p>
<p>coupled with the continued fragmentation of FSA-affiliated groups has made it impossible 
</p>
<p>to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire or broader political agreement. It has further 
</p>
<p>weakened the stance of the SNC as its leverage over these groups progressively declined. 
</p>
<p>Recent efforts have been geared towards &#8220;harmonizing&#8221; the relations of SNC with 
</p>
<p>influential armed groups on the ground, while also engaging with the internal political 
</p>
<p>opposition. The latest meeting in Cairo, held on 22 January 2015 between the SNC and 
</p>
<p>members of the internal opposition, was specifically aimed at creating a common platform. 
</p>
<p>A final 10-point document was endorsed by a majority of participating members. It called 
</p>
<p>for a peaceful transition to a democratic and civil system, while stressing that the Geneva 
</p>
<p>communiqu&#233; remained the basis for negotiations with the Government. 
</p>
<p>112. The initiative taken by the Russian Federation in January 2015 was aimed at bringing 
</p>
<p>together members of the opposition and the Government. The main external opposition 
</p>
<p>bloc, the SNC, declined the invitation, while members from various internal opposition 
</p>
<p>groups agree to attend. Consensus was reached on the need to preserve the sovereignty and 
</p>
<p>unity of the Syrian Arab Republic; the rejection of foreign interference; fighting terrorism 
</p>
<p>as a priority; and ending the civil war through peaceful means. 
</p>
<p>113. The expansion of extremist groups has also hardened the negotiating position of the 
</p>
<p>Government and its willingness to make concessions. The Government has consistently set 
</p>
<p>the end of external military support to armed groups and the so-called &#8220;fight against 
</p>
<p>terrorism&#8221; as preconditions for any political or transitional process. It has also refused to 
</p>
<p>recognise the SNC as a unified entity and has instead focused its efforts on engaging with 
</p>
<p>the internally tolerated opposition. 
</p>
<p>114.  The current step-by-step approach adopted by Special Envoy of the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General Staffan de Mistura aims to address the fragmentation of the conflict by focusing on 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 A/66/865&#8211;S/2012/522, annex.. </p>


<p>a localized freeze of hostilities in Aleppo city. It emphasizes a bottom-up approach to 
</p>
<p>resolving the conflict through the reinforcement of localized agreements that can be 
</p>
<p>replicated on a larger scale, facilitating a gradual transition towards a wider political 
</p>
<p>solution. No specific plan has been presented to date, but success of the Aleppo freeze will 
</p>
<p>be a litmus test for the success of this model in other areas.  
</p>
<p>115. While a gradual transition with solid confidence-building measures could reduce 
</p>
<p>hostilities locally and improve humanitarian conditions, it will ultimately need to address a 
</p>
<p>longer-term perspective. Although the Geneva communiqu&#233; provided an framework for a 
</p>
<p>political settlement, contentious issues remain, including the scope and nature of the 
</p>
<p>opposition&#8217;s representation in any transitional arrangement. President Assad&#8217;s role in the 
</p>
<p>transitional phase remains a deeply contentious issue among the parties. These aspects must 
</p>
<p>be addressed before a lasting agreement can be seriously contemplated. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Involvement of external actors 
</b></p>
<p>116. Beyond the internal escalation, triggered in March 2011 by the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force against largely unarmed protests, several external actors have 
</p>
<p>contributed to the militarization process that transformed the unrest into a brutal civil war.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Involvement of influential States on both sides of the conflict 
</b></p>
<p>117. Since the uprising began, some States have endeavoured to influence the conduct of 
</p>
<p>various parties according to their geopolitical interests. Their support extended to the 
</p>
<p>financial and military realms, giving the warring parties, though unequally, the required 
</p>
<p>capabilities to escalate or at least maintain their engagement. In particular, countries in the 
</p>
<p>region are competing for influence over the belligerents, gradually transforming the Syrian 
</p>
<p>crisis into a regional contest.  
</p>
<p>118. Critical financial and military assistance injected by different States into the conflict 
</p>
<p>has fuelled the warring parties&#8217; unwillingness to compromise as they continued to believe 
</p>
<p>that they could prevail militarily. The limited efforts of the international community to 
</p>
<p>restore peace and stability in the region have been jeopardized by some States&#8217; continuous 
</p>
<p>support for the parties, to the advantage of hard-liners on all sides. 
</p>
<p>119. The consistent support provided to the Government by its international backers, in 
</p>
<p>terms of military equipment, advice and training, encouraged it to persist in its military and 
</p>
<p>security approach based on the excessive use of force. Such support enabled it to adjust the 
</p>
<p>posture, capabilities and structure of its forces to asymmetric fighting against the escalating 
</p>
<p>armed violence. 
</p>
<p>120.  States supporting the opposition have also provided various groups and coalitions 
</p>
<p>with lethal and non-lethal military equipment. Owing to self-imposed restrictions, the scale 
</p>
<p>and policy of this support never gave these groups the required capabilities to seriously 
</p>
<p>challenge government forces in the medium and long terms. Despite all the precautions 
</p>
<p>allegedly taken by the States steering the process, the support given to the so-called 
</p>
<p>&#8220;moderates&#8221; has ultimately consolidated the dominance of extremist groups such as ISIS 
</p>
<p>and Jabhat Al-Nusra, which managed to overrun the positions of moderates and to gain 
</p>
<p>loyalties among their ranks.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Involvement of non-State actors from neighbouring States  
</b></p>
<p>121. Several non-State actors from States in the region have participated in the war either 
</p>
<p>through the direct deployment of their forces or by the provision of logistical and financial 
</p>
<p>support to one side or the other. Their entry has been facilitated by the porosity of large 
</p>
<p>parts of the Syrian borders. </p>


<p>122. The increasing engagement of these players has led to a spillover of violence into 
</p>
<p>their countries of origin. The military intervention of Hizbullah and Iraqi Shia militia on the 
</p>
<p>side of the Government and the involvement of thousands of extremist militants in support 
</p>
<p>of the rebels have heightened the pre-existing risks of instability in neighbouring States. 
</p>
<p>The continuous armed confrontations in northern Lebanon and the rise of ISIS and its 
</p>
<p>subsequent offensive in Iraq are indicators of the increased regionalization of the crisis. 
</p>
<p>123. Owing to their background and the narrative they use to justify their presence and 
</p>
<p>operations in the Syrian Arab Republic, non-State actors have accentuated violence along 
</p>
<p>sectarian lines, further aggravating religious and ethnic divisions.  
</p>
<p>124. Non-State players have also fuelled the radicalization of the belligerents, in 
</p>
<p>particular of armed groups. In supporting the anti-government armed groups, charity 
</p>
<p>organizations and private donors interested in the spread of extreme ideologies have 
</p>
<p>privileged groups willing to endorse their beliefs.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Flow of foreign fighters resulting in the rise of extremism and terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>125. Predominantly driven by hardline religious ideology, foreign fighters who joined 
</p>
<p>non-State armed groups initially gained prominence among their counterparts owing to 
</p>
<p>their efficient involvement in both operational and governance activities. The respect they 
</p>
<p>secured or the fear they enforced among local communities in areas held by armed groups 
</p>
<p>has enabled them to influence the landscape in the direction of extremism.  
</p>
<p>126. The engagement of foreign fighters has benefited the extremist groups, such as ISIS 
</p>
<p>and Jabhat Al-Nusra. These groups, designated as terrorist groups under Security Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 2170 (2014), have used their fighting skills and, more importantly, their ability to 
</p>
<p>use their ideology to effectively mobilize and recruit fighters. This has accentuated the 
</p>
<p>supremacy that these groups have gained over the mainstream armed groups throughout the 
</p>
<p>war, particularly in 2014. 
</p>
<p>127. These fighters have driven the radicalization process in areas held by armed groups. 
</p>
<p>Besides their military engagement, they have also played a prominent role in religious, 
</p>
<p>educational and judiciary &#8220;systems&#8221; established in these areas. Control of these 
</p>
<p>fundamental aspects of civilian life will further radicalize communities under their 
</p>
<p>authority.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Responsibility of the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>128. After more than two years of inaction on the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic, the 
</p>
<p>Security Council adopted resolution 2118 in September 2013, in which it required the 
</p>
<p>verification and destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, calling for the convening of 
</p>
<p>the Geneva II peace talks and endorsing the establishment of a transitional governing body 
</p>
<p>with full executive powers.  
</p>
<p>129. As the crisis worsened, the Security Council adopted resolution 2139 in February 
</p>
<p>2014. In the resolution, the Council requested that all parties, in particular the Government, 
</p>
<p>allow humanitarian access across conflict lines, in besieged areas and across borders. The 
</p>
<p>scope of resolution 2139 (2014) was broadened with the adoption of resolution 2165 
</p>
<p>(2014), in which the Council authorized cross-border and cross-line access for the United 
</p>
<p>Nations and its partners to deliver humanitarian aid without State consent. In its resolution 
</p>
<p>2191, adopted in December 2014, the Council renewed its authorization to use routes across 
</p>
<p>conflict lines as well as specified border crossings. It also renewed the monitoring 
</p>
<p>mechanism created by that resolution. </p>


<p>130. In monthly briefings to the Security Council to follow up on the implementation of 
</p>
<p>resolutions 2139 (2014) and 2165 (2014), the Under-Secretary-General and Emergency 
</p>
<p>Relief Coordinator reported on the severe constraints and challenges still obstructing 
</p>
<p>humanitarian access and highlighted issues relating to civilian protection. On 15 December 
</p>
<p>2014, she appealed to the Council to ensure that the parties to the conflict complied with 
</p>
<p>resolution 2139 (2014) in its entirety. Although not specifically adopted in the context of 
</p>
<p>the Syrian Arab Republic, resolution 2175 (2014) decried the increasingly common 
</p>
<p>incidences of violence against participants in humanitarian operations, as well as the attacks 
</p>
<p>on humanitarian convoys and destruction and looting of their assets. 
</p>
<p>131. In resolution 2170 (2014), the Security Council expressed its gravest concern that 
</p>
<p>territory in parts of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic was under the control of ISIS and Al-
</p>
<p>Nusra, placed six individuals affiliated with the groups on its Al-Qaida sanctions list, and 
</p>
<p>threatened measures against those who financed, recruited or supplied weapons to them. It 
</p>
<p>affirmed the need for accountability for perpetrators of violations in Iraq and the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic. In its resolution 2178 (2014), the Council expanded the counter-terrorism 
</p>
<p>framework by imposing obligations on Member States to respond to the threat of foreign 
</p>
<p>fighters. 
</p>
<p>132. The failure of the Security Council to reach consensus on accountability, however, 
</p>
<p>has allowed perpetrators to continue to operate with impunity. In May 2014, the Council 
</p>
<p>failed to adopt a draft resolution calling for the referral of the situation in the Syrian Arab 
</p>
<p>Republic to the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>133. In the light of the manifest failure of the Government to protect its population from 
</p>
<p>gross human rights abuses, the international community, through the United Nations, bears 
</p>
<p>the responsibility of protecting the Syrian population from such crimes. The Commission 
</p>
<p>looks forward to specific action by the United Nations to urgently adopt and implement a 
</p>
<p>common &#8220;human rights up front&#8221; strategy to ensure that all engagement with the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Arab Republic effectively takes into account and addresses the grave human rights 
</p>
<p>situation. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>134. <b>In the report, the Commission has taken stock of seminal developments in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Syrian Arab Republic over the past four years, highlighting key trends that have 
</b></p>
<p><b>characterized the conflict. The situation has degenerated from legitimate popular 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspirations into a conflagration of an unparalleled scale and magnitude.  
</b></p>
<p>135.<b> Missed humanitarian opportunities have been aggravated by the exponential 
</b></p>
<p><b>rise in the perpetration of war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations. The civilian population continues to bear the brunt of the pain and 
</b></p>
<p><b>suffering, while the perpetrators are shielded from accountability. The responsibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>for this unrelenting tragedy is shared by a variety of national, regional and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international actors. 
</b></p>
<p>136.<b> From the angle of humanitarian access and protection of civilians, the challenge 
</b></p>
<p><b>is to adopt more assertive measures to ensure compliance by integrating human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>into the totality of the United Nations system to protect victims more effectively, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>due regard for gender sensibility and the specific needs of children.  
</b></p>
<p>137.<b> </b>The current military stalemate is presaged by the Commission&#8217;s reminder that 
</p>
<p><b>there is no military solution to the conflict. An all-inclusive political process towards </b></p>


<p><b>peace remains imperative. Any further delay or inaction will only contribute to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>spread of extremism, the surge in foreign fighters, terrorism and the destabilization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the region. 
</b></p>
<p>138.<b> That perpetrators have, for more than four years, committed crimes that shock 
</b></p>
<p><b>the conscience of humanity raises questions about the inadequacy of the response of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the international community. The Syrian authorities have demonstrated their 
</b></p>
<p><b>unwillingness to bring perpetrators to justice. Extremism and terrorism proliferate 
</b></p>
<p><b>daily, with groups such as ISIS and Al-Nusra carrying out unspeakable atrocities.  
</b></p>
<p>139.<b> Considering the gravity of the findings of the Commission, it is crucial for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international community to adopt a common and effective strategy to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity gap in the Syrian Arab Republic. The referral of the situation in the Syrian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Arab Republic to the International Criminal Court through the Security Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains a key option; however, the current lack of consensus among the permanent 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of the Council invites the urgent consideration of establishing an 
</b></p>
<p><b>international ad hoc tribunal.  
</b></p>
<p>140.<b> The long-standing position of the Commission has been that its investigation 
</b></p>
<p><b>methodology does not meet the normal requirements of due process, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequently, alleged perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity should 
</b></p>
<p><b>not be named. After four years of intensive monitoring and the submission of four 
</b></p>
<p><b>confidential lists of perpetrators, however, not to publish names at this juncture of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation would be to reinforce the impunity that the Commission was mandated 
</b></p>
<p><b>to combat.  
</b></p>
<p>141.<b> The Commission deems that it should interpret its mandate in a way that is 
</b></p>
<p><b>most conducive to the protection of the victims of the conflict and their right to the 
</b></p>
<p>truth. It is the Commission&#8217;s hope that putting alleged perpetrators on notice will 
</p>
<p><b>serve to maximize the potential deterrent effect of the findings of the Commission and

<p><b>Annex II  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Violations documented between 15 July 2014 and 15 January 
2015 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Massacres and other unlawful killing 
</b></p>
<p>1. In October 2013, following the request of the Human Rights Council to investigate 
</p>
<p>all massacres,a the commission adopted the following working definition of a massacre: 
</p>
<p>An intentional mass killing of civilians not directly participating in hostilities, or hors de 
</p>
<p>combat fighters, by organized armed forces or groups in a single incident, in violation of 
</p>
<p>international human rights or humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>2. Massacres include multiple instances of the war crime of murder, the war crime of 
</p>
<p>attacking civilians, and the war crime of sentencing or execution without due process. 
</p>
<p>When murder is committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a 
</p>
<p>civilian population, perpetrated pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational 
</p>
<p>policy, the commission of massacres may amount to the crime against humanity of murder. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>3. Throughout the reporting period, the Government has continued to heavily shell and 
</p>
<p>bombard areas of Syria held by anti-Government armed groups and ISIS. These attacks 
</p>
<p>have often resulted in mass civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>4.  Where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the shelling, bombardments or 
</p>
<p>bombings intentionally targeted civilians, such attacks fall within the definition of a 
</p>
<p>massacre.  
</p>
<p>5.  On the morning of 9 August 2014, a Government helicopter dropped a barrel bomb 
</p>
<p>on a crowded vegetable market in Al-Maadi district of Aleppo city. According to first 
</p>
<p>responders at the scene, the barrel-bomb killed 20 civilians, including one entire family. 
</p>
<p>Some people died when they were buried under rubble as a nearby building collapsed. 
</p>
<p>Dozens were injured.  
</p>
<p>6. On 11 September, a Government helicopter dropped a barrel bomb on a livestock 
</p>
<p>market in Al-Bab (Aleppo), a town under the control of ISIS. The livestock market, held 
</p>
<p>every Thursday, is the biggest in Aleppo governorate and attracts people from the 
</p>
<p>surrounding countryside and bordering governorates. The barrel bomb killed at least 21 
</p>
<p>civilians and injured over a dozen more. A significant amount of livestock was killed. 
</p>
<p>There were no indications of any military targets inside or near the livestock market. 
</p>
<p>7. One week later, on 18 September, a Government helicopter again dropped barrel 
</p>
<p>bombs on Al-Bab (Aleppo). One barrel bomb hit a bakery, where people were queuing for 
</p>
<p>bread. This bomb killed 35 people and injured many others. A second barrel bomb hit Al-
</p>
<p>Bab covered market, killing shoppers and vendors inside. The bomb set fuel stores in the 
</p>
<p>market ablaze, further increasing civilian casualties. This attack killed 20 civilians, 
</p>
<p>including women and children. Approximately 80 people were injured. The nearest ISIS 
</p>
<p>military position was 1 kilometre away. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> a HRC resolution 21/26, para. 19. </p>


<p>8. On approximately 9 October, Government forces aerially bombarded Irbin market, 
</p>
<p>near Hammourieh in eastern Ghouta (Rif Damascus), killing scores of civilians and injuring 
</p>
<p>many others. There were reportedly no military targets in the area. 
</p>
<p>9. On 6 November, a Government helicopter targeted Al-Muwaslat neighbourhood in 
</p>
<p>Aleppo city, dropping two barrel bombs. The bombs hit a residential neighbourhood, killing 
</p>
<p>20 people including women and children and injured dozens more. 
</p>
<p>10. Also on 6 November, a Government helicopter dropped two consecutive barrel 
</p>
<p>bombs on Al-Shaar neighbourhood. The first bomb killed civilians in its area of impact, 
</p>
<p>while others were buried in the rubble of a building which collapsed. As people rushed to 
</p>
<p>help the buried and wounded, they were targeted by the second barrel bomb. 
</p>
<p>Approximately 15 people were killed, most of whom were women and children. Dozens 
</p>
<p>were injured. Some of the wounded later died in field hospitals, reportedly as a result of 
</p>
<p>lack of necessary medical supplies. 
</p>
<p>11. On 10 December, Government forces stationed in Al-Ramousa (Aleppo) fired 
</p>
<p>artillery shells into Al-Mashed neighbourhood of Aleppo city. Twelve people were killed, 
</p>
<p>including two children. Eight were injured. 
</p>
<p>12.  The Government has continued its campaign of aerial bombardment in Aleppo and 
</p>
<p>Rif Damascus. There are an increasing number of reports of aerial bombardments across Ar 
</p>
<p>Raqqah and Al Hsakah districts. These remain under investigation. 
</p>
<p>13. The Government&#8217;s aerial attacks, directed at civilians, are consistent with the 
</p>
<p>Government forces&#8217; counterinsurgency strategy. Employed since 2012, the strategy 
</p>
<p>includes creating conditions of life so unbearable that the civilian population living in 
</p>
<p>armed-group-controlled areas displace, eroding possible bases of supporting for the groups. 
</p>
<p>14. While the commission has received multiple, consistent accounts of deaths in 
</p>
<p>Government detention facilities, it was not possible to confirm that multiple deaths 
</p>
<p>occurred in a single incident, as required under its definition of &#8216;massacre&#8217;. These deaths 
</p>
<p>are documented below in the section on Other Unlawful Killing. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Anti-Government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>15. During and immediately prior to the reporting period, armed groups operating in and 
</p>
<p>around the Al-Salamiyah area of Hama governorate attacked and killed civilians.  
</p>
<p>16. Shortly after an attack on Khattab village (Hama) on 17 June 2014 which killed 
</p>
<p>three men, including one soldier who was home on leave, an armed group again attacked 
</p>
<p>the village. In the course of this attack, fighters killed 16 people. Some victims had their 
</p>
<p>throats cut and some of the bodies were reportedly mutilated. At least one victim was a 
</p>
<p>pregnant woman. No group has claimed responsibility for this attack. 
</p>
<p>17. On 10 July 2014, armed groups entered Al-Rahjan village, the home of the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s then Defence Minister. After killing soldiers guarding the residence, fighters 
</p>
<p>moved through the village killing civilians living there. One interviewee described fighters 
</p>
<p>shouting that the family were infidels, while dragging a male family member out of the 
</p>
<p>house and executing him. While the fighters appeared focussed on killing fighting-age men, 
</p>
<p>the killing of women and children was also documented. Jabhat Al-Nusra and Tajamu 
</p>
<p>Ajnad Al-Sham claimed responsibility for this attack. 
</p>
<p>18. In early August, members of an armed group attacked Tal Al-Muzairia village, 
</p>
<p>home to an Ismaili Muslim community. Most of those killed were adult men. A 12-year-old 
</p>
<p>girl was also killed. Three children, including one toddler, were seriously injured. The 
</p>
<p>attackers also stole cattle and livestock. Tal Al-Muzairia had been attacked previously in </p>


<p>February 2014, when the armed group reportedly killed an elderly man. In both incidents, 
</p>
<p>those interviewed stated they believed the armed group responsible was based in Rastan in 
</p>
<p>northern Homs. 
</p>
<p>19. In the early hours of 1 September 2014, double car bombs exploded in Housh Beit 
</p>
<p>Zidan, a village in the Taldara countryside (Hama). The first car bomb exploded as the car 
</p>
<p>made its way along a secondary road on the eastern side of the village. It killed two people 
</p>
<p>and injured nine others. Among the injured were four children who lost limbs. 
</p>
<p>Approximately 20 minutes later, a second car bomb exploded, this time on a secondary 
</p>
<p>road on the western side of the village. It killed six members of one family. No group 
</p>
<p>claimed responsibility for this attack. 
</p>
<p>20. On 1 October 2014, two bombs exploded near two schools, the El-Makhzoumi and 
</p>
<p>Mohdatha schools in the Akrama neighbourhood of Homs city. The first explosion occurred 
</p>
<p>shortly after children were leaving school, reportedly killing at least 30 boys and girls. Ten 
</p>
<p>minutes later, another bomb was detonated. Reports indicate that the second bombing was 
</p>
<p>the result of a suicide bomber exploding himself near the entrance of the Makhzoumi 
</p>
<p>school, ushering those fleeing the first blast into the school. There were no military targets 
</p>
<p>in the area. While it has not been possible to confirm the number killed, the casualties 
</p>
<p>included children, some of whom were torn apart in the blasts. No group claimed 
</p>
<p>responsibility for this attack. 
</p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) 
</i></p>
<p>21. ISIS has carried out massacres of civilians and captured soldiers in Ar Raqqah, 
</p>
<p>Homs, and Dayr az Zawr. While eyewitness accounts were collected, in several incidents, 
</p>
<p>the killings were carried out in isolated locations and the bodies of the victims were neither 
</p>
<p>displayed by the group nor able to be retrieved by the families. The group has published 
</p>
<p>photographs and videos of the killings and acknowledged their responsibility for them 
</p>
<p>publicly.  
</p>
<p>22.  By mid-2014, ISIS had besieged the 17th Division&#8217;s base in Raqqah city and the 
</p>
<p>Tabqa airbase, two of the last Syrian army positions in Ar Raqqah governorate. When the 
</p>
<p>17th Division base fell on 25 July 2014, the armed group killed the soldiers captured inside 
</p>
<p>and later beheaded many of their corpses. Residents of Raqqah city and Slouk described 
</p>
<p>that, in the days that followed the attack, ISIS displayed the bodies and heads in the town 
</p>
<p>squares. Videos, some recorded by the group, showed children looking at the mutilated 
</p>
<p>corpses. 
</p>
<p>23. By 23 August 2014, the group had launched its final assault on Tabqa airbase. As it 
</p>
<p>became apparent that the base would fall to ISIS, some soldiers fled across the desert. 
</p>
<p>While a few made it to the safety of army positions many miles away, others were captured 
</p>
<p>and killed in small groups in nearby towns, such as Slouk and Tabqa. 
</p>
<p>24. Over two hundred men, most captured still inside the Tabqa airbase, were stripped to 
</p>
<p>their underwear and forced to walk into the desert. A video of this forced march was 
</p>
<p>recorded and later distributed by ISIS. A later video showed hundreds of bodies lying dead 
</p>
<p>in the sand, bearing gunshot wounds to the head.  
</p>
<p>25. On 16 November 2014, ISIS released another video in which they cut the throats of 
</p>
<p>18 captured soldiers. A family member of one of the men executed in this video stated that 
</p>
<p>he recognised his relative who had been a serving soldier at the Tabqa airbase at the time of 
</p>
<p>the August attack. It appears, however, that others had been captured from other locations, 
</p>
<p>including during ISIS&#8217;s overrunning of the 17th Division in Ar Raqqah in late July 2014. 
</p>
<p>26. In mid-July 2014, ISIS fighters seized the Sha&#8217;ar gas field in eastern Homs, killing 
</p>
<p>an alleged 350 people in close quarters after capturing the area. Among those killed were 
</p>
<p>technicians and other staff working at the gas fields and their family members, including </p>


<p>children. The body of a doctor who was killed in the attack was found on 27 July in his 
</p>
<p>medical clinic, with his hands tied and having been shot at close range. The family of a 
</p>
<p>civilian guard at the facility received his body at the hospital in Homs city. He had been 
</p>
<p>shot twice in the head. The family also saw the bodies of women and children who had 
</p>
<p>been killed in the attack. Another family collected the body of their son, a technician at the 
</p>
<p>oil fields, from the same hospital. He took had been shot in the head. Civilian residents of 
</p>
<p>nearby villages, such as Al-Mahfoura, were also killed in the attack.  
</p>
<p>27. In August 2014, ISIS attacked and killed several hundred members of the Al-Sheitat 
</p>
<p>tribe of eastern Dayr az Zawr. The tribe had its own militia which, earlier in the conflict, 
</p>
<p>had been affiliated with the FSA. Some Al-Sheitat tribesmen had, by 2013, become part of 
</p>
<p>Jabhat Al-Nusra, which had allowed the tribe to continue to exercise control over its 
</p>
<p>territory and to continue to extract oil from the oilfields located there.  
</p>
<p>28. In the summer of 2014, fighting broke out between Jabhat Al-Nusra and ISIS over 
</p>
<p>control of territory &#8211; and in particular, the oilfields &#8211; in eastern Dayr az Zawr. While the 
</p>
<p>massacre of the Al-Sheitat tribe in Dayr az Zawr in August 2014 occurred as part of a 
</p>
<p>struggle for control of oil resources near the town of Mohassan, the circumstances 
</p>
<p>surrounding the killings are complex. The clashes between ISIS and Al-Sheitat, which 
</p>
<p>preceded the massacre, related more broadly to control of the eastern provinces of Dayr az 
</p>
<p>Zawr and were an epilogue to the fighting which had erupted in April 2013 between ISIS 
</p>
<p>and Jabhat Al-Nusra, as well as the local tribes that had been aligned to each of these 
</p>
<p>groups. 
</p>
<p>29.  During the initial days of the fighting, ISIS attacked oil fields under the control of 
</p>
<p>Al-Sheitat and captured 85 workers, including some minors. The following day, they 
</p>
<p>released photographs of their executions. In the days following these killings, ISIS shelled 
</p>
<p>Al-Sheitat villages and then entered the villages, killing its male residents, including 
</p>
<p>children and the elderly. Some civilians were also killed while fleeing. ISIS released several 
</p>
<p>videos showing the killing perpetrated by its fighters. 
</p>
<p>30.  ISIS publicly displayed the bodies of some of those killed. One survivor described 
</p>
<p>seeing &#8220;many heads hanging on walls while I and my family escaped.&#8221; Individuals living 
</p>
<p>nearby reported seeing freshly dug mass graves.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Other unlawful killing 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>31. In the reporting period, deaths of men, women and children at the hands of the 
</p>
<p>Government have occurred in two distinct contexts. The first is the death of those held in 
</p>
<p>Government detention facilities and prisons. The second are those killed during 
</p>
<p>Government attacks, both on contested towns and villages and those under the control of 
</p>
<p>anti-Government armed groups and ISIS. In this latter context, civilians were killed by 
</p>
<p>snipers as well as a result of the indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks by the 
</p>
<p>Government. 
</p>
<p><i>Deaths in detention 
</i></p>
<p>32. Since the unrest in Syria began, the Government has arrested and detained 
</p>
<p>thousands. As detailed in this and previous reports, many are taken into and moved among 
</p>
<p>Government detention facilities, including its intelligence and security agencies, and its 
</p>
<p>prisons. Most detainees held longer than a matter of weeks are eventually transferred to 
</p>
<p>detention facilities in Damascus and Rif Damascus governorates. In these facilities, 
</p>
<p>consistent reports of deaths of detainees held in Government custody have most frequently 
</p>
<p>been documented. </p>


<p>33. In this reporting period, multiple, consistent accounts of the deaths of detainees have 
</p>
<p>been recorded in Air Force Intelligences branches at Mezzeh Military Airport and Harasta; 
</p>
<p>Military Security branches 215 (Raids branch), 227 (Damascus regional branch) and 235 
</p>
<p>(Palestine branch); and Sednaya prison.  
</p>
<p>34. Most accounts of deaths come from the deceased&#8217;s cellmates or former detainees. In 
</p>
<p>some cases, family members were informed of the deaths and received the bodies of their 
</p>
<p>relatives. In every case where a body was returned, it bore marks of severe torture. 
</p>
<p>35. People died in custody as a result of acts and omissions on the part of the 
</p>
<p>Government authorities. Some are killed while being tortured in interrogation sessions or 
</p>
<p>during beatings by prison guards in the cells. In some cases, detainees are returned to the 
</p>
<p>cells with life-threatening injuries to which they soon succumb.  
</p>
<p>36. Injuries sustained as a result of torture became fatal due to the victims&#8217; receiving 
</p>
<p>little or, more often, no medical treatment. In other instances, detainees had pre-existing 
</p>
<p>conditions such as diabetes, asthma or high blood pressure. The lack of medical care, 
</p>
<p>coupled with the conditions of detention, led to easily preventable deaths of detainees.  
</p>
<p>37. The severe overcrowding and squalid conditions of detention have led to inmates&#8217; 
</p>
<p>becoming extremely ill &#8211; chronic diarrhoea and skin infections were often reported. The 
</p>
<p>lack of medical treatment, access to toilet and shower facilities, adequate food and potable 
</p>
<p>water led to the physical weakening and eventual death of detainees. Some detainees who 
</p>
<p>lost substantial body weight, had on-going injuries and were still undergoing torture in 
</p>
<p>interrogations and while detained in cells did not have the physical stamina required to 
</p>
<p>continue to survive inside Government detention centres. 
</p>
<p>38. There has been an increase in reports of family members being informed by the 
</p>
<p>Government of the death of their relatives. Multiple interviewees stated that they had been 
</p>
<p>directed to Tishreen Military Hospital in Barzah (Damascus) to collect a death certificate, 
</p>
<p>and occasionally their relative&#8217;s identification documents. The death certificates often 
</p>
<p>indicate that the detainee died of &#8220;cardiac arrest&#8221; or &#8220;stroke&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>39. Most families who receive death certificates did not receive the body. In response to 
</p>
<p>inquiries, Government authorities occasionally reportedly stated that the deceased had 
</p>
<p>already been buried. Some relatives of victims were told that bodies are buried in a mass 
</p>
<p>grave in Najha cemetery (Rif Damascus). Other than the death certificate, families received 
</p>
<p>no further documentation or proof that the victim died. 
</p>
<p>40. In late December 2013, a man was called for interrogation at a local intelligence 
</p>
<p>office in Damascus city and subsequently disappeared. A family member heard from a 
</p>
<p>detainee who had been held at branch 215, that the man had also been detained and had 
</p>
<p>died there after being tortured. The family visited a security branch in Damascus in late 
</p>
<p>2014 and received a death certificate issued by Tishreen Military Hospital. The death 
</p>
<p>certificate was dated in early October 2014 and stated that the relative had died in mid-July 
</p>
<p>2014. The cause of death was listed as &#8216;cardiac arrest&#8217;. The family never received the body. 
</p>
<p>The family of a man arrested during the Government attack on Hosh Arab (Rif Damascus) 
</p>
<p>was held in branch 227. His family received his death certificate from Tishreen Military 
</p>
<p>Hospital in May 2014, but did not receive the body. 
</p>
<p>41.  In mid-2014, a doctor was transferred from a detention facility in Damascus to Air 
</p>
<p>Force Intelligence in Mezzeh Military Airport where he was held until October. While 
</p>
<p>there, he witnessed the deaths of five other inmates. Two detainees died of pre-existing 
</p>
<p>medical conditions, aggravated by the conditions of detention and the lack of any medical 
</p>
<p>care. In both instances, the detainee informed the prison guards that the men were dying but 
</p>
<p>this elicited no response. In the case of the other deaths, the men had been severely tortured </p>


<p>and later died. Bodies remained in the cells for hours, sometimes overnight, before being 
</p>
<p>removed by the guards. 
</p>
<p>42. A female detainee held in branch 235 between April and August 2014 witnessed 
</p>
<p>male inmates being tortured. She also saw emaciated men being returned to their cells from 
</p>
<p>interrogations. During her detention, she saw four bodies being removed from the cells.  
</p>
<p>43.  A women&#8217;s husband and three sons were arrested by Government forces in town in 
</p>
<p>Rif Damascus in December 2013. She made attempts to locate them through official 
</p>
<p>channels but received no response. Their whereabouts were unknown until former detainees 
</p>
<p>informed her that they were being held in branch 235. Several months later, the Military 
</p>
<p>Police in her town informed her that her husband had died in custody. They were directed 
</p>
<p>to the Al-Qaboun Military Police in Damascus where they received her husband&#8217;s ID card 
</p>
<p>and a death certificate from Tishreen Military Hospital, stating her husband had died of a 
</p>
<p>heart attack. In the months that followed, she received the IDs and deaths certificates for 
</p>
<p>two of sons from Al-Qaboun Military Police. The death certificates were stamped as 
</p>
<p>originating from Tishreen Military Hospital. She was not permitted to receive the bodies 
</p>
<p>and was not informed of the place of burial. Despite continuing efforts, she does not know 
</p>
<p>the whereabouts of her remaining son. 
</p>
<p>44. There were multiple accounts of detainees dying in Sednaya prison (Rif Damascus) 
</p>
<p>in 2014. One detainee, released during this reporting period, witnessed the deaths of two 
</p>
<p>cellmates in February and March 2014 respectively. Both detainees died following severe 
</p>
<p>beatings with metal bars and cables by prison guards inside the cell. The corpses of the 
</p>
<p>deceased remained in the cell for several hours before being removed by the guards. 
</p>
<p>Another detainee held in Sednaya and released in July 2014, described a cellmate dying 
</p>
<p>after being left on the ground bleeding after a beating by prison guards. The same detainee 
</p>
<p>saw several detainees pass away between March and June 2014 after being extremely ill, 
</p>
<p>with severe diarrhoea. Another detainee, also detained in Sednaya during this time, 
</p>
<p>described the death of several other detainees in similar circumstances. 
</p>
<p>45. In many instances, families who were informed of the deaths of their relatives never 
</p>
<p>discovered where they had been held. In late 2013, intelligence officers detained several 
</p>
<p>students at a university in Damascus. In the case of one student, the family attempted 
</p>
<p>unsuccessfully to locate him. In October 2014, officers at branch 235 told the father to go to 
</p>
<p>Tishreen Military Hospital, where he received his son&#8217;s identification card and death 
</p>
<p>certificate. 
</p>
<p>46. The practice of producing official death certificates appears to be growing, but is not 
</p>
<p>consistent. It is apparent that the certificates are issued in order to misrepresent the causes 
</p>
<p>of death and conceal detainee abuse. Many families simply do not know what has happened 
</p>
<p>to their relatives after their initial arrest by Government forces or abduction by pro-
</p>
<p>Government militia. Such incidents amount to enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><i>Deaths by sniping, shelling and bombardments 
</i></p>
<p>47. Civilians have been deliberately targeted and killed by Government forces during 
</p>
<p>military attacks. Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks by Government forces have 
</p>
<p>also contributed significantly to civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>48. Government snipers, reported to be based near Al-Watani hospital, killed several 
</p>
<p>civilians in the Tariq Al-Sad neighbourhood of Dara&#8217;a city (Dara&#8217;a) between June and 
</p>
<p>September 2014.  
</p>
<p>49. Civilian deaths continue to be recorded as a result of the Government&#8217;s aerial 
</p>
<p>bombardment campaign on anti-Government armed-group-controlled areas of Aleppo city 
</p>
<p>as well in towns in Rif Damascus and Dara&#8217;a governorates. In the eastern neighbourhoods 
</p>
<p>of Aleppo city, notably Al-Sukkari, civilians were killed when barrel bombs were dropped </p>


<p>indiscriminately by Government helicopters flying at high altitudes. Government barrel-
</p>
<p>bombing also killed civilians in Qadi Askar neighbourhood in January, June and October 
</p>
<p>2014. 
</p>
<p>50. As the Government&#8217;s aerial bombardment in Dara&#8217;a governorate has intensified, 
</p>
<p>civilian casualties has climbed. Between June and August, Government rocket and barrel 
</p>
<p>bomb attacks on Tafas killed civilians. In one incident in August 2014, a barrel hit a home 
</p>
<p>that was close to a market, killing nine members of the same family. In early August, an 
</p>
<p>attack on Samlin hit a family home, killing a 12-year-old girl. 
</p>
<p>51. Multiple reports were received of civilians killed in Government attacks in locations 
</p>
<p>across Dara&#8217;a in October 2014. On 9 October, Government forces fired rockets into the 
</p>
<p>Tariq Al-Sad neighbourhood of Dara&#8217;a city, killing a six-year-old boy and critically 
</p>
<p>injuring his two sisters, 7 and 2 years old. In Al-Mahata market in Dara&#8217;a city, civilians 
</p>
<p>were killed in a barrel-bombing attack in mid-October 2014. On 19 October, a family of 
</p>
<p>five living in an armed-group-controlled neighbourhood were killed when a barrel-bomb 
</p>
<p>landed on their house as they sat down to dinner. 
</p>
<p>52. On 4 October, two civilians were killed and twelve others injured when a 
</p>
<p>Government artillery shell hit a vegetable shop in Inkhil. Two weeks later, on 19 October, 
</p>
<p>two farmers working their fields outside of Al-Mezeireeb village were killed by a rocket 
</p>
<p>launched by a Government plane. Attacks on Al-Mezeireeb, resulting in further civilian 
</p>
<p>casualties, reportedly continued on in November 2014. 
</p>
<p>53. Civilians have also been killed in indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks by the 
</p>
<p>Government on ISIS-controlled areas of Aleppo, Ar Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr, and Al 
</p>
<p>Hasakah governorates. 
</p>
<p>54. On 18 October, Government forces hit Al-Mahdom Bakery in Minbeij (Aleppo), 
</p>
<p>killing approximately 25 civilians working there. The Government has intensified its rocket 
</p>
<p>and barrel bomb attacks on Ar Raqqah governorate in recent months. On mid-October and 
</p>
<p>in late November, civilians living in Raqqah city were killed in indiscriminate airstrikes by 
</p>
<p>Government forces. One attack on an industrial area east of Raqqah city on 25 November, 
</p>
<p>resulted in extensive civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>55.  In July, civilians were killed in an airstrike on Al-Ashara (Dayr az Zawr). On 3 
</p>
<p>August, a Government airplane struck Al-Tayanna (Dayr az Zawr), killing six civilians. 
</p>
<p>Also in August, airstrikes seemingly targeted a municipality building being used as an ISIS 
</p>
<p>base in Al-Mayadin. The strike also hit a nearby market. This attack killed thirteen civilians 
</p>
<p>in the market at the time. On 3 September, a Government jet struck an ISIS checkpoint near 
</p>
<p>Al-Shula. While killing ISIS fighters, the disproportionate attack also killed 21 civilians, 
</p>
<p>most of them children, who were in a bus at the checkpoint at the time.  </p>
<p>56. Fighting has surged among Government forces, ISIS, YPG and local militias in 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods of Hasakah city and in towns and villages south of Qamishli. In August 
</p>
<p>2014, as ground fighting between the YPG and the Ahrar Al-Ghweran armed group was 
</p>
<p>taking place in Al-Ghweran neighbourhood of Hasakah city, Government forces shelled 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods indiscriminately, resulting in civilian casualties. On 12 August, 11 
</p>
<p>civilians were killed, including one child who bled to death following injuries from heavy 
</p>
<p>shelling by Government forces. 
</p>
<p><i>Findings 
</i></p>
<p>57.  Government forces perpetrated massacres and unlawful killings as part of a 
</p>
<p>widespread attack directed against the civilian population. The attack included widespread 
</p>
<p>shelling and bombardment of civilian-inhabited localities and the targeting of civilians for 
</p>
<p>arrest, detention and disappearance on the basis of their association or perceived opposition 
</p>
<p>to the Government. It is a continuation of the attack on the civilian population identified in </p>


<p>document A/HRC/25/65. The coordination and active participation of Government 
</p>
<p>institutions indicated that the attacks were conducted as a matter of institutional policy.  
</p>
<p>58. The massacres and unlawful killings formed part of those attacks and constitute 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity. Government forces also committed the war crime of murder and 
</p>
<p>has arbitrarily deprived people of life. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Anti-Government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>59. Anti-Government armed groups have killed civilians during ground attacks in Hama 
</p>
<p>governorate. They have also caused civilians deaths through indiscriminate shelling of 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods, villages and towns controlled by the Government. 
</p>
<p><i>Ground attacks 
</i></p>
<p>60. In mid-August 2014, fighters from an unidentified armed group entered a village in 
</p>
<p>the Al-Salamiyah countryside (Hama). Villagers fled at the sound of approaching gunfire. 
</p>
<p>The following day, residents returned and found the bodies of an elderly couple, who had 
</p>
<p>been too infirm to flee, and their daughter. They had been shot. The bodies had been cut 
</p>
<p>with a knife though it is unclear if those wounds were sustained before or after death. 
</p>
<p>Armed groups had reportedly shot and killed civilians travelling between Al-Qbaibat and 
</p>
<p>Al-Saboura in early 2014. It was not possible to identify the armed group to the 
</p>
<p>commission&#8217;s standard of proof. 
</p>
<p><i>Bombings and shelling 
</i></p>
<p>61. Armed groups have launched indiscriminate attacks on areas under Government 
</p>
<p>control in Hama, Damascus, Dara&#8217;a, and Aleppo, killing civilians. 
</p>
<p>62. Armed groups have increased their use of vehicle-borne and other improvised 
</p>
<p>explosive devices in Hama governorate. In August, two civilian men were killed by a 
</p>
<p>roadside bomb placed on the Al-Kafat &#8211; Taldara road. A few weeks later, in September, 
</p>
<p>another roadside IED was detonated as a car drove between Al-Kafat and Taldara. The 
</p>
<p>explosion killed a father and his child and severely injured the mother. On 24 September, 
</p>
<p>Jabhat Al-Nusra claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing which killed two people and 
</p>
<p>injured 10 others in Ain Amouda village. 
</p>
<p>63. On 4 and 9 September 2014, an armed group fired rockets into villages in the Al-
</p>
<p>Ghab area (Hama) killing civilians. On 12 November, rockets fired from the direction of 
</p>
<p>Kafr Zeita struck a schoolyard in Karnaz (Hama), killing seven children. 
</p>
<p>64. Armed groups holding territory in Damascus city and eastern Ghouta in Rif 
</p>
<p>Damascus have indiscriminately shelled neighbourhoods under Government control, 
</p>
<p>causing civilian casualties. On 31 July, two children were killed while standing on their 
</p>
<p>balcony in Karm Asmadi neighbourhood when they were hit by mortar fire. On 13 August, 
</p>
<p>a shell landed in a public park in Jaramana neighbourhood, killing three children. On 20 
</p>
<p>and 30 September, an armed group fired mortars into Douelaa neighbourhood, killing 
</p>
<p>civilians &#8211; including minors &#8211; on both occasions. 
</p>
<p>65.  IEDs were also placed on roads between villages in western Suweida western 
</p>
<p>countryside (As-Suweida). On 3 September, one exploded between Dama and Areeqah as a 
</p>
<p>bus drove past. Five civilians were killed. Armed groups around Busra Al-Sham (Dara&#8217;a) 
</p>
<p>shelled the town throughout 2014, killing civilians. On 26 December, a six-month-old baby 
</p>
<p>was reportedly killed by mortar fire into Zahra (Aleppo). 
</p>
<p><i>Findings </i></p>


<p>66.  In committing these acts, the anti-Government armed groups perpetrated the war 
</p>
<p>crime of murder. Due to the fragmented nature of armed groups and frequently shifting 
</p>
<p>alliances and membership, it is challenging to identify exact perpetrators.  
</p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham  
</i></p>
<p>67. Throughout the reporting period, ISIS has killed civilians, captured Government 
</p>
<p>soldiers and captured fighters from other armed groups in Aleppo, Ar Raqqah, Dayr az 
</p>
<p>Zawr and Al Hasakah governorates. While the group is infamous for its public executions 
</p>
<p>and its display of mutilated bodies, ISIS has also killed people held in its detention centres, 
</p>
<p>journalists, and those captured during military attacks or bought from other armed groups. 
</p>
<p>Civilian deaths were also recorded due to the group&#8217;s indiscriminate shelling of Ayn al-
</p>
<p>Arab (Kobane) in September 2014. 
</p>
<p><i>Sentencing and executions without due process 
</i></p>
<p>68. ISIS has killed men, women and children in public spaces in towns and villages 
</p>
<p>across northeastern Syria. Many of those executed were found guilty by ISIS courts of 
</p>
<p>being affiliated with other armed groups or collaborating with the Government. In public 
</p>
<p>declarations made before the executions, ISIS designated such people as &#8220;kuffar&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>infidels. In other cases, the victims were civilians who had breached ISIS&#8217;s edicts. Local 
</p>
<p>residents are urged to watch. In some cases, men and boys on the streets near execution 
</p>
<p>sites are forcibly taken to witness the killings. 
</p>
<p>69. Executions have been recorded in Ar Raqqah, Aleppo, Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah, 
</p>
<p>and Hama governorates. While most of the soldiers from the Tabqa airbase on 23 August, 
</p>
<p>were killed en masse soon after capture, smaller groups of soldiers captured as they fled in 
</p>
<p>the desert were later executed in Slouk and Tabqa. Two soldiers, captured outside the base, 
</p>
<p>were brought to Slouk and executed in a public square between 28 and 30 August 2014. A 
</p>
<p>16-year-old ISIS fighter carried out the beheading. Two more captured soldiers were 
</p>
<p>executed publicly in Tabqa in late August 2014.  
</p>
<p>70. After killing the captured soldiers, ISIS mutilated their bodies. The group placed the 
</p>
<p>decapitated heads of some of the soldiers on public display in squares and on roundabouts 
</p>
<p>in Tabqa and Raqqah cities, terrorising the local population.  
</p>
<p>71. ISIS executed men in Al-Jurniyah (Ar Raqqah) in July 2014. Furthermore, heads of 
</p>
<p>the executed soldiers captured from the 17th Division base were displayed in parks and 
</p>
<p>roundabouts around the town in late July. Executions continue to take place regularly in Al-
</p>
<p>Na&#8217;im Square in Raqqah city with multiple accounts of heads and bodies being placed on 
</p>
<p>display in the square.  
</p>
<p>72.  The group has executed women and men for unapproved contact with the opposite 
</p>
<p>sex, resulting in charges of adultery. In Ar Raqqah governorate, ISIS executed eight women 
</p>
<p>on these grounds on three separate occasions in June and July 2014. Most were stoned to 
</p>
<p>death, ostensibly for adultery. Others interviewed indicated that the women had been 
</p>
<p>discovered helping fighters from other armed groups.  
</p>
<p>73.  Multiple accounts of ISIS executing men in Minbeij (Aleppo) were collected. 
</p>
<p>Between August and October, residents witnessed executions of young men and the display 
</p>
<p>of their bodies in the public park. Executions were also documented in Al-Bab (Aleppo) in 
</p>
<p>July and August 2014.  
</p>
<p>74. Following ISIS&#8217;s taking over part of Dayr az Zawr governorate, there has been an 
</p>
<p>escalation in reports of public executions, notably in Al-Ashara, Al-Mayadin, Al-Bukamal, 
</p>
<p>Al-Shuhail, Al-Bouamrou and Al-Tayanna. On 16 September, a 16-year-old boy, alleged to 
</p>
<p>be a fighter with an armed group, was shot in the head by an ISIS fighter in a public market. </p>


<p>The body was displayed for several days. On 15 October, ISIS declared that it had executed 
</p>
<p>a man in Al-Ashara for practising sorcery. 
</p>
<p>75. Dozens of executions were recorded as taking place in Al-Mayadin in July and 
</p>
<p>August 2014, shortly after ISIS solidified its control of the town. Residents recalled seeing 
</p>
<p>30-40 bodies hung around the Al-Bal&#8217;oum roundabout throughout August. In August, ISIS 
</p>
<p>fighters executed two men found to have committed rape. In late August, ISIS detained and 
</p>
<p>beheaded a female dentist in Al-Mayadin who had continued to treat patients of both sexes.  
</p>
<p>76.  Men were also executed, by beheading in Al-Bouamrou and Al-Tayanna in late July 
</p>
<p>and late August, respectively. On 30 August, three males, including a 16-year-old-boy were 
</p>
<p>executed at a roundabout in Al-Bouamrou. In September, ISIS killed a captured Al-Nusra 
</p>
<p>fighter in a park in Al-Shuhail. 
</p>
<p>77.  On 10 July, ISIS executed two men accused of being Government soldiers in front 
</p>
<p>of a municipal building &#8211; which the group had transformed into an ISIS court &#8211; in Hasakah 
</p>
<p>city (Al Hsakah). In late 2014, the group executed a man they believed to be a member of 
</p>
<p>another armed group in Al-Houl (Al Hsakah).  
</p>
<p>78.  In Hama governorates, ISIS executed a man in a public square in Aqaribat in 
</p>
<p>October 2014. The group reportedly shot and killed a woman in May 2014 on the grounds 
</p>
<p>that she had committed adultery. 
</p>
<p>79. Following ISIS executions, as described above, the mutilated bodies of male victims 
</p>
<p>are often placed on display, a warning to the local population of the consequences of failure 
</p>
<p>to submit to the armed group&#8217;s authority. The group also circulated photos of the bodies of 
</p>
<p>executed captured female Kurdish fighters on social media in late 2014. Interviewees, 
</p>
<p>notably in Raqqah city (Ar Raqqah) and Al-Mayadin (Dayr az Zawr) remarked that bodies 
</p>
<p>were &#8220;always&#8221; on display and demonstrated a growing desensitisation that underpinned the 
</p>
<p>trauma of the civilian population. 
</p>
<p><i>Deaths in detention 
</i></p>
<p>80. As ISIS further solidified control of localities in north and eastern Syra, it set up 
</p>
<p>court and detention facilities. Detention facilities are sometimes in former Government 
</p>
<p>detention facilities, such as Jarablus prison. In other cases, ISIS sets up makeshift detention 
</p>
<p>centres in municipal buildings or private houses. 
</p>
<p>81. In late September 2014, ISIS shot and killed three prisoners shortly after their arrival 
</p>
<p>at Jarablus prison (Aleppo). The killing occurred soon after an airstrike close to the prison. 
</p>
<p>Reportedly, two of the men were accused of being fighters with an anti-Government armed 
</p>
<p>group while the third was accused of being a member of the YPG. A former detainee held 
</p>
<p>by ISIS in Al-Bab (Aleppo) stated that prisoners in Al-Bab had been tortured and executed 
</p>
<p>by ISIS. Prisoners were removed and did not return. This included two boys, aged 13 and 
</p>
<p>11 years. The killing of ISIS detainees was also documented in a detention centre in Al-
</p>
<p>Bukamel in August 2014. 
</p>
<p><i>Killing of journalists 
</i></p>
<p>82. Since ISIS came into being in April 2013, the group has killed Syrian and 
</p>
<p>international journalists and aid workers in a deliberate attempt to control the flow of 
</p>
<p>information in the areas under its control. 
</p>
<p>83. On or about 19 August and 2 September 2014, ISIS executed two American 
</p>
<p>journalists in an unknown location. On 13 September 2014, the group executed a British aid 
</p>
<p>worker. All three had been abducted and detained inside Syria.  
</p>
<p><i>Killing of civilians and captured fighters during ground attack on Ayn al-Arab (Kobane)  </i></p>


<p>84. On 15 September 2014, ISIS launched a multi-front attack on the Ayn Al-Arab 
</p>
<p>(Kobane) region with heavy weapons, artillery, tanks, and thousands of fighters. While 
</p>
<p>most residents fled or were evacuated by the YPG before ISIS advanced, some men and 
</p>
<p>women who did not flee &#8211; who were too old, too infirm, disabled, or who had remained to 
</p>
<p>protect their property &#8211; were executed by ISIS. Executions of civilians were documented in 
</p>
<p>Pinard, Tel Sha&#8217;eer, Kortek, Qaramou, Tel Haydar, Dongez and Biliq villages in late 
</p>
<p>September and October 2014. In Pinard village, one of those killed by ISIS was a mentally 
</p>
<p>handicapped man.  
</p>
<p>85.  ISIS executed Kurdish fighters captured during its attack. In mid-September 2014 in 
</p>
<p>Tel Abyad (Ar Raqqah), ISIS executed a female Kurdish fighter before a group of detained 
</p>
<p>civilians from Ayn al-Arab (Kobane).  
</p>
<p><i>Killing of a captured soldier purchased from another armed group 
</i></p>
<p>86. In late June 2014, a group claiming to be the Islamic Front kidnapped a soldier at a 
</p>
<p>checkpoint in Al Hasakah. They made a ransom demand to the soldier&#8217;s family but the 
</p>
<p>family was not able to pay. In July the group reportedly sold the soldier to ISIS. On 16 
</p>
<p>November, ISIS released a view purporting to show the soldier&#8217;s execution. The family was 
</p>
<p>able to identify the soldier in the video as being their relative. The location of the execution 
</p>
<p>remains unclear. 
</p>
<p><i>Shelling of Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) 
</i></p>
<p>87. In mid-September 2014, prior to and during the initial phases of ISIS&#8217;s attack on the 
</p>
<p>Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) region, ISIS indiscriminately shelled towns and villages across Ayn 
</p>
<p>al-Arab (Kobane), as well as the city. Multiple accounts were received of men, women and 
</p>
<p>children having been killed by the shelling. In late September, a 15-year-old boy was killed 
</p>
<p>by ISIS shelling of the city. On 22 and 23 September, a 55-year-old and a 60-year-old man 
</p>
<p>were killed as they fled from the city towards the Turkish border. 
</p>
<p><i>Finding 
</i></p>
<p>88. ISIS justifies its executions by religious law. While investigations into the operation 
</p>
<p>of ISIS sharia courts are ongoing, there are reasonable grounds to believe that ISIS has 
</p>
<p>committed the war crime of execution without due process. ISIS carried out public 
</p>
<p>executions to instil terror among the population, ensuring submission to its authority. 
</p>
<p>89. By its public display of bodies and failure to honourably inter them in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the rites of the religion of the deceased, ISIS has violated customary international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law. Displays of dead, mutilated bodies are deliberate acts intended to 
</p>
<p>humiliate and degrade the victims and their family, amounting to the war crimes of outrages 
</p>
<p>upon personal dignity.  
</p>
<p>90. ISIS has committed acts of violence against the civilian population under its control 
</p>
<p>in Ar Raqqah and in its areas of control in Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah and Aleppo 
</p>
<p>governorates. That is a continuation &#8212; and a geographic expansion &#8212; of the widespread 
</p>
<p>and systematic attack on the civilian population identified in document A/HRC/25/65. ISIS, 
</p>
<p>a structured group, directs and organizes those acts of violence against civilians, evincing 
</p>
<p>an organizational policy.  
</p>
<p>91.  The massacres and unlawful killings in Ar Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah and 
</p>
<p>Aleppo governorates, as described above, form part of the attack. In perpetrating those 
</p>
<p>killings in those governorates, ISIS has committed the crime against humanity and the war 
</p>
<p>crime of murder. The war crime of murder has also been committed in relation to the 
</p>
<p>massacres and other unlawful killings in Hama and Homs governorate. In deliberately 
</p>
<p>attacking persons, such as journalists, the armed group has committed a war crime. </p>


<p><b> B. Hostage-taking 
</b></p>
<p>92. In this reporting period, non-State armed groups, motivated by the need to effect a 
</p>
<p>prisoner exchange or extract ransom, have abducted individuals, in violation of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian and criminal law.  
</p>
<p>93. Where ransoms are demanded, it is increasingly difficult to discern whether the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators are parties to the conflict, or simply an opportunistic criminal gang.  
</p>
<p><b>  Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Anti-Government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>94. Armed groups in Damascus and Al-Quneitra have kidnapped civilians and members 
</p>
<p>of the Syrian armed forces, in order to force prisoner exchanges.  
</p>
<p>95. Twenty-six hostages, mainly women and children, captured by Jabhat Al-Nusra in 
</p>
<p>December 2013 in Adra Al-Omaliyah (Damascus), are still being held. Relatives of the 
</p>
<p>female hostages have received telephone calls, ostensibly from members of the group, 
</p>
<p>demanding that the families urge the Government to release detained Al-Nusra fighters as 
</p>
<p>part of a prisoner exchange. Al-Nusra released a video repeating these demands shortly 
</p>
<p>after the kidnapping. Since August 2014, however, there has been no news of the hostages. 
</p>
<p>96. In mid-June 2014, an armed group attacked Tal Al-Jumou military base in Al-
</p>
<p>Quneitra, capturing a Colonel. The group then sought to exchange the officer for 200 
</p>
<p>women held by the Government in detention centres in Damascus.  
</p>
<p>97. In August 2014, nine members of a family &#8211; including three women and two 
</p>
<p>children aged 12 and 10 years &#8211; were kidnapped by an unidentified armed group from their 
</p>
<p>home in a village in the eastern Hama countryside. Their property was destroyed during the 
</p>
<p>attack. In exchange for the release of the hostages, their kidnappers demanded the defection 
</p>
<p>of a son currently serving in the army. 
</p>
<p>98. Anti-Government armed groups operating in Hama, Damascus and Dara&#8217;a have 
</p>
<p>taken hostage civilians from families or areas perceived to be supportive of the 
</p>
<p>Government, and have demanded ransoms. In June 2014, a farmer was kidnapped from 
</p>
<p>fields outside the village of Al-Muzairia (Hama) and held for ransom for several weeks by 
</p>
<p>an unidentified armed group based in Al-Staihat.  
</p>
<p>99. In late June, two soldiers returning from home leave were kidnapped at the Tel Brak 
</p>
<p>checkpoint (Al Hasakah). Shortly afterwards, a group claiming to be the Islamic Front 
</p>
<p>contacted the family, provided proof of life, and demanded a high ransom. As the family 
</p>
<p>was unable to raise the necessary funds to meet the group&#8217;s demands, in July 2014, the 
</p>
<p>group informed the family that they were selling the soldiers to ISIS in Ar Raqqah. ISIS 
</p>
<p>later released a video purporting to show the execution of the two soldiers. In mid-2014, a 
</p>
<p>taxi driver was abducted by an armed group while driving between Dama and Dir Dama 
</p>
<p>(Damascus). The abductors demanded 5 million Syrian lira as ransom. The man was 
</p>
<p>released after the family paid 1.5 million lira. 
</p>
<p>100. Armed groups continue to hold hostages for extended periods. On 4 August 2013, 
</p>
<p>groups &#8211; including Ahrar Al-Sham and Jabhat Al-Nusra &#8211; abducted over 100 civilians 
</p>
<p>during an operation on villages in eastern Latakia. Approximately 40 were released in the 
</p>
<p>beginning of May 2014, after signing an agreement between fighters and the Government 
</p>
<p>enabling the withdrawal of rebel fighters from Homs city. On 26 January 2015, a pro-
</p>
<p>opposition website published what it alleged to be video footage recorded on 6 December 
</p>
<p>2014, showing approximately 55 women and children who had been taken hostage from the 
</p>
<p>Latakia villages. In the video, hostages urge the Government to exchange them with </p>


<p>fighters held by the Government. The fate of the women and children, abducted by the 
</p>
<p>group but not appearing on the video, is unknown.   
</p>
<p>101. Anti-Government armed groups have kidnapped individuals and held them hostage 
</p>
<p>in violation of common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, amounting to a war crime. 
</p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</i></p>
<p>102.  On 29 May 2014, ISIS in Minbeij abducted 153 Kurdish school children, boys aged 
</p>
<p>13 and 14 years, as they returned to Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) from Aleppo city. While 15 
</p>
<p>boys were released on 28 June as part of a prisoner exchange for ISIS members held by the 
</p>
<p>YPG, a further prisoner exchange between the two armed groups, intended to take place on 
</p>
<p>18 July, failed. The situation then shifted from being one of hostage-taking as ISIS held the 
</p>
<p>remaining children for the purposes of indoctrination, before releasing them in groups in 
</p>
<p>August and September 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrest 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Government forces 
</b></p>
<p>103. Unlike previous reporting periods, where arbitrary arrests by Government forces 
</p>
<p>occurred at checkpoints, during ground raids and during other military operations, the 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrests documented between July 2014 and January 2015 occurred almost 
</p>
<p>exclusively at checkpoints.  
</p>
<p>104. With ground searches now a rarity, checkpoints are the principal point of direct 
</p>
<p>contact between Government forces and those living outside of its area of control. They are 
</p>
<p>regarded with great fear by civilians, particularly those whose identification documents 
</p>
<p>indicate they hail from restive areas or who have injuries, whether conflict or non-conflict 
</p>
<p>related.  
</p>
<p>105. Some refugees emphasised that fear of arrest at Government checkpoints motivated 
</p>
<p>their flight from Syria. One women left as her eldest son entered his adolescence, fearful 
</p>
<p>that he was now old enough to be vulnerable to arrest at checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>106. Those arrested at checkpoints are almost exclusively males between the ages of 15 
</p>
<p>and 60 years. The arrests and detention of men of fighting age is an indication of 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness. The circumstances of many of the arrests indicate that they were conducted on 
</p>
<p>discriminatory grounds, such as the religious or geographic origin of persons.  
</p>
<p>107. On 25 July 2014, a man was travelling from Damascus city to Lebanon when he was 
</p>
<p>stopped at a military checkpoint. He had been arrested previously, in 2011, for participating 
</p>
<p>in demonstrations. His whereabouts are currently unknown. In March 2014, a man 
</p>
<p>attempted to leave the besieged area of eastern Ghouta to travel to Damascus. He had not 
</p>
<p>links to armed groups but was held at a Government checkpoint outside Hammouriyah (Rif 
</p>
<p>Damascus) and has not been heard from since. There have been multiple accounts of arrests 
</p>
<p>of young men travelling between Damascus and Dara&#8217;a cities in 2014. 
</p>
<p>108. In late August, an elderly man, aged 72 years, and his daughter attempted to leave 
</p>
<p>the eastern Ghouta so that he could receive urgent medical treatment. As the area is 
</p>
<p>besieged, Government forces were not allowing ambulances or medical aid into the area. 
</p>
<p>Their taxi was stopped at an identified checkpoint near Douma (Rif Damascus) and the 
</p>
<p>elderly man was arrested. His daughter&#8217;s pleas that her father needed medical attention 
</p>
<p>went unheeded. His whereabouts are unknown. 
</p>
<p>109. There were multiple accounts of adult men being arrested at checkpoints in Homs 
</p>
<p>and Hama governorates. In mid-August, a young man was arrested at Mallouk checkpoint 
</p>
<p>in the Homs countryside, after he had been been forcibly return to Syria from Jordan. In </p>


<p>October, soldiers at a checkpoint near Tadmor in the eastern Homs countryside arrested a 
</p>
<p>man hailing from a neighbourhood of Homs city that had, earlier in the conflict, been 
</p>
<p>supportive of the armed groups. The man was forced to disembark a company bus which 
</p>
<p>was carrying employees to work. He has since disappeared. In early October, a man, 
</p>
<p>travelling with his wife and four children for the Eid holiday, was arrested at Al-Massafi 
</p>
<p>checkpoint, a few kilometres west of Hama city.  
</p>
<p>110. Government forces have carried out arbitrary arrest in violation of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>111. There was a surge in reports of enforced disappearance, both from family members 
</p>
<p>of the disappeared and from victims who have since reappeared. While many of the initial 
</p>
<p>arrests or abductions took place outside of the reporting period, the disappearances are 
</p>
<p>ongoing. It is a continuous violation that remains unabated until the fate of the disappeared 
</p>
<p>is uncovered. 
</p>
<p>112. The majority of disappearances documented in this reporting period occurred in 
</p>
<p>Damascus and Rif Damascus governorates. In May 2014, two students were arrested a 
</p>
<p>Government military checkpoint between Dara and Damascus cities. Their families visited 
</p>
<p>various Intelligence branches in an effort to determine their whereabouts but received no 
</p>
<p>information. In August 2013, a man from a restive neighbourhood of Homs city was 
</p>
<p>arrested at a checkpoint outside of Damascus city while travelling with his wife and 
</p>
<p>children. When his family protested, the soldiers ordered them to leave, saying that they 
</p>
<p>would not see their father again. The man&#8217;s fate and whereabouts remain unknown. 
</p>
<p>Another man, whose brother-in-law and cousin disappeared in separate incidents in 2013 in 
</p>
<p>Damascus city, stated that the family had made inquiries with official sources but had 
</p>
<p>received no information. The interviewee stated that he now moves as little as possible, 
</p>
<p>minimising the possibility of being stopped at checkpoints. 
</p>
<p>113. Government forces were also documented as having &#8216;disappeared&#8217; persons, mainly 
</p>
<p>men 15 to 60 years of age, in Dara&#8217;a, Homs, Hama, Dayr az Zawr and Latakia 
</p>
<p>governorates. A trader was detained at an army checkpoint in June 2013 while travelling 
</p>
<p>from Jadia to Sanamayn (Dara&#8217;a). The man&#8217;s family attempted to locate him through 
</p>
<p>official channels and personal contacts and were not successful. Near identical accounts of 
</p>
<p>male relatives being detained and not heard from again were received from locations across 
</p>
<p>Syria. 
</p>
<p>114. As previously documented by the commission, many families continued to be too 
</p>
<p>afraid to approach the authorities to inquire about the whereabouts of their loved ones. One 
</p>
<p>interviewee, whose 72 years-old father was taken at an army checkpoint on his way to 
</p>
<p>Damascus in August 2014, explained that she did not dare inquire about his fate: &#8220;I fear for 
</p>
<p>the life of my father but at the same time I feel helpless&#8221;. In the majority of cases, this fear 
</p>
<p>is well-founded. Interviewees explained that, in some instances, individuals who reported a 
</p>
<p>disappearance were themselves detained. 
</p>
<p>115. The desperation of families to know the truth about the fate of their loved ones 
</p>
<p>nourishes a lucrative business of extortion. Some relatives pay bribes to lawyers, who often 
</p>
<p>falsely, claimed they could provide information. In some cases, families were defrauded of 
</p>
<p>very large sums of money. One interviewee stated that she sold her car and spent 300,000 
</p>
<p>Syrians pounds in an attempt to gain information on the fate of her son, who disappeared at 
</p>
<p>a checkpoint in Aleppo, in September 2012.  </p>


<p>116. The family of a man who had disappeared in Aleppo city in late 2011 searched for 
</p>
<p>him in multiple intelligences branch in Aleppo city. When the man was released &#8211; from 
</p>
<p>Sednaya prison in Damascus &#8211; in March 2014, he described being transferred from an 
</p>
<p>intelligence agency in Aleppo city to multiple detention centres in Damascus. He was 
</p>
<p>tortured during his detention.  
</p>
<p>117. Survivors of enforced disappearance consistently described being subjected to 
</p>
<p>torture during their detention. One woman explained that her husband, whose detention in 
</p>
<p>Adra prison in Damascus had been concealed by the authorities, died of the injuries 
</p>
<p>sustained during the torture he endured after his release.  
</p>
<p>118. In all the instances documented, the victims were denied their fundamental right to 
</p>
<p>due process. They were deprived of contact with the outside world, including close 
</p>
<p>relatives. No legal assistance was provided. They were placed outside the law, at the mercy 
</p>
<p>of their captors. 
</p>
<p>119.  Not knowing whether their loved ones are dead and, if so, what has happened to 
</p>
<p>their bodies, families can neither mourn nor adjust to their loss. One interviewee reported 
</p>
<p>how her mother had a mental breakdown, unable to cope with the prolonged disappearance 
</p>
<p>of her son, who went missing in 2011. One former detainee, on his release, was surrounded 
</p>
<p>by women waving photographs of their male relatives, hoping that he had seen them alive 
</p>
<p>in Government custody. Several survivors spoke of the distress caused by the awareness 
</p>
<p>that their families did not know what had happened to them.  
</p>
<p>120. Women face specific hardships. The uncertainty created by the disappearance of 
</p>
<p>their husbands or fathers has social and legal consequences, including on the status of 
</p>
<p>marriage, right to inheritance and social welfare, and the management of the property of the 
</p>
<p>disappeared person. 
</p>
<p>121. Enforced disappearance places its victims outside the law, violating their right to 
</p>
<p>recognition as a person before the law, to liberty and security and freedom from arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention. It is, as evidenced by the accounts of those who have reappeared, often a 
</p>
<p>gateway to the commission of further offences, such as torture. 
</p>
<p>122. Enforced disappearances perpetrated by the Government formed part of the attack 
</p>
<p>referred to in paragraph 57 above and constitute a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>123. Persons, often those perceived as not being in supportive of ISIS, have been 
</p>
<p>abducted by the armed group and have subsequently disappeared. Such disappearances 
</p>
<p>have been documented in Ar Raqqah and Aleppo governorates.  
</p>
<p>124. In March 2014, a man was taken from his home in Slouk by ISIS fighters on the 
</p>
<p>ground that they believed him to be supportive of the Government. His family members 
</p>
<p>made inquiries with ISIS administration in Slouk but received no information. His 
</p>
<p>whereabouts remain unknown.  
</p>
<p>125. A bus driver was stopped at a checkpoint in Ar Raqqah and detained by ISIS 
</p>
<p>fighters. His family believe he was targeted because he was Christian. They were too 
</p>
<p>frightened to seek information about his whereabouts. He has not been heard from since. As 
</p>
<p>previously reported, ISIS abducted a Jesuit priest, Father Dall&#8217;Oglio on 28 January 2013. 
</p>
<p>Since his disappearance, there has been no information about his fate. 
</p>
<p>126. A man was held by ISIS in Al-Bab (Aleppo) in March 2014. His parents went to 
</p>
<p>ISIS headquarters to inquire about where he was but received no response. The man 
</p>
<p>reappeared in late 2014, after being released from ISIS detention in the town. </p>


<p>127. ISIS has adopted practices that may lead to acts tantamount to enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance, in breach of its obligations under international humanitarian law. Forming 
</p>
<p>part of the attack identified in paragraph 90 above, their practices constitute a crime against 
</p>
<p>humanity. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Unknown perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>128. Syrians have disappeared after being abducted by unknown armed individuals. In 
</p>
<p>those circumstances, it has not been possible to identify the perpetrator to the commission&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>standard of proof. Such cases include that of Syrian human rights defenders Razan 
</p>
<p>Zaitouneh, Samira al-Khalil, Wael Hamada, and Nazem Hammadi who were abducted in 
</p>
<p>Duma (Rif Damascus) in December 2013. At the time, the area from which they were 
</p>
<p>abducted was under the control of an anti-Government armed group. There has been no 
</p>
<p>information about their fate or whereabouts since their disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>129. Since the start of the unrest in Syria in March 2011, Government forces, notably 
</p>
<p>agents of its security and intelligence agencies, have tortured and ill-treated men, women 
</p>
<p>and children in their custody.  
</p>
<p>130. Numerous interviews concerning the treatment of detainees between 10 July 2014 
</p>
<p>and 10 January 2015 further evidence earlier factual and legal findings made by the 
</p>
<p>Commission. Most accounts come from torture survivors. 
</p>
<p>133. Almost all interviewees who had been detained in Government facilities detailed 
</p>
<p>being tortured and held in horrific conditions. Most were civilians who had also been 
</p>
<p>beaten from the point of arrest or abduction &#8211; usually at checkpoints &#8211; to their arrival at the 
</p>
<p>detention centres. With the exception of those kept in solitary confinement, all had 
</p>
<p>witnessed the torture of other detainees. As detailed above, several witnessed the deaths of 
</p>
<p>cellmates and/or saw bodies of detainees in other areas of the facilities. Many bear physical 
</p>
<p>and psychological scars. 
</p>
<p>134.  In this reporting period, the majority of accounts of torture and ill-treatment 
</p>
<p>occurred in detention centres in Damascus and Rif Damascus governorates, most 
</p>
<p>particularly in Military Security branches 215 (Raids branch), 235 (also known as Palestine 
</p>
<p>branch), 227 (Damascus regional branch), 248 and 291 (Investigations branches); Air Force 
</p>
<p>Intelligence branch in Mezzeh military airport; in Mezzeh Military Hospital 601 and 
</p>
<p>Tishreen Military Hospital; and in Sednaya prison. Branches 248, 291 and 293 are housed 
</p>
<p>in the same facility in Kafr Sousa. 
</p>
<p>135. Former detainees also reported being tortured in Government detention facilities and 
</p>
<p>prisons in Aleppo, Dara&#8217;a, and Hama governorates. Torture was also recorded as having 
</p>
<p>occurred at a facility run by the Government&#8217;s paramilitary group, the National Defence 
</p>
<p>Force in the Al-Joura neighbourhood of Dayr az Zawr city between May and October 2014. 
</p>
<p>136. Methods of torture remained consistent across time and governorates. In this reporting 
</p>
<p>period, former detainees described being beaten on the head, bodies and soles of feet with 
</p>
<p>wooden and metal sticks, hoses, cables, belts, whips, and wires. Detainees were also 
</p>
<p>sexually assaulted; given electric shocks, including to their genitals; burnt with cigarettes; 
</p>
<p>and were placed in stress positions for prolonged periods of time. A substantial number of 
</p>
<p>male detainees reported having their hands handcuffed behind their backs and then being 
</p>
<p>suspended by their wrists from the ceiling or a wall for hours. Detainees emphasised that 
</p>
<p>they were beaten not only during interrogations, but also in the cells by the prison guards. </p>


<p>137.  While the majority of interviews concerned the treatment of male detainees, female 
</p>
<p>detainees also reported being severely beaten, sexually assaulted and given electric shocks.  
</p>
<p>138. In May 2014, a member of the medical staff at a field hospital in Rif Damascus was 
</p>
<p>arrested during an attack by Government forces. He was taken to Air Force Intelligence in 
</p>
<p>Mezzeh military airport where he was held until late 2014. He described being stripped to 
</p>
<p>his underwear and placed in a very overcrowded, lice-infested cell. He and his cellmates 
</p>
<p>were given little food. He was whipped. Interrogators then forced his limbs into a car tyre 
</p>
<p>and beat him severely.  
</p>
<p>139.  Another man, who had worked in a field hospital in an armed-group controlled area 
</p>
<p>in the east of the country, was arrested by military intelligence in Damascus city in June 
</p>
<p>2014 and taken to branch 215. Accused of terrorism, he reported being beaten, kicked, 
</p>
<p>suspended from the ceiling by his wrists, burnt with cigarettes and electrocuted. Another 
</p>
<p>man, also held at branch 215 at the time and not released until December 2014, described 
</p>
<p>being tortured and held in an overcrowded cell. 
</p>
<p>140. In June 2014, a man was transferred from another detention facility in Damascus to 
</p>
<p>branch 235. He was beaten during the transfer by his guards. During his interrogation, he 
</p>
<p>was beaten unconscious and, later, his thumbprint placed on a document he was not able to 
</p>
<p>read. 
</p>
<p>141.  In Aleppo governorate, while one man was held at an intelligence agency from April 
</p>
<p>to late July 2014, he witnessed other detainees being severely beaten and heard a female 
</p>
<p>detainee being beaten.  
</p>
<p>142.  One woman, held in branch 227 in mid-2014, stated that she was beaten and kicked 
</p>
<p>during interrogations during twice weekly interrogations over a three-month period. She 
</p>
<p>reported that authorities used electric shocks on at least two other detainees. She was 
</p>
<p>released after her family paid a bribe to the facility&#8217;s authorities. A woman, released from 
</p>
<p>branch 235 in August 2014 stated that women were beaten there.  
</p>
<p>143. Former detainees stated that they would try to avoid transfer to Mezzeh (601) or 
</p>
<p>Tishreen military hospitals because the torture and ill-treatment of patients at these facilities 
</p>
<p>was notorious. One detainee held in Sednaya from 2012 to mid-2014 stated his cellmate 
</p>
<p>had been transferred to Hospital 601 and was severely beaten there. 
</p>
<p>144. In February 2014, one detainee was transferred from an intelligence agency in 
</p>
<p>Damascus city to Sednaya prison where he was held until late 2014. The guards beat and 
</p>
<p>kicked him and the other detainees being taken to Sednaya. He describes prison guards 
</p>
<p>entering the cells and severely beating, kicking, and stepping on him and the other 
</p>
<p>detainees. In one such attack, the interviewee stated he was beaten unconscious and 
</p>
<p>sustained a broken shoulder and several fractured ribs. 
</p>
<p>145.  Government authorities in intelligence and security agencies as well as prisons 
</p>
<p>committed sexual torture against male and female detainees. This included sexual assaults, 
</p>
<p>electrocutions of the genitals and the threats of rape being made to the detainee or of his/her 
</p>
<p>female family members.b 
</p>
<p>146. The above conduct was perpetrated by both prison guards and interrogators and was 
</p>
<p>often designed to elicit confessions from the detainee. Some former detainees stated that, 
</p>
<p>under torture, they were made to give names of other civilians who they would falsely 
</p>
<p>indicate were involved in opposition activities. These names were reportedly used to effect 
</p>
<p>further arbitrary arrests. Beating and other physical abuse by prison guards, often occurring 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> b See paragraphs 176-183, below. </p>


<p>inside the cells, appeared designed to humiliate and punish those held in Government 
</p>
<p>custody. 
</p>
<p>147. In this reporting period, conditions of detention continue to be characterised by a 
</p>
<p>lack of food, water, space, sleep, hygiene and medical care and denial of life saving 
</p>
<p>medicine. Detainees are held in severely overcrowded cells, often with little light and with 
</p>
<p>limited access to toilet facilities. Many described having to sleep in shifts as there was 
</p>
<p>insufficient room for all the detainees to lie down at the same time. Many of those held 
</p>
<p>were not able to shower for months at a time. Detainees routinely described cells as being 
</p>
<p>infested with lice and other insects. In such circumstances, infections from injuries 
</p>
<p>sustained from torture by prison guards and interrogators were common, and sometimes, 
</p>
<p>fatal. 
</p>
<p>148.  Those held in Government detention facilities and prisons often received little or no 
</p>
<p>medical treatment. Inadequate food was provided, with some detainees reporting a loss of 
</p>
<p>over a third of their body weight while held in custody. Few detainees ever saw a lawyer, 
</p>
<p>were ever charged or ever appeared in court. 
</p>
<p>149.  One detainee, held in Sednaya prison until late 2014, stated that he was detained in a 
</p>
<p>cell so overcrowded that he and his cellmates took turns standing, sitting and sleeping. 
</p>
<p>Cells were without light and infested with insects, including lice. They did not have access 
</p>
<p>to a shower while imprisoned there. They received no medical care and very little food. 
</p>
<p>Other detainees, held in Sednaya earlier in 2014 provided consistent accounts of dirty, 
</p>
<p>unhygienic conditions in the cells and detainees suffering malnutrition and infections, 
</p>
<p>which went untreated. 
</p>
<p>150.  A woman held in branch 235 during the reporting period stated that her cell was so 
</p>
<p>overcrowded, the woman and girls held there had to sleep on their sides if they were all to 
</p>
<p>lie down. They received little food. No sanitary napkins were provided. The failure of the 
</p>
<p>Government authorities to provide sanitary products from female detainees was echoed by 
</p>
<p>another female detainee in an unknown military security branch in Damascus earlier in 
</p>
<p>2014. 
</p>
<p>151.  Children under the age of 18 years have been recorded as being held in Government 
</p>
<p>custody and subjected to torture and ill-treatment.c Placed in the cells with adults, they also 
</p>
<p>suffered the same prisons conditions.  
</p>
<p>152. A man held in Air Force Intelligence in Mezzeh military airport until early October 
</p>
<p>2014 described being held in an overcrowded cell with children as young as 10 years old. A 
</p>
<p>woman, held in Military Security branch 235 until August 2014 described being held in a 
</p>
<p>small group cell with approximately 30 women, the youngest being 15 years old. 
</p>
<p>153.  Torture and others forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</p>
<p>have been committed by the Syrian Government, in violation of its obligations under 
</p>
<p>international human rights and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>154. Severe pain has been inflicted on men, women and children held in Government 
</p>
<p>detention centres. It was inflicted to extract information and to humiliate and punish. The 
</p>
<p>physical violence described by former detainees &#8211; being suspended by the wrists or ankles, 
</p>
<p>electrocution, kicking, beating (including on the soles of the feet) &#8211; have been found to 
</p>
<p>constitute torture by various international tribunals and UN human rights bodies. 
</p>
<p>155. The Government has continued to perpetrate torture and other forms of cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as part of a widespread and systematic 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> c See paragraph 195, below. </p>


<p>attack directed against a civilian population, indicating the existence of a State policy. The 
</p>
<p>Government has therefore, as previously found, committed torture and other inhumane acts 
</p>
<p>as crimes against humanity. This conduct is also prosecutable as the war crimes of torture 
</p>
<p>and inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p>156. The conditions of detention suffered by the men, women and children held in 
</p>
<p>Government custody constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
</p>
<p>may, in themselves, rise to such a level as to constitute torture.  
</p>
<p>157. The Government continues to commit these crimes with impunity. Members of 
</p>
<p>intelligence agencies and their military and civilian superiors failing to prevent and punish 
</p>
<p>these crimes can be held individually criminally liable for the conduct described above. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</i></p>
<p>158. In the areas it controls, ISIS has continued to torture and ill-treat civilians and 
</p>
<p>captured fighters from other armed groups and Government soldiers. This conduct has been 
</p>
<p>documented in three distinct contexts: public punishments for breaches of ISIS edicts; in 
</p>
<p>the group&#8217;s detention centres; and during its indoctrination efforts. 
</p>
<p>159.  Throughout the reporting period, ISIS has carried out lashings in public spaces in 
</p>
<p>towns and villages in Aleppo, Dayr az Zawr, Ar Raqqah and Al Hasakah governorates. 
</p>
<p>Men and boys under the age of 18 have been lashed for being in the company of women 
</p>
<p>whom ISIS considered to be &#8220;improperly&#8221; dressed, for smoking, not attending Friday 
</p>
<p>prayers, trading during prayer times and for having tattoos. Women have been lashed for 
</p>
<p>not being fully covered while in public and for being in public with a man who was neither 
</p>
<p>their spouse nor a close male relative. 
</p>
<p>160. In Dayr Hafir (Aleppo), ISIS lashed men who were caught smoking. In late August 
</p>
<p>2014, ISIS fighters assaulted two men they found smoking on the streets of Mo Hassan 
</p>
<p>(Dayr az Zawr) and took them to the Sharia court, which released them. A 16-year-old boy 
</p>
<p>was beaten publicly by ISIS fighters in Al-Mayadin (Dayr Az-Zawr) in June 2014. The 
</p>
<p>reasons for this beating are unclear. 
</p>
<p>161. In Raqqah city (Ar Raqqah), a woman was publicly lashed for &#8220;prostitution&#8221; in a 
</p>
<p>market in October 2014. In Al-Bab (Aleppo), Al-Hisba &#8211; ISIS&#8217;s morality police &#8211; hit 
</p>
<p>women in the street with sticks if they judged them improperly undressed. These on-the-
</p>
<p>spot punishments are administered by its all-female brigade, Al-Khans&#8217;aa. 
</p>
<p>162.  In November 2014, in the village of Al-Ghreika (Al Hasakah), ISIS lashed a man 60 
</p>
<p>times after his wife left their house alone in order to check on their crops. ISIS had 
</p>
<p>forbidden women to be anywhere outside home without a close male relative or spouse. 
</p>
<p>163.  As ISIS stabilised its control over territory it currently holds, it has set up detention 
</p>
<p>centres in former Government prisons, military bases, hospitals, schools and in private 
</p>
<p>houses. Detainees are held there while waiting to go before the ISIS courts and some then 
</p>
<p>serve sentences there.  
</p>
<p>164.  A detainee, held in the ISIS detention centre in Jarablus in late 2014, stated that 
</p>
<p>there were approximately 30 prisoners there, including several boys aged 13-14 years old. 
</p>
<p>The prison guards beat them about the body and the face. An Egyptian fighter was 
</p>
<p>particularly harsh. Kurdish detainees, who appeared to have been captured during the ISIS 
</p>
<p>assault on Ayn Al-Arab, suffered particularly severe beatings, on the grounds that they 
</p>
<p>were &#8220;infidels&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>165. In Al-Shaddadi (Al Hsakah), a man &#8211; initially held at a checkpoint in a neighbouring 
</p>
<p>governorate &#8211; was detained in a makeshift ISIS detention facility set up in a private house </p>


<p>while security checks were carried out by the group. While he was not beaten, he heard 
</p>
<p>other detainees in adjacent rooms being beaten and interrogated about their involvement in 
</p>
<p>the black market for oil.  
</p>
<p>166. In August 2014, a man was arrested by ISIS fighters in Bukamel and taken to a 
</p>
<p>detention facility in the agricultural school. There he was handcuffed behind his back and 
</p>
<p>suspended by the wrists while being beaten with wooden sticks. He noted that several of 
</p>
<p>those carrying out the beatings were foreign fighters, among them a Tunisian and a 
</p>
<p>Moroccan. 
</p>
<p>167. In late May 2014, ISIS in Minbeij abducted 153 Kurdish schoolchildren, boys aged 
</p>
<p>13 and 14 years as they travelled from Aleppo to their homes in Ayn al-Arab (Kobane). 
</p>
<p>Shortly after their abduction, the boys were beaten with hoses. Following a failed prisoner 
</p>
<p>exchange in mid-July 2014, the group turned its attention to the indoctrination of the 
</p>
<p>children, teaching them ISIS ideology and having them watch videos of executions. ISIS set 
</p>
<p>numerous rules including not speaking Kurdish, not being loud, praying at the correct times 
</p>
<p>and observing Ramadan. When the boys broke these rules they were beaten by the Emir, 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;ideology teacher&#8221; or the guards. Reports were received of children being severely 
</p>
<p>beaten with braided electrical cables, hoses, plastic cables on the soles of their feet, back 
</p>
<p>and hands. Where schoolboys were caught trying to escape, they were brutally punished, 
</p>
<p>including by being given electric shocks and by being suspended by the wrists with their 
</p>
<p>hand tied behind their backs. Both Syrian and foreign fighters committed these acts. 
</p>
<p>168. In February 2014, approximately 150 Kurdish men were held by ISIS and 
</p>
<p>transferred to a former Government prison in Tel Abyad briefly and then to a small village 
</p>
<p>in Ar Raqqah governorate. They were held there until late 2014. They were beaten severely 
</p>
<p>for being suspected members of the YPG. ISIS also made attempts to indoctrinate the men, 
</p>
<p>forcing them to watch videos of beheadings and to wear uniforms similar to those worn by 
</p>
<p>the ISIS fighters.  
</p>
<p>169. As an organised armed group exercising effective control over territory, ISIS has an 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure humane treatment. By regularly using violence to life, torture, cruel 
</p>
<p>treatment, ISIS is violating binding international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>170. By orchestrating systematic harm against a civilian population, ISIS has 
</p>
<p>demonstrated its capacity and intent to wilfully apply measures of intimidation and terror, 
</p>
<p>such as violence to life and inhuman treatment inflicting great suffering and injury to bodily 
</p>
<p>integrity. 
</p>
<p>171. ISIS has committed torture as part of an attack on a civilian population in Aleppo, 
</p>
<p>Ar Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Al Hasakah governorates, amounting to war crimes and 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity. The direct perpetrators and their commanders can be held 
</p>
<p>individually responsible for these acts. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>172. The information collected since July 2014 regarding sexual and gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence against men and women demonstrates the importance of continued attention to and 
</p>
<p>documentation of sexual violence in Syria. Many of the accounts collected describe 
</p>
<p>incidents that occurred prior to 2014. Many victims of sexual and gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>could speak out only once they had been released from detention, while others took time to 
</p>
<p>relay their experiences of violations which often occurred in secret or were cloaked in 
</p>
<p>silence or taboo. Under-reporting and delayed reporting of sexual violence continues to be 
</p>
<p>endemic. Contemporaneous medical documentation is rare and in custodial contexts, </p>


<p>medical assistance is denied to detainees. Female victims of sexual violence who have fled 
</p>
<p>Syria may be reluctant to convey their testimonies due to their continued vulnerability as 
</p>
<p>displaced, often female-headed households. 
</p>
<p>173. The lives of Syrian women have been radically altered by four years of violence and 
</p>
<p>conflict. Many women interviewed described the psychological and physical repercussions 
</p>
<p>they and their children experienced in the aftermath of witnessing the death of their 
</p>
<p>husbands and fathers. A woman whose husband went missing in March 2012 in Al-Shaar 
</p>
<p>neighbourhood, Aleppo city, described being in denial about his fate despite being told that 
</p>
<p>he had died in a Government bombardment. Many women explained that they fled their 
</p>
<p>homes for fear of their husbands or sons being arrested. With the rise in female-headed 
</p>
<p>households and demographic shifts as a result of mass displacement and deaths and 
</p>
<p>disappearances of fighting-age men, women have also experienced a shift in their societal 
</p>
<p>roles. In Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Dara&#8217;a governorates, women cited a fear of sexual 
</p>
<p>violence in their decisions to flee their homes. 
</p>
<p>174. Men and boys who are considered to be of &#8216;fighting-age&#8217; through the policies and 
</p>
<p>acts of Government forces and affiliated militia, have been subjected to physical and 
</p>
<p>psychological violence on the basis of their gender. Perceived as likely to participate in 
</p>
<p>hostilities against the Government or aid armed groups, men and boys have been arrested, 
</p>
<p>tortured, disappeared, and killed on grounds of suspected affiliation or loyalty. With their 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement constrained due to the constant fear of apprehension at Government 
</p>
<p>checkpoints, men and boys have been forced to remain in zones of active hostilities. Sexual 
</p>
<p>violence and torture is commonly employed against male detainees in Government 
</p>
<p>detention facilities as an interrogation tactic, to degrade and humiliate. 
</p>
<p>175. Material collected further corroborates previous findings of sexual torture and rape 
</p>
<p>being employed in Government detention facilities operated by security and intelligence 
</p>
<p>agencies in Damascus. Torture methods such as the application of electric shocks to the 
</p>
<p>genitals, were consistently and widely documented. Male detainees were subjected to 
</p>
<p>sexual assault, sexual torture and rape in Branch 291 between June and October 2011, in 
</p>
<p>Branch 215 between 2012 and 2013 and in June 2014. Rape and sexual violence was 
</p>
<p>employed against men detained in Sednaya Prison, administered by the Military Police, in 
</p>
<p>February 2013. Six documented incidents of rape and sexual torture used in the course of 
</p>
<p>interrogations of male detainees in the Air Force Intelligence Branch in Mezzeh military 
</p>
<p>airport between August 2011 and October 2014 were recorded. Male survivors of assaults 
</p>
<p>described sexual torture employed at checkpoints between August 2011 and January 2012 
</p>
<p>and in January 2014. Detainees held in Mezzeh Prison and Hospital 601 were also 
</p>
<p>threatened with rape in the course of their interrogations and torture. 
</p>
<p>176. Some female detainees were subject to sexual violence, including rape in 
</p>
<p>Government detention facilities, in particular in the investigation branches of the Military 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Directorate (commonly known as Military Security) located in Kafr Sousa 
</p>
<p>(Damascus). Branches 248, 215 and 291 are located in the same building and contain 
</p>
<p>holding cells underground. Documented incidents of female detainees being sexually 
</p>
<p>assaulted and raped occurred in Branch 291 between June and October 2011, in Branch 215 
</p>
<p>between 2012 and 2013 and in 2014, and in three separate incidents in Branch 248 between 
</p>
<p>April 2012 and June 2013. A woman was raped in the General Intelligence Branch 285 in 
</p>
<p>Kafr Sousa in 2012.  
</p>
<p>177. A female detainee was sexually tortured in Branch 227 between April and June 
</p>
<p>2014. Sexual violence was also employed against female detainees at Air Force Intelligence 
</p>
<p>branches, in Harasta between March and September 2012, and in Mezzeh military airport 
</p>
<p>between May and October 2014.  </p>


<p>178. Consistent accounts indicate that women held in detention facilities administered by 
</p>
<p>the General Security Directorate in Damascus are subjected to sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>Interrogators sexually assaulted detainees in the Al-Arbaieen Branch in April 2012. 
</p>
<p>Incidents of female detainees being raped and sexually tortured in Branch 251 (Al-Khatib 
</p>
<p>Branch) were documented as occurring in March 2011, between July and September 2012, 
</p>
<p>and in March 2014. 
</p>
<p>179. Victim and witness accounts of rape and sexual violence employed as torture in the 
</p>
<p>course of interrogations were also documented regarding incidents in Mezzeh Prison 
</p>
<p>between June and September 2011 and December 2013 and May 2014, in particular the 
</p>
<p>application of electric shocks to genitals, in Branch 235 (Palestine Branch) in 2013, and at 
</p>
<p>the Criminal Security Branch in Bab Mosala in March 2013.  
</p>
<p>180. In Dara&#8217;a governorate, women faced sexual violence from Government authorities 
</p>
<p>in custodial environments. Interviewees described being threatened with sexual assault in 
</p>
<p>the Criminal Security Branch in Izrah, subjected to rape at a checkpoint before being taken 
</p>
<p>to the Military Security Branch in Dara&#8217;a city in 2013, and sexual torture employed in 
</p>
<p>detention facilities in Jasim and Dara&#8217;a city in 2014. 
</p>
<p>181. Victim and witness accounts of sexual violence were also recorded in northern 
</p>
<p>governorates. During house searches in Aleppo city in 2012 and 2013, Government forces 
</p>
<p>sexually assaulted women and men in their homes. In 2013, detainees were raped in the 
</p>
<p>Political Security branch and sexual assaulted at the Military Security branch in Latakia. 
</p>
<p>182. Violations of physical integrity through the use of torture and ill-treatment and 
</p>
<p>sexual violence, including rape, by Syrian State officials, amounting to severe and 
</p>
<p>systematic violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>Syrian government authorities have manifestly failed to protect male and female detainees 
</p>
<p>from sexual harassment, sexual torture, rape and sexual violence in prisons and detention 
</p>
<p>facilities in Damascus, administered by and under the control of the military, intelligence 
</p>
<p>and security agencies. Survivors and witnesses emphasised the long-lasting physical and 
</p>
<p>psychological repercussions of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>183. Many women and men, including minors, have been victims of the deliberate use of 
</p>
<p>sexual humiliation, sexual torture and rape while in the custody of Government authorities 
</p>
<p>throughout the span of the unrest and conflict in Syria (from 2011 &#8211; 2014). Rape and other 
</p>
<p>forms of sexual violence, amounting to serious violations of international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>war crimes and crimes against humanity, entail individual criminal responsibility for the 
</p>
<p>direct perpetrators of crimes and their authors at the highest levels of the chain of 
</p>
<p>command, including the highest levels of Government.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>184. Accounts have been collected which indicate the vulnerability of women and gay 
</p>
<p>men to sexual assault and harassment at checkpoints run by armed groups. Upon detention, 
</p>
<p>gay men were abused and harmed on the basis of their sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</i></p>
<p>185. As documented in the thematic report &#8220;Rule of Terror: Living Under ISIS in Syria&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>ISIS has executed women and men on the basis of their gender and subjected them to 
</p>
<p>sexual assault and rape, as part of a broader attack on the civilian population in areas of Ar 
</p>
<p>Raqqah and Dayr az Zawr governorates, constituting the crimes against humanity of 
</p>
<p>murder, torture, rape and other inhumane acts.  </p>


<p>186. Women have been executed in Ar Raqqah and Dayr az Zawr.d These executions, 
</p>
<p>carried out as punishment for crimes such as adultery, were utilised to instil fear among 
</p>
<p>women for disobeying the social edicts imposed by ISIS. 
</p>
<p>187. The restrictions imposed on women and subsequent corporal punishments for non-
</p>
<p>compliance continue to occur, enforced by the Al-Hisbah morality police and the Al-
</p>
<p>Khans&#8217;aa all-female brigade. In Ar Raqqah, women and men have been lashed for improper 
</p>
<p>dress and women&#8217;s freedom of movement has been severely restricted. In Aleppo, women 
</p>
<p>and men have been forced to comply with onerous dress and prayer instructions in Al-Bab, 
</p>
<p>Minbeij, Massakanah, and Dayr Hafir. In Al Hsakah, ISIS has imposed dress codes for 
</p>
<p>women in Qamishli and restricted the movement of men. Similar measures were undertaken 
</p>
<p>in Aqaribat (Hama) and in Al-Mayadin and Al-Bukamal (Dayr az Zawr) in October 2014. 
</p>
<p>The psychological and physical harm caused by ISIS&#8217;s treatment of women, the onerous 
</p>
<p>instructions imposed on their dress code, and restrictions on their freedom of movement 
</p>
<p>demonstrate discriminatory treatment on the basis of gender. 
</p>
<p>188. During its early August 2014 attack on Sinjar in northern Iraq, ISIS abducted 
</p>
<p>hundreds of Yazidi women and girls. Some abductees have been taken into Syria and sold 
</p>
<p>as &#8216;war booty&#8217; to ISIS fighters while others have been given to ISIS fighters as 
</p>
<p>&#8216;concubines&#8217;.e Information collected recently indicates that groups of dozens of girls and 
</p>
<p>women have been transported to various locations in Syria, including Ar Raqqah, Al 
</p>
<p>Hsakah, and Dayr az Zawr. There, the girls and women are raped and held in sexual 
</p>
<p>slavery. Most of the women and girls captured remain in captivity in Syria. The 
</p>
<p>enslavement of Yazidi women was undertaken as part of ISIS&#8217;s attack on civilian 
</p>
<p>communities considered to be infidels. ISIS attacks on Yazidi women and girls now being 
</p>
<p>held inside Syria are violations of international humanitarian law and amount to the war 
</p>
<p>crime of sexual slavery, sexual violence, rape and forced pregnancy. Undertaken as part of 
</p>
<p>a widespread and systematic attack identified in paragraph 90, these acts amount to the 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity of enslavement, rape and sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>189.  Gay men have been targeted on the basis of their sexuality and killed. Reports 
</p>
<p>indicate that such conduct is indicative of a broader pattern of ISIS&#8217; treatment of 
</p>
<p>homosexual men. Such killings constitute murder as a war crime, and a crime against 
</p>
<p>humanity. 
</p>
<p>190. ISIS has imposed arbitrary and disproportionate restrictions on women and men on 
</p>
<p>the basis of their gender, inflicting harsh punishments for non-compliance with ISIS&#8217; edicts 
</p>
<p>and instilling fear among the civilian population under the control. Corporal punishments 
</p>
<p>amount to cruel treatment and torture, and publicly humiliate and degrade women and men, 
</p>
<p>in violation of customary international humanitarian law and rising to the level of war 
</p>
<p>crimes, incurring individual criminal and command responsibility. Undertaken as part of a 
</p>
<p>widespread and systematic attack, these acts amount to the crimes against humanity of 
</p>
<p>torture and other inhumane acts. </p>
<p><b> G. </b>Violations of children&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>191. Children have been killed, injured and maimed in aerial bombardments, barrel bomb 
</p>
<p>and shelling attacks carried out by the Government on a massive scale. Children living in 
</p>
<p>non-State armed group-controlled neighbourhoods of Aleppo city have been suffering from

</p>
<p> e See A/HRC/27/CRP.3, paragraphs 53-57. </p>


<p>near continuous bombardment by Government forces and inadequate humanitarian relief 
</p>
<p>for over two years. Children who fled Rif Damascus in the course of 2014 experienced 
</p>
<p>long-lasting distress as a result of the state of insecurity and constant shelling and 
</p>
<p>Government airstrikes. A mother of three boys aged 7, 5 and 4 years, described her two 
</p>
<p>eldest children as having lost a lot of weight while the family was besieged in eastern 
</p>
<p>Ghouta. The youngest still has nightmares about being bombarded. Psychosocial 
</p>
<p>consequences of bombardment, displacement and other violations have affected children 
</p>
<p>across Syria.  
</p>
<p>192. The Government continued its aerial bombardment campaign in Dara&#8217;a and Idlib 
</p>
<p>governorates throughout 2014, killing and injuring children in several documented 
</p>
<p>instances in October. On 30 July, two children were wounded, one seriously, when Ein 
</p>
<p>Thaka village was aerially bombardment by Government forces. In Samlin (Dara&#8217;a), a 12-
</p>
<p>year-old girl was killed during indiscriminate shelling by Government forces reportedly 
</p>
<p>based in Zamrin. 
</p>
<p>193. A doctor working near the frontlines in Aleppo city reported an increase in injuries 
</p>
<p>from sniper fire between September and October 2014. He estimated that approximately 
</p>
<p>40% of persons hit by sniper fire were children. Most were targeted in Bustan Al-Pasha and 
</p>
<p>Sheikh Maksood. A pediatrician working in Aleppo described mass malnutrition, 
</p>
<p>communicable diseases, trauma and related ailments, and chronic illnesses left untreated 
</p>
<p>among his patients. 
</p>
<p>194. With approximately 5,000 schools destroyed in Syria, the resulting sharp decline in 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s education continues to be one of the greatest concerns among those interviewed. 
</p>
<p>The Government aerially bombarded Dar Ta&#8217;azzah, a town northwest of Aleppo, in late 
</p>
<p>June, early November and mid-December 2014, hitting a school on 6 November and 
</p>
<p>injuring children in the attack. In Dar Al-Kabira (Homs) and in Bab Touma (Damascus), no 
</p>
<p>schools have been operating since 2012. Some school buildings are used to shelter 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, while others have been abandoned after being targeted in 
</p>
<p>aerial attacks. The risk of being attacked while in school prevents children from accessing 
</p>
<p>education. Interviewees who fled Al Hasakah governorate described how children did not 
</p>
<p>go to school due to the frequent bombardments targeting educational institutions.  
</p>
<p>195. Intelligence and security agencies continued to detain young children together with 
</p>
<p>adults, exposing them to sexual violence and subjecting them to the same ill-treatment and 
</p>
<p>torture as adult detainees. In detention, children also witness violent torture and death. The 
</p>
<p>presence of children was documented in Military Security Branch 235, known as the 
</p>
<p>Palestine Branch, and in the Air Force Intelligence Branch in Mezzeh military airport 
</p>
<p>(Damascus), detention facilities in which torture is systematically employed. A 16-year-old 
</p>
<p>girl was subjected to sexual violence in Military security Branch 248 in Kafr Sousa in 
</p>
<p>Damascus in 2012 and 2013. A 5-year-old child who had been detained and tortured with 
</p>
<p>his mother in several different Government detention facilities, including Branch 248 in 
</p>
<p>Kafr Sousa, suffered severe distress, nightmares, and experienced problems urinating for 
</p>
<p>months afterward. A 16-year-old boy, who was detained and tortured at the National 
</p>
<p>Defense Forces Branch in Al-Joura neighbourhood in Dayr az Zawr, described being held 
</p>
<p>together with at least five other young boys, most of whom were younger than he. They 
</p>
<p>were placed inside a tyre and beaten and hung up for prolonged periods of time.  
</p>
<p>196. The failure of the Syrian authorities to protect children from the effects of conflict 
</p>
<p>has resulted in a devastating level of displacement of children. In targeting schools and 
</p>
<p>failing to take precautions in attacks to minimize harm to children and schools has led to a 
</p>
<p>significant loss of access to education among Syrian children, while indiscriminate attacks 
</p>
<p>continue to maim and kill children on a massive scale. In detaining children and exposing 
</p>
<p>them to ill-treatment and torture in detention facilities, Syrian authorities, including the 
</p>
<p>military, security and intelligence agencies, have violated children&#8217;s human rights and the </p>


<p>rules of international humanitarian law, amounting to war crimes. They have perpetrated 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity, entailing individual criminal responsibility for the direct 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of crimes and their authors at the highest levels of the chain of command, 
</p>
<p>including the highest levels of Government.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Anti-Government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>197. Anti-Government armed groups operating in eastern Ghouta (Rif Damascus) 
</p>
<p>continued to carry out indiscriminate attacks against residential neighbourhoods in 
</p>
<p>Damascus city. These mortar attacks resulted in civilian casualties, killed and maimed 
</p>
<p>children. On 30 September, Douela&#8217;a in Rif Damascus was shelled by non-State armed 
</p>
<p>group fighters from the direction of Doukhaniyah, killing a 10-year-old boy and injuring 
</p>
<p>other civilians who were walking along a residential street.  
</p>
<p>198. According to witnesses and victims of non-State armed group attacks in Busra Al-
</p>
<p>Sham, (Dara&#8217;a) the shells often hit civilian targets and many of the resulting casualties were 
</p>
<p>children. In an attack on 7 October, mortar shells were fired at the Busra Al-Sham hospital, 
</p>
<p>killing a 13-year-old girl who was standing in the hospital&#8217;s courtyard.  
</p>
<p>199. As armed groups have gained a foothold in southern governorates, hostilities have 
</p>
<p>taken place between Bedouin military and Druze localities in As-Suweida. On 16 August 
</p>
<p>2014, following attacks on local Druze civilians, Bedouin militants allied with Jabhat Al-
</p>
<p>Nusra killed a 13-year-old boy at close quarters. 
</p>
<p>200. On 12 November 2014, a rocket fired by non-State armed groups hit the Karnaz 
</p>
<p>Female School in Karnaz (Hama). The attack took place at approximately 10:15 am during 
</p>
<p>morning recess when children were playing in the school&#8217;s courtyard. Seven children were 
</p>
<p>killed in the attack and many others severely injured. As parents came to search for their 
</p>
<p>children, &#8220;each father or mother shouted and looked for his or her child, crying and 
</p>
<p>screaming.&#8221; A nearby medical clinic was also damaged in the shelling attack. Parents 
</p>
<p>described how their children, who survived the attack, were distressed and experienced 
</p>
<p>trauma in the aftermath. 
</p>
<p>201. In the course of hostilities between armed groups and Government forces in Adra 
</p>
<p>Al-Omalia, Jabhat Al-Nusra and Jaysh Al-Islam abducted hundreds of civilian residents in 
</p>
<p>December 2013. Around 25 September, the hostages were transferred by armed groups 
</p>
<p>when Government forces regained control over Adra Al-Omalia. The hostages, many of 
</p>
<p>whom are young children, continue to be held in an unidentified location. In early August 
</p>
<p>2014, an armed group kidnapped nine members of one family, including a 12-year-old boy 
</p>
<p>and a 10-year-old girl, from a village in Hama. The family were reportedly taken hostage to 
</p>
<p>force a relative&#8217;s defection from the army. 
</p>
<p>202. On 10 July, during an attack on Al-Rahjah village (Hama), Jabhat Al-Nusra fighters 
</p>
<p>beheaded a man in front of his children. Months later and displaced from their home, his 
</p>
<p>children continued to suffer the impact of the attack. 
</p>
<p>203. Of the 6.5 million internally displaced persons in Syria, half are children. With many 
</p>
<p>IDPs fleeing into areas under non-State armed group control, they are vulnerable to the 
</p>
<p>conduct of non-State armed group fighters. Separated from their communities, and often 
</p>
<p>their families and parents, children are at risk of being targeted and instrumentalised. 
</p>
<p>Armed groups continue to recruit and train children for active participation in hostilities. 
</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s membership in armed groups exposes them to injury and death in the course of 
</p>
<p>hostilities and to retaliation from other armed groups. A 16-year-old boy who had been 
</p>
<p>recruited and trained by Jabhat Al-Nusra in Dayr az Zawr, was imprisoned by ISIS upon 
</p>
<p>capture and then recruited into their ranks.  </p>


<p>204. Non-State armed groups have maimed and killed children in indiscriminate attacks 
</p>
<p>in Damascus, Idlib, Dara&#8217;a, Hama and Homs, including in attacks targeting schools, taken 
</p>
<p>children hostage and failed to protect children in their custody from harm. In a continuing 
</p>
<p>trend, Jabhat Al-Nusra has continued to use and recruit children into their ranks for active 
</p>
<p>combat roles. Acting in violation of international humanitarian law, the group has infringed 
</p>
<p>the rights of children and disregarded their obligations to afford them necessary protections 
</p>
<p>from harm and abuse.
 
</p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</i></p>
<p>205. ISIS has continued to instrumentalise and abuse children on a massive scale. The 
</p>
<p>violations documented have had acute physical and psychological repercussions for 
</p>
<p>survivors and witnesses and have had destabilising effects on communities. 
</p>
<p>206. On 29 May, a convoy of buses transporting children home to Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) 
</p>
<p>after writing their final school exams in Aleppo, was stopped by ISIS fighters. All male 
</p>
<p>students, aged 13 and 14 years old, were removed and transported to Menbej, where they 
</p>
<p>were taken to the Sharia Court and the Al-Fateh Mosque to spend the night. The following 
</p>
<p>morning, the children were taken to a two-story school building 500 metres from the 
</p>
<p>mosque and told that they would be detained there as hostages for a prisoner exchange with 
</p>
<p>the YPG. In the course of their four month long detention, ISIS members and Shari&#8217;a 
</p>
<p>teachers beat and mistreated the children as punishment for disobeying rules, such as being 
</p>
<p>too loud or speaking Kurdish. In the most severe punishments for repeat offences or for 
</p>
<p>trying to escape, ISIS gave boys electric shocks and suspended them by their wrists from 
</p>
<p>the ceiling for several hours.  
</p>
<p>207. The children were subjected to religious education in an apparent attempt to 
</p>
<p>indoctrinate them into ISIS&#8217; ideology and to desensitise them to forms of violence 
</p>
<p>employed by ISIS. This included forcing them to watch videos of beheadings. Following 
</p>
<p>their release, the boys&#8217; parents described the altered behaviour of their children and the 
</p>
<p>concerns they had for their mental well-being in the long-term. This incident stands as a 
</p>
<p>stark example of the manner in which ISIS utilises children to entrench their ideology into 
</p>
<p>communities with a view to ensuring long-term loyalty. 
</p>
<p>208. ISIS has detained children and subjected them to the same treatment as adults. A 13-
</p>
<p>year-old boy detained in an ISIS facility in (Aleppo) between March and October 2014, was 
</p>
<p>accused of writing anti-ISIS graffiti and tortured as punishment. A co-detainee described 
</p>
<p>the boy being taken away, blindfolded, hooded and tied up. He never returned to his cell. 
</p>
<p>An 11-year-old boy who was arrested in Al-Bab and accused of fighting against ISIS, was 
</p>
<p>executed in the same detention facility in 2014.  
</p>
<p>209. ISIS fighters have executed children accused of being members of opposing armed 
</p>
<p>groups as well as those who broke the group&#8217;s edicts. In September, ISIS beheaded a 16-
</p>
<p>year-old girl, who they accused of being an YPG member, in Shuyoukh, (Aleppo). On 5 
</p>
<p>September, a 16-year-old boy believed to have been a captured fighter from another armed 
</p>
<p>group was executed in Al-Ashara, (Dayr az Zawr) and his body was displayed for days 
</p>
<p>afterward. In early October, a male child was killed and his body placed on display in 
</p>
<p>Minbeij (Aleppo). Children are often present in the crowds at the executions and cannot 
</p>
<p>avoid seeing the publicly displayed corpses in the days that follow. One woman described 
</p>
<p>closing her son&#8217;s eyes as they passed television screens in Raqqah city on which ISIS 
</p>
<p>screened videos of its executions. 
</p>
<p>210. ISIS has also used children as executioners. Two Syrian Government soldiers 
</p>
<p>captured at Tabqa airport were executed by a 16-year-old ISIS fighter in late August. On 13 
</p>
<p>January, ISIS released a video showing a child approximately 10 or 11 years old shooting 
</p>
<p>two men accused of espionage. Children are trained to use weapons and to deploy as 
</p>
<p>suicide bombers in &#8220;Cubs Camps&#8221;. One 14-year-old boy, who was trained in such camps in </p>


<p>Idlib and Hama described seeing many non-Syrian children in the camps, some of whom 
</p>
<p>were the children of fighters, some who had been kidnapped, or had voluntarily joined ISIS. 
</p>
<p>Witnesses described seeing young children in ISIS insignia carrying weapons in Minbeij 
</p>
<p>(Aleppo) in October 2014. One of those interviewed witnessed a boy having to drag an AK-
</p>
<p>47 as the weapon was taller than him. Armed children were also observed in Al Hasakah, 
</p>
<p>where they were seen guarding ISIS bases and working at the group&#8217;s checkpoints. A child, 
</p>
<p>aged approximately 10 years, was seen working as a prison guard in an ISIS detention 
</p>
<p>centre in Tibneh (Dayr az Zawr). Children participated in active hostilities in the ISIS 
</p>
<p>assault on Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) and in military operations in Tibneh and Al-Shuhail (Dayr 
</p>
<p>az Zawr).  
</p>
<p>211. ISIS has failed to protect children in the course of their military operations. Children 
</p>
<p>who survived the attack on Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) in September and October 2014 
</p>
<p>exhibited signs of trauma in the aftermath and described their distress at losing their homes 
</p>
<p>and futures following their displacement. 
</p>
<p>212. In November 2014, ISIS closed schools in Aleppo and Dayr az Zawr for lack of 
</p>
<p>conformity with its understanding of Shari&#8217;a curriculum. In Ar Raqqah governorate, some 
</p>
<p>schools have reopened in compliance with ISIS&#8217; requirements. ISIS has also occupied 
</p>
<p>schools and used them as military bases. Two schools were occupied in Al-Shaddadi (Al 
</p>
<p>Hasakah) and one in Al-Ashara (Dayr az Zawr). The International Coalition&#8217;s aerial 
</p>
<p>campaign against ISIS has led their fighters to hide deeper in densely populated civilian 
</p>
<p>areas, abandoning their bases in school buildings, which were frequently marked with the 
</p>
<p>group&#8217;s banners. 
</p>
<p>213. The military use of schools endangers children and prevents their access to 
</p>
<p>education. The kidnapping and indoctrination of Kurdish schoolchildren in Minbeij is a 
</p>
<p>clear instance of a deliberate victimisation of children, entailing repeated violations of 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights. ISIS recruitment and use of children violates international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law and rises to the level of war crimes, committed in a systematic manner and on a mass 
</p>
<p>scale. The training of children and testimony describing the presence of children among 
</p>
<p>ISIS fighters indicates the organised recruitment and preparation of children for active 
</p>
<p>combat roles. The use of children as executioners, and the execution of children accused of 
</p>
<p>membership in opposing armed groups, indicates the level of vulnerability of children, in 
</p>
<p>particular boys, perceived to be of fighting age. ISIS&#8217; violations entail clear individual 
</p>
<p>criminal responsibility for the direct perpetrators of crimes and their authors at the highest 
</p>
<p>levels of ISIS&#8217; hierarchy.  
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Protection Units (YPG) </p>
<p>214.  Underage fighters were involved in the YPG&#8217;s military operations against ISIS in 
</p>
<p>Ayn al-Arab (Kobane). After the YPG call for mass mobilization to defend the area from 
</p>
<p>ISIS, many children joined the fighting and were wounded or killed. Minors participated in 
</p>
<p>military operations and YPG failed to take action to prevent their involvement. One 
</p>
<p>interviewee stated that his 15-year-old brother had been conscripted into the YPG to fight 
</p>
<p>in Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) and had since been injured in hostilities.  
</p>
<p>215. Accounts of recruitment of minors into the YPG have also been documented in 
</p>
<p>Aleppo and Al Hasakah. In separate incidents two 15-year-old girls were recruited by the 
</p>
<p>Women&#8217;s Protection Unit of the YPG in December 2014. 
</p>
<p>216. The YPG continues to recruit and use children in active hostilities in violation of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and their own stated commitments to the contrary. Available 
</p>
<p>information indicates that minors are accepted into YPG ranks for roles that involve direct 
</p>
<p>participation in hostilities. 
 </p>


<p><b> H. Unlawful attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>217. As the Government&#8217;s aerial campaign intensified on Raqqah city and governorate, 
</p>
<p>the Syrian air force continued to attack Aleppo city and its surroundings. Between 
</p>
<p>September and October 2014, the districts of Haydaria, Ard Hamra and Masakin Hanano 
</p>
<p>were targeted with barrel bombs on several documented occasions, killing civilians. A 
</p>
<p>doctor working in Aleppo city reported that the majority of his patients in critical condition 
</p>
<p>displayed wounds consistent with barrel bomb injuries. 
</p>
<p>218. The Government aerial bombardment campaign on non-State armed group-
</p>
<p>controlled areas of Aleppo has been ongoing since August 2012. In the course of the 
</p>
<p>campaign, Aleppo experienced mass displacement, in particular following the start of the 
</p>
<p>offensive in October 2013. However, interviewees described how those who lacked 
</p>
<p>resources, feared arrest and detention, or were too weak to flee, remained despite the 
</p>
<p>constant threat of bombardment. On 16 September, a Government helicopter dropped a 
</p>
<p>barrel bomb on a crowded vegetable market in Tariq Al-Bab, killing six civilians and 
</p>
<p>injuring 10 others. In October 2014, Al-Sukkari and other eastern districts of Aleppo, which 
</p>
<p>had been under repeated attack, were again hit with barrel bombs, killing civilians. 
</p>
<p>219. Between July and September 2014, Government forces dropped barrel bombs and 
</p>
<p>conducted airstrikes on the southern countryside of Idlib province, an area which hosts 
</p>
<p>large numbers of IDPs. One survivor from Sinjar described the attacks as following a 
</p>
<p>pattern of regular bombardments during daylight hours. Barrel bombs were dropped by 
</p>
<p>transport helicopters at night, between 3 and 4am. According to witnesses, the attacks were 
</p>
<p>conducted without distinguishing between civilian and military targets. In an attack around 
</p>
<p>16 July 2014, a barrel bomb was dropped on a civilian home at night, killing its inhabitants, 
</p>
<p>including two young children. 
</p>
<p>220. Since the Government began a concerted aerial campaign against ISIS, they have 
</p>
<p>conducted their strikes in an indiscriminate manner, hitting civilian objects and causing 
</p>
<p>considerable civilian casualties. On 18 October 2014, Government forces hit Al-Mahdom 
</p>
<p>Bakery in Minbeij, Aleppo, killing the civilian employees inside. On 6 November, 
</p>
<p>Government forces hit a school in Dar Tazzah, injuring children in the attack.  
</p>
<p>221. Raqqah city has been bombarded on a regular basis throughout September 2014 &#8211; 
</p>
<p>January 2015. Government forces have dropped barrel bombs on civilian targets and 
</p>
<p>conducted their hostilities in an indiscriminate manner. On 25 November 2014, densely 
</p>
<p>populated civilian locations were subjected to heavy aerial bombardment. The attack began 
</p>
<p>with two airstrikes targeting the industrial area east of Raqqah city. The Hanni Mosque was 
</p>
<p>subsequently hit with two targeted airstrikes, causing considerable damage to the mosque 
</p>
<p>and surrounding area. The Museum Square, a busy part of Raqqah city was hit thereafter. 
</p>
<p>The Boulman public transport station was targeted, with airstrikes hitting two buses and 
</p>
<p>killing the passengers inside. According to witnesses of the attacks, there was no armed 
</p>
<p>group or ISIS activity in any of the targeted areas. Interviewees suggested that the attacks 
</p>
<p>were carried out in retaliation for ISIS executing captured Government soldiers. The aerial 
</p>
<p>campaign on Raqqah city has resulted in extensive civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p>222. Government attacks on ISIS-controlled areas in Dayr az Zawr, namely on Al-Ashara 
</p>
<p>in July, Al-Tayanna on 3 August, Al-Mayadin in August and Tibneh throughout 2014 have 
</p>
<p>been conducted in an indiscriminate manner, causing considerable civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>Government forces indiscriminately bombarded Ahrar Al-Ghweran district in Hasakah city 
</p>
<p>on 12 August 2014, as part of a concerted assault on the area. Aqaribat (Hama) was also 
</p>
<p>subjected to indiscriminate attacks in October 2014, leading to civilian casualties and the 
</p>
<p>destruction of civilian property.  </p>


<p>223. On 3 September, a Government jet struck an ISIS checkpoint near Al-Shula. While 
</p>
<p>killing ISIS fighters, the disproportionate attack also killed 21 civilians, most of them 
</p>
<p>children, who were in a bus at the checkpoint at the time. The available information 
</p>
<p>suggests that this attack was disproportionate, causing excessive incidental death and 
</p>
<p>injury, in relation to the direct, overall anticipated military advantage. 
</p>
<p>224. Government forces continued to carry out indiscriminate attacks against areas with 
</p>
<p>non-State armed group presence in Rif Damascus. Douma and Mesraba were subject to 
</p>
<p>bombardment between July and September 2014. In the context of the siege on Zabadani, 
</p>
<p>Government forces continued shelling the area and using landmines, causing considerable 
</p>
<p>harm to the civilian population. Civilians, including children were killed in an aerial attack 
</p>
<p>on a market in Arbin on 9 October 2014.  
</p>
<p>225. The increase in intensity of hostilities on the southern front of the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>military offensive has also caused extensive civilian casualties. Indiscriminate attacks were 
</p>
<p>carried out in Namar from July to August, Samlin on 1-2 August 2014, Tafas between June 
</p>
<p>and August, in Al-Arba&#8217;een neighbourhood in Dara&#8217;a Al Balad on 4 September 2014.  
</p>
<p>226. Persons displaced as a result of Government attacks have been further targeted while 
</p>
<p>fleeing Syria. Survivors described shelling targeting convoys in Dara&#8217;a transporting 
</p>
<p>displaced civilians moving toward the Syrian-Jordanian border. Many people have been 
</p>
<p>unable to flee Syria to neighbouring states, including Jordan and Lebanon, due to 
</p>
<p>restrictions on persons seeking refuge.  
</p>
<p>227. The strikes and shelling attacks continued through October 2014, with Tariq Al Sad 
</p>
<p>neighbourhood in Dara&#8217;a city targeted with bombardment on 9 October 2014. A barrel 
</p>
<p>bomb attack on Al-Mahata market in Dara&#8217;a city in mid-October, leading to civilian 
</p>
<p>casualties, among them children. Inkhil was shelled in October, killing and wounding 
</p>
<p>civilians in the area. Al-Mezeireeb was aerially bombarded on 20 October 2014. The attack 
</p>
<p>killed and injured farmers working in their fields.  
</p>
<p>228. During the reporting period, the Government undertook an aerial campaign on Ar 
</p>
<p>Raqqah and continued its aerial assault on Dara&#8217;a. The pattern of attacks and manner in 
</p>
<p>which they were carried out demonstrates an apparent lack of precautions taken by Syrian 
</p>
<p>forces and a lack of distinction between military and civilian targets. The use of barrel 
</p>
<p>bombs in aerial campaigns against whole areas is in violation of international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law and in some cases, amounts to the war crime of targeting civilians. Government forces 
</p>
<p>have systematically targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure, demonstrating the intent to 
</p>
<p>kill, wound and maim. Targets have included markets, shops, hospitals, schools, and public 
</p>
<p>spaces where civilians gather in large numbers. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Anti-Government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>229. In conducting hostilities, non-State armed groups relied on the inherently 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate use of vehicle-borne (VBIED) and roadside improvised explosive devices 
</p>
<p>(IED), and continued to fire mortars indiscriminately at civilian areas under Government 
</p>
<p>control. 
</p>
<p>230. Armed groups positioned in eastern Ghouta in Rif Damascus continued to shell 
</p>
<p>residential neighbourhoods in Damascus city controlled by the Government. In August, 
</p>
<p>civilians living in Al Amara and Jaramana districts of Damascus were subjected to 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate mortar shelling, which caused civilian deaths and injuries. Between 6 and 14 
</p>
<p>September, fighters from Jaysh Al-Islam shelled Al-Kabbas neighbourhood, and Douelaa 
</p>
<p>on 20 and 30 September. In November, As Sadat and Al Amara were shelled by armed 
</p>
<p>groups, and Mezzeh was hit by mortar fire reportedly fired from eastern Ghouta. </p>


<p>231. In the context of hostilities between Bedouin military and Druze localities in As-
</p>
<p>Suweida, Bedouin militants allied with Jabhat Al Nusra fired upon civilian passenger buses 
</p>
<p>on 14 August and 16 August 2014 near Dama and Deir Dama, wounding women and 
</p>
<p>children with gunshots from the direction of the town of Ariqa. On 16 August, Bedouin 
</p>
<p>Jabhat Al Nusra fighters attacked a Druze family, killing three men with mortar fire. 
</p>
<p>Survivors of the attack stated that the fighters shouted, &#8220;You are <i>kufar,</i> you are pigs. We are 
</p>
<p>coming to kill you.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>232. Improvised explosives placed on a busy route between Dama and Areeqah in Dara&#8217;a 
</p>
<p>killed five civilian passengers travelling on a bus and injured nine others on 3 September 
</p>
<p>2014. The bus was hit by two consecutive IEDs, causing major damage to the vehicle and 
</p>
<p>its passengers. The casualties included a high school student and a school principal. 
</p>
<p>233. Armed groups shelled Government-controlled civilian areas of Busra Al-Sham, 
</p>
<p>Dara&#8217;a between March and September and between 7 and 25 October 2014. Armed groups 
</p>
<p>also shelled Government-controlled areas of Dara&#8217;a and Busra Al-Sham throughout 2014, 
</p>
<p>causing civilian casualties due to their indiscriminate manner.  
</p>
<p>234. Prior to being pushed back by Government forces in October 2014, armed groups 
</p>
<p>operating in northern Hama governorate had intensified their hostilities against 
</p>
<p>Government-controlled areas conducted indiscriminate attacks against Al Suqaylabyah 
</p>
<p>between August and September, Mahrada between July and September, and Karnaz in 
</p>
<p>October. In the eastern countryside, armed group fighters conducted indiscriminate attacks 
</p>
<p>on villages west of Salamiyah city including Snaydeh, Khnayfiss and Salamiyah in October 
</p>
<p>2014.  
</p>
<p>235. VBIEDs continued to be deployed by armed groups operating in Hama, indicating 
</p>
<p>an increased use of and reliance on tactics that spread terror among the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>On 31 August and 1 September, there were two car bomb attacks on Taldara, a majority 
</p>
<p>Ismaili village. The first attack killed two civilians and severely injured nine others, four of 
</p>
<p>whom were young children. Six more civilians were killed in the second attack. Many of 
</p>
<p>those injured were maimed. The explosion led to the extensive destruction of residential 
</p>
<p>homes and agricultural buildings. On 3 September, a roadside IED was detonated between 
</p>
<p>Al-Kafat and Taldara, killing a father and his child and severely injuring the mother. The 
</p>
<p>family was on their way to get medical treatment for their child. This attack followed 
</p>
<p>several other attacks on the Al-Kafat &#8211; Taldara road in August 2014. 
</p>
<p>236. On 24 September 2014, Jabhat Al-Nusra claimed responsibility for a car bomb 
</p>
<p>attack on Ain Amouda, Hama, killing two and injuring ten civilians. Witnesses to the attack 
</p>
<p>stated that there were no Government military or NDF forces in the area. Residents of 
</p>
<p>Ismaili enclaves in the Hama countryside described a drastic increase in the number of 
</p>
<p>IEDs and car bomb attacks in recent months and the level of fear instilled as a result. 
</p>
<p>237. Civilians living in Homs city continued to be affected by armed group hostilities 
</p>
<p>directed at residential neighbourhoods. Wadi Dahab neighbourhood was attacked with 
</p>
<p>mortar fire on 16 September, and Zahra was targeted in November 2014. Residents alleged 
</p>
<p>that the attacks were carried out with rocket propelled grenades by fighters from Jabhat Al 
</p>
<p>Nusra.  
</p>
<p>238. Non-State armed groups attacked civilian areas under Government control in an 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate manner, often targeting no military objective and causing civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>The continued rise in documented IEDs, vehicle borne and roadside, particularly in Hama 
</p>
<p>governorate, has resulted in high civilian casualties as they target civilians in densely 
</p>
<p>populated areas and transit routes. Such conduct is in violation of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, and where attacks target civilians, amount to war crimes.  
</p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham </i></p>


<p>239. In Aleppo governorate, ISIS has engaged in intensive hostilities against non-State 
</p>
<p>armed groups and Kurdish armed forces. ISIS&#8217; ground assault on Ayn al-Arab (Kobane), 
</p>
<p>which started on 15 September was enabled through their capacity to direct protracted 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate shelling toward the town and its inhabitants. On 22 September, as ISIS was 
</p>
<p>advancing, fighters shelled a bakery in the village of Zarik, killing four civilian employees. 
</p>
<p>The bakery served the entire western region of Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) and was a vital 
</p>
<p>source of sustenance for the surrounding area.  
</p>
<p>240. Since taking control of territory in northern and eastern Syria, ISIS has occupied 
</p>
<p>civilian buildings, including schools and hospitals as military bases. Since the onset of 
</p>
<p>International Coalition strikes, ISIS fighters have moved their positions into residential 
</p>
<p>areas, endangering civilians. In October, residents of Minbeij described how ISIS occupied 
</p>
<p>buildings in densely populated areas as a deliberate tactic. A similar trend was observed in 
</p>
<p>Al Bab in November 2014, putting the civilian population at risk of the effects of attacks 
</p>
<p>against ISIS targets.  
</p>
<p>241. In Dayr az Zawr, ISIS adopted similar tactics, occupying civilian buildings in Al-
</p>
<p>Ashara in September 2014. In one instance, a civilian whose relatives were killed in a 
</p>
<p>coalition airstrike was forced to flee because he complained to ISIS about their presence 
</p>
<p>near his home. In Al-Mayadin, ISIS fighters appropriated and moved into civilian homes in 
</p>
<p>November 2014, displacing their residents and endangering the civilian population in the 
</p>
<p>vicinity.  
</p>
<p>242. By occupying civilian homes, ISIS has endangered civilians in violation of their 
</p>
<p>obligations under customary international humanitarian law. ISIS&#8217; assault on Ayn al-Arab 
</p>
<p>(Kobane) was conducted in an indiscriminate manner, violating international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law and with the apparent intent to cause considerable harm to the Kurdish population. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Undetermined perpetrator 
</b></p>
<p>243. On Friday, 15 August 2014, a car bomb was detonated outside the Taqwa Mosque in 
</p>
<p>Namar (Dara&#8217;a). The explosion took place while worshippers were leaving the mosque. 
</p>
<p>According to victim testimony, the car was parked less than 20 metres from the mosque and 
</p>
<p>the bombing was timed to cause maximum damage. Media reports and witness accounts 
</p>
<p>suggest that between 14 and 22 people were killed in the attack, including several children. 
</p>
<p>Also killed in the bombing were several FSA fighters, including at least one defector. It is 
</p>
<p>possible that he was the target of the attack. According to an account, FSA-affiliated armed 
</p>
<p>groups in the area apprehended persons from a Shi&#8217;a militant group in connection with the 
</p>
<p>attack. Those interviewed indicated that people apprehended at the scene stated that they 
</p>
<p>had planted the bomb there at the behest of the Government. Further information collected 
</p>
<p>indicates that Government forces, in particular the General Security Directorate, may have 
</p>
<p>been involved in commissioning similar VBIEDs on other occasions. No party has claimed 
</p>
<p>responsibility for this attack. Other VBIEDs have been detonated in civilian areas, causing 
</p>
<p>considerable casualties. In areas with continuous and protracted hostilities between 
</p>
<p>Government forces and non-State armed groups, it is not possible to verify the perpetrator 
</p>
<p>of certain attacks. 
 
</p>
<p><b> I. Specifically protected persons and objects 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>244. Government forces have continued to target medical facilities in the course of their 
</p>
<p>military operations against armed groups. The remaining functioning hospitals and medical 
</p>
<p>facilities in non-State armed group-controlled areas do not mark their buildings with the 
</p>
<p>Red Cross or Red Crescent emblem to avoid being targeted by Government forces. </p>


<p>245. During the aerial campaign in Idlib governorate, Government forces dropped barrel 
</p>
<p>bombs on Kansafra city, hitting and destroying two hospitals and injuring medical 
</p>
<p>personnel on 16 July 2014. The hospitals contained orthopaedics, obstetrics and 
</p>
<p>gynaecology and paediatric centres. On 29 July, Orient Hospital in Al-Kaniya village near 
</p>
<p>Jisr Al-Shukhour, was hit in an airstrike. On 19 September, the hospital was attacked again, 
</p>
<p>rendering its facilities dysfunctional. Orient Hospital in Al-Kaniya had been targeted twice 
</p>
<p>in 2013.  
</p>
<p>246. Hospitals in eastern Ghouta (Rif Damascus) have been systematically targeted. Al-
</p>
<p>Nashabeea Hospital was struck by tank fire on 28 July, killing a general surgeon and an 
</p>
<p>emergency intensive care doctor. The hospital was further targeted with repeated airstrikes 
</p>
<p>during the first week of September 2014, leading to its destruction. The Al-Kahf Surgical 
</p>
<p>Hospital in eastern Ghouta was hit with barrel bombs on 1 September, destroying much of 
</p>
<p>the hospital&#8217;s infrastructure and injuring medical personnel. 
</p>
<p>247. In a devastating attack on Al-Houda surgical field hospital in Aleppo countryside on 
</p>
<p>2 August 2014, six medical personnel and nine patients were killed, and 20 medical staff 
</p>
<p>were injured. The hospital was hit at 10:30 am and rendered dysfunctional.  
</p>
<p>248. Helfaya National Hospital in Hama was attacked on 6 and 7 August 2014, causing 
</p>
<p>significant damage to its infrastructure and substantially reducing its ability to treat patients.  
</p>
<p>249. On 23 August, the Al-Tabqa National Hospital in Ar Raqqah was attacked with 
</p>
<p>barrel bombs, destroying the building and killing at least four medical personnel. The 
</p>
<p>hospital was a significant provider of medical care to the residents of Tabqa. 
</p>
<p>250. Ambulances have been targeted, killing paramedics and the sick and wounded. On 
</p>
<p>17 July 2014, an airstrike hit an ambulance while paramedics were rescuing and providing 
</p>
<p>emergency care to persons wounded in airstrikes against Al-Bab (Aleppo). A paramedic 
</p>
<p>was killed and the driver of the ambulance was severely injured. An ambulance rescuing 
</p>
<p>civilians injured in an airstrike targeting a market in Douma, (Rif Damascus) on 3 August 
</p>
<p>2014, was hit, killing two paramedics. Another ambulance was attacked on 18 September 
</p>
<p>2014 in eastern Ghouta (Rif Damascus), killing the two drivers. An ambulance transporting 
</p>
<p>wounded civilians was struck by barrel bombs in the north of Aleppo city.  
</p>
<p>251. Government forces carried out an airstrike against Atteb Alhadeeth Hospital in Al-
</p>
<p>Mayadin (Dayr az Zawr) on 16 December 2014, killing tens of wounded patients and 
</p>
<p>destroying much of the hospitals infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>252. Al-Radwan field hospital located in Jasim (Dara&#8217;a) was hit in four separate air raids 
</p>
<p>on 31 December, destroying much of its infrastructure and forcing it to cease operations. 
</p>
<p>The attack wounded dozens of patients, among them children. The hospital had previously 
</p>
<p>been targeted in aerial bombardment campaigns in Dara&#8217;a. The field hospital served 
</p>
<p>residents and IDPs seeking shelter in areas of Jasim city under non-State armed group 
</p>
<p>control. 
</p>
<p>253. Medical personnel continue to be detained and disappeared. Accounts from 
</p>
<p>Government detention facilities often refer to doctors and nurses detained on charges of 
</p>
<p>aiding the opposition. Medical personnel have been severely tortured and died in the 
</p>
<p>custody of Syrian authorities.  
</p>
<p>254. The documented incidents of attacks against hospitals are of grave concern, as they 
</p>
<p>demonstrate a disregard for the specially protected status of healthcare facilities and a 
</p>
<p>failure to take precautions to avoid civilian casualties and protected the sick and wounded. 
</p>
<p>The pattern of attacks indicates that Government forces deliberately target hospitals and 
</p>
<p>medical units to gain military advantage by depriving anti-Government armed groups and 
</p>
<p>their perceived supporters of medical assistance.  </p>


<p>255. Attacks against medical facilities and personnel amount to serious violations of 
</p>
<p>Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and war crimes. Such tactics have long-term 
</p>
<p>repercussions on the ability of entire communities to treat war-related and chronic 
</p>
<p>healthcare problems. The criminalization of medical assistance under anti-terrorism laws 
</p>
<p>issued on 2 July 2012 contravene the customary international humanitarian law rule that 
</p>
<p>under no circumstances shall any person be punished for carrying out medical activities 
</p>
<p>compatible with medical ethics, regardless of the person benefiting therefrom.  
</p>
<p>256. Government forces continue to disregard their international legal obligations to 
</p>
<p>refrain from attacking cultural objects and sites and to not use them for military purposes. 
</p>
<p>In continuing to use the Aleppo Citadel, a World Heritage site, as a military base to 
</p>
<p>bombard the Old City of Aleppo, the Government has endangered the site and disregarded 
</p>
<p>Security Council Resolution 2139, adopted on 22 February 2014, which calls on all parties 
</p>
<p>to act immediately to save Syria&#8217;s rich societal mosaic and cultural heritage, and take 
</p>
<p>appropriate steps to ensure the protection of Syria&#8217;s World Heritage Sites.  
</p>
<p><b>  2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham 
</i></p>
<p>257. In the course of ISIS&#8217; assault on Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) in September 2014, the 
</p>
<p>city&#8217;s hospitals were shelled, contributing to the dire humanitarian situation and 
</p>
<p>displacement of civilians.f 
</p>
<p>258. The deliberate destruction of an Armenian church in Dayr Az-Zawr in September 
</p>
<p>2014 demonstrates a continuation of the trend documented in the Commission&#8217;s thematic 
</p>
<p>paper &#8220;Rule of Terror: Living Under ISIS in Syria&#8221;.g  
</p>
<p>259. The abduction, torture and execution of journalists, media activists and humanitarian 
</p>
<p>aid workers by ISIS have been documented since June 2013 in Aleppo. Both Syrian and 
</p>
<p>international journalists and aid workers have been killed by ISIS in a deliberate attempt to 
</p>
<p>control the flow of information in the areas under its controls. Journalists and activists 
</p>
<p>working to document the violations and abuses suffered by their local communities under 
</p>
<p>ISIS have been denied their special protection under international humanitarian law and 
</p>
<p>have been disappeared, detained, tortured and killed. 
</p>
<p>260. ISIS&#8217; conducts attacks that violate its obligations under customary international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law. In a deliberate effort to assert control, ISIS has deliberate attacked 
</p>
<p>protected objects and persons, amounting to war crimes.  </p>
<p><b> J. Sieges and denial of humanitarian access 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>261. The Government continues to conduct its military operations in a manner which 
</p>
<p>disregards the humanitarian needs of the civilian population. Government authorities 
</p>
<p>prohibit the inclusion of medical and surgical supplies in humanitarian convoys making 
</p>
<p>cross-line deliveries. In Damascus, the impact of the eastern Ghouta siege on food security 
</p>
<p>has harmed children. The siege is enforced through checkpoints encircling eastern Ghouta, 
</p>
<p>manned by elite units, including the 3
rd
</p>
<p>, 4
th
</p>
<p> Divisions, and Republican Guard. Government 
</p>
<p>forces shelled Hamouriyah in eastern Ghouta between March and September, worsening 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> f See paragraphs 279-281, below. 
</p>
<p> g See A/HRC/27/CRP.3, paragraphs 25, 29 and 31. </p>


<p>the humanitarian conditions and contributing to displacement. Those who fled described a 
</p>
<p>lack of adequate humanitarian aid and access to basic foodstuffs.  
</p>
<p>262. The siege of Yarmouk in Damascus has continued to be enforced by pro-
</p>
<p>Government forces, including elements from Branch 235 (also known as the Palestine 
</p>
<p>Branch) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. These forces and the Syrian 
</p>
<p>authorities accord irregular and inadequate access to humanitarian actors. 18,000 
</p>
<p>Palestinians remain inside Yarmouk. The absence of medical and surgical supplies in aid 
</p>
<p>deliveries has created a chronically low supply of medicine in Yarmouk. Children suffer 
</p>
<p>from acute malnutrition. Instances of humanitarian actors coming under attack by armed 
</p>
<p>groups operating inside Yarmouk have been reported. Many of the residents whohave fled 
</p>
<p>Yarmouk in the course of the conflict are currently displaced to Khan Al-Sheeh (Rif 
</p>
<p>Damascus). Government forces have surrounded the area and conducted indiscriminate 
</p>
<p>attacks in their assault against armed groups operating in the area. Palestinians living inside 
</p>
<p>Syria are faced with a worsening situation and eroding protections.   
</p>
<p>263. Accounts consistent with previous reporting periods indicate that Government forces 
</p>
<p>impose restrictions on movement, humanitarian access, medical supplies and basic 
</p>
<p>necessities on areas with non-State armed group presence. This has resulted in severe 
</p>
<p>shortages among the civilian population in Dara&#8217;a, namely in Khirbat Ghazala (Al-Tahwra), 
</p>
<p>Nawa, Mhajeh, Al-Mohhayam and Tariq Al-Sad neighbourhood in Dara&#8217;a city. These areas 
</p>
<p>have also been indiscriminately shelled, aggravating the humanitarian situation. 
</p>
<p>Government forces periodically tighten and loosen the sieges in Dara&#8217;a as part of their 
</p>
<p>military strategy. During the summer of 2014, wheat fields and agricultural land in Namar 
</p>
<p>and Jasim were set alight as a result of mortar shelling by Government forces. Some 
</p>
<p>residents who suffered the destruction of their harvest said the attacks had been punitive. In 
</p>
<p>the course of the Government&#8217;s campaign against ISIS, a bakery in Minbeij (Aleppo) was 
</p>
<p>aerially bombarded on 18 October 2014.  
</p>
<p>264. Government forces instrumentalise the basic needs of civilians, including access to 
</p>
<p>medical care and food, as part of a military strategy to erode civilian support in areas under 
</p>
<p>non-State armed group control and punish those perceived to be affiliated with armed 
</p>
<p>groups. By refusing to permit humanitarian delivery of medical supplies to the civilian 
</p>
<p>population, the lives of women, men and children are put at grave risk. Civilians are 
</p>
<p>indiscriminately targeted by a systematic policy to prevent access to medical assistance. 
</p>
<p>The consistent denial of medical supplies by Syrian authorities is in stark violation of their 
</p>
<p>obligations under Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions to care for the sick and 
</p>
<p>wounded, which includes both the civilian population as well as those taking an active part 
</p>
<p>in hostilities. The denial of medicine has no military justification and is used as part of a 
</p>
<p>punitive strategy. Attacks on civilian objects, such as bakeries, are unlawful.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>Anti-Government armed groups 
</i></p>
<p>265.  Since mid-2014, non-State armed groups have carried out an increased number of 
</p>
<p>attacks against facilities necessary for the survival of the civilian population. Targeting the 
</p>
<p>lifelines of communities under the control of, or perceived to be affiliated with the 
</p>
<p>Government has emerged as a military tactic of some non-State armed groups, with dire 
</p>
<p>humanitarian consequences for civilians. In Nubul and Zahra (Aleppo) armed groups 
</p>
<p>controlling the access routes to the area prevent the supply of basic goods to the civilian 
</p>
<p>population.  
</p>
<p>266. On 24 November 2014, armed groups attacked Ain Al-Fijeh, the source of fresh 
</p>
<p>water for Damascus city, in retaliation for the Government offensive against their positions. </p>


<p>An estimated five million people living in Damascus suffered shortages of water as a result, 
</p>
<p>as water had to be re-routed from other localities to Damascus. 
</p>
<p>267. In Hama, armed group fighters burned wheat fields and olive groves in Al-Muzaira, 
</p>
<p>targeting the Ismaili community perceived to be affiliated with the Government. Mortar fire 
</p>
<p>indiscriminately fired by armed groups against Taldara set agricultural fields alight and 
</p>
<p>destroyed what residents described to be 70% of their harvest. Armed group fighters 
</p>
<p>continued to prevent farmers from accessing their land and harvest in Al-Ghab and around 
</p>
<p>Al-Salamiyah by planting anti-personnel landmines and using sniper fire. 
</p>
<p>268. In As-Suweida, armed groups restricted farmer&#8217;s access to their agricultural fields in 
</p>
<p>Leben. This has had a significant impact on the ability of the local Druze community to 
</p>
<p>access their livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>269. Non-State armed groups increasingly targeted the lifelines of civilians, including 
</p>
<p>power stations, electricity installations, and agricultural land. By attacking, destroying or 
</p>
<p>rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, armed 
</p>
<p>groups have violated their obligations under international humanitarian law and infringed 
</p>
<p>upon the rights of civilians.  
</p>
<p><i>Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) 
</i></p>
<p>270. Prior to the assault on Ayn al-Arab (Kobane), ISIS fighters deliberately cut off water 
</p>
<p>and electricity supplies to the town. During the ground attack, the group pillaged livestock 
</p>
<p>and destroyed the property of Kurdish civilians. Civilians living in areas under ISIS control 
</p>
<p>lack access to basic medical care due to the destruction or occupation of medical facilities 
</p>
<p>and restrictions imposed on the professional activities of medical personnel, resulting in a 
</p>
<p>lack of qualified doctors. Accounts describe ISIS attempts to recruit and train civilians to 
</p>
<p>become nurses and doctors to fill this gap and abducting doctors for the same purpose. 
</p>
<p>271. ISIS fighters violated their obligations under international humanitarian law in 
</p>
<p>cutting off the supplies and installations indispensable to the survival of the civilian 
</p>
<p>population in to Ayn al-Arab (Kobane). Through deliberately looting and destroying the 
</p>
<p>property of Kurdish civilians, ISIS fighters appeared to conduct their operations with the 
</p>
<p>objective of ensuring that Kurdish civilians could not return to their homes. Such acts, 
</p>
<p>amounting to forcible displacement, amount to grave violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law and war crimes, incurring individual criminal responsibility. ISIS has also 
</p>
<p>failed in its obligations to provide adequate medical care to the sick and wounded and to 
</p>
<p>civilians under its control. 
 
</p>
<p><b> K. Arbitrary and forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Government forces  
</b></p>
<p>272. Over ten million Syrians, more than a third of the country&#8217;s population, have been 
</p>
<p>displaced from their homes, fleeing to areas of relative safety inside Syria or crossing its 
</p>
<p>borders to live as refugees. Many of these have fled the indiscriminate disproportionate 
</p>
<p>aerial bombardments and shelling by Government forces. Such mass displacements 
</p>
<p>occurred in the eastern countryside of Aleppo governorate, eastern Ghouta (Rif Damascus), 
</p>
<p>and in the area of Sheikh Maskin and Nawa in central Dara&#8217;a. 
</p>
<p>273. By causing such large-scale displacements as a result of its unlawful attacks, the 
</p>
<p>Government has failed in its obligations under international human rights law to protect 
</p>
<p>civilians from such displacement. It has also failed to comply with its duties under 
</p>
<p>customary international humanitarian law to take all possible measures to provide displaced 
</p>
<p>civilians shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition and to ensure that members of the 
</p>
<p>same family are not separated.  </p>


<p><b> 2. Non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) 
</i></p>
<p>274. ISIS has systematically targeted sources of potential dissent, including through the 
</p>
<p>forcible displacement of civilians living in its areas of control. 
</p>
<p>275. As ISIS solidified its control of large swathes of Dayr az Zawr governorate in the 
</p>
<p>summer of 2014, it forced those perceived to be not in support of the armed group - or those 
</p>
<p>who were connected, even tenuously, to persons supporting the Government or other armed 
</p>
<p>groups - from their homes. 
</p>
<p>276. In mid-August 2014, shortly after seizing Mohassan, ISIS forced out a large family 
</p>
<p>who had rented a house from an Alawite man perceived to be connected to the Syrian 
</p>
<p>Government. In confiscating the property and driving the family out, ISIS fighters stated 
</p>
<p>that the landlord was &#8220;kuffar&#8221; and &#8220;working for the regime&#8221;. Reportedly several others 
</p>
<p>families were forcibly displaced by ISIS on the grounds that the owners were &#8220;infidels&#8221;. In 
</p>
<p>early October 2014, ISIS expelled a family from its home in Al-Qouriyah days after the 
</p>
<p>wife had given birth. The group displaced the family ostensibly because the husband was 
</p>
<p>seen as being &#8220;moderate&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>277. In the displacements documented in Mo Hassan and Al-Qouriyah (Dayr az Zawr) 
</p>
<p>and Slouk (Ar Raqqah), ISIS fighters confiscated the houses and provided them to its 
</p>
<p>fighters and their families for their own use. 
</p>
<p>278.  In July 2014, ISIS ordered Kurdish families from their homes in Slouk. The group 
</p>
<p>then confiscated the property and gifted it to its foreign fighters and their relatives. One 
</p>
<p>civilian was evicted from his apartment, which was then turned over to a Pakistani ISIS 
</p>
<p>fighter. Other residents of Slouk suspected to be supportive of the Syrian Government, or 
</p>
<p>who use to be officers in the civilian management were also reportedly forced from their 
</p>
<p>homes by ISIS.   
</p>
<p>279.  On 15 September 2014, ISIS launched a multi-front attack on the Ayn al-Arab 
</p>
<p>(Kobane) region, a majority Kurdish enclave in northern Aleppo. Between 15 September 
</p>
<p>and 5 October 2014, ISIS advanced quickly through the countryside, amidst heavy clashes 
</p>
<p>with the YPG. By the first week of October, the group entered the city, seizing some of its 
</p>
<p>outer neighbourhoods. During the ISIS advance, more than 200,000 Kurdish civilians fled, 
</p>
<p>or were evacuated by YPG. While close to 400 villages were emptied, some civilians who 
</p>
<p>were too old, too infirm or wished to protect their property, remained behind. 
</p>
<p>280.  Some were executed while others were immediately ordered to the leave their 
</p>
<p>homes. ISIS also took some civilians by force to Tel Abyad (Ar Raqqah) where they were 
</p>
<p>detained and beaten. On release, they were forced to leave the area. &#8220;You have to forget 
</p>
<p>Kobane and your villages&#8221;, one ISIS fighter told an interviewee. A senior ISIS commander, 
</p>
<p>when asked if one resident could return to his village to collect his livestock, responded 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? Do you have your house here? Do you have your village here? &#8230;.You don&#8217;t belong 
</p>
<p>here. By tomorrow not one of you will remain here or come back here.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>281. After ISIS took control, executing or forcibly displacing the few remaining 
</p>
<p>residents, fighters systematically looted houses in rural Ayn al-Arab (Kobane), with goods 
</p>
<p>and livestock transported to markets in Ar Raqqah governorate. ISIS fighters also killed 
</p>
<p>livestock and set houses alight. 
</p>
<p>282. In early November 2014, ISIS expelled a family from its home in Al-Bab on the 
</p>
<p>grounds that the father of the family was an activist working against ISIS. The man&#8217;s wife 
</p>
<p>and six children were forced to leave, with one fighter saying &#8220;this home is no longer their 
</p>
<p>property but the property of the Islamic State&#8221;. Other activists and their families were also </p>


<p>reportedly ordered to vacate their homes by ISIS, with ISIS then confiscating their houses 
</p>
<p>and property for its fighters&#8217; own use.  
</p>
<p>283. In the above incidents, there is no evidence to suggest that ISIS&#8217;s order that civilians 
</p>
<p>leave was justified by either the security of the civilians involved or by military necessity. 
</p>
<p>Such conduct amounts to the war crime of forcible displacement. 
</p>
<p>284. Further, there is no evidence to suggest that the appropriation of property as 
</p>
<p>described above was justified by military necessity and it is evident that the houses and any 
</p>
<p>property within was then provided to foreign ISIS fighters and their families for their 
</p>
<p>personal use. Consequently, there are reasonable grounds to believe that ISIS has 
</p>
<p>committed the war crime of pillaging.  </p>
