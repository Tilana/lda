<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E. M&#233;ndez, to the Human 
Rights Council, pursuant to its resolution 16/23.  
</p>
<p>2. In the present addendum, the Special Rapporteur provides observations, where 
considered appropriate, on communications sent to States between 1 December 2011 and 
30 November 2012 , as well as on responses received from States in relation to these 
communications until 31 January 2013. Communications sent and responses received 
during the reporting period are accessible electronically through hyperlinks. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the receipt of additional responses from 
States through to 31 January 2013 in relation to the joint study on global practices in 
relation to secret detention in the context of countering terrorism (A/HRC/13/42). The 
current report does not comment on the substance of responses received so far to the joint 
study on secret detention. Subject to agreement with the other mandate-holders responsible 
for that joint report, and after more responses are received, a special report on those 
contributions will be issued.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all States which have transmitted responses to 
communications sent. He considers response to his communications an important part of 
cooperation by States with his mandate. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls 
paragraph 6(a) of the Human Rights Council resolution 16/23 which urges States to 
&#8220;cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his or her task, to 
</p>
<p>supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to fully and expeditiously 
respond to his or her urgent appeals, and urges those Governments that have not yet 
responded to communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur to answer 
without further delay.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>5. The communications and the relevant replies can be accessed via the 
communications reports of Special Procedures A/HRC/20/30 (communications sent, 1 
December 2011 to 15 March 2012; replies received, 1 February 2012 to 15 May 2012); 
A/HRC/21/49 (communications sent, 16 March to 31 May 2012; replies received, 16 May 
to 31 July 2012) and A/HRC/22/67 (communications sent, 1 June to 30 November 2012; 
replies received, 1 August 2012 to 31 January 2013).

<p><b> II. Observations by the Special Rapporteur

</b></p>
<p><b> (a) </b>JAL 21/12/2011 Case No. AGO 3/2011 State reply: None to date<b> Alleged excessive use of 
force by authorities during peaceful protests 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Angola has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged excessive use of force against 
peaceful protestors. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that principle 4 of the UN Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, provides that, &#8220;Law 
enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent 
means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221; In light of the fact that no 
</p>
<p>evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur finds that the rights 
under the UN Convention against Torture of the individuals mentioned in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>communication have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible and to provide full redress to the 
victims.

<p><b> (a) </b>AL 11/07/2012 Case No. ARG 1/2012 State reply: 05/09/2012<b> Allegacion de actos de 
tortura cometidos por agentes oficiales de la localidad de Florencia en la Provincia de 
</b></p>
<p><b>Santa Fe 
</b></p>
<p>7. El Relator lamenta que, hasta la fecha, el Gobierno de Argentina no haya respondido 
a esta comunicaci&#243;n de fecha 11 de julio de 2012. La comunicaci&#243;n se refer&#237;a a las 
alegaciones de actos de tortura cometidos por agentes oficiales en contra de personas 
detenidas. Los actos alegados incluyen el uso de picana el&#233;ctrica sobre varias partes del 
cuerpo, y el uso de bolsas sobre la cabeza para asfixiar a la persona. Adem&#225;s, se alega que 
este caso ejemplifica una pr&#225;ctica reiterada por algunos funcionarios policiales en la 
localidad de Florencia en la Provincia de Santa Fe. En este contexto, el Relator Especial 
desea hacer referencia al Gobierno de Argentina al p&#225;rrafo l de la Resoluci&#243;n del Consejo 
de Derechos Humanos 16/23, la cual &#8220;Condena todas las formas de tortura y otros tratos o 
penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes, que est&#225;n y seguir&#225;n estando prohibidos en todo 
momento y en todo lugar y que, por lo tanto, pueden justificarse nunca, y exhorta a todos 
los gobiernos a que respeten plenamente la prohibici&#243;n de la tortura y otros tratos o penas 
crueles, inhumanos o degradantes.&#8223; Tambi&#233;n hace referencia al art&#237;culo 15 de la 
</p>
<p>Convenci&#243;n contra la Tortura, la cual se&#241;ala que &#8220;[t]odo Estado Parte se asegurar&#225; de que 
</p>
<p>ninguna declaraci&#243;n que se demuestre que ha sido hecha como resultado de tortura pueda 
ser invocada como prueba en ning&#250;n procedimiento, salvo en contra de una persona 
acusada de tortura como prueba de que se ha formulado la declaraci&#243;n.&#8221; Ante la ausencia 
</p>
<p>de evidencia contradictoria, el Relator Especial considera que los derechos de las presuntas 
v&#237;ctimas han sido vulnerados. El Relator Especial exhorta al Gobierno a asegurar la 
investigaci&#243;n, procesamiento y eventual condena de los responsables, e insta al Gobierno a 
que proporcione informaci&#243;n detallada acerca de las medidas que hayan sido tomadas.

</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged attack on 
three journalists --which included torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by 
guards of the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). One of the 
journalists, Mr. Idrak Abbasov, was the subject of a prior communication sent to the 
Republic of Azerbaijan on October 17, 2005 by the Special Rapporteur, which also had 
gone unanswered by the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that 
paragraph 1 of the Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In addition, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also reminds the Government that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility 
</p>
<p>and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
[&#8230;].&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur finds that the rights of Mr. Idrak Abbasov, Ms. Gunay Musayeva, and Mr. 
Adalat Abbasov have been violated under the UN Convention against Torture. The Special </p>

<p>9. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate

<p><b>  Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) </b>JUA 20/01/2012 Case No. BHR 1/2012 State reply: 21/03/2012<b> Alleged excessive use of 
force against protestors for human rights 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 21 
March 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged excessive use of force, 
including beatings, tear gas, and stun grenades, during and following arrest for peaceful 
human rights demonstrations. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that paragraph 7b of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;(t)o take persistent, determined and 
effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an 
independent, competent domestic authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground 
to believe that such an act has been committed [&#8230;].&#8221; The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
</p>
<p>Government for its explanation of the complaint system available to victims of human 
rights abuses, but nonetheless urges an investigation ex officio into the allegations, and 
reminds the Government of its obligation to provide full redress, including fair and 
adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible to all victims of torture or 
other ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) </b>JUA 09/02/2012 Case No. BHR 2/2012 State reply: 19/03/2012 <b>Alleged beating in 
detention and denial of access to specialist medical treatment 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its reply, of 19 March 
2012, in response to the urgent appeal of 9 February 2012 regarding the alleged beating in 
detention of Mr. Mahdi &#8222;Issa Abu Dheeb and his denial of access to specialist medical 
</p>
<p>treatment. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern about Mr. Mahdi Issa Abu 
Dheeb&#8223;s deteriorating health condition in prison. In its reply, the Government of Bahrain 
described the health service procedures provided for all detainees, including Mr. Abu 
Dheeb&#8223;s access to specialist medical treatment. The Government also declared the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>allegation of the beating to be &#8220;entirely false.&#8221; Although the Special Rapporteur appreciates 
the Government&#8223;s reply, he reminds the Government of Article 15 of the CAT, which 
</p>
<p>provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to 
</p>
<p>have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; With 
</p>
<p>respect to Mr. Abu Dheeb&#8223;s deteriorating health condition, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
</p>
<p>the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) provides that 
&#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized 
</p>
<p>institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their 
equipment, furnishing and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care and 
the treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers.&#8221;The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to ensure that all allegations of torture and 
other ill-treatment are investigated and punished, and reminds the Government of its 
obligation to provide full redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full 
rehabilitation as possible to all victims of torture or other ill-treatment. In addition, the State 
is obliged to exclude any confession or statement made under torture from evidence in 
criminal proceedings against the victim.  The SRT also encourages the Government to 
continue its engagement with the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) </b>JUA 12/03/2012 Case No. BHR 3/2012 State reply: 13/04/2012, 27/04/2012, 11/06/2012<b> 
Alleged declining health of detained human rights defender on hunger strike 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its several replies in 
response to the urgent appeal of 12 March 2012 regarding the deteriorating health condition 
of Mr. Abdulhadi Alkhawaja who began a hunger strike more than a month earlier in 
response to his life sentence. In its reply, the Government of Bahrain detailed the various 
health services provided for prisoners as well as the specific services provided for Mr. 
Alkhawaja during his hunger strike, which included 24-hour a day health care monitoring 
on an ongoing basis. Further, the Special Rapporteur notes the provision of two medical 
specialists, one an expert on hunger strikes and the other an expert of the protection of the 
rights of torture victims. Moreover, the Government claimed that Mr. Alkhawaja&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>condition is now stable and he no longer is in danger as a result of his hunger strike. Mr. 
Alkhawaja ended his hunger strike on 28 May 2012. However, the Special Rapporteur 
expresses great concern about the condition of detention of Mr. Alkhawaja and reminds 
Government of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) 
provides that &#8220;sick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to 
</p>
<p>specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an 
institution, their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the 
medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained 
officers.&#8221;Rule 25(1) provides that &#8220;the medical officer shall have the care of the physical 
</p>
<p>and mental health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain 
of illness, and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; He encourages the 
</p>
<p>Government to continue its engagement with the mandate.

<p>13. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply, dated 18 April 2012, to 
this communication in reference to the situation of Mr. Hassan Mushaima, Secretary-
General of the Haq Democracy Movement, who is detained in the Bahrain State Prison and 
has allegedly been denied access to medical treatment and an independent medical doctor in 
detention. According to the information received, Mr. Mushaima was diagnosed with 
advanced follicular lymphoma, a malignant cancer prior to his detention.  In its reply, the 
Government confirmed Mr. Mushaima&#8223;s diagnosis and stated that since the detention, he </p>

</p>
<p>underwent several rounds of chemotherapy at the Bahrain Royal Medical Services Hospital 
in accordance to a medical treatment plan. The Government further reported that it plans to 
contact and consult Medical Services about permitting Mr. Mushaima to be examined by 
two doctors of his choice, and to undergo a scan to obtain a conclusive current diagnosis.  
While acknowledging the Government&#8223;s reply, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind 
</p>
<p>the Government of its obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons, set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the CAT. The Special Rapporteur 
also reiterates the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) 
provides that &#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to 
</p>
<p>specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an 
institution, their equipment, furnishing and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the 
medical care and the treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained

persons in detention are provided with proper medical care and treatment, and urges the 
Government to grant, and to provide the results of Mr. Mushaima&#8223;s requested medical

<p>14. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for its reply, dated 2 
August 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged excessive use of force by 
law enforcement against peaceful assemblies in Manama, as well as during the detention of 
some of the demonstrators. However, the Government did not provide specific information 
regarding any investigations into the allegations made against the law enforcement officers 
involved. The Special Rapporteur recalls Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use 
of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;[l]aw enforcement officials, 
</p>
<p>in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non- violent means before 
resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221; Given the information received, the Special

individuals named in the communication have been violated, and calls on the Government 
to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of the alleged acts, including prosecution 
and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide appropriate and adequate redress.

enforcement did not respond to threats in association with the violence. The Special

article 12 paragraphs, 2 and 3, of the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized

</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Barbados has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to allegations that Mr. Raul Garcia, a 
Cuban native, who has been deprived of his liberty in excess of his prison sentence for over 
two years, and is being held in solitary confinement at the maximum security Dodd Prison. 
In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government of the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, which is set 
forth inter alia in the UDHR and ICCPR. The Special Rapporteur also recalls paragraph 6 
of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee, which states that prolonged 
solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by 
article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment] of the ICCPR.  The Special Rapporteur would also like to refer to article 7 of 
the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed 
to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, 
should be undertaken and encouraged.&#8221; (Adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 
</p>
<p>45/111 of 14 December 1990). In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Garcia have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to provide information regarding the legal grounds for 
Mr. Garcia&#8223;s detention in excess of his prison sentence, and to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation into his alleged mistreatment, leading to prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victim. The Special 
Rapporteur further calls upon the Government to abolish or restrict the use of solitary 
confinement as a punishment and adopt measures that promote rehabilitation of those held 
in detention.

<p>20. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of China for its response, dated 4 
February 2012, in response to the joint urgent appeal letter regarding the pre-trial detention 
and lengthy prison sentences of Mr. Chen Wei and Mr. Chen Xi. Mr. Chen Wei and Mr. 
Chen Xi were allegedly denied family visits while held in pre-trial detention. The Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges recent family visits of both aforementioned individuals, however, 
expresses grave concern regarding the denial of family visits during pre-trial detention. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates Principle 19 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of 
All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment adopted by the General 
Assembly on 9 December 1988 which states that, &#8220;A detained or imprisoned person shall 
</p>
<p>have the right to be visited by and to correspond with, in particular, members of his family 
and shall be given adequate opportunity to communicate with the outside word.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern regarding the physical and 
psychological security of both aforementioned individuals with respect to their lengthy 
sentences. The Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of the aforementioned 
individuals have been violated in that the denial of family visits of persons in custody 
constitutes, under these circumstances, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in violation 
of international standards. He urges the Government to ensure continued family visits of 
both Mr. Chen Wei and Mr. Chen Xi and calls on the Government to protect the right to 
physical and mental integrity of persons held in detention. The Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government of China to continue its engagement with the mandate.

<p>21. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of China for its response, dated 12 
April 2012, to the joint urgent appeal regarding the alleged excessive use of force against 
peaceful protestors in Luhuo, Seda and Rangtang Counties, Sichuan Province, resulting in 
the death of at least seven persons and severe injuries of over 60 persons. In its reply the 
Government claims some of the demonstrators in Luhuo &#8220;engaged in wanton beating and 
smashing,&#8221; causing damage to buildings. Further, the Government alleges that the 
</p>
<p>demonstrators did not respond to officers&#8223; attempts to curtail the protest and therefore when 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;warning shots proved ineffective, the people&#8223;s police were forced to open fire.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>government acknowledges the casualties and injured persons as a result of the police 
opening fire. In Seda, the Government claims that Tibetan monks attacked the police 
station, assaulting people&#8223;s police, soldiers, and firemen on duty, therefore, purportedly 
mandating the use of force to &#8220;uphold public order.&#8221; Despite the Government&#8223;s account of 
</p>
<p>the protests as not peaceful, the Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government 
that, under international law, excessive use of force and firearms is not permitted when 
policing peaceful assemblies. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur reiterates Principle 13 of 
the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials 
(adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the 
Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990), which states that 
&#8220;[i]n the dispersal of assemblies that are unlawful but non-violent, law enforcement 
officials shall avoid the use of force or, where that is not practicable, shall restrict such 
force to the minimum extent necessary&#8221;, and Principle 14 states that &#8220;[i]n the dispersal of 
</p>
<p>violent assemblies, law enforcement officials may use firearms only when less dangerous </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>

<p>means are not practicable and only to the minimum extent necessary.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteur notes the insufficiency of the Government&#8223;s response to the allegations that 
</p>
<p>wounded persons, some of whom were wounded critically, were not taken to the hospital. 
In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Principle 5, which 
provides that &#8220;[w]henever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials shall, (a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of 
the offence and the legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and 
respect and preserve human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to 
any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment and (d) Ensure that relatives 
or close friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible 
moment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of those injured or killed during 
</p>
<p>the course of participating in peaceful protests have been violated under international law. 
The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to investigate, prosecute and punish those 
responsible and to provide full redress to the victims and their family members. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government of China to continue its engagement with the 
mandate.

March 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged imminent repatriation of 31 
Korean citizens to the Democratic People&#8223;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), where they face a 
risk of detention, torture, and execution. In its reply, the Government described its 
discovery of and investigations into the detained persons&#8223; illegal attempts to reach the

nationals illegally immigrating into China are not &#8220;refugees&#8221; &#8230; the principle of non-
refoulement is not applicable here.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government 
</p>
<p>failed to address the concern that the 31 individuals facing imminent repatriation are at a 
significant risk of detention, torture, and execution in the DPRK. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government if its obligation to protect the right to physical and 
mental integrity of all persons, regardless of immigration status, under the UDHR and the 
Convention against Torture. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw the Government&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>attention to article 3 of the Convention against Torture, which provides that no State party 
shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;) or extradite a person to another State where there are 
substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to 
torture. The Special Rapporteur further notes that paragraph 9 of General Commend No. 20 
of the Human Rights Committee states that State parties must not expose individuals to the 
danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to 
another country by way of extradition, expulsion or refoulement. The Special Rapporteur 
also draws the attention of the Government to paragraph 16 of the Resolution 
A/RES/65/206 of the UN General Assembly which urges States &#8220;not to expel, return 
</p>
<p>(&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in another way transfer a person to another States where there are 
</p>
<p>substantial grounds for believing that the person would be danger of being subjected to 
torture, and recognizes that diplomatic assurances, where used, do not release States from 
their obligation under international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in 
particular the principle of non-refoulement.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the Korean 
nationals are respected and, if investigations support or suggest the allegations to be correct, 
to adopt effective measures to prevent repatriation. </p>

a human rights defender and his family, and the alleged arbitrary detention or enforced 
disappearance of several of his relatives and supporters. According to the information we 
received, Mr. Chen Guangcheng, a human rights attorney, was subjected to extralegal 
house arrest, and that various members of his family were threatened, arrested and or 
victims of enforced disappearances. The communication also referred to Mr. Jiang

deliberate destruction of property and organizing a mob to disrupt traffic, from which he 
was released in September 2010. The Government further reported that no law enforcement 
actions were taken against Mr. Chen since that time, and that he has since relocated to the 
United States, where he is a student at New York University. The Governemnt also 
reported that Mr. Chen&#8223;s son was arrested on 16 April 2012 on charges of wielding a knife 
</p>
<p>against local officials and works, and that an investigation into his case is pending. 
Additionally, the Government explained that Mr. Chen&#8223;s cousins and Mr. Tianyong have

<p>24. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of China for its reply dated 30 
October 2012, to this communication referring to the alleged torture and assassination of 
Mr. Li Wangyang, a human and labor rights activist who was imprisoned for a total of 23 
years. He allegedly endured the forcible pulling of his teeth, living in a cell measuring 2.5m 
in height and width for several months. He was reportedly subjected as well to severe 
beatings that left him completely blind and almost deaf. Soon after his release, Mr. 
Wangyang was found hanging from his hospital room&#8223;s window, which was allegedly 
under 24-hour police surveillance. In its reply the Government informed that immediately 
after the event, Shaoyang Cityand Daxiang District&#8223;s public security authorities as well as 
</p>
<p>other relevant parties have, according to the law, carried out on site and post event 
investigations. The authorities have also requested third party post mortem examination by

Based on reviews and verification of the evidence and investigation procedures, a second </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>joint investigation team has concluded that in line with the conclusion of the Zhongshan 
University Forensic Identification Center, Li Wangyang committed suicide by hanging 
himself. Furthermore the Government explains that Li Wangyanghas not received inhuman 
treatment during his incarceration but suffered from multiple serious illnesses prior to his 
arrest. According to the Government, the hospital diagnosed hyperthyroidism, thyroid heart 
disease, and secondary blindness in both eyes and deafness. After various treatments, his 
situation has shown slight improvement. Finally, the Government informed that Li 
Wangyang&#8223;s relatives enjoy freedom of movement and have not been arrested or 
</p>
<p>incarcerated. After the Li Wangyang incident, Li&#8223;s relatives issued a written statement to 
the public stating that they do not wish to interact with the outside world and that they do 
not wish to be disturbed and give any interviews. The Special Rapporteur reiterates 
paragraph l of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Based on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that 
the cause of death of Mr. Wangyang has been investigated by the Government. However, 
no substantive explanation with regard to the allegations of torture and ill-treatment during 
the 23 years of incarceration has been provided by the Government. The Special

the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) &#8220;[n]o child shall be deprived of his or her 
liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in 
conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the 
shortest appropriate period of time&#8221;. In addition, paragraph l of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Based on the information 
received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Ms. X&#8223;s rights under the UN Convention 
against Torture and under the Convention on the Rights of the Child were violated, and 
calls on the Government to release Ms. X immediately, undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation of the alleged torture leading to prosecution and punishment of perpetrators, 
and to provide full redress to Ms. X. </p>

<p>26. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of China for its reply, dated 28 
September 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture and arbitrary 
detention of Mr. Kim Young-Hwan, a South Korean human rights defender, and three other 
South Korean nationals who were in China assisting North Korean refugees.  After four 
months of detention on espionage charges they were expelled and allowed to return to 
South Korea.  In its response, the Government of China disputes the factual allegations in 
their entirety and purports to show that several medical examinations and consular visits 
granted to South Korean consular officials disprove such allegations.  The Special 
Rapporteur notes that the medical examinations performed were conducted by officials and 
not by independent practitioners.  In addition, depending on the dates of those examinations 
and of the consular visits, they would be far from conclusive in disproving acts of torture.  
The Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 7(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
which urges States &#8220;[t]o take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all 
</p>
<p>allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent, competent domestic 
authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe that such an act has 
been committed.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Kim Young-
Hwan may have been violated, and calls on the Government to conduct an impartial 
investigation and to submit the results of such investigation.

this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged imminent deportation of 
Mr. Morteza Kazemian and his family to Iran, the country where Mr. Kazemian and his

expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea has not responded to this communication dated 3 October 2012, thereby 
failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The 
communication referred to the alleged use of labour camps for thousands of prisoners 
where a pattern of human rights violations is committed. The Special Rapporteur expresses 
grave concern regarding all of the persons allegedly detained arbitrarily and subsequently 
subjected to torture in order to obtain false confessions. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur 
expresses further concern regarding the fact that detainees are not given a trial and are held 
incommunicado. Actual conditions at the labour camps, which include extrajudicial 
executions, torture, forced labour, lack of adequate food, and severe health conditions, also 
cause great concern. In view of these allegations, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that 
paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011, which 
reminds States that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; In light of the fact 
</p>
<p>that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that 
these practices violate the rights of the persons held in labour camps under international 
standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea to undertake a prompt, impartial, and effective investigation of the 
alleged acts of torture, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to 
provide redress to the victims. Further, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to end 
the practice of incommunicado detention and to end the practice of sending political 
prisoners not yet convicted of a crime to labour camps, especially given the dire conditions 
alleged. </p>

<p>34. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Egypt for its response, dated 17 
July 2012, to the joint letter of allegation regarding the alleged arbitrary arrest of Mr. 
Ahmed Ramzy Ali Amar who was reportedly beaten by prison guards, placed in solitary 
confinement, and tortured causing his death in custody. In its reply, the Government denies 
that Mr. Amar was tortured and further claims that his death was the result of suicide. 
However, the Special Rapporteur finds that the Government does not provide sufficient 
evidence of the contrary and that in addition the Government&#8223;s response failed to address 
</p>
<p>the allegations of solitary confinement. In this context, The Special Rapporteur reiterates 
that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of

intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Further, with respect to the allegation that Mr. Amar was held in solitary 
confinement after being beaten, the Special Rapporteur recalls that paragraph 6 of General 
Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee states that prolonged solitary 
confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 
7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Accordingly, in the absence </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>21

leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of Mr. Ahmed Ramzy Ali Ama,

</b></p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication dated 11 September 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the 
mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
extensive mistreatment and torture of Mr. Mohamed Gayez Sabbah, Mr. Ossama Mohed 
Abdel-Ghani Al-Nakhlawi, and Mr. Younis Mohamed Abu-Gareer, who were previously 
held in incommunicado detention and face charges on the basis of evidence obtained under 
torture. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern regarding the likely admission of 
statements that were made as a result of torture in the aforementioned persons&#8223; criminal 
</p>
<p>proceedings. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates Article 2(2) of the 
Convention Against Torture, which provides that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, 
whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public 
emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government of Article 12 of the CAT, which requires that &#8220;[e]ach 
State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in 
any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case 
promptly and impartially examined by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to 
ensure that the complainant and witnesses are protected against all ill-treatment or 
intimidation as a consequence of his complaint or any evidence given.&#8221; In light of the fact 
</p>
<p>that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that 
the rights of the aforementioned persons under the UN Convention against Torture have 
been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Egypt to undertake a 
prompt, impartial, and effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture, leading to 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victims. 
Further, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure that no evidence obtained

</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Egypt for its response, dated 1 
November 2012, to the joint urgent appeal regarding the alleged arbitrary detention of Mr. 
Albert Saber Ayyad and the ill-treatment and abuse he faced, partly as a result of 
provocations of an arresting officer. In its reply, the Government states that a Prosecutor 
conducted an investigation regarding allegations that Mr. Saber was assaulted while in 
detention, and concluded that the allegations are untrue. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government of the General Assembly&#8223;s resolution 64/164, urging 
States to step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion or belief, and to this end &#8220;(b) To ensure that no one within their jurisdiction is 
</p>
<p>deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person because of religion or belief and 
that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, or arbitrary arrest or detention on that account and to bring to justice all 
perpetrators of violations of these rights.&#8221; The government&#8223;s response does not explain the

</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>investigation into the assault suffered by Mr. Saber. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur 
finds that the violence by a law enforcement officer against a detainee is highly credible. 
The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure its police officers and other 
security officials do not commit violence based on an individual&#8223;s personal religious 
beliefs, which is conduct that violates international standards prohibiting torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. He encourages the Government to

November 2012, to this communication regarding the alleged severe torture of Mr. Mostafa 
Kamal Abul Magd for four days while detained and forced false confessions as a result of 
torture. In its reply, the Government states that it undertook an investigation regarding 
allegations that Mr. Abul Magd was subjected to psychological and physical torture, 
concluding that no information has been obtained relating the veracity of the allegations. 
The Special Rapporteur notes the insufficiency of the Government&#8223;s reply since it does not 
explain how the independence and impartiality of the inquiry was ensured.  He urges the 
Government to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
&#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any

</p>
<p>concludes that the rights of Mr. Abul Magd under the UN Convention against Torture have 
been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to investigate, prosecute 
and punish those responsible and to provide full redress to the Mr. Abul Magd. The Special

</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Egypt has not responded to 
this communication dated 9 November 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged imminent

Mr. Yasser Jeremy Attiya Al-Torbini, Mr. Amr Mohamed Mahmoud El-Malah, Mr. 
Hossam Abdo Abdelrady Hassan, and Mr. Ahmed Selmy Hammad Alyan. Further, the 
communication referred to the alleged torture while in detention, in some instances to 
forcibly obtain confessions, and the use of incommunicado detention. Given the 
irreversibility of the punishment of the death penalty, the Special Rapporteur expresses 
grave concern regarding the aforementioned individuals, especially in light of allegations 
that torture was used to obtain false confessions and statements. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates Article 15 of the CAT, which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall 
</p>
<p>ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall 
not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture 
as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been

<p>provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of the

at the instigation of prison authorities. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that article 12 of 
the Convention against Torture requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt 
and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has 
been committed, and article 7 of the same Convention requires State parties to prosecute 
suspected perpetrators of torture, their accomplices and instigators. Without any evidence to 
the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Andualem Aragie 
under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government 
to ensure a prompt, independent and impartial investigation, leading to prosecution and 
punishment of all those responsible, and to provide redress to the victims, including fair and 
adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

<p>42. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Georgia for its reply, dated 
September 26, 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture of Mr. Irakli 
Beraia, a human rights defender who was arrested during a peaceful protest. In its reply, 
The Government provided information denying having had knowledge of Mr. Beraia&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>allegations of torture on June 29, 2012, but did not explain how this could have occurred 
given that the allegations were made at a public press conference. The Special Rapporteur

through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place

</p>
<p>Rights and other organs of implementation of human rights, prosecutors are under an 
obligation to investigate torture ex officio whenever there are indicia that it might have 
happened, even if no formal complaint is filed.  Based on the information received, the 
Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Irakli Beraia under the UN Convention 
against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government to provide the results of 
any investigation, medical examinations and judicial or other inquiries carried out in 
relation to this case.  He urges the Government to investigate, prosecute and punish all

to the victims, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as

</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Indonesia has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged indiscriminate killings of 
farmers and villagers in relation to land disputes, including an alleged massacre caught on 
video that showed what appeared to be mutilated bodies, in addition to showing two men 
being beheaded. The Special Rapporteur recalls article 6 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the Government of Indonesia acceded to on 23 
February 2006, and that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. In addition, 
paragraph 18 of the General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture, where the 
Committee has made clear that &#8220;where State authorities or others acting in official capacity 
or under color of law, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-
treatment are being committed by non-State officials or private actors and they fail to 
exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials 
or private actors consistently with the Convention, the State bears responsibility and its 
officials should be considered as authors, complicit or otherwise responsible under the 
Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible acts.&#8221; In light of the fact 
that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that 
the rights of the victims involved under international standards prohibiting torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to investigate, prosecute, and punish all perpetrators, 
in addition to providing redress to all victims, including measures of rehabilitation and non-
repetition.

of the Brimbo, the state&#8223;s riot police forces. The Government reported that investigations

demonstrations violates a State&#8223;s obligations under international law on the use of firearms 
</p>
<p>by law enforcement personnel and, under appropriate circumstances, may constitute cruel,

September 25, 2012, to this communication in reference to the allegedly increasing climate 
of violence in Papua and West Papua by police, military forces, and non-state forces, as 
well as the allegedly frequent use of excessive force against demonstrators. The Special 
Rapporteur commends the Government for the investigations and prosecutions of many of 
the named aggressors. Unfortunately, the Government did not mention an investigation in 
relation to the situation at the Abepura Correctional Facility. The Special Rapporteur insists 
that excessive use of force in repressing riots and demonstrations violates a State&#8223;s

of Health regulation is to protect women and girls from unsafe and harmful procedures of 
female circumcision, with a en goal to mitigate the harmful effects of such practices 
throughout the country. The regulation shall not be construed as encouraging or promoting 
the practice of female circumcision. Furthermore the Government informs that in line with 
its commitment toward international human rights norms and a standard, including those 
concerning female genital mutilation (FGM), the Government is establishing a cross-

attention of the Government to article 5(a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women which calls for States to take &quot;all appropriate 
measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a 
view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which 
are based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped 
roles for men and women.&quot; The Special Rapporteur believes that female circumcision 
amounts to torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and that regulating it &#8211; even 
for purposes of ensuring safe and professional procedures -- serves only to provide cover 
for a practice that violates the State&#8223;s obligations under international law. He insists that the

<p>49. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication dated 16 February 2012, thereby failing to 
cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication 
referred to the imminent execution of Messrs. Saeed Malekpour, Ahmadreza Hashempour, 
Vahid Ashghari and Mehdi Alizadeh Fakhrabad. Mr. Malekpour was the subject of a 
previous communication sent on 31 December 2010, yet no reply has been received. The

</p>
<p>confinement for over a year, the Special Rapporteur recalls that, in accordance with 
paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee, the prolonged 
solitary confinement of Mr. Malekpour amounted to acts prohibited by article 7 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In light of the fact that no evidence 
has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the rights of 
the individuals under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to undertake a prompt, 
impartial, and effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture, leading to prosecution 
and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victims.

cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication 
referred to the alleged torture and subsequent death in detention of Mr. Nasser Derafshan

that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also reiterates the Government&#8223;s obligations under 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ratified on 24 June 1975), which 
provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this right 
shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life 
(article 6). In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the 
Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of both Mr. Nasser Derafshan Alboshokeh and 
Mr. Mohammad al-Kaabi under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. 
The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
undertake a prompt, impartial, and effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to the

<p>51. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran

cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication 
referred to the imminent execution of Messrs. Zaniar (or Zanyar) Moradi and Loghman (or

15 November 2011 (see A/HRC/19/44, case no IRN 18/2011). However, no response has 
been received. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the allegations that 
the aforementioned individuals were subjected to torture and coercion in order to extract 
confessions. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human

</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur asserts that the use of confessions extracted under torture in judicial 
proceedings is strictly prohibited under international law. Article 15 of the Convention 
against Torture which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement 
</p>
<p>which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as 
evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made.&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the 
</p>
<p>contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of the aforementioned individuals 
under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls 
on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to undertake a prompt, impartial, and 
effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture, leading to prosecution and punishment 
of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victims. Furthermore, given the 
irremediable nature of capital punishment, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran not to proceed with the executions and to set aside any 
criminal conviction based on evidence obtained under torture.

</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication, thereby withholding cooperation with the 
mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged torture and imminent execution of Mr. Habibollah Golparpour. Mr. Golparpour was 
allegedly arrested for cooperating with the Party for Free Life of Kurdistan, and was 
charged with Enmity against God after a five minute trial in which he was sentenced to 
death. In addition, Mr. Golparpor was allegedly tortured while he was imprisoned at the 
Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps detention facility in Mahabad and at a Ministry of 
Intelligence detention facility in Sanandaj, Kordestan province. The Special Rapporteur 
recalls paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all 
</p>
<p>forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including 
through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the 
absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading

paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which urges States &#8220;[t]o take

<p>persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially examined 
by the competent national authority, to hold those who encourage, order, tolerate or 
perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely 
punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act 
is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of the Principles on the 
Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to

<p>53. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the allegation that Mr. Aref 
Hamidian was coerced into confessing to the offense of drug trafficking after being 
tortured. In this context, the Special Rapporteur stress that paragraph 7(c) of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;[t]o ensure that no statement established to have 
</p>
<p>been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, and calls upon States to 
consider extending that prohibition to statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, recognizing that adequate corroboration of statements, 
including confessions, used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for 
the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur affirms that Mr. Aref Hamidian was in fact brutally tortured to make him 
confess to crimes and that his rights under international standards prohibiting torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to set aside any criminal conviction based on evidence 
obtained under torture.

<p>54. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Iran has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the allegation that Mr. Hamid 
Ghassemi-Shall was convicted and sentenced to death based on a confession made under 
duress. In addition, he was placed in solitary confinement for a period of 18 months without 
any legal representation. In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses the obligation of all 
States to ensure that the individuals&#8223; right to a fair trial and the guarantees thereof are 
</p>
<p>respected in accordance with article 14 of the ICCPR and Safeguard 4 of the Safeguards 
guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. The latter provision 
provides that &#8220;[c]apital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person 
</p>
<p>charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative 
explanation of the facts.&#8221; In addition, under article 14(g) of the ICCPR, no one shall be 
</p>
<p>compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt. The Special Rapporteur would also 
like to stress that paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee 
states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may 
amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that Mr. Ghassemi-Shall&#8223;s rights under international standards prohibiting 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have been violated, 
and calls on the Government to ensure that Mr. Ghassemi-Shall or his next of kin obtain 
redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible.

<p>55. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its response to the communication dated 14 May 2012, regarding the alleged arrests and </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>continued detention of members of the Bah&#225;&#8223;i faith community. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>thanks the Government for addressing the cases involving the people in Sanandaj, but 
insists that the Government further investigate in order to determine the circumstances 
surrounding those arrested in relation to the issuance of an order to confiscate the Bah&#225;&#8223;i 
</p>
<p>cemetery in Sanandaj. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its explanation of 
the cases from Shiraz that occurred on 3, 4, 5, 6, and 23 February 2012, and the case from 
Yazd that occurred on 26 February 2012. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government did not address allegations of violence perpetuated against those arrested in 
Shiraz. In addition, the Government did not clarify how Ms. Mehregani&#8223;s beliefs are not the 
</p>
<p>reason for her arrest since she is charged with being a member of a Bah&#225;&#8223;i organization. In 
</p>
<p>addition, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government failed to address additional 
cases which took place in Tehran, Rasht, Semnan, Shiraz and Kerman, which included 
allegations of lack of medical care for a severely ill detainee and solitary confinement for 
another. Given the common origin of all of the persons involved in the communications, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to remind the Government of Article 27 of the ICCPR which 
establishes that &#8220;In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, 
</p>
<p>persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the 
other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own 
religion, or to use their own language.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur would also like to draw the 
</p>
<p>Government&#8223;s attention to rule 25(1) provides that, &#8220;The medical officer shall have the care 
of the physical and mental health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all 
who complain of illness, and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; He 
would also like to remind the Government that &#8220;prolonged solitary confinement of the 
</p>
<p>detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] of 
the ICCPR (adopted at the 44th session of the Human Rights Committee, 1992). The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to end all arbitrary arrests of Bah&#225;&#8223;i members, 
</p>
<p>and insists that the Government investigate, prosecute and punish all cases of ill-treatment, 
in addition to providing the result of any investigation, medical examination, and judicial or 
other inquiries which may have been carried out in relation to these cases.

<p>56. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iran for its reply dated 7 
September 2012, to this communication referring to the alleged solitary confinement, 
torture and death sentence of Mr. Behrouz Alkhani, a Kurdish citizen. The Special 
Rapporteur expressed serious concern about allegations that Mr. Behrouz Alkhani was 
found guilty in the absence of a adequate judicial proceedings, was held in solitary 
confinement for 19 months, and was submitted to severe physical and psychological 
torture. In its reply, the Government reported that Mr. Alkhani&#8223;s capital punishment 
</p>
<p>sentence was upheld by branch number four of the high court. While the Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges the Government&#8223;s response, he regrets the Government&#8223;s failure 
to address allegations that Mr. Alkhani was subjected to physical and psychological torture 
and ill-treatment and held in prolonged solitary confinement. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to reiterate the Government&#8223;s obligation to protect the right to 
</p>
<p>physical and mental integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the UDHR and 
ICCPR. The Special Rapporteur additionally recalls paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 &#8221;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>Government to the United Nations Safeguards 4 and 5 Guaranteeing Protection of the

trial, at least equal to those contained in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, including the right of anyone suspected of or charged with a crime for 
which capital punishment may be imposed to adequate legal assistance at all stages of the 
proceedings.&#8221; In regards to the alleged solitary confinement and torture Mr. Alkhani 
</p>
<p>experienced, the Special Rapporteur would like to place emphasis on paragraph 6 of 
General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee, which states &#8220;that prolonged 
solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by 
article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&#8221; In the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Behrouz 
Alkhani under international law prohibiting torture have been violated, and calls on the 
Government of Iran to vacate his death sentence and to undertake prompt, impartial and 
effective investigations of these acts, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators of torture. In addition, the Government must ensure that he obtains redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full a rehabilitation as possible.

<p><b> (i) </b>UA Iran 19/06/2012 Case No. IRN 13/2012 State reply: None to date<b> Alleged imminent 
execution of five members of a family 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication dated 19 June 2012, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to 
the imminent execution of five persons of Ahwazi Arab origin and members of the same 
family: Mr. Abd Al-Rahman Heidari, Mr. Taha Heidari, Mr. Jamshid Heidari, Mr. Mansour 
Heidari, and Mr. Amir Muawi. The Special Rapporteur had expressed grave concern that 
the five individuals were subjected to torture and other forms of inhuman treatment and 
coerced to confess to the charges brought against them. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government of the Islamic Republic of Article 7 of the ICCPR, 
which requires States to protect the dignity and physical and mental integrity of every 
individual, and to afford everyone protection against acts of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, whether inflicted by people acting in their 
official capacity, outside their official capacity, or in a private capacity. The Special 
Rapporteur further expressed serious concern over allegations that the persons had been 
transferred to an undisclosed location and that their executions could be carried out at any 
moment. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
</p>
<p>or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In response to the 
transfer to the detainees to an undisclosed location, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
paragraph 8b of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which reminds States that 
&#8220;detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, 
and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity 
of the person and to ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; 
In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur is of the view that the rights of the given persons have been violated. 
Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to undertake a prompt, impartial, and effective investigation of the alleged acts of 
torture, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>the victims. Given the irremediable nature of capital punishment, the Special Rapporteur 
further calls on the Government to take all necessary measures to prevent the execution of 
the five individuals and to set aside any criminal conviction based on evidence obtained 
under torture.

Alleged acts of torture and imminent execution 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its reply, dated 10 October 2012, regarding the alleged imminent execution of Mr. Saeed 
Sedeghi and Ms. Safieh Ghafouri. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern over 
reports that Mr. Sedeghi has been subjected to acts of torture and ill-treatment which 
resulted in bodily injury during custody. Mr. Sedeghi was the subject of a separate urgent 
action (UA Iran 07/08/12 Case No. IRN 21/2012) which has gone unanswered. The Special 
Rapporteur further expresses concern about the potential imminent execution of Ms. 
Ghafouri, whose case has been accepted on appeal by the Supreme Court. In its reply, the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is silent about the case of Mr. Sedeghi and only 
refers to the case of Ms. Ghafouri.  The government declared that all legal protocols were 
observed in the case, and that a high court dismissed Ms. Ghafouri&#8223;s request for a retrial on 
</p>
<p>2 July 2012. The Government also declared that Ms. Ghafouri&#8223;s sentence was carried out 
</p>
<p>on 12 July 2012 on the grounds of Shiraz&#8223; Adel-Abad prison. With regard to the alleged 
acts of torture and ill-treatment and the subsequent sentence to death the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all 
</p>
<p>forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including 
through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the 
absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Ms, Safieh 
</p>
<p>Ghafouri under international law were severely violated by her torture and by her execution 
following a trial that used evidence obtained under torture.  The Special Rapporteur calls on 
the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to undertake a prompt, impartial, and 
effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture leading to prosecution and punishment 
of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victim&#8223;s family.

<p>59. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication dated 6 July 2012, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to 
the alleged imminent execution of Mr. Hamid Ghassemi-Shall, who was the subject of a 
joint urgent appeal dated 4 May 2012.  In its response to the joint urgent appeal, the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran declared that Mr. Shall was charged with 
collaborating with a terrorist group. The communication referred to allegations that Mr. 
Shall&#8223;s sentence was issued on the basis of evidence obtained under duress, and in the 
absence of legal counsel during pre-trial detention.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that Article 7 of the ICCPR requires States to protect the dignity and physical and 
mental integrity of every individual, and to afford everyone protection against acts of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, whether inflicted 
by people acting in their official capacity, outside their official capacity, or in a private 
capacity. Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Shall have been violated. Given the 
irremediable nature of capital punishment, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government 
not to proceed with the execution and to set aside any criminal conviction based on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>evidence obtained under torture. Further, he calls on the Government of the Islamic

leading to the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to 
Mr. Shall&#8223;s next of kin.

has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the imminent

Sayed Jaber Alboshoka, Sayed Mokhtar Alboshoka, Hashem Sha&#8223;bani Amouri, and Hadi 
</p>

Rapporteur reminds the Government of the Islamic Republic of Article 7 of the ICCPR, 
which requires States to protect the dignity and physical and mental integrity of every

and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008, which urges States &#8220;to ensure that no 
statement established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any

The Special Rapporteur also calls on the Government to offer appropriate remedies to the

<p>61. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication dated 3 August 2012, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to 
the alleged detention and denial of access to medical treatment to Pastor Behnam Irani in 
the Ghezal Hesar Prison. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern about Pastor 
Irani&#8223;s deteriorating condition in prison. Further, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern 
</p>
<p>over allegations of maltreatment and assaults suffered by Pastor Irani in prison. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of the Islamic Republic of Article 
7 of the ICCPR, which requires States to protect the dignity and physical and mental 
integrity of every individual, and to afford everyone protection against acts of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, whether inflicted by people 
acting in their official capacity, outside their official capacity, or in a private capacity. The 
Special Rapporteur further reiterates the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>concludes that the rights of Pastor Irani under international law have been violated.  The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that 
all sick persons in detention are provided with proper medical care and treatment. Further, 
he calls on the Government to undertake a prompt, independent and effective investigation 
of the facts, leading to the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide

has not responded to this communication dated 7 August 2012, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to 
the imminent execution of Mr. Saeed Sedeghi, who was sentenced to death on drug-related

The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concerns about the physical and mental integrity of 
Mr. Sedeghi in light of allegations of acts of torture and ill-treatment while in detention. In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran of Article 7 of the ICCPR, which requires States to protect the dignity and physical and

concern regarding allegations that Mr. Savadjani was subjected to torture and ill-treatment 
and held in solitary confinement for over 40 months while in detention. The Special

that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to 
acts prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment] of the ICCPR.  In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
additionally recalls article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which 
provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or 
</p>
<p>to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken and encouraged.&#8221; In light of the fact that

by Mr. Ebrahimi on 6 August 2012. The Special Rapporteur stresses the Government&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. In response to 
Mr. Ebrahimi&#8223;s unknown whereabouts, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 8b of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which reminds States that &#8220;detention in secret 
places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all 
States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the 
person and to ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Article 7 of the ICCPR, which requires States to protect the dignity and physical and mental 
integrity of every individual, and to afford everyone protection against acts of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, whether inflicted by people 
acting in their official capacity, outside their official capacity, or in a private capacity. 
Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
concludes that the rights of Mr. Ebrahimi, whose whereabouts remain unknown, have been 
violated. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to end the practice of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>incommunicado and unacknowledged detention. He also calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of possible acts of torture, leading to the 
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to ensure Mr. Ebrahimi obtains redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible. Further, if 
Mr. Ebrahimi is to be tried, the Government must ensure that any evidence against him 
obtained under torture is declared inadmissible.

</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication dated 8 October 2012, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to 
the imprisonment of Mr. Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, a lawyer and co-founder of the Centre 
for Human Rights Defenders (CHRD). The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern 
about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Dadkhah in view of allegations that he has 
been subjected to flogging. In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses the 
Government&#8223;s obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons 
as stated in article 7 of the ICCPR. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of 
paragraph 7a of Resolution 8/8 of the Human Rights Council, which states that corporal 
punishment, can amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or even torture. Also, in 
report A/HRC/10/44 the office of the Special Rapporteur held that corporal punishment can 
no longer be justified under present international law, not even under the most exceptional 
situations. Finally, Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In light of the fact that no 
evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the 
rights of Mr. Dadkhah have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran to undertake a prompt, impartial, and effective investigation 
of the alleged acts of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to Mr. 
Dadkhah.

</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has not responded to this communication dated 11 October 2012, thereby failing to 
cooperate with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication 
referred to the imminent execution of Mr. Saeed Sedeghi and ten other individuals, 
including Mr. Hamid Rahi&#8223;i, Mr. Mohammad Ali Rabi&#8223;i, Mr. Ali Darvish, and Mr. Abbas 
Namaki, who are reportedly at risk of imminent execution. Mr. Sedeghi was the subject of a 
previous communication dated 26 June 2012 and 7 August 2012, all of them also 
unanswered. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concerns about the physical and 
mental integrity of Mr. Sedeghi in light of allegations of acts of torture and ill-treatment 
while in detention, and of reports that Mr. Sedeghi was transferred to Evin Prison and 
placed in solitary confinement. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that 
paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture 
</p>
<p>and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever

</b></p>
<p><b>38</b>  
</p>
<p>non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; With respect to the allegation that Mr. Sedeghi was held in solitary 
confinement, the Special Rapporteur recalls that paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 
of the Human Rights Committee states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained 
or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In light of the fact that no evidence has been 
provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the rights of Mr. 
Sedeghi have been violated. The Special Rapporteur also concludes, in the absence of other 
information, that the government of Iran has violated the rights under international law of 
Mr. Hamid Rahi&#8223;I, Mr. Mohammad Ali Rabi&#8223;I, Mr. Ali Darvish, Mr. Abbas Namaki and 
</p>
<p>the six other individuals named in the urgent appeal. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to undertake a prompt, impartial, and effective 
investigation of the alleged acts of torture, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victim. Given the irremediable nature of capital 
punishment, the Special Rapporteur further calls on the Government to take all necessary 
measures to prevent the execution of Mr. Sedeghi and the others and to set aside any 
criminal conviction based on evidence obtained under torture. In case that Mr. Sedeghi or 
one of the others have already been executed, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
of Iran to provide full redress to their next of kin.

<p>67. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its reply, dated 4 December 2012, regarding the alleged torture, ill-treatment and death in 
custody of Mr. Sattar Beheshti, an Iranian blogger, who was allegedly arrested on 
cybercrime related charges. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern over the 
death of Mr. Beheshti in custody, in light of allegations of multiple acts of torture and ill-
treatment and the related complaint of Mr. Beheshti prior to his death. In its reply, the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran declared that it has established an interagency 
committee to investigate the circumstances surrounding Mr. Beheshti&#8223;s death and his 
alleged torture and ill-treatment in custody. The Government also declared that the official 
in charge of the police cyber security department has been dismissed for omissions in the 
supervision of personnel and improper investigation into Mr. Beheshti&#8223;s file. Although the 
Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8223;s reply, he reiterates paragraph 1 of Human 
</p>

</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8223;s willingness to investigate the death in 
</p>
<p>custody of Mr. Beheshti and the allegations of torture and ill-treatment. He calls on the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide any results of these investigations 
and the punishment of the perpetrators. He also calls on the Government to provide redress

<p>68. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iraq for its response, dated 2 
November 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged imminent risk of 
execution faced by Mr. Saleh Musa Ahmed Mohammed Al Baydani, a Yemeni citizen, and </p>

<p>then executions of 21 individuals, including three women, for terrorism related charges on 
27 August 2012. According to the information we received, Mr. Al Baydani was a minor at 
the time of his arrest and detained incommunicado for a period of ten months. In its reply, 
the Government sent the Special Rapporteur a copy of the verdict that was issued in Mr. Al 
Baydani&#8223;s case on 27 December 2011. The court documents show that Mr. Al Baydani was 
22 years old at the time of his arrest; that he was charged with being a member of Al 
Qaeda, to which he confessed; and that he was captured in flagrante delicto while 
attempting to bury weapons and ammunition.  They also show that, as of April 2012, he had 
not been executed, pending a request from the defense to stay the execution and order a 
retrial.  While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8223;s response with regards 
</p>
<p>to Mr. Al Baydani&#8223;s case, he regrets that the Government did not clarify the circumstances 
surrounding the 21 executions of 17 August 2012.  In this context, The Special Rapporteur 
reminds the Government of its obligation to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the ICCPR and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT). The Special Rapporteur also draws attention to paragraph 7c of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 8/8 of 18 June 2008, which reminds all States that &#8220;Prolonged 
incommunicado detention may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such 
treatment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur reiterates article 15 of the CAT and paragraph 6c of 
Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 of 2008, which provide that a State must ensure that 
no statement &#8220;established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in 
</p>
<p>any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement 
was made.&#8221;  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur finds that 
</p>
<p>the executions of 27 August 2012 violated Iraq&#8223;s obligations under international law.  In 
connection with the case of Mr. Al Baydani, the Special Rapporteur appreciates that his 
case is under review; he also finds that his execution would violate international law 
because his crime, if proven, did not involve loss of life with intent to deprive of life, which 
are the only crimes for which capital punishment would not violate an international 
standard.  The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to set aside any criminal 
conviction based on evidence obtained under torture or for a crime that is not of the 
maximum gravity, and to promptly and impartially investigate all allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment.

by Messrs. Abdullah Azzam Saleh Musfer al-Qahtani, Manaf Abdulrahim Abdulhamid Issa 
al-Rawi, Mohammad Nouri Matar Yassin, Ibrahim Abdulqader Ali Antik, Safa Ahmad 
Abdul&#8223;aziz Abdullah, and Mohammad Jaber Taqfiq Obaid. In its reply, the Government 
</p>
<p>provided a list of the articles under which the named persons were sentenced.  While the 
Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8223;s reply, he regrets that the Government 
</p>
<p>failed to address the allegations that the convictions were based on confessions obtained 
pursuant to torture and ill-treatment. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government of its obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all

<p>finds that the rights of the named persons under international law have been violated. Given

<p>70. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iraq for its response, dated 9 
November 2012, to this communication in reference to the case of Mr. Ahmad Amr Abd al-
Qadir Muhammad, who is at risk of imminent execution in Iraq. He was allegedly held 
incommunicado for more than a year after his arrest and subjected to torture. His injuries 
were allegedly still visible months after his arrest in 2006. Also a forensic medical 
examination in 2008 found that he had scarring. His testimony has been included as part of 
evidence during the trial before the court although Mr. Muhammad withdrew his statement, 
claiming that his confession had been extracted under coercion and torture. In its response, 
the Government explained that the communication sent by the Special Rapporteur led to a 
prompt investigation by the Ministry of Interior (MoI) into all allegations raised. The MoI 
came to the conclusion, that no violations of Mr. Muhammad&#8223;s rights under domestic and 
</p>
<p>international law could be detected, that he was never subjected to torture and subsequently, 
that the death sentence was pronounced in accordance with the law. The Government 
informed that Mr. Muhammad&#8223;s execution is now subject to administrative procedures and 
</p>
<p>will be carried out. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8223;s reply, he 
finds that the Government did not provide evidence against the allegations of torture, 
solitary confinement and the use of confession made under duress in the case of Mr. 
Mohammad. He reminds the Government of its obligation to protect the right to physical 
and mental integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the ICCPR 
and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT). The Special Rapporteur also draws attention to paragraph 7c of Human

Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that, &#8220;[t]he

<p>72. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Israel has not responded to 
this communication dated 28 March 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged sexual 
assault and torture of a 30-year-old Palestinian woman held in administrative detention and 
subsequent use of solitary confinement as a reprisal to her hunger strike in response to the 
use of administrative detention. The victim was the subject of an earlier urgent appeal to the 
Government of Israel regarding the administrative detention, however, regrettably no reply 
has been received. In response to the alleged abuse and sexual assault perpetrated by a 
solider in the Salem detention center and the subsequent use of solitary confinement, the 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons, as set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). 
He would like to refer to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; With regard to the use of solitary 
confinement as a reprisal for the hunger strike, the Special Rapporteur stresses that solitary 
confinement should be used only in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, for as 
short a time as possible, as detailed in the Istanbul Statement on the Use and Effects of 
Solitary Confinement (paragraph 89, A/66/268).  Circumstances or purposes for which 
solitary confinement may be legitimate do not include reprisals. The use of solitary 
confinement may cause serious psychological and physiological adverse effects on 
individuals deprived of liberty, negating a primary aim of the penitentiary system, 
rehabilitation and reintegration. Further, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to 
paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee, stating that 
prolonged solitary confinement of detained or imprisoned persons may amount to acts 
prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

encouraged.&#8221; (Adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 45/111 of 14 December

rights of the identified woman have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to provide information regarding the legal grounds for the aforementioned 
person&#8223;s arrest and detention and to undertake a prompt and independent investigation of 
</p>
<p>the alleged mistreatment while held in detention, leading to prosecution and punishment of 
the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victim. Furthermore, the Special

established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the dire and 
critical health condition of Mr. Thaer Halahleh and Mr. Bilal Diab and other Palestinian 
prisoners and detainees who underwent a prolonged hunger strike in response to the 
Government&#8223;s alleged excessive use of administrative detentions, solitary confinement, and 
</p>
<p>limitations on family visits. Further, the communication referred to the alleged denial of 
adequate medical attention to those in critical health condition. The Special Rapporteur 
expresses serious concern regarding the physical and psychological integrity of the 
Palestinian prisoners and detainees. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates Rule 
22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that 
&#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized 
</p>
<p>institutions or to civil hospitals.  Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, 
their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be a staff be proper for the 
medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained 
officers.&#8221; Regarding the use of solitary confinement, the Special Rapporteur draws attention 
</p>
<p>to paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee, which states that 
prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts 
prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading

evidence, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the Government&#8223;s use of punitive measures 
</p>
<p>in response to hunger strikes violates the rights of prisoners and detainees. The Special 
Rapporteur also concludes that the denial of medical attention to persons in custody 
constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in violation of international standards. 
The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to prohibit the imposition of solitary 
confinement as a disciplinary measure and ensure the physical and mental health of the 
prisoners. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Israel to ensure 
that all sick persons in detention are provided with proper medical care and treatment.  </p>

this communication dated 26 November 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the 
mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to alleged 
arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of Palestinian human rights defender Mr. Ayman 
Nasser. The Special Rapporteur expressed grave concern for the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Nasser in view of allegations that he has been subjected to ill-treatment 
during lengthy interrogations, denied proper medical attention, and held in an isolation cell 
under inadequate conditions. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the

</b></p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Jordan has not responded to 
this communication dated 17 October 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
incommunicado detention of Mr. Mohammad Yousef Abdulsalam and use of torture during 
previous incommunicado detention. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern 
regarding Mr. Abdulsalam&#8223;s unknown whereabouts and alleged great risk of torture at the 
</p>
<p>hands of Jordanian authorities.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses that 
paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 reminds States that &#8220;(p)rolonged 
</p>
<p>incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself 
constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to ensure that secret places 
of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been 
</p>
<p>provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Mr. </p>

</p>
<p>Abdulsalam under international standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or

Government to investigate, prosecute and punish all allegations of ill-treatment and to end 
the practice of incommunicado detention.

</b></p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Kazakhstan has not 
responded to this communication dated 12 October 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged imminent extradition of Mr. Makhset Abdullayevich Djabbarbergenov to 
Uzbekistan by Kazakh authorities. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern over 
allegations that Mr. Djabbarbergenov, a practicing Protestant Christian, may face serious 
charges for exercising his freedom of religion and a risk of torture upon extradition to 
Uzbekistan.  The Special Rapporteur stresses the Government&#8223;s obligation to protect the 
right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the 
ICCPR and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (CAT). In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that 
article 3 of the Convention against Torture holds that no State party shall expel, return 
(&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. The Special 
Rapporteur also draws the attention of the Government to paragraph 9 of General 
Commend No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee states that State parties must not expose 
individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
upon return to another country by way of extradition, expulsion or refoulement. The Special 
Rapporteur additionally reminds the Government of paragraph 7d of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23, which urges States not to expel, return, or extradite or in any other way 
transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that ht 
person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, stressing the importance of 
effective legal and procedural safeguards in this regard and recognizing that diplomatic 
assurances, where used, do not release States from their obligations under international 
human rights, humanitarian, and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement. 
The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure a thorough and fair assessment 
to ascertain whether Mr. Djabbarbergenov is at risk of being tortured or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and urges the Government to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee that his rights and freedoms are respected.

<p>77. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Kazakhstan has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged excessive use of 
force by law enforcement officials against protestors, including the deaths of many 
protestors. The Special Rapporteur reiterates principle 4 of the Basic Principles on the Use 
of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement, which states that law enforcement officials, in 
carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to 
the use of force and firearms. They may use force and firearms only if other means remain 
ineffective or without any promise of achieving the intended result, in accordance with the 
principles of necessity and proportionality. In addition, if the use of force is unavoidable, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4

assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest 
possible moment; (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the injured or affected person 
are notified at the earliest possible moment.&#8221; Without any evidence to the country, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the victims under the Convention against 
Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government of Kazakhstan to ensure a prompt, 
independent and impartial investigation, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators of torture, and to provide full redress to the victims, including fair and

<p>78. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Kyrgyzstan for its reply, dated 
August 14, 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture of of Ms. X to 
induce her confession while in the presence of her seven-year-old son. Unfortunately, the 
Government&#8223;s reply notes that no investigation has been opened in the matter of Ms. X&#8223;s 
allegations of torture under interrogation. Given the information received, the Special 
Rapporteur determines that the rights to physical and psychological integrity of Ms. X and 
of her child have been violated, and calls on the Government to investigate, prosecute and 
punish all cases of torture and to ensure that any evidence obtained under torture is declared 
inadmissible in trial against the victim.

</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Kyrgyzstan for its reply, dated 
August 14, 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture of Mr. Dilshad 
Nabijanov. The Government&#8223;s response acknowledges that Mr Nabijanov sustained injuries 
</p>
<p>in the course of his detention in late March and early April of 2012.  Several medical 
examinations confirmed injuries of a light nature.  The case concerning his mistreatment 
was separated from the file on criminal charges faced by Mr. Nabijanov, but it was twice 
dismissed and reopened. At the time of the government&#8223;s response, the case was pending 
</p>
<p>further inquiries and nominally still open, but no charges had been filed against any 
perpetrator. The Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 8/8, which urges States &#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures 
</p>
<p>to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment promptly and impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold 
those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them 
brought to justice and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of 
detention where the prohibited act is found to have been committed [&#8230;].&#8221; Given the 
</p>
<p>information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Mr. Nabijanov was indeed 
mistreated during his arrest or early days of detention, and that the Government has yet to 
comply with its obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish those who are ultimately 
found responsible.  The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to remain engaged 
with the Rapporteurship and to provide information on developments in the case.  In 
addition, since the criminal case for which Mr. Nabijanov was arrested is still pending, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligation to exclude any confession or 
statement obtained under torture from the charges against the defendant.  </p>

<p>80. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Kyrgyzstan for its reply, dated 
October 4, 2012, to this communication in reference to the Supreme Court&#8223;s upholding of a 
</p>
<p>life sentence for Mr. Azimjan Askarov, a human rights defender who was allegedly tortured 
during interrogations. The Government&#8223;s response stated that inquiries into the allegations 
of torture against Mr. Askarov were conducted, and that these inquiries concluded that Ms. 
ASkarov was not subjected to any torture. The Government also stated that Mr. Askarov 
did not undergo any examinations in connection to the allegations of torture. The Special 
Rapporteur expresses concern in regards to the outcomes of the inquiries given that even a 
medical examination of Mr. Askarov was never conducted. In addition, the reply does not 
address what the inquiries consisted of and how the result was reached. The Special 
Rapporteur recalls guideline 16 of the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, which states 
that &#8220;[w]hen prosecutors come into possession of evidence against suspects that they know 
</p>
<p>or believe on reasonable grounds was obtained through recourse to unlawful methods, 
which constitute a grave violation of the suspect's human rights, especially involving 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or other abuses of human 
rights, they shall refuse to use such evidence against anyone other than those who used such 
methods, or inform the Court accordingly, and shall take all necessary steps to ensure that 
those responsible for using such methods are brought to justice.&#8221; Based on the information 
received, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Askarov may have been 
violated, and calls on the Government to conduct a complete and impartial investigation 
into the aforementioned allegations and to prosecute and punish all those responsible.  He 
also urges the Government to conduct a review of Mr. Askarov&#8223;s conviction and sentence,

<p>81. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic for its response, dated 10 October 2012, to this communication in reference to Mr. 
Souvanh, a human rights defender, who was allegedly bound by his arms and legs and 
regularly beaten during a fourteen-day detention. Furthermore, he was denied regular 
meals, providing only eight meals during the entire detention. The Special Rapporteur 
expresses concern regarding Mr. Souvanh&#8223;s current hospitalization due to the injuries 
</p>
<p>sustained during his detention. In its reply, the Government denies the allegations regarding 
Mr. Souvanh&#8223;s arrest, detention, and torture. The Government supports this claim citing an 
investigation taken on the allegations and further suggests that such allegations are aimed at 
discrediting the image of the Government. The Special Rapporteur notes the insufficiency 
of the information provided relating to the specific investigation, and further asserts that all 
investigations must be conducted in an impartial and independent manner. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 
16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any

</b></p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Lebanon for its reply to this 
communication dated 2 April 2012 regarding the alleged beating of a domestic worker, who 
was reportedly trafficked to the country, abused by her employer, and subsequently 
detained, ultimately leading to a transfer to a psychiatric hospital. The Special Rapporteur 
expresses grave concern regarding the alleged beating and suicide in the psychiatric 
hospital in light of the circumstances prior to her arrival in the hospital. In its reply, the 
Government reported that the illegal recruitment office had been closed and the 
Government was conducting an investigation regarding the allegations, subsequently 
charging one person for his role in allegedly beating of the domestic worker and in 
trafficking her to the country. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 18 
of the General Comment No. 2 of the Committee against Torture, where the Committee has 
made clear that &#8220;where State authorities or others acting in official capacity or under color 
of law, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill- treatment are 
being committed by non-State officials or private actors and they fail to exercise due 
diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials or private 
actors consistently with this Convention, the State bears responsibility and its officials 
should be considered as authors, complicit or otherwise responsible under the Convention 
for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible acts. Since the failure of the State to 
exercise due diligence to intervene to stop, sanction and provide remedies to victims of 
torture facilitates and enables non- State actors to commit acts impermissible under the 
Convention with impunity, the State's indifference or inaction provides a form of 
encouragement and/or defacto permission The Committee has applied this principle to 
States parties&#8223; failure to prevent and protect victims from gender-based violence, such as 
rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation and trafficking.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur

September 2012, to the joint urgent appeal regarding the excessive use of force against 
peaceful protestors in the context of acts of desecration of graves and other monuments of 
the Sufi cultural heritage.  The appeal also inquired about the subsequent ill-treatment and 
beatings imposed on protestors against the desecration, who were arbitrarily detained, 
including an Imam, Mr. Ashraf Jerbi. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the determination 
of the Lybian government, as expressed in its response, not to tolerate expression of 
religious hatred and to preserve the cultural heritage of Lybia in all its manifestations.  At 
the same time, the Special Rapporteur notes the insufficiency of the Government&#8223;s reply in 
</p>
<p>that it did not address any of the allegations of excessive force against protestors or beatings 
and torture of those detained. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 1

<p>86. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Malaysia for its reply dated 27 
September 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged excessive use of force 
by law enforcement authorities against peaceful protestors, and acts of harassment and 
police brutality against Ms. Ambiga Sreenevasan, media personnel and human rights 
defenders, in the context of a peaceful demonstration organized to take place in Kuala 
Lampur on 28 April 2012. In its reply, the Government reiterated statements made by its 
officials reaffirming its commitment to the freedom of peaceful assembly and association 
during an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and association in June 2012. The Government also states that Ms. 
Sreenevasan and other protesters did not request protection by the authorities in response to 
alleged acts of harassment and intimidation. The Government further reported that Ms. 
Sreenevasan has lodged only one police complaint with authorities, which alleged that a 
group of men gathered outside her home some time after the demonstration to cook and 
discuss a set of demands they indended to present to Ms. Sreenevasan. While the Special 
Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8223;s reply, he regrets that the Government did not 
clarify allegations that authorities in Kuala Lampur used excessive force, including 
beatings, tear gas, water canons, to disperse a crowd of peaceful protesters. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that law enforcement officials should 
apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms, as provided in 
principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials. 
Furthermore, principle 5 provides that, &#8220;[w]henever the use of force and firearms is 
unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, (a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in 
proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate object to be achieved; (b) 
Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life; (c) Ensure that

August to 7 September 1990). Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur determines that the 
rights of Ms. Ambiga Sreenevasan and the media and human rights defenders who were 
targeted have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure that 
persons are protected against any violence, threats, or retaliation as a consequence of 
exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to undertake investigation of the alleged threats and 
intimidation, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full

its response, dated 21 June 2012, to the urgent appeal regarding reported excessive use of 
force by law enforcement authorities seriously injuring at least 37 people, including the 
alleged stabbing of Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) member, Ms. Maria Mohamed 
Didi; the beating of a member of Parliament, Mr. Bondey; and the serious injuries to 
another member of Parliament, Mr. Moosa Manik. The Special Rapporteur expresses 
serious concern in light of allegations that immigration officers did not allow MP Moosa 
Manik to board a flight in order to receive necessary treatment due to the seriousness of his 
injuries.  In its reply, the Government does not dispute the alleged force used by the police 
during the demonstrations, nor that MP Moosa Manik was injured as well as other civilians. 
However, the Government attributes this to a fairly uncertain and chaotic climate and 
describes demonstrators as inciting violent disorder and breaching the peace. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that the Government has initiated an &#8220;independent Commission of 
National Inquiry to investigat the nature of the alleged events, the findings of which will be 
forwarded to the Attorney-General and Prosecutor General for appropriate legal 
proceedings. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates Principle 5 of the UN Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which states that 
&#8220;[w]henever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials shall, 
</p>
<p>(a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and 
the legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and respect and 
preserve human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured 
or affected persons at the earliest possible moment and (d) Ensure that relatives or close 
friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible moment.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur urges the Government to continue to investigate any allegations of 
excessive use of force by law enforcement officials and to take appropriate action against 
the responsible officials. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of the 
Republic of the Maldives to continue its engagement with the Mandate.

<p>88. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Maldives has not responded

</b></p>
<p>use of force by law enforcement authorities against, and arrest and detention of, protestors 
belonging to the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP). These allegations were the subject of 
a previous communication dated 29 February 2012 however, we regret that to date no reply 
has been transmitted. We would like to refer to Human Rights Council resolution 16/23 
which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; With regard to the alleged excessive use 
</p>
<p>of force, the Special Rapporteur reiterates Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use 
of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;[l]aw enforcement officials, 
</p>
<p>in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting 
to the use of force and firearms.&#8221; Based on the information received and in the absence of 
</p>
<p>evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the incommunicado 
detention and use of excessive force by the Maldives Security Forces violated the rights of 
protestors, some of whose whereabouts remain unknown. The Special Rapporteur urgently 
calls on the Government to guarantee the physical and mental integrity of all protestors. 
The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure a prompt and independent 
investigation of mistreatment and, should the allegations be correct, hold any persons 
responsible for the violations accountable and provide redress to all victims of ill treatment 
or torture. Additionally, he requests the Government to adopt effective measures to prevent 
the recurrence of these acts by Maldives Security Forces and calls on the Government to 
abolish the practice of incommunicado detention.

provides that &#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to

recalls paragraph 7c of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 of June 2008, which reminds 
all States that &#8220;Prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may 
</p>
<p>facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

care and treatment. Further, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to undertake a 
prompt, independent and effective investigation of the facts surrounding Mr. Aung&#8223;s

temporary asylum residence permit for Mr. Y, yet encourages the Government to address a 
long-term solution for Mr. Y as an individual facing persecution in his home country. In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates Article 3 of the Convention against Torture, 
which provides that no State party shall expel, return (refouler), or extradite a person to 
another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in 
danger of being subjected to torture. In this regard, the Human Rights Committee has stated 
that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another country by way of extradition, 
expulsion or refoulement&#8221; (paragraph 9 of the Human Rights Committee&#8223;s General 
</p>
<p>Comment No. 20 on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment). The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of the 
Netherlands to continue to protect Mr. Y&#8223;s right to physical and mental integrity. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of the Netherlands to continue its 
engagement with the mandate. </p>

</b></p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Netherlands for its response, 
dated 20 August 2012, to the letter of allegation regarding Mr. Ihsan Gurz who was 
allegedly arrested by police using excessive violence, and died later that day while in 
custody. The Special Rapporteur had expressed concern in light of allegations of the 
Government&#8223;s failure to conduct an exhaustive and impartial investigation. The 
</p>
<p>Government&#8223;s reply responded to such allegations calling them mostly false and 
</p>
<p>incomplete, yet failed to respond substantively to them. The Special Rapporteur reiterates 
the Government&#8223;s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, which include in Article 6 that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life.  
When the State detains an individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence in 
protecting that individual&#8223;s rights. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the 
</p>
<p>Government that when an individual dies as a consequence of injuries sustained while in 
State custody, there is a presumption of State responsibility. Due to the Government&#8223;s 
insufficient response and based on the allegations presented, the Special Rapporteur 
concludes that the rights of Mr. Gurz under international law have been violated. The 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government of the Netherlands to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation of Mr. Gurz&#8223;s death, leading to the prosecution and punishment 
</p>
<p>of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the victim&#8223;s family. The Special

Mutalip, who was facing deportation to the People&#8223;s Republic of China, where he is

<p>reportedly at risk of torture and ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the 
Government&#8223;s issuance of a residence permit for Mr. Mutalip. In this context, the Special 
</p>

State party shall expel, return (refouler), or extradite a person to another State where there 
are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected 
to torture. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of the Netherlands to continue to

<p>100. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territories have not responded to this communication dated 19 March 2012. The 
communication referred to the severe beating and subsequent death in custody of Mr. 
Hassan Mahammad El Hmidi. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate 
that Human Rights Council Resolution 17/5 stating that all States have &#8220;to conduct 
</p>
<p>exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions.&#8221; Furthermore, the Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, paragraph 
</p>
<p>7(b), urges States to hold responsible not only those who perpetrate torture, but also those 
&#8220;who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts [...], to have them brought to justice

<p>officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been 
committed.&#8221; Accordingly, based on the information received and in the absence of evidence 
</p>
<p>to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that Mr. Hassan Mahammad El Hmidi&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>rights under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on the 
Government of the Occupied Palestinian Territories to undertake a prompt and independent 
investigation, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators. Furthermore, 
because Mr. Hassan Mahammad El Hmidi is no longer alive, the Special Rapporteur calls 
on the Government of the Occupied Palestinian Territories to provide full redress, including 
compensation, to his dependents in accordance with international standards.

</b></p>
<p>101. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Occupied Palestinian 
Territories has not responded to this communication dated 26 June 2012, thereby failing to 
cooperate with the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication 
referred to imminent execution of Mr. Na&#8223;el Jamal Qandil Doghmosh, who was sentenced 
</p>
<p>to death by hanging after allegedly being subjected to torture in order to force his 
confession to a murder. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern regarding the 
physical and mental integrity of Mr. Na&#8223;el Doghmosh in light of the irremediable nature of 
</p>
<p>capital punishment. In this context, the Special Rapporteur asserts that capital punishment 
should not be imposed on the basis of a confession obtained under torture. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 7(c) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges 
States &#8220;[t]o ensure that no statement established to have been made as a result of torture is 
invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as 
evidence that the statement was made, and calls upon States to consider extending that 
prohibition to statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, recognizing that adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, 
used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In light of the fact that no 
evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur affirms that Mr. Na&#8223;el 
</p>
<p>Doghmosh was tortured to make him confess to crimes and that his rights under 
international standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment may have been violated. Given the irremediable nature of capital 
punishment, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government not to proceed with the 
executions and to set aside any criminal conviction based on evidence obtained under 
torture.

</b></p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has not responded 
to this communication dated 7 February 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the 
mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
prolonged pre-trial detention of X. and Y., girls of 14 and 12 years of age respectively. In 
response to their reportedly prolonged pre-trial detention in a jail and alleged detention 
inappropriate for their age and sex, the Special Rapporteur expresses grave concerns about 
the minors&#8223; mental and physical integrity. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons, as set forth inter alia in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). In absence of evidence to the contrary, the 
Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the identified minors have been violated. 
The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to conduct medical examinations of persons </p>

Special Rapporteur urges the immediate release of the aforementioned juveniles and the 
conduct of an investigation to hold accountable any person responsible for the alleged 
violations. He also urges the Government to ensure the physical and mental safety of the 
minors while held in detention and after their release.

</b></p>
<p>105. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the reply transmitted by the Government of 
Pakistan on 29 March 2012; however, he notes that the Government has yet to provide 
substantive information pertaining to the issues raised. The communication referred to 
alleged acts of intimidation and threats against Mr. Muhammad Ali Shah by security forces 
as well as alleged excessive use of force against peaceful protestors. With respect to the 
allegations that Mr. Muhammad Ali Shah was threatened by a Rangers&#8223; Lieutenant Colonel 
</p>
<p>with kidnapping and death, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate paragraph 8(a) of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which reminds States that &#8220;[i]ntimidation and 
</p>
<p>coercion, as described in article 1 of the Convention against Torture, including serious and 
credible threats, as well as death threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or of a third 
person can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or to torture.&#8221; With regard to 
</p>
<p>the allegations of excessive use of force against peaceful protestors, the Special Rapporteur 
refers to article 12, paragraph 2 and 3, set forth in the Declaration on the Right and 
Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which provides that 
&#8220;the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent 
</p>
<p>authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against any violence, 
threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other 
arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in 
the Declaration.&#8221;Based on the information received and in the absence of evidence to the 
</p>
<p>contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that Mr. Muhammad Ali Shah&#8223;s rights under 
the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to ensure that persons are protected against any violence, threats, or retaliation 
as a consequence of exercising his or her right to freedom of peaceful assembly and 
expression. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to undertake investigation of the 
alleged threats and intimidation, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, 
and to provide full redress to the victim.

</b></p>
<p>106. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Pakistan has not responded 
to this communication dated 2 May 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to an alleged rape 
of an 18-year-old girl by her step-father, a police officer, for more than five years and 
subsequent failure of the State to investigate when reported. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to reiterate paragraph 7 (b) of Resolution 8/8 of the Human Rights 
Council, which states that &#8220;[i]ntimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, 
to the physical integrity of the victim or of a third person, can amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or to torture. Rape and other serious acts of sexual violence by officials 
in contexts of detention or control may not only amount to torture or ill-treatment, but also 
constitute a particular egregious form of it, due to the stigmatization they carry&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/7/3, para. 69). Further, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>60</b>  
</p>
<p>against Women (CEDAW) in its general recommendation No. 19, paragraph 9, provides 
that &#8220;States may also be responsible for private acts if they fail to act with due diligence to 
</p>
<p>prevent violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts of violence, and for providing 
compensation.&#8221;Based on the information received and in the absence of evidence to the 
</p>
<p>contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the identified individual&#8223;s rights under the 
UN Convention against Torture were violated and the Government was obligated to act 
with due diligence to investigate and punish acts of violence. The Special Rapporteur urges 
the Government to conduct a prompt and independent investigation of the alleged rape and 
hold those responsible for the acts and those who failed to respond to reported rape 
accountable. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure the 
identified person obtains redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full 
rehabilitation as possible.

dated 7 November 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged shooting, ill-
treatment and intimidation of Mr. Raymond Kakaponi, and further ill-treatment of Mr. 
Kakaponi&#8223;s two-year old son and two other members of his family. In its reply, the 
Government requested additional information regarding the allegations from the Special 
Rapporteur.  The mandate will endeavor to provide more information, but wishes to remind 
the government that the sources of allegations contained in communications from Special 
Procedures are reserved. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of 
paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of 
</p>
<p>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also reminds the Government that paragraph 6b of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 urges States &#8220;[t]o take persistent, determined and 
effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment promptly and impartially examined by the competent national 
authority, to hold those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture 
responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely punished, including the officials 
in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have been 
committed, and to take note in this respect of the Principles on the Effective Investigation 
and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to combat torture.&#8221;  The

<p>Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt, independent, and

protection of human rights through action to combat impunity as a useful tool in efforts to 
prevent and combat torture.&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the 
</p>
<p>contrary, the Special Rapporteur finds that the rights of Ms. Roxas under the UN 
Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to undertake an impartial and prompt investigation, and prosecute and punish 
those responsible. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the 
Republic of the Philippines to provide Ms. Roxas redress, award her fair and adequate 
compensation, and provide her appropriate social, psychological, medical and other 
relevant treatment.

<p><b> (a) </b>JAL 17/04/2012 Case No. KOR 1/2012 State reply: 21/06/2012<b> Alleged deportation and 
secret detention in Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Republic of Korea for its 
response, dated 21 June 2012, to this communication in reference to the entry of Mr. X to 
the Republic of Korea reportedly to avoid the risk of persecution and torture in Uzbekistan 
for his religious beliefs. In its reply, the Government indicated that Mr. X illegally entered 
the Republic and did not initially disclose that the purpose of his entry to Korea was to 
escape any potential persecution. Upon consideration of his refugee status application, the 
Government found Mr. X did not sufficiently substantiate the allegations of persecution and 
torture if deported, thereby rejecting his refugee status application and deporting him to 
Uzbekistan. The whereabouts of above-mentioned person remain unknown. In this context, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate article 3 of the Convention against Torture, 
which provides that no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to 
another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in 
danger of being subjected to torture. The Special Rapporteur concludes that prior history of 
persecution is highly relevant to the determination of risk. The non-refoulement obligation 
is reaffirmed in paragraph 9 of General Comment 20 of the Human Rights Committee and 
paragraph 9 of the Resolution A/RES/61/253 of the UN General Assembly. The Special 
Rapporteur draws attention to paragraph 16 of the Resolution A/RES/65/205 of the UN 
General Assembly which urges States &#8220;not to expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), extradite or in any 
</p>
<p>other way transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>63 
</b></p>
<p>believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, and recognizes 
that diplomatic assurances, where used, do not release States from their obligations under 
international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-
refoulement.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also recalls that paragraph 7(d) of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011 urges States &#8220;[n]ot to expel, return (refouler), 
</p>
<p>extradite or in any way transfer a person to another state where there are substantial 
grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&#8221; The 
Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its explanation of Mr. X&#8223;s arrest and of the 
subsequent administrative proceedings undertaken to determine refugee status. However, 
the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure a thorough risk assessment to 
ascertain whether anyone deported may be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment in the receiving country. The Special Rapporteur urges 
the Government of Korea to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and 
freedoms of Mr. X are respected and to refrain from any future acts of refoulement.

</b></p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Korea has 
not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
harassment, intimidation, ill-treatment, and excessive use of force by police against 
peaceful protestors. The Special Rapporteur recalls article 3 of the UN Code of Conduct for 
Law Enforcement Officials which states that, &#8220;(l)aw enforcement officials may use force 
</p>
<p>only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>In addition, provisions 4 and 7 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms 
by Law Enforcement Officials states that law enforcement officials shall make use of non-
violent means, as far as possible; and that States should ensure that &#8220;arbitrary or abusive 
</p>
<p>use of force&#8230; by law enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence under their 
law.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 15/21, and in particular paragraph 1, &#8220;calls upon States to respect and fully 
</p>
<p>protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully [&#8230;] including persons espousing 
minority or dissenting views or beliefs, human rights defenders, [&#8230;] and others, [&#8230;], 
</p>
<p>seeking to exercise or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary measures to ensure 
that any restrictions on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly [&#8230;] 
are in accordance with their obligations under international human rights law.&#8221; In the 
</p>
<p>absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of 
those mentioned in the communication under the UN Convention against Torture have been 
violated, and calls on the Government to ensure investigation and prosecution of the 
perpetrators and the provision of redress to all the victims.

<p><b>to the Special Rapporteur on torture 
</b></p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Moldova for its reply, dated 6 
March 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged torture and solitary 
confinement of Mr. Iurie Matcenco. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the situation in 
regards to the Transnistrian region of Moldova but recalls that violations committed by 
non-State agents in that region can still invoke Moldova&#8223;s international responsibility. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that article 13 of the Convention against Torture requires that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>64</b>  
</p>
<p>&#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges he has been subjected to 
torture in any territory under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his 
case promptly and impartially examined by, its competent authorities.&#8221; In addition, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee states that 
prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned person may amount to acts 
prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment] of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Based 
on the information received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Mr. Matcenco&#8223;s rights 
</p>
<p>under international standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment have been violated, and calls on the Government to cease the 
isolation of Ms. Matcenco while ensuring his safety, as well as ensuring he obtains redress 
and as full rehabilitation as possible.

</b></p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Moldova for its reply, dated 12 
April 2012, to this communication regarding the alleged torture and ill-treatment of Mr. X 
while in detention. In its reply, the Government of Moldova denied any torture of Mr. X 
while in police custody, citing a medical examination conducted upon Mr. X&#8223;s entry in the 
</p>
<p>penitentiary. According to the Government, the report indicated no bodily injuries of Mr. X, 
alleging this fact revealed that Mr. X was not subjected to acts of torture or cruel, inhuman, 
degrading treatment or punishment while in police custody. The Special Rapporteur also 
thanks the Government for its response regarding investigations of alleged ill-treatment 
while in police custody. According to the Government&#8223;s investigation, Mr. X did not 
</p>
<p>experience ill-treatment in police custody. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
Article 12 of the CAT, which requires competent authorities to undertake a prompt and 
impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has 
been committed, and Article 7 of the CAT, which requires State parties to prosecute 
suspected perpetrators of torture. The government&#8223;s response relies exclusively in the 
medical examination done upon Mr. X&#8223;s admission of the penitentiary, but provides no 
</p>
<p>information by which to assess the quality of that examination.  The State also affirms that 
the allegations of torture were examined by a prosecutor, who concluded that there was no 
basis for them; yet the government&#8223;s reply fails to explain what investigatory steps were 
</p>
<p>taken to ascertain the facts.  Since the State has not shown that it attempted to establish 
whether or not torture had occurred by  objective, impartial and independent investigation,  
the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Mr. X have been violated under the UN 
Convention Against Torture. He calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
independent investigation, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to 
provide full redress to Mr. X. He encourages the Government to continue its engagement 
with the mandate.

</b></p>
<p>115. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Russian Federation has 
not responded to this communication dated 11 June 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged systematic beating and intimidation of Mr. X while held in a minimum security 
prison, and reported solitary confinement of Mr. X that may have amounted to one year. 
Furthermore, the communication referred to the forced feeding of Mr. X while tied up for 
19 hours in response to his hunger strike. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>65 
</b></p>
<p>of the physical and mental integrity of Mr. X in light of allegations of the use of prolonged 
solitary confinement and systematic beatings. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates paragraph b of the Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which urges States 
&#8220;[t]o take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment investigated promptly, 
effectively and impartially by an independent, competent domestic authority, as well as 
whenever there is reasonable ground to believe that such an act has been committed; to hold 
persons who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such acts responsible, to have them 
brought to justice and punished in a manner commensurate with the gravity of the offense, 
including the officials in charge of the place of where the prohibited act is found to have 
been committed.&#8221; With respect to the use of prolonged solitary confinement, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights 
Committee, which provides that &#8220;prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or 
</p>
<p>imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In light of the fact that no evidence has been 
provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the rights of Mr. X 
under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls 
on the Government of the Russian Federation to undertake a prompt, impartial, and 
effective investigation of the alleged acts of torture, leading to prosecution and punishment 
of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victims. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government to abolish the practice of solitary confinement as a punishment.

</b></p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has not 
responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by 
the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged torture and sentence 
of amputation of Mr. Iyada, as well as the sentence of amputation of five other people. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States 
to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In addition, the Special Rapporteur notes 
</p>
<p>that the Committee against Torture on Saudi Arabia expresses concern about &#8220;(t)he 
</p>
<p>sentencing to, and imposition of, corporal punishments by judicial and administrative 
authorities, including, in particular, flogging and amputation of limbs, that are not in 
conformity with the Convention.&#8221; Article 15 of the Convention against Torture also 
</p>
<p>provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to 
have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, 
except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; In the 
</p>
<p>absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of 
Mr. Iyada and the five other victims have been violated under the UN Convention against 
Torture. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake prompt and 
impartial investigation of all allegations of torture to ensure the accountability of those 
responsible and to repeal from its domestic laws the imposition of amputation as execution 
of a criminal sentence.  </p>

<p>117. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Saudi Arabia has not 
responded to this communication dated 14 February 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged arbitrary arrest and detention of 35 Ethiopian Christians as a result of their peaceful 
exercise of freedom of religion. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern regarding 
the alleged ill-treatment of 29 women and Mr. Z while in detention and the detainees&#8223; 
impending deportation. Further, grave concern is also expressed regarding the physical and 
mental integrity of the aforementioned individuals and the lack of adequate medication 
provided to detainees. In response to ill-treatment of the women detainees and the beating 
of Mr. Z, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall 
remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, 
and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that as a State Party of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, Article 4(c)-(d) requires States 
to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in accordance with national 
legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those acts are perpetrated by 
the State or by private persons. Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the aforementioned detainees under the 
UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government of Saudi Arabia to undertake a prompt, independent and effective 
investigation of the facts, leading to the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and 
to provide full redress to the victims.

responded to this communication dated 9 February 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged imminent execution of Mr. Mohamed Fahd Al Wajaan Al Shamari, who was 
reportedly subjected to torture in order to obtain confessions, which were subsequently used 
as evidence in proceedings. The communication also referred to alleged use of force against 
witnesses to make false testimonies against Mr. Al Shamari. The Special Rapporteur 
expresses grave concern regarding the death sentence against Mr. Al Shamari, especially in 
light of the use of torture methods to obtain impermissible evidence. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates Article 15 of the CAT, which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State 
</p>
<p>Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of 
torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person 
accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>asserts that a death sentence should only be imposed for the most serious crimes. 
Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
determines that the rights of Mr. Al Shamari under the UN Convention against Torture have 
been violated. Given the irremediable nature of capital punishment, the Special Rapporteur 
calls on the Government not to proceed with the execution and to set aside any criminal 
conviction based on evidence obtained under torture. Further, he calls on the Government 
of Saudi Arabia to undertake a prompt, independent and effective investigation of the facts, 
leading to the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to </p>

responded to this communication dated 1 March 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the 
mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged prolonged pre-trial detention, heavy sentencing, and torture while in detention of 
human rights defenders, including Dr. Saud Mokhtar Al-Hashimi, Mr. Walid Ali Ahmad 
Lamri, and Mr. Sulaiman Ibrahim Saleh Al-Rashoudi. Furthermore, the communication 
referred to the alleged 20-month incommunicado detention of Mr. Mokhlif Al Shammari, 
who reportedly was tortured while in detention. In addition, the communication referred to 
Dr. Mubarak Bin Said Bin Zair, who reportedly continues to be held in detention despite an 
order for his provisional release, and Dr. Said Bin Zair, who allegedly was held in pre-trial 
detention since 2007 and allegedly held incommunicado during this period. The Special 
Rapporteur expresses grave concern regarding the physical and psychological integrity of 
all aforementioned individuals in light of the lengthy nature of the sentences reportedly 
handed down, the allegations of ill-treatment while in detention, and the reports of 
prolonged incommunicado detention. He expresses further concern regarding recent 
allegations of Mr. Al-Hashimi being held in solitary confinement and being beaten in 
response to his family&#8223;s public statements about the authorities. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>stresses the Government&#8223;s obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of 
all persons, as provided in the UN Convention Against Torture. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which 
&#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any 
time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Further, in response to the Government&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>use of incommunicado detention, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 8b of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which reminds States that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado 
detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of 
such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, 
security and the dignity of the person and to ensure that secret places of detention and 
interrogation are abolished.&#8221;Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the aforementioned persons under the 
UN Convention against Torture have been violated. Therefore, he calls on the Government 
of Saudi Arabia to undertake a prompt, independent and effective investigation of the facts, 
leading to the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to

responded to this communication dated 25 May 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the 
mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged arbitrary arrest and false charges brought against Mr. Ahmed El-Sayed likely as a

<p>mental torture in detention. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern regarding the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ahmed El-Sayed, particularly in light of the 
possible imposition of the death penalty based on confessions obtained under torture. The 
Special Rapporteur asserts that the use of confessions extracted under torture in judicial 
proceedings is strictly prohibited under international law, reiterating article 15 of the 
Convention against Torture, which provides that, &#8220;[e]ach State Party shall ensure that any 
</p>
<p>statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that 
the statement was made.&#8221; With respect to Mr. El-Sayed&#8223;s legitimate work as a human rights 
lawyer, we would like to refer to Principle 16 of the Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and 
the Treatment of Offenders held at Havana, Cuba, from 27 August to 7 September 1990, 
which provides that &#8220;Governments shall ensure that lawyers (a) are able to perform all of

<p>their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper 
interference; (b) are able to travel and to consult with their clients freely both within their 
own country and abroad; and (c) shall not suffer, or be threatened with, prosecution or 
administrative, economic or other sanctions for any action taken in accordance with 
recognized professional duties, standards and ethics.&#8221; With respect to the allegation of 
</p>
<p>possible imposition of the death penalty, the Special Rapporteur reiterates Safeguard 5 of 
the UN Safeguards Guaranteeing Protection of the Rights of Those Facing the Death 
Penalty, which provides that &#8220;[c]apital punishment may only be carried out pursuant to a 
</p>
<p>final judgment rendered by a competent court after legal process which gives all possible 
safeguards to ensure a fair trial, at least equal to those contained in article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including the right of anyone 
suspected of or charged with a crime for which capital punishment may be imposed to 
adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings.&#8221; Based on the information 
provided, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Mr. El-Sayed under the UN 
Convention against Torture have been violated, and calls on the Government of Saudi 
Arabia to set aside any conviction based on evidence obtained under torture, and ensure that 
Mr. El-Sayed obtains redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full 
rehabilitation as possible. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to undertake a 
prompt and impartial investigation of the alleged acts of torture, leading to prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
if it will not abolish the death penalty, to impose it only for the most serious crimes where it 
can be shown that there was an intention to kill, which results in the loss of life, a crime that 
Mr. El-Sayed is not alleged to have committed.

responded to this communication dated 15 August 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged torture in detention of Mr. Ahmed El-Sayed, a human rights lawyer, and his 
deteriorating condition since his imprisonment. Mr. El-Sayed was the subject of an earlier 
urgent appeal; regrettably, no reply has yet been received. The Special Rapporteur 
expresses grave concern regarding the demonstrated evidence of torture on Mr. El-Sayed&#8223;s 
body, deteriorating health, and possible imposition of the death penalty. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Article 12 of the Convention Against 
Torture (&#8220;CAT&#8221;), which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and 
</p>
<p>impartial investigation whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has

rape of internally displaced Tamil woman   
</b></p>
<p>123. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Sri Lanka has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged assault and rape of an internally 
displaced Tamil woman by military officers. The Special Rapporteur recalls article 4 (c &amp; 
d) of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which 
notes the responsibility of States to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and, in 
accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against women, whether those 
acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons. In addition, General Assembly 
resolution 48/104 on the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which 
provides in its article 4(b) that States should pursue by all appropriate means and without 
delay a policy of eliminating violence against women and, to this end, should refrain from </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>70</b>  
</p>
<p>engaging in violence against women. In the absence of other evidence, the Special 
Rapporteur is of the view that this woman was indeed raped, which is a serious violation of 
the Convention against Torture. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation and to provide full redress, including fair 
and adequate compensation, to the victim.

and excessive use of force against peaceful protestors  
</b></p>
<p>124. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Republic of Sudan for its 
response to this communication regarding allegations of the police and internal security 
forces violently dispersing peaceful protests at universities in various cities, resulting in 
injuries and arbitrary arrests of many protestors. In its reply, the Government attributed the 
use of force to the aim of safeguarding the lives of students and citizens, claiming the 
gatherings were unlawful. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the Government&#8223;s reply 
regarding student Taj Alsir Jaafar, who reportedly is no longer in detention and was 
permitted to receive family visits while in detention. The Special Rapporteur also notes the 
Government&#8223;s establishment of a fact-finding committee to investigate the claim that police 
entered the university campus and assaulted students. The Special Rapporteur nonetheless 
encourages the Government to ensure that all allegations of torture and other ill-treatment 
are investigated and punished, and reminds the Government of its obligation to provide full 
redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible to 
all victims. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Article 2 of the Declaration 
on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote 
and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which 
provides that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and 
</p>
<p>implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as 
may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and 
other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its 
jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights 
and freedoms in practice.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur urges that all allegations of 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate and/or excessive use of force by law enforcement officials be properly 
investigated and appropriate action taken against the responsible officials.  He also looks 
forward to continued engagement with the Government, in particular with regard to the 
findings of the fact-finding committee.

<p><b> (b) </b>JUA 05/06/2012 Case No. SDN 2/2012 State reply: None to date<b> Alleged death sentence 
by stoning of a 20-year-old woman for charges of adultery 
</b></p>
<p>125. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Sudan has 
not responded to this communication dated 5 May 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged sentencing to death by stoning of Ms. Intisar Sharif Abdallah for the crime of 
adultery, charges which she admitted after reportedly being beaten by her brother. With 
respect to the imposition of the death penalty, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the 
Government&#8223;s obligations to Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, which states that &#8220;in countries which have not abolished the death 
penalty,&#8221; the &#8220;sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that corporal punishment can amount to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading punishment or even torture, which is provided in the Resolution 
2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights and that the State is obliged to exclude 
evidence obtained under torture from criminal proceedings against the defendant. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>71 
</b></p>
<p>Moreover, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern regarding the allegation that the man 
co-accused of the same charges was released after denying them. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its legal obligations to ensure equality 
between men and women in the enjoyment of all civil and political rights, including the 
right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
punishment. Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur determines that the rights of Ms. Intisar Sharif Abdallah under the international 
law have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the Republic of 
Sudan to eliminate the imposition of the death penalty, and if the Government must impose 
the death penalty, to do so only in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention 
to kill which resulted in loss of life.

<p><b> (c) </b>JUA 08/06/2012 Case No. SDN 3/2012 State reply: 26/06/2012 &amp; 03/07/2012<b> Alleged 
incommunicado detention and reported beating until detainee went into a coma 
</b></p>
<p>126. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Republic of Sudan for its 
response to this communication regarding alleged incommunicado detention of Mr. Bushra 
Gamar Hussein, where he was reportedly beaten until he went into a coma. The Special 
Rapporteur expresses grave concern in light of Mr. Hussein&#8223;s deteriorating health, which 
</p>
<p>has been worsened by stress and trauma allegedly caused by the physical and racial abuse 
suffered during his incommunicado detention. In its latest reply, the Government disclosed 
that Mr. Hussein was released because of the insufficiency of the evidence, and the case is 
now closed. Regrettably, the Government&#8223;s response fails to substantively address any of 
</p>
<p>the specific allegations of ill-treatment and torture contained in the joint urgent appeal. In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur asserts that the Government has an obligation to protect 
the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. The Special Rapporteur therefore 
recalls paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;[c]ondemns all 
forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including 
through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place 
whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the 
absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; Moreover, the Special Rapporteur reiterates General Comment 
</p>
<p>No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which holds that 
&#8220;States are under the obligation to respect the right to health by, inter alia, refraining from 
</p>
<p>denying or limiting equal access for all persons, including prisoners or detainees, 
minorities, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, to preventive, curative and palliative 
health services.&#8221; Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur determines that the rights of Mr. Bushra Gamar Hussein under international law 
have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to undertake a prompt 
and independent investigation, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, 
and to provide full redress to Mr. Hussein. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
of the Republic of Sudan to eliminate the practice of incommunicado detention. He 
encourages the Government to continue its engagement with the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> (d) </b>JUA 06/07/2012 Case No. SDN 4/2012 State reply: None to date<b> Alleged use of force 
during peaceful demonstrations and the alleged torture and ill-treatment of detainees 
</b></p>
<p>127. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Sudan has 
not responded to this communication dated 6 July 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with 
the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged use of excessive force in response to protests, including towards student protestors, 
and the alleged torture and ill-treatment of detained protestors, who were allegedly 
threatened with rape and subjected to violence. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave 
concern regarding protestors still in detention who are at risk of torture and ill-treatment, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>72</b>  
</p>
<p>including Ms. Rashida Shams al-Din, who allegedly has been held incommunicado in an 
undisclosed location. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that Principle 4 of 
the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which 
provides that, &#8220;[l]aw enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as 
possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221; 
Moreover, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;[w]henever the use of force and firearms is 
</p>
<p>unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall: (a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in 
proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved; (b) 
Minimize damage and injury, and respect and preserve human life; (c) Ensure that 
assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest 
possible moment; and (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the injured or affected 
person are notified at the earliest possible moment. In light of the fact that no evidence has 
been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that there have been 
several violations of rights of Ms. Shams al-Din and of the other victims under international 
law. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of the Republic of Sudan to cease the 
practice of secret detention and calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
impartial investigation of the allegations of torture and ill-treatment, to ensure the 
accountability of those responsible, and to prevent the recurrence of these acts.

<p><b>as well as mass arrests 
</b></p>
<p>128. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Sudan has 
not responded to this communication dated 3 August 2012, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged use of excessive force in response to protests, resulting in at least 12 deaths and 
many injuries; the alleged torture and ill-treatment of detained protestors; and the 
incommunicado detention and severe ill-treatment of Mr. Mohammad Salah Mohammed. 
The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern regarding protestors still in detention who 
are risk of torture and ill-treatment, including Mr. Salah. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates Principle 4 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;[l]aw enforcement officials, in carrying 
out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use 
of force and firearms.&#8221; Moreover, Principle 5 provides that, &#8220;[w]henever the use of force

that assistance and medical aid are rendered to any injured or affected persons at the earliest 
possible moment; and (d) Ensure that relatives or close friends of the injured or affected

reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all 
</p>

treatment or punishment.&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the

of Mr. Salah Mohammed and other victims under international law. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government to cease the practice of secret detention and calls on the Government 
to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of the allegations of torture and ill-
treatment, to ensure the accountability of those responsible, to offer redress, reparations and 
rehabilitation to the victims and to prevent the recurrence of these acts. </p>

</b></p>
<p>129. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Republic of Sudan has 
not responded to this communication dated 5 September 2012, thereby failing to cooperate 
with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged sentencing to death by stoning of Ms. Layla Ibrahim Issa for the crime of adultery, 
charges which were brought by her husband. The Special Rapporteur expressed grave 
concern regarding the allegation that Ms. Ibrahim Issa wasshackled together with her 6-
month old baby. With respect to the imposition of the death penalty, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates the Government&#8223;s obligations to Article 6(2) of the International Covenant on 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that corporal punishment can amount to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even torture, which is provided in the 
Resolution 2005/39 of the Commission on Human Rights. Stoning as a means of executing 
a death sentence has universally been condemned as cruel, inhuman and degrading 
punishment. Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur determines that the rights of Ms. Layla Ibrahim Issa under the international law 
have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the Republic of 
Sudan to eliminate the imposition of the death penalty, and if the Government must impose 
the death penalty, to do so only in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention 
to kill which resulted in the loss of life. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls on the 
Government for commutation of the sentence.

<p>130. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
has not responded to this communication dated 20 February 2012, thereby failing to 
cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication 
referred to the alleged arbitrary detention of at least 16 persons, including prominent human 
rights defenders, and the reported ill-treatment and torture of the male detainees. The 
Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern about the allegations that several of the 
aforementioned individuals remain in detention and have been subjected to torture while in 
detention. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman 
</p>
<p>or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall

<p>131. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syria has not responded to 
this communication dated 27 March 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
arrest, incommunicado detention, and possible enforced disappearance of Mr. Rudy 
Uthman, a journalist and human rights defender, and Mr. Saleh Shameya, a well-known 
lawyer, as a result of the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and 
assembly. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 7(c) of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 8/8 of 18 June 2008, which reminds all States that &#8220;[p]rolonged 
</p>
<p>incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the perpetration of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself 
constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards 
concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person.&#8221;Accordingly, based on the 
</p>
<p>information received and in the absence of the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines 
that the rights of the identified persons under the UN Convention against Torture, whose 
whereabouts remain unknown, have been violated. The Special Rapporteur urgently calls 
on the Government to guarantee the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Rudy Uthman and 
Mr. Saleh Shameya. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to undertake a prompt 
and independent investigation on the allegations, leading to the prosecution and punishment 
of the perpetrators. Moreover, the Government must ensure that all individuals whose rights 
have been violated obtain redress, including fair and adequate compensation, and as full 
rehabilitation as possible. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Syria to

</b></p>
<p>132. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syria has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human 
Rights Council. The communication referred to the allegations of prolonged 
incommunicado detention and torture and ill-treatment of the members of the Syrian Centre 
for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM) as a result of their legitimate activities as 
human rights defenders. These allegations were the subject of a previous communication 
dated 20 February 2012, however, we regret that to date no reply has been transmitted. The 
Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern for the physical and psychological integrity of 
the detainees, particularly that of Mr. Mazen Darwich and the other individuals who are 
being held incommunicado and who have been subjected to torture and ill-treatment. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 7(c) of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 8/8 of 18 June 2008, which reminds all States that &#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado 
detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other

<p>Government of Rule 22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, 
which provides that &#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to 
specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an 
institution, their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the 
medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained 
officers.&#8221; Furthermore, Rule 25(1) provides that, &#8220;[t]he medical officer shall have the care 
</p>
<p>of the physical and mental health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all 
who complain of illness, and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; </p>

the Special Rapporteur determines that under the UN Convention against Torture the rights 
of Messrs. Mazen Darwich, Hussayn Gharir, Hani Zitani, Abdelrahman Alhamade, and 
Mansour al-Omari, whose whereabouts remain unknown, were violated. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur believes that, in the absence of contrary evidence, the criminal charges 
against these individuals are likely part of a wider pattern of Government harassment 
against human rights defenders. Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur determines that under 
the UN Convention against Torture the rights of Mr. Bassam al-Ahmed, Mr. Jawan Farso, 
Mr. Ayham Ghazzoul, Ms. Yara Badr, Ms. Razan Ghazawi, Ms. Mayada Khalil, Ms. Sana&#8223;

<p>135. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syria has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged arrest, incommunicado 
detention, torture, and killing of Syrian citizens by the Syrian government. The alleged 
victims, including those currently being held incommunicado and those who are deceased, 
are  Mr. Shepal Ibrahim, Mr. Maher Fawzi al-Hamoud, Ms. Fatma Saad, Mr. Osama al-
Habaliy, Mr. Salah al-Shogre, Ms. Zilal Ibrahim al-Salhani, Mr. Badr Ka&#8223;ake, Mr. Yahia

</p>
<p>or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall

and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Furthermore, 
paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 of 12 April 2011 asserts that 
&#8220;[p]rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the 
</p>
<p>perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the 
safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to ensure that 
secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; Based on the fact that no 
evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur finds that the rights of 
the victims named above under the Convention against Torture have been violated. The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Syria to ensure a prompt and impartial 
investigation of the violations, leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, 
and the provision of redress, compensation and rehabilitation to all victims and their 
families.

<p>136. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Syria has not responded to 
this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged arbitrary detention and 
torture of Mr. Muhammad Raed Al-Tawil, a volunteer with the Damascus-based 
humanitarian organization, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. Mr. Al-Tawil was allegedly 
arrested without cause by Syrian security forces at Red Crescent headquarters, and was

of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, each government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons. Paragraph l of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any

</p>
<p>against Torture requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed. And article 7 of the Convention against Torture requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. Since no evidence has been provided to the 
contrary, the Special Rapporteur finds that the rights of Mr. Al-Tawil under the Convention 
against Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of 
Syria to promptly and impartially investigate, prosecute and punish these violations and 
their perpetrators, and to provide full redress, compensation and rehabilitation to the victim.

</b></p>
<p>137. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Tajikistan for its response to this 
communication in reference to the alleged arrest, torture, and harassment of Mr. Tagoibek 
Sharifbekov, a Tajik citizen, by police officers in the town of Vakhdat, Tajikistan. 
According to the allegation, Mr. Sharifbekov was detained by police officers and subjected 
to torture in an attempt to make him confess to committing a theft. Following his release, 
Mr. Sharifbekov filed several complaints with the Police Complaints Department. Since 
then, Mr. Sharifbekov has allegedly been subjected to harassment and was at one point 
attacked by members of the police force in an attempt to pressure him to withdraw the 
complaint. In its reply, the Government of Tajikistan stated that after a thorough 
investigation of the matter, they have determined that the allegations of torture and 
harassment are factually unfounded, and that disciplinary measures have not been taken 
against those allegedly responsible for these actions. The Government stated that forensic 
evaluations did not reveal any substantial physical evidence of the alleged torture, and that 
Mr. Sharifbekov had in fact been detained by police officers in Vakhdat several days earlier 
than he claimed in his allegation. Furthermore, the Government claims that no harassment 
took place, as alleged by Mr. Sharifbekov, given the fact that under Tajik law, a police 
complaint cannot be withdrawn once it has been submitted, thereby extinguishing any 
incentive to pressure Mr. Sharifbekov to withdraw the complaint. The Government claims 
to have taken disciplinary measures against certain police officers who were found to have 
arrested and detained Mr. Sharifbekov for over three hours without registering an official 
record of arrest, and who confiscated Mr. Sharifbekov&#8223;s passports without filling out the 
required documents. The Government did not explain, however, what specific disciplinary 
measures were taken. The Special Rapporteur believes that forensic examinations that are 
not made by an impartial and independent expert cannot be conclusive on the issue of 
whether torture or mistreatment has occurred.  Even if done independently, the absence of 
physical evidence is also not dispositive of the issue, as it depends on the type of 
mistreatment and the time elapsed, among other factors. The Special Rapporteur reiterates 
that Paragraph l of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of 
</p>
<p>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or  punishment, including through </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4

<p>intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any  time and in any place 
whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States  to implement fully the 
absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel,  inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment.&#8221; Furthermore, paragraph 8(a) of Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>Resolution 16/23 states that &#8220;[i]ntimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, 
to the physical integrity of the victim or of a third person can amount to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or to torture.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur concludes that the government 
</p>
<p>has not sufficiently dispelled the credible allegations received and urges it to investigate 
further.

<p>138. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Tajikistan has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the 
Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged intimidation, 
mistreatment, and threats towards inmates being held at the Ministry of Justice minimum 
security prison known as a &#8222;settlement colony&#8223; YaT 9/7 located in the city of Kurgan-Tube, 
Tajikistan. It is also alleged that the inmates&#8223; complaints against their mistreatment have 
</p>
<p>been ignored by prison officials, and in one case prison officials retaliated against a 
complaint by placing the complaining inmate in solitary confinement. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 7 (b) of Resolution 8/8 of the Human Rights Council 
states that &#8220;Intimidation and coercion, as described in article l of the Convention against 
Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death threats, to the physical 
integrity of the victim or of a third person, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or to torture.&#8221; In addition, article 13 of the CAT, requires that &#8220;Each State Party 
</p>

under its jurisdiction has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and 
impartially examined by, its competent authorities. Steps shall be taken to ensure that the 
complainant and witnesses are protected against all ill- treatment or intimidation as a 
consequence of his complaint or any evidence given.&#8221; Based on the fact that no evidence 
</p>
<p>has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the 
victims under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. The Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government of Tajikistan to ensure a prompt and impartial 
investigation of the alleged violations, leading to prosecution and punishment of the 
perpetrators, and the provision of redress, compensation and rehabilitation to the victims

<p>139. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Tajikistan has not responded 
to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate established by the

Association of Young Lawyers of Tajikistan &#8220;Amparo&#8221;, following the decision of the 
</p>
<p>Khujand City Court at the request of the Ministry of Justice. Amparo is a leading 
organization which provides free legal aid, human rights education, and training, and is a 
member of the Coalition against Torture. An Urgent Appeal was previously sent to the 
Government of Tajikistan in August 2012 regarding the legal proceedings against the

information regarding the legal proceedings has given rise to concern. In particular, it is 
alleged that there was a lack of transparency and clear procedural guidelines in the initial </p>

dignity of the human person&#8221;, as well as article 12 of the International Covenant on

<p>142. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Uganda for its response, dated 8 
May 2012, to the joint letter of allegation regarding the alleged dangerously unhealthy 
conditions of detention in Ugandan prisons, including the lack of medical care, 
overcrowding, spread of communicable diseases, poor hygiene and provision of food with 
low nutritional value. In its reply, the Government of Uganda acknowledged that detention 
conditions in Ugandan prisons still fall short of both internationally and nationally 
prescribed standards, however, notes the progress being taken to address these conditions. 
The Government predicts that they are likely to contain congestion levels to acceptable and 
tolerable limits within the next five years, and attributes the inadequate prison conditions to 
a general lack of financial resources. Despite the Government&#8223;s constraints on resources, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur reiterates that the Committee against Torture and the Human Rights 
Committee have consistently found that conditions of detention can amount to inhuman and 
degrading treatment. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Rule 
22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that, 
&#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized 
institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their 
equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care 
and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers.&#8221;

faces a serious risk of being subject to torture and inhuman treatment by Russian authorities 
due to charges with offenses associated with participation in armed groups and armed 
violence in Ingushetia. The Special Rapporteur stresses the Government&#8223;s obligation to

UDHR, the ICCPR and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that article 3 of the Convention against Torture holds that no State party shall

where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of

safeguards in this regard and recognizing that diplomatic assurances, where used, do not 
release States from their obligations under international human rights, humanitarian, and 
refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement. The Special Rapporteur calls on 
the Government to ensure a thorough and fair assessment to ascertain whether Mr. X is at

urges the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that his rights and

of the international standards prohibiting torture and the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the United Arab 
Emirates acceded on 19 July 2012. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the call for the

Muthoni Mara, Ms. Naomi Nziula Kimweli, and Mr. Samuel Kimweli Mbithuka Kilatya, 
who are seeking redress from the British Government for acts of torture to which they were 
allegedly subjected by British authorities prior to Kenyan independence. In its reply, the 
Government states that the interim ruling issued in the case allows the case to proceed 
against the Government&#8223;s preliminary objections, and does not constitute a definitive 
</p>
<p>finding of liability against the Government. The Government expressed the opinion that 
international law does not establish rules concerning limitation periods for civil actions in 
national courts for wrongs that may amount to torture, and that a fair trial in a civil case 
relating to matters which occurred more than 50 years ago is not possible. The Government 
further expressed the view that it is not bound under international human rights obligations 
to take measures in relation to events that took place prior to the ratification or entry into </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>

<p>force of the relevant instruments. However, the Government also states that different 
considerations may apply to criminal cases and article 29 of the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court which relates to prosecutions for crimes within the jurisdiction 
of the International Criminal court. In this context, the Special Rapporteur expressed 
concern over the Government&#8223;s alleged claim that the complaint is time barred by virtue of 
</p>
<p>the Limitation Act of 1980. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that taking into account the 
grave nature of acts of torture, they cannot be subject to any statute of limitations. He 
reiterates that in accordance with Article 7 and Article 29 of the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, adopted by the Government of the United Kingdom on 4 
October 2001, widespread and systematic torture constitutes a crime against humanity and 
shall not be subject to any statute of limitations. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
Government to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation into the above mentioned 
allegations of torture of Kenyan nationals by the British authorities prior to Kenyan 
independence, and to provide full redress to the victims, including fair and adequate 
compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible in accordance with international law.

</p>
<p>there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be danger of being

States from their obligation under international human rights, humanitarian and refugee 
law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement.&#8221; The Government indicated that it 
carefully considers all asylum and human rights applications from Sri Lanka nationals, 
including those of Tamil ethnicity, and that applicants at risk of persecution and ill 
treatment upon repatriation are granted protection. The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for its confirmation that some injunctions stopping removal from the United 
Kingdom were granted. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur notes that the Government 
did not address allegations that the aforementioned individuals are at a significant risk of 
torture at the hands, consent, or acquiescence of Sri Lankan authorities. The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights

upon extradition the aforementioned persons will allegedly be placed in detention under 
conditions of solitary confinement for an indefinite period of time and be accordingly 
placed at a risk of being subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds that paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 
of the Human Rights Committee states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained 
or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that article 3 of 
the Convention against Torture holds that no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or 
extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the 
person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. The Special Rapporteur also draws 
the attention of the Government to paragraph 9 of General Commend No. 20 of the Human 
Rights Committee states that State parties must not expose individuals to the danger of 
torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to another 
country by way of extradition, expulsion or refoulement. The Special Rapporteur calls on 
the Government not to extradite persons at risk of prolonged solitary confinement and to 
conduct a fair assessment of the risk of being tortured in each case of imminent extradition 
from the United Kingdom. Finally, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that diplomatic

<p>obligation to refrain from refoulement.

<p><b> (d) </b>JUA 30/11/2012 Case No. GBR 6/2012 State reply: None to date<b> Allegations of

</b></p>
<p>148. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland has not responded to this communication dated 30 
November 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate issued by the Human Rights 
Council. The communication referred to the alleged continued torture of a British resident, 
Mr. Shaker Aamer, and the Government&#8223;s complicity and actual involvement in these acts 
</p>
<p>of torture. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern regarding Mr. Aamer&#8223;s right to 
physical and mental integrity in light of the consistent use of severe torture and, 
furthermore, his current status as a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, where he is held based on 
forced false allegations and has been cleared for release since 2007. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that Article 1 of the Convention against Torture includes 
complicity or explicit or tactic consent on the part of law enforcement or security personnel 
or any other person acting in an official capacity. The Special Rapporteur also reiterates 
that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of 
</p>
<p>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; Moreover, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Article 2(2) of 
</p>
<p>the CAT, which provides that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of 
war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be 
invoked as a justification of torture. Accordingly, based on the information received and in 
light of the fact that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur 
concludes that the rights of the Mr. Shaker Aamer under the UN Convention against 
Torture have been violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to uphold its obligations to protect the right 
to physical and mental integrity of all persons and to undertake a prompt, impartial, and 
effective investigation of the alleged acts of excessive, leading to prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide redress to the victims. Furthermore, the 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure the immediate return of Mr. Aamer to </p>

<p><b> (a) </b>JAL 11/06/2012 Case No. USA 6/2012 State reply: 02/01/2013<b> Alleged mistreatment 
with electric shock of children and young adults enrolled in the residential 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme of the Judge Rotenberg Center in Canton, Massachusetts 
</b></p>
<p>149. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States of America for 
its response, dated 2 January 2013 to this communication concerning the treatment suffered 
by children and young adults enrolled in the residential programme of the Judge Rotenberg 
Center (JRC), including the use of aversive therapy by means of electric shock and physical 
means of restraints. In its reply, the Government reports that the JRC uses Graduated 
Electronic Decelerators (GED) to deliver contingent skin shocks as a form of aversive 
behavior control, including two versions of the GED, namely the GED3A and GED4, that 
are modified beyond what was approved for use by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). The Government explained that the FDA has sent a warning letter 
to the JRC on 6 December 2012, demanding prompt corrective action as regards the use of 
modified GEDs and requesting a meeting to discuss discontinuing their use. The 
Government also reported that &#8220;the use of aversive therapy by JRC has been challenged 
</p>
<p>through a variety of state and federal legislative and judicial actions,&#8221; including the 
Department of Justice&#8223;s (DOJ) investigation into possible violations of civil rights laws, 
</p>
<p>which remains open and ongoing. In this context the Government reiterates that it would 
gladly provide additional information once that investigation is complete. In Massachusetts 
a variety of measures that would regulate or ban the use of aversive treatment have been 
introduced in recent years but failed to pass into law. However, the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts&#8223; Department of Developmental Services (DDS) amended its behavior 
modification regulations in October 2011 in order to ban all schools in Massachusetts from 
using certain aversive interventions unless a child had a court-approved treatment plan that 
allowed for their use prior to 1 September 2011. The Government additionally stated that in 
New York State, regulations have been enacted prohibiting all day or residential schools 
from using aversive interventions, which also provide for annually renewable exemptions 
in cases of children whose state-mandated &#8220;individualized education plans&#8221; approved the 
use of aversive therapy prior to  30 June 2009. Furthermore, New York authorities expect 
that by June of 2014, all (New York) residents at JRC, including those who remain subject 
to court-approved aversive interventions, will be offered placements in New York State 
where such interventions are not authorized. The Special Rapporteur welcomes new 
information received indicating that in February 2013 the State of Massachusetts 
announced it was seeking a reversal of the court order that had approved treatment plans 
using aversive therapy. Although the Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>response, he expresses serious concern about the physical and mental integrity of the 
students residing at JRC, in view of the continued use of electric shock therapy and 
physical means of restraint as part of the JRC educational programme. He notes that 
although in 2011 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&#8223; Department of Developmental 
</p>
<p>Services (DDS) approved regulation changes that limited the use of Level III Aversive 
Interventions (including skin shock), this new regulation does still allow the use of electric 
shocks for those students who had an existing court-approved treatment plan as of 
September 1, 2011 (115 CMR 5.14). Under the revised regulations, only new students in 
Massachusetts are protected from Level III aversives, including electric shock or prolonged 
restraints. The Special Rapporteur notes with great concern that many students at the JRC 
are still eligible for the Level III Aversive Interventions, including electro-shock treatment. 
The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that Massachusetts regulations would not apply </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>85 
</b></p>
<p>in other states.  JRC, previously called the Behavioral Research Institute, was previously 
located in California and Rhode Island.  There is nothing to stop JRC from simply 
relocating again to another state.  Protections are needed at the federal level to ensure that 
Level III aversives are brought to an end in the United States of America.The Special  
Rapporteur understands that, under individualized court orders now in place for JRC 
patients, the use of Level III aversives have been justified as form of  treatment, 
rehabilitation, habilitation, or education for persons with disabilities.   The Special 
Rapporteur would like to draw attention to mandates&#8223; recent report on the applicability of 
</p>
<p>the torture and ill-0treatmenet framework in health-care settings (A/HRC/22/53, 1 February 
2103).  As the report states in paragraph 18, authoritative interpretations of international 
human rights law by international bodies have established that a violation of the 
Convention against Torture may occur &#8220;where the purpose or intention of the State&#8223;s action 
</p>
<p>or inaction was not to degrade, humiliate or punish the victim, but where this nevertheless 
was the result.&#8221; The report calls into question the concept that medical necessity may ever 
</p>
<p>be used to justify a treatment practice that induces severe emotional or physical pain (see 
paras. 31-35),   &#8220;This is particularly the case when intrusive and irreversible, non-
consensual treatments are performed on patients from marginalized groups, such as persons 
with disabilities, notwithstanding claims of good intentions or medical necessity&#8221; (para. 
32). The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of paragraph 7a of Resolution 8/8 of 
the Human Rights Council, according to which corporal punishment, including that of 
children, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even torture. The 
Special Rapporteur further reminds of his report to the 60th session of the General 
Assembly, in which he determined that any form of corporal punishment is contrary to the 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 
that States cannot invoke provisions of domestic law to justify violations of their human 
rights obligations under international law, including the prohibition of corporal punishment. 
The Special Rapporteur also reiterates that in paragraph 5 of General Comment No. 20, the 
Human Rights Committee stated that the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment must 
extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement ordered as punishment for 
a crime or as an educative or disciplinary measure.  Therefore and in the absence of 
evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the students of 
the JRC subjected to Level III Aversive Interventions by means of electric shock and 
physical means of restraints have been violated under the UN Convention against Torture 
and other international standards. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
ensure a prompt and impartial investigation into these continued practices. He calls on the 
Government to provide information on the Department of Justice&#8223;s (DOJ) investigation into 
possible violations of civil rights laws and to take measures to prohibit the use of Level III 
Aversive Interventions for all students on a national level, including those students who had 
an existing court-approved treatment plan as of 1 September 2011 in Massachusetts.

</b></p>
<p>150. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
prolonged solitary confinement and ill-treatment of Mr. Robert Cuff, a member of the 
United States Navy, who suffers from brain damage and severe Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD).  According to the information received, Mr. Cuff is incarcerated and held 
in solitary confinement at the Bossier Parish Medium Correctional Facility in Shreveport, 
Louisiana, under unsanitary conditions and without access to adequate medical care. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the 
Human Rights Committee, which states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained 
or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 of the International </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>86</b>  
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and article 7 of the Basic Principles for the 
Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of solitary 
confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken and 
encouraged.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur would also like to draw the Government&#8223;s attention 
</p>
<p>to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, which &#8220;Condemns all forms of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through 
intimidation, which shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and 
can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and 
non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur further draws the Government&#8223;s attention the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Rule 22(2) provides that, &#8220;(s)ick 
</p>
<p>prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or 
to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their equipment, 
furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be proper for the medical care and treatment 
of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of suitable trained officers.&#8221; Furthermore, Rule 
</p>
<p>25(1) provides that, &#8220;(t)he medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental 
health of the prisoners and should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, 
and any prisoner to whom his attention is specially directed.&#8221; Based on the information 
</p>
<p>received, the Special Rapporteur determines that Mr. Cuff&#8223;s rights under international 
standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment have likely been violated, and calls on the Government to cease the prolonged 
isolation of Mr. Cuff, and ensure that he obtains adequate medical care and redress, 
including fair and adequate compensation and as full rehabilitation as possible.

confinement 
</b></p>
<p>151. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States for its reply 
dated 28 September 2012 to the communication dated 21 June 2012. The communication 
referred to the alleged prolonged solitary confinement of Mr. Russel Maroon Shoats, an 
inmate of Pennsylvania&#8223;s State Correctional Institution (SCI). According to the information 
we received, Mr. Shoats has spent the last 21 years in solitary confinement, being held in 
lockdown for 23 to 24 hours each day. The government&#8223;s response mentions the serious 
nature of the crimes for which Mr Shoats was convicted and the fact that he twice escaped 
and was recaptured, one time after holding hostages.  According to prison authorities, Mr. 
Shoats has repeatedly been involved in fights with other inmates.  On the other hand, the 
response does not dispute the facts about the conditions of confinement to which Mr. 
Shoats is subjected or the long term nature of such conditions. A lawsuit brought by Mr. 
Shoats before United States courts resulted in a finding that the procedures followed to 
place them in solitary confinement did not breach his rights under the US Constitution.  The 
Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights 
Committee, which states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained or imprisoned 
person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, and article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, 
which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as a 
punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken and encouraged.&#8221; In his 
</p>
<p>report a/66/268, the Special Rapporteur states that &#8220;solitary confinement is a harsh measure 
</p>
<p>which may cause serious psychological and physiological adverse effects on individuals 
regardless of their specific conditions.&#8221; Moreover, &#8220;[d]epending on the specific reason for 
</p>
<p>its application, conditions, length, effects and other circumstances, solitary confinement can 
amount to . . . an act defined in article 1 or article 16 of the Convention against Torture.&#8221; ( 
paras. 79 and 80). The Special Rapporteur urges that solitary confinement should be used 
only in very exceptional circumstances, as a last resort, for as short a time as possible (para. 
89). Additionally, the Special Rapporteur also reiterates paragraph 1 of Human Rights </p>

on 21 April 2012 by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and his subsequent 
isolation for a period of five days without access to food, water, or hygienic facilities. In its 
reply, the Government stated that the Office of the Inspector General within the United 
States Department of Justice is current conducting an independent investigation into Mr. 
Chong&#8223;s allegations, inclusive of consideration of penal, disciplinary, or administrative 
sanctions against alleged perpetrators. The Government also reported that the DEA is 
reviewing its internal procedures, and that Mr. Chong has exercised his rights under 
relevant municipal law for monetary compensation. The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for its explanation of the investigations undertaken to date into Mr. Chong&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>allegations, and invites to provide the mandate with more information as the proceedings 
develop.  He encourages the Government to ensure that all allegations of torture and other

the mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
alleged judicial and other forms of harassment against Mr. Steve Richardson and police

that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of

</b></p>
<p>154. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United States of America 
has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
detention of five non-US citizens currently detained at the military detention facility at 
Guantanamo Bay, Mr. Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, Mr. Walid Muhammad Salih Mybarack 
Bin Attash, Mr. Ramzi Binalshibh, Mr. Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, and Mr. Mustafa Ahmed Adam 
Al Hawasawi. According to the information received, the United States Military 
Commission brought charges against the five named individuals on 31 May 2011 and 26 
January 2012. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the Government failed to 
properly investigate and acknowledge that some of the interrogation techniques used in its 
detention facilities including Guantanamo Bay might constitute a violation of the 
Convention against Torture.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government that the Committee Against Torture called on the United States in 2006 to 
&#8220;rescind any interrogation technique, including methods involving sexual humiliation, 
</p>
<p>&#8222;waterboarding,&#8223; &#8222;short shackling&#8223; and using dogs to induce fear, that constitutes torture or 
cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in all places of detention under its de 
facto effective control, in order to comply with its obligations under the Convention.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur further draws attention to article 12 of the Convention against torture 
and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment (CAT), which requires 
competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there is 
reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory 
under the jurisdiction of the State party. The Special Rapporteur additionally reiterates 
article 15 of the Convention, which provides that &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any

<p>statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked 
as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that

himself or to confess guilt.&#8221; In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur concludes that the named individuals were in fact subjected to the methods of 
torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment mentioned in his communication.  The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to initiate prompt and impartial investigations 
into all allegations of torture and ill-treatment and to ensure that evidence obtained under 
torture will not be invoked in any proceedings against the defendants.

has not responded to this communication, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
detention of Mr. Shaker Aamer, a non-United States citizen, at the military detention 
facility at Guantanamo Bay.  The Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern over 
allegations that Mr. Aamer was subjected to torture, inhuman, and degrading treatment at 
the Bagram and Kandahar Air Force bases in Afghanistan, and at Guantanamo Bay. 
According to the information received, Mr. Aamer was captured in October 2001 and not 
brought before a court or tribunal until November 2004. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligation to protect to right to physical and 
mental integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the ICCPR, and 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or

<p>156. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Uzbekistan has not 
responded to this communication dated 13 April 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the 
mandate established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the 
arbitrary detention of Mr. X, failure to provide any evidence substantiating charges brought 
against him, and the closed trial before a military court that found Mr. X guilty of 
espionage and sentenced him to a twelve-year imprisonment. Further, the communication 
referred to the alleged denial of a specialist for Mr. X&#8223;s deteriorating health since in

<p>detention. Additionally, at least three persons were reportedly subjected to threats of torture 
and punishment in order to force them to testify against Mr. X and at least one person was 
reportedly beaten to extract testimony. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern 
regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. X and those subjected to acts of 
intimidation and ill-treatment for the purpose of extracting testimony. In response to Mr.

</b></p>
<p>157. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Uzbekistan has not 
responded to this communication dated 17 April 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the 
mandate issued by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
religious persecution and subsequent incommunicado detention of Mr. X and possible 
enforced disappearance. The Special Rapporteur stresses the Government&#8223;s obligation to 
protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. In response to Mr. X&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>unknown whereabouts, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 8b of Human Rights 
Council Resolution 16/23, which reminds States that &#8220;detention in secret places can 
facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to 
respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; Furthermore, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of article 12 of the Convention against 
Torture, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, and article 7 of the Convention against Torture, which requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. Accordingly, and in the absence of evidence to 
the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Mr. X, whose whereabouts 
remain unknown, have been violated under the UN Convention against Torture. The 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to end the practice of incommunicado detention 
and unacknowledged detention. He also calls on the Government to undertake a prompt and 
impartial investigation of possible acts of torture, leading to the prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators, and to ensure Mr. X obtains redress, including fair and 
adequate compensation, and as full rehabilitation as possible. Further, if Mr. X is to be 
tried, the Government must ensure that any evidence against him obtained under torture is 
declared inadmissible.

<p>158. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Uzbekistan for its reply, dated 19 
June 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged arbitrary detention, solitary 
confinement, and physical ill-treatment of Mr. Erkin Musaev, an Uzbek national and former 
UNDP employee. In its reply, the Government stated that Mr. Musaev received a medical 
examination upon entering prison and has received medical care on several occasions. The 
Government further stated that was sentenced to three periods of &#8220;confinement in a 
</p>

</p>
<p>that there is &#8220;no need to carry out any investigations or medical examinations&#8221; with regards 
</p>
<p>the aforementioned allegations. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reminds the

persons, as set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 
&#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any

</p>
<p>Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee that Mr. Musaev&#8223;s rights and 
freedoms are respected in compliance with the aforementioned international instruments. 
The Special Rapporteur further urges the Government to undertake a prompt, impartial, and 
effective investigation of the alleged acts of ill-treatment leading to the prosecution and 
punishment of perpetrators and, if necessary, to provide redress to the victim.

</p>
<p>detention. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur expresses grave concern regarding Ms. Tran 
Thi Thuy&#8223;s deteriorating health, and reminds the Government of its obligation to provide 
adequate medical services to all prisoners and detainees. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates rule 22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners, which provides that, &#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be 
transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are 
provided in an institution, their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be 
proper for the medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be a staff of 
suitable trained officers.&#8221; Thus, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Ms. 
</p>
<p>Tran Thi Thuy under international standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment may have been violated and calls on the Government of 
Vietnam to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation, leading to prosecution and

</b></p>
<p>161. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Zimbabwe has not responded 
to this communication dated 29 March 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
arbitrary detention of six activists and to the alleged use of torture for the purpose of 
extracting confessions. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern that the activists 
were subjected to torture and ill-treatment and denied adequate medical treatment for their 
injuries while in detention. In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that Paragraph 
7b of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 that urges States &#8220;[t]o take persistent, 
determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially examined by the competent 
national authority, as well as whenever there is reasonable ground to believe that such an 
act has been committed; to hold persons who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate such 
acts responsible, to have them brought to justice and punished in a manner commensurate 
with the gravity of the offence, including the officials in charge of the place of detention 
where the prohibited act is found to have been committed; and to take note, in this respect, 
of the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful 
tool in efforts to combat torture.&#8221; In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special

<p>Rapporteur concludes that the six activists&#8223; rights under international law related to torture 
</p>
<p>have been violated. The Special Rapporteur stresses that any evidence obtained through 
means of torture shall not be used in judicial proceedings. He calls on the Government to 
undertake a prompt and impartial investigation of those responsible for using such methods, 
leading to prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to the 
victims. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that all

<p>162. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of Zimbabwe has not responded 
to this communication dated 17 August 2012, thereby failing to cooperate with the mandate 
established by the Human Rights Council. The communication referred to the alleged 
arrest, detention, ill-treatment, and beating of 44 members of Gays and Lesbian Zimbabwe

and mental integrity of the individuals in question. In this context, the Special Rapporteur

<p>164. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bangladesh for its response to 
this communication regarding the alleged detention and torture of Mr. Salauddin Quader 
Chowdhury, an opposition politician. According to the information received, following his 
arrest on 16 December 2010, Mr. Chowdhury was subjected to torture by the Bangladeshi 
security forces during interrogation at a private residence, with a physician accompanying 
them. Mr. Chowdhury was reportedly tortured for several hours, including by applying 
electrodes to his genitals, beating him, slitting his stomach with razors and twisting his </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>94</b>  
</p>
<p>toenails and fingernails with pliers. In its reply, the Government of Bangladesh states that it 
formed an Inspection Committee responsible for investigating the alleged violations. The 
Government notes that the Inspection Committee interviewed multiple witnesses and 
determined that no such acts of torture or ill treatment occurred. The Government further 
notes that Mr. Chowdhury has been provided with adequate and independent medical 
treatment, has been allowed to meet regularly with his family and his lawyer, and has been 
afforded all other legal and due process rights in his case. The government&#8223;s reply does not 
explain what measures were taken to ensure that the investigation by the Inspection 
Committee was surrounded by guarantees of independence and impartiality, as required by 
international standards.  The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern about the 
impartiality and independence of a committee formed by three members of the corrections 
agency of Bangladesh who are presumably in a hierarchical chain of command amongst 
themselves.  In addition, no information is provided as to whether the investigation also 
included a timely, professional and independent medical examination of Mr. Chowdhury to 
determine the possible existence of physical signs corroborating the acts of torture alleged.  
The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Bangladesh to continue investigating the 
matter and to remain engaged with the mandate.

asylum seekers, lack of access to medical assistance and solitary confinement 
</b></p>
<p>165. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Cyprus for its reply, dated 31 
August 2012, to this communication in reference to the alleged attack, ill-treatment, and 
denial of medical assistance to Iranian asylum seekers, Messrs. Mohammad Khosh Sorour, 
Mohsen Khosravani, Bagher Ebrahimzadeh, Mostafa Hajilou, Mohammad Malek Madar, 
and Zakariah Ebrahim Moj. The Special Rapporteur expressed serious concern over the 
alleged severe beating and subsequent placement in solitary confinement of 72-year old Mr. 
Ebrahimzadeh. According to the information we received, Mr. Ebrahimzadeh suffers from 
a heart condition and sustained a broken leg during the beating, for which he was denied 
adequate medical assistance. In its reply, the Government noted that an investigation into 
the allegations by the Independent Authority for the Investigation of Allegations and 
Complaints against the Police is underway. While the Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for its reply, he regrets that the Government failed to address the allegations 
concerning Mr. Ebrahimzadeh&#8223;s beating, ill-treatment, and the denial of medical care.  Mr. 
Ebrahimzadeh was deported on 18 July 2011. The government of Cyprus has not explained 
what measures were taken to ensure compliance with its obligation not to return (<i>refouler</i>) 
any person to a place where he or she would be at risk of being tortured. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligation to protect the physical and 
mental integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the UDHR, the ICCPR, and 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT). The Special Rapporteur would like to refer to paragraph 1 of Human 
Rights Council Resolution 16/23 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are 
and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be 
justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derivable 
prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221;  The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur also reiterates Article 12 of the CAT, which requires competent 
authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and Article 7 of the CAT, which 
requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. With respect to 
allegations that the detainees were subjected to beating, the Special Rapporteur would like </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>95 
</b></p>
<p>to draw attention to Principle 15 of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and 
Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;(l)aw enforcement officials, in their 
relations with persons in custody or detention, shall not use force, except when strictly 
necessary for the maintenance of security and order within the institution, or when personal 
safety is threatened.&#8221; With regards to the allegations that Mr. Ebrahimzadeh was held in 
isolation, the Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 of the 
Human Rights Committee, which states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained 
or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment] of the ICCPR.  In 
this regard, the Special Rapporteur additionally recalls article 7 of the Basic Principles for 
the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of 
solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken 
and encouraged.&#8221; Additionally, in view of allegations of the denial of medical care, the 
Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligations under the Body of Principles 
for the Protection of All Persons under Any form of Detention or Imprisonment, and in 
particular of Principle 24, which provides that &#8220;[a] proper medical examination shall be 
offered to a detained or imprisoned person as promptly as possible after his admission to 
the place of detention or imprisonment, and thereafter medical care and treatment shall be 
provided wherever necessary,&#8221; free of charge. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
the Special Rapporteur concludes that the rights of the detainees have been violated under 
international human rights law. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to 
continue its investigation into the facts in a prompt, independent and effective manner 
leading to the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to 
the victims.

</b></p>
<p>166. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Ethiopia for its response to this 
communication in reference to the alleged arrest and prosecution of journalists and 
opposition politicians, including the ill-treatment of Mr. Eskinder Nega, the alleged torture 
of Mr. Woubshet Taye, and the lack of access to doctors of Ms. Reeyot Alemu while in 
detention. The Government states that domestic anti-terrorism legislation is in conformity 
with international human rights law as well as the Ethiopian constitution, and that it 
incorporates legal and practical safeguards to prevent ill-treatment of persons suspected of 
engaging in terrorist activities. The Government further states that all procedural due 
process and legal rights were afforded to the aforementioned individuals at all times during 
their arrest, detention, prosecution, and conviction, including access to family, lawyers, and 
medical personnel. Regrettably, however, the Government did not respond to allegations of 
ill-treatment and torture of the alleged victims. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that article 12 of the Convention against Torture requires the competent 
authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation wherever there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and article 7 requires State parties to 
prosecute suspected perpetrators of torture. In light of the fact that no evidence has been 
provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the 
aforementioned individuals under the UN Convention against Torture have been violated. 
The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of Ethiopia to investigate, prosecute and 
punish all cases of torture and ill-treatment and to ensure full redress to the victims. </p>

32-year old woman, Ms. X, in the Kulgam district of Kashmir. In its reply, the Government

allegation was baseless and instigated.&#8221; While he appreciates the Government&#8223;s reply, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate paragraph 7 (b) of Resolution 8/8 of the Human 
Rights Council, which states that &#8220;[i]ntimidation and coercion, as described in article 1 of 
the Convention against Torture, including serious and credible threats, as well as death 
threats, to the physical integrity of the victim or of a third person, can amount to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or to torture. Rape and other serious acts of sexual violence 
by officials in contexts of detention or control may not only amount to torture or ill-
treatment, but also constitute a particular egregious form of it, due to the stigmatization 
they carry&#8221; (A/HRC/7/3, para. 69). Further, the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in its general recommendation No. 19, 
paragraph 9, provides that &#8220;States may also be responsible for private acts if they fail to act 
with due diligence to prevent violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts of 
violence, and for providing compensation.&#8221;  The Special Rapporteur regrets that no details 
</p>
<p>have been provided regarding the investigation conducted, particularly if it was prompt, 
impartial and independent, as international standards require.  Similarly, no grounds were 
offered for the Government&#8223;s conclusions that the allegations were baseless and instigated.

with the death of Mr. Shalla, while the involvement of Border Security Forces personnel in 
the death of Mr. Mondal could not be established by an official inquiry. The Government 
also reported that Mr Sanjoy&#8223;s exact cause of death could not be established, and the results

article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts

<p>addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as a punishment, or to the restriction of 
its use, should be undertaken and encouraged.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur would also like to 
remind the Government of Rule 22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of

<p>170. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its response to this communication dated 3 September 2012, regarding the alleged arbitrary 
detention of human rights defenders and persons peacefully exercising their freedoms of 
expression and assembly, including Ms. Massumeh Dehghan, Ms. Mahnaz Mohammadi, 
Ms. Mansoureh Behkish, Mr. Farzad Haghshenas, Ms. Maryam Bahreman, Mr. Ashkan 
Zahabian, and Mr. Mohammed Reza Fakhravar. The Special Rapporteur expressed serious 
concerns about the physical and mental integrity of Ms. Mohammadi, who suffers from a 
serious spine condition that requires regular medical attention, the denial of which could 
cause such sever pain as to constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even 
torture. In its reply, the Government described the proceedings and sentence issued against 
Ms. Bahreman by a branch of the Shiraz court of revolution. The Special Rapporteur </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>98</b>  
</p>
<p>regrets that the Government failed to address and clarify allegations concerning the alleged 
denial of medical treatment for Ms. Mohammadi. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
stresses that the Government has an obligation to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the UDHR and the ICCPR. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate Rule 22(2) of the Standard Minimum Rules for 
the Treatment of Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;[s]ick prisoners who require specialist 
</p>
<p>treatment shall be transferred to specialized institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital 
facilities are provided in an institution, their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical 
supplies shall be proper for the medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall

should daily see all sick prisoners, all who complain of illness, and any prisoner to whom 
his attention is specially directed.&#8221; In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes that the rights of Ms. Mohammadi under international law have been 
violated. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
ensure that all sick persons in detention are provided with proper medical care and 
treatment. The Special Rapporteur additionally calls on the Government to undertake a 
prompt, independent and effective investigation of the facts, leading to the prosecution and 
punishment of the perpetrators, and to provide full redress to Ms. Mohammadi.

</b></p>
<p>171. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its response to this communication dated 26 September 2012, regarding the alleged 
arbitrary detention and solitary confinement of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, a human rights 
lawyer and defender. In its reply, the Government reported that Mr. Soltani&#8223;s appeal was 
heard by branch 54 of Tehran&#8223;s court of appeals. The government described that part of Mr. 
</p>
<p>Soltani&#8223;s original verdict, which condemned him to five years&#8223; imprisonment, was 
</p>
<p>dismissed, and that his prohibition from practicing law after his release from prison was 
reduced to a period of ten years. The Government explained that the remainder of the lower 
court&#8223;s verdict was upheld. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>response, he regrets that the Government did not address allegations that Mr. Soltani was 
placed in solitary confinement in Section 209 of the Evin prison. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur stresses that the Government has an obligation to protect the right to physical 
and mental integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the UDHR and the 
ICCPR. The Special Rapporteur reiterates paragraph 6 of General Comment 20 of the 
Human Rights Committee, which states that prolonged solitary confinement of the detained 
or imprisoned person may amount to acts prohibited by article 7 [on the prohibition of

<p>172. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its response to this communication in reference to the alleged ill-treatment and denial of </p>

</b></p>

and Ms. Fereshteh Shirazi, and the alleged judicial harassment, sentencing, and arbitrary 
detention of Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh, Ms. Narges Mohammadi and Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahai. In 
its reply, the Government of Iran states that Ms. Shirazi was charged and convicted of 
disseminating propaganda and falsely alarming the public by insulting and making false 
allegations about government officials. She was sentenced to two years imprisonment, and 
was barred from exiting the country for five years. The Government, however, did not 
comment on the cases of Ms. Farid, Ms. Sotoudeh, Ms. Mohammadi, or Ms. Nazar-Ahai, 
nor did not explain if it had taken any measures to ensure the physical and psychological 
safety of any of the aforementioned victims. The Special Rapporteur notes that Article 7 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights expressly prohibits all forms of 
torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Special Rapporteur 
also reiterates that under paragraph 8(b) of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23, 
&#8220;(p)rolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the 
</p>
<p>perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 
can in itself constitute a form of such treatment.&#8221; The Resolution further urges all states &#8220;to 
</p>
<p>respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person and to 
ensure that secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished.&#8221; In light of the fact 
</p>
<p>that no evidence has been provided to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur concludes that 
the rights of the aforementioned individuals have been violated. The Special Rapporteur 
calls on the Government to investigate, prosecute and punish all allegations of ill-treatment 
and to end the practice of incommunicado detention.

</b></p>

</p>
<p>173. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
its response to this communication in reference to the allegation that Mr. Lo Zaniar Moradi 
and Mr. Loghman Moradi, Iranian Kurdish nationals, were arrested for their suspected 
involvement in three murders and membership in the Komole terrorist organization. It is 
alleged that the individuals were coerced into confessing to these offenses after being 
subjected to ill-treatment and torture for 25 days. The victims were subsequently convicted 
and sentenced to death. In this context, the Special Rapporteur stresses that paragraph 7(c) 
of Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 urges States &#8220;[t]o ensure that no statement 
established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was 
made, and calls upon States to consider extending that prohibition to statements made as a 
result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, recognizing that adequate 
corroboration of statements, including confessions, used as evidence in any proceedings 
constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In light of the fact that no evidence has been provided 
</p>
<p>to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur affirms that the aforementioned victims were 
tortured in order to make them confess to crimes, and that their rights under international 
standards prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment may have been violated. Given the irremediable nature of capital punishment, 
the Special Rapporteur calls on the Government not to proceed with the executions and to 
set aside any criminal conviction based on evidence obtained under torture. </p>

<p>174. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Iraq for its response, dated 20 
August 2012, to the communication on the excessive use of force by Iraqi security forces, 
the arbitrary detention of peaceful protestors who were allegedly subjected to sever torture, 
and the incommunicado detention of Mr. Haidar Shihab Ahmad Abdel Latif. The Special 
Rapporteur notes the insufficiency of the Government&#8223;s response, as it failed to 
</p>
<p>substantively address any of the allegations. The Special Rapporteur expresses grave 
concern regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Haidar Shihab Ahmad 
Abdel Latif, whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown. Furthermore, the Special

Oday Alzaidy, Abdel-Jabbar Shaloub Hammadi, Hadi al-Mehdi, Sharwan Azad Faqi

</p>

Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;[l]aw 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent 
means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221; Moreover, with respect to 
allegations of torture, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of paragraph 1 of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 16/23 that &#8220;[c]ondemns all forms of torture and other 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, 
which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus

notes that it has not received any negative reports or complaints regarding Mr. Wad&#8223;ani&#8223;s

Alleged rape of sex worker by police while in detention  
</b></p>
<p>177. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of South Africa for its response to 
this communication in reference to the alleged arbitrary arrest and rape of a sex worker by 
police officers. In its reply, the Government of South Africa states that there is no evidence 
that the alleged rape took place, and further notes that many past allegations of sex worker 
abuse have been vague and unfounded. The Government also notes that in some instances, 
courts have taken legal action against members of the police force and that statutes dealing 
with domestic violence, abuse, and torture are currently in place, or are being discussed. 
The Special Rapporteur, however, regrets that no further information has been provided by 
the Government in relation to the allegations of sexual abuse. The Special Rapporteur refers 
to his report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/7/3, para. 69), in which he stressed that 
&#8220;rape and other serious acts of sexual violence by officials in contexts of detention or 
</p>

form of it, due to the stigmatization they carry.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur also would like to 
</p>
<p>draw the attention of the Government to article 4 (c) and 4(d) of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, which notes the responsibility 
of states to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish acts of violence against 
women, as well as articles 7 and 12 of the UN Convention against Torture, which require </p>

order to determine whether the State has acted in conformity with its obligations under 
international law. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to provide more detailed 
information on the investigations that have been carried out, and to prosecute and punish 
the perpetrators of the alleged torture, and to provide redress to all victims.

<p>178. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States of America for 
its response to this communication in reference to allegations of torture and ill-treatment in 
immigration facilities. According to the information received, 16 gay and transgender 
individuals have allegedly been subjected to solitary confinement, torture and ill-treatment, 
including sexual assault, while in detention in U.S. immigration facilities. Furthermore, 
there was reportedly a lack of protection from persecution and respect for the principle of 
non-refoulement for those who risk torture if returned to their home countries on account of 
their sexual orientation, gender identity or HIV status. In its reply, the Government of the 
United States indicated that it is currently investigating these allegations, but has not 
provided any further details. The Government also refused to comment on whether the 
standards under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) would be extended to include 
immigration detention facilities. The Government stated that a wide variety of complaint, 
investigation, and medical assistance mechanisms have been established in immigration 
facilities, and that it is currently revising its prisoner risk assessment procedures and 
general detention standards, so as to provide enhanced protection to LGBT detainees. The 
Government, however, did not specify the exact measures that will be adopted under these 
initiatives. The Special Rapporteur would like to draw the attention of the Government to 
paragraph 6 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights Committee, to article 7 of 
the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, to the Body of Principles for the 
Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment and the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, particularly rule 22 (2). Given the lack of 
evidence to the contrary, the Special Rapporteur determines that the rights of the 
aforementioned victims have been violated under the Convention against Torture. The 
Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure the continued investigation of the 
allegations, and to prosecute and punish those responsible, and to provide the victims with

<p><b>charges 
</b></p>
<p>179. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States of America for 
its response to this communication regarding the alleged prolonged solitary confinement of 
individuals suspected or convicted of terrorism-related offences. According to the 
information received, Mr. Syed Fahad Hashmi, Mr. Zaid Safarini, and other individuals 
have allegedly been held in prolonged solitary confinement, including during pre-trial 
detention. Furthermore, these prisoners have allegedly not been provided with adequate 
mechanisms through which they can challenge the conditions of their confinement. In its 
reply, the Government of the United States explained that solitary confinement under so 
called Special Administrative Measures (SAMs), may only be imposed where necessary to 
protect national security, and may not exceed one year at a time. The Government further </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/53/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>states that inmates under SAMs and other forms of solitary confinement are afforded 
adequate due process, and are given reasonably prompt notification of the conditions of 
their confinement. In regards to Mr. Sarafini, the Government states that he was not 
subjected to SAMs, but does not state whether or not he was subjected to other forms of 
solitary confinement. The Government does not address the case of Mr. Hashmi. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates that the practice of solitary confinement can amount to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, due to the punitive nature of the punishment and 
the pain and suffering it may inflict on the accused. The Special Rapporteur further draws 
the Government's attention to article 7 of the Basic Principles for the Treatment of 
Prisoners, which provides that &#8220;efforts addressed to the abolition of solitary confinement as 
</p>
<p>a punishment, or to the restriction of its use, should be undertaken and encouraged.&#8221; In the

<p>absence of contrary evidence, the Special Rapporteur determines that the victims&#8223; rights
