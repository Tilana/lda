<p>                                                
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>also </i>the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the Goals on improving 
</p>
<p>maternal health, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child and infant 
</p>
<p>mortality and the development of a global partnership,<b>1
</b></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the obligations of States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that increased political will and commitment, cooperation and technical 
</p>
<p>assistance at the international and national levels are urgently required to reduce the 
</p>
<p>unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the leading role of the World Health Organization in maternal health and the 
</p>
<p>work under the annual World Health Assembly agenda item on the monitoring of the 
</p>
<p>achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality 
</p>
<p>and morbidity is a health, development and human rights challenge, and that a human rights 
</p>
<p>analysis of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and the integration of a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective in international and national responses to maternal mortality and morbidity could 
</p>
<p>contribute positively to the common goal of reducing this rate, with a view to eliminating 
</p>
<p>preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, </p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the ongoing efforts of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies to 
</p>
<p>highlight the human rights aspects of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, including 
</p>
<p>those of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, and of the special procedures, in particular those described in the report of the 
</p>
<p> 
<b>1</b> Millennium Development Goals 5, 3, 4 and 8 respectively. </p>

 <p>Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
</p>
<p>of physical and mental health (A/61/338), 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the Council has a constructive role to play in raising awareness of the 
</p>
<p>human rights aspects of the unacceptably high global rate of maternal mortality and morbidity 
</p>
<p>and in supporting, promoting and enhancing existing national and international efforts to reduce 
</p>
<p>this rate, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> its initiative to hold an interactive dialogue at its eighth regular session on 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality and the human rights of women, on 5 June 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that preventable maternal mortality and morbidity affects women and their 
</p>
<p>families in all regions and cultures, and that it is exacerbated by factors such as poverty, gender 
</p>
<p>inequality, age and multiple forms of discrimination, as well as factors such as lack of access to 
</p>
<p>adequate health facilities and technology, and lack of infrastructure, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal 
</p>
<p>mortality and morbidity, noting in this regard that the World Health Organization has assessed 
</p>
<p>that over 1,500 women and girls die every day as a result of preventable complications occurring 
</p>
<p>before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, and that, globally, maternal mortality is the 
</p>
<p>leading cause of death among women and of girls of reproductive age; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> that most instances of maternal mortality and morbidity are preventable, 
</p>
<p>and that preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is a health, development and human rights 
</p>
<p>challenge that also requires the effective promotion and protection of the<b> </b>human rights of women 
</p>
<p>and girls, in particular their rights to life, to be equal in dignity, to education, to be free to seek, 
</p>
<p>receive and impart information, to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, to freedom from 
</p>
<p>discrimination, and to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p>including sexual and reproductive health; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Requests</i> all States to renew their political commitment to eliminating preventable 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality and morbidity at the local, national, regional and international levels, and to 
</p>
<p>redouble their efforts to ensure the full and effective implementation of their human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the International Conference for </p>

 <p></p>
<p>                                                
</p>
<p>Population Development Programme of Action and their review conferences, and the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the Goals on 
</p>
<p>improving maternal health and promoting gender equality and empowering women,<b>2</b> including 
</p>
<p>through the allocation of necessary domestic resources to health systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also requests </i>States to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity 
</p>
<p>initiatives in their development partnerships and cooperation arrangements, including through 
</p>
<p>honouring existing commitments and considering new commitments, and the exchange of 
</p>
<p>effective practices and technical assistance to strengthen national capacities, as well as to 
</p>
<p>integrate a human rights perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> States and other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and non-governmental organizations, to give increased attention and resources to 
</p>
<p>preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in their engagement with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights system, including with the human rights treaty bodies, the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review and special procedures; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>prepare a thematic study on preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights, in 
</p>
<p>consultation with States, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund, 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and the World Bank, and all other relevant stakeholders, and 
</p>
<p>requests that the study include identification of the human rights dimensions of preventable 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality and morbidity in the existing international legal framework; an overview of 
</p>
<p>initiatives and activities within the United Nations system to address all causes of preventable 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality and morbidity; identification of how the Council can add value to existing 
</p>
<p>initiatives through a human rights analysis, including efforts to achieve the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goal on improving maternal health<b>3</b>, and recommended options for better 
</p>
<p> 
<b>2</b> Millennium Development Goals 5 and 3. 
</p>
<p><b>3</b> Millennium Development Goal 5. </p>

 <p>addressing the human rights dimension of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity 
</p>
<p>throughout the United Nations system; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Decides</i> to address the thematic study requested in paragraph 6 above within the 
</p>
<p>programme of work of its fourteenth session, and to consider taking further possible action on 
</p>
<p>preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights at that session, and invites the 
</p>
<p>Office of the High Commissioner, the World Health Organization, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Population Fund and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to participate in an interactive dialogue 
</p>
<p>on the study in the Council.
