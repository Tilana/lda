<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official mission to Kenya from 19 to 27 September 
2011, at the invitation of the Government of Kenya. Pursuant to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8223;s mandate, contained in Human Rights Council resolution 14/6, he sought 
</p>
<p>to examine the current situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kenya, 
including those displaced as a result of the 2007/2008 post-election violence, natural 
disasters, and development and environmental conservation projects. 
</p>
<p> He commends the Government of Kenya for the progress and important steps 
taken to date to address internal displacement, including the development of a draft 
IDP policy and draft IDP bill, and the establishment of an institutional focal point on 
internal displacement. The Government has also facilitated the return and 
resettlement of many IDPs affected by the 2007/2008 post-election violence, which 
resulted in the internal displacement of nearly 664,000 persons, and has maintained 
constructive cooperation with the United Nations.

<p> The Special Rapporteur noted key remaining challenges, including the lack of 
a policy and legislative framework, of comprehensive, efficient and disaggregated 
data-collection systems, and of sufficient operational and institutional capacity. He 
highlights an urgent humanitarian need to address the dire living conditions and 
human rights of many persons who remain currently displaced, and the need for a 
broader and more participatory approach to durable solutions. He encourages the 
Government of Kenya, with the support of the international community and civil 
society, to take the necessary measures to address the above concerns, to ratify the 
African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced 
Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention), and to adopt the draft policy and draft bill 
on IDPs, which will provide a solid framework with which the country can prevent, 
manage and find durable solutions to internal displacement situations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate, contained in Human Rights Council resolution 
14/6, and at the invitation of the Government of Kenya, the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official visit to 
Kenya from 19 to 27 September 2011. The Special Rapporteur undertook this visit in order 
to examine the current situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kenya, including 
those displaced as a result of the 2007/2008 post-election violence, natural disasters, and 
development and environmental conservation projects. The Special Rapporteur&#8223;s 
conclusions and recommendations are based on his findings during his visit, and on the 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>2. In the course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Justice, 
National Cohesion and Constitutional Affairs, Mr. Mutula Kilonzo; the Minister of State 
for Special Programmes, Ms. Esther Murugi Mathenge; the Attorney General, Mr. Githu 
Muigai; staff of the Office of the President and of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Regional 
Commissioners; and members of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Internally 
Displaced Persons. He also met with the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights 
(KNCHR), members of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, civil society 
organizations, United Nations agencies, and local officials in the field locations he visited. 
In addition to Nairobi, the Special Rapporteur visited various sites of displacement, 
including internal displacement camps, and areas of return and resettlement, in and around 
the region of Nakuru and Eldoret, and satellite IDP camps of evictees from the Mau Forest 
complex.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation to all his 
interlocutors, and, in particular, the Government of Kenya for its invitation and constructive 
engagement during the visit, the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator, the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which provided invaluable support in 
the preparation and coordination of the visit, as well as throughout its duration. He also 
expresses his gratitude to the United Nations Country Team, the members of the Protection 
Working Group on Internal Displacement (PWGID), and the many internally displaced 
persons he met with during his visit who shared their experiences and concerns with him. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political and socio-economic context 
</b></p>
<p>4. Kenya, which gained its independence in 1963, established itself as a Constitutional 
multiparty electoral democracy in 1991. It was dominated by a single party until 2002. In 
2007, a disputed general election led to widespread post-election violence and 
displacement, and ultimately to the establishment of a coalition Government between the 
Party of National Union (PNU) and the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). Politically 
motivated clashes, often underpinned by land and political disputes, have long been 
associated with electoral processes in the country, and a key cause of repeated 
displacements over the years. To address these issues, the Government has embarked on a 
series of constitutional, electoral and institutional reforms. A constitutional referendum was 
held on 4 August 2010, leading to the promulgation of a new national Constitution in 
August 2010, containing a comprehensive Bill of Rights.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Kenyan population is composed of diverse ethnic, racial and linguistic groups.1 
According to the 2011 human development index, Kenya is considered a low human 
development country, with a ranking of 143 out of 187 countries. The same report reveals 
that about 46 per cent of the population live below the national poverty line, and a further 
27.4 are vulnerable to poverty.2 Kenya is also considered among the 10 most unequal 
societies in the world.3 The country&#8223;s population, estimated at nearly 39 million, is young, 
with a median age of 18.5 years. The combination of widespread absolute poverty and a 
young population (over 42 per cent are children under 15 years of age), among other 
factors, means that over 82 per cent of Kenyans depend on others.4 The majority of the 
population live in rural areas, while 32 per cent live in urban settings. Approximately 80 per 
cent of the land is considered arid or semi-arid. 
</p>
<p>6. The country is significantly impacted by natural disasters and the effects of climate 
change. An average of over 27,000 per million people are affected every year by natural 
disasters, almost 36 per cent of children under 5 years of age suffer from stunting due to 
environmental factors, and 31 per cent of the population live on degraded land.5 
Temperature variations, environmental degradation, increased variability in rainfall, and 
global warming6 are all likely to represent a significant humanitarian, development and 
security challenge for the country, both domestically and in the context of region-wide 
impacts. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>7. Kenya is a State party to most core international human rights instruments.7 At the 
regional level, it has also ratified key regional human rights instruments, including the 1981 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights, and the 2006 Pact on Security, Stability 
and Development in the Great Lakes Region. Kenya participated in the Human Rights 
Council&#8223;s universal periodic review process in 2010. In that context, concerns were 
expressed with regard to, inter alia: a legacy of impunity in the country which continued to 
contribute to persistent violence and conflict; the large number of street children, their 
vulnerability to exploitation and abuse, and lack of access to education and health; and 
violations of economic and social rights and the right to an adequate standard of living in a 
context of widespread extreme poverty.8 With regard to IDPs specifically, concern was 
expressed regarding the hundreds of thousands of IDPs in Kenya who lacked access to 
basic rights and services, and who are residing in environmentally and economically 
vulnerable parts of the country. This diminishes their economic and durable-solution 
prospects and increases their vulnerability.9

<p>8. Kenya has a number of specialized institutions with a specific mandate for human 
rights. Chief among them is KNCHR, a statutory body established under an Act of 
Parliament, and in conformity with the principles relating to the status of national 
institutions for the promotion and protection of human right (Paris Principles).10 The 
Commission is vested with a broad mandate of human rights promotion and protection, 
which includes the fundamental rights and freedoms of any individual protected under the 
Constitution and any international instrument to which Kenya is signatory 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KEN/1, para. 19). KNCHR is active with regard to the human rights of 
IDPs in the country, and is a member and co-chair of the PWGID. Also of note is the 2011 
Constitutional Commission on Administrative Justice, which has a mandate to receive and 
document all complaints against public officers, and to enquire into allegations of 
incompetence, misuse of office, corruption and other unethical conduct in the public sector. 
</p>
<p>9. In addition to the above, a number of transitional justice mechanisms addressing 
human rights violations were set up in the context of the national reform agenda after the 
2007/2008 post-election violence. These include:11 the Commission of Inquiry on Post-
election Violence (Waki Commission), which had a mandate to investigate the 
circumstances surrounding the post-election violence and to make recommendations on 
measures to eradicate impunity; the National Cohesion and Integration Commission, which 
has a mandate to investigate incitement and hate speech, analyse factors inhibiting 
harmonious relations between ethnic communities and participation in the life of the 
country, and to make recommendations and initiate prosecutions; and the Truth, Justice, 
and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC),12 which seeks to address past violations since 
independence, within a broader context of building a democratic society based on the rule 
of law. During the country visit, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to meet with 
members of the TJRC, hear testimonies by IDPs, and attend hearings held in displacement-
affected communities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. History, causes and extent of internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Ethnic clashes and land-related political violence as causes of internal displacement</b>13<b> 
</b></p>
<p>10. Kenya has suffered repeated waves of internal displacement in its recent history, due 
to political, ethnic and land-related disputes, as well as to a number of other causes. Land 
policies during the colonial period entailed the dispossession of the lands of many 
indigenous communities, especially in the Rift Valley, Nyanza and the Western and Central 
provinces. During this period, an individual freehold title registration system was imposed 
which effectively legalized the dispossession of these lands, and replaced the customary 
mechanisms of land tenure. The freehold land title system was maintained after 
independence, alongside the implementation of a number of market-based resettlement 
schemes to deal with displacement. Neither of these policies and schemes questioned the 
injustice in the acquisition of the original land titles, nor compensated or assisted those who 
had been displaced and did not have the financial means to acquire lands under the market-
based resettlement schemes.

<p><b>A/HRC/19/54/Add.2

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>11. Land-related issues and ethnic tensions were further aggravated due to a number of 
factors, including corruption and ethnic politics which favoured certain communities at the 
expense of others, during successive Governments. In the context of the rise of multiparty 
politics in the 1990s, and national elections in 1992 and 1997, ethnic identity was used as a 
political instrument, which led to ethnic clashes throughout that decade, leaving thousands 
dead and hundreds of thousands internally displaced. By the end of 2007, it was estimated 
that there were still 380,000 IDPs from the clashes of the 1990s.14 
</p>
<p>12. The land grievances of communities such as the Kalenjin, Kikuyu and Maasai, 
which had originally been dispossessed by the British, later became a key feature of 
national politics, successive election platforms and related violence and displacement, as 
communities were intermittently either favoured or evicted from contested lands, depending 
on the Government in power. These unresolved ethnic and land-related grievances, as well 
as their political instrumentalization have persisted, resulting in a pattern of violence and 
displacement, most recently re-experienced in the 2007/2008 post-election violence, in 
which 1,300 persons lost their lives, and nearly 664,000 persons were internally displaced. 
The new Constitution attempts to remedy these grievances by reclassifying land into public, 
community and individual lands, establishing land redistribution mechanisms, and 
redressing historical land injustices.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other multiple causes of internal displacement  
</b></p>
<p>13. In addition to the above, there have been various other causes of internal 
displacement in Kenya over the years. Some of these displacements affect relatively few 
people and are short lived (for example, over a few days), while others are large-scale and 
prolonged. Causes of these displacements include, inter alia: resource-based conflicts 
between communities; evictions related to development or environmental conservation 
projects; insecurity; urban disasters (such as fires); and natural disasters, including due to 
the effects of climate change. 
</p>
<p>14. Some displacements are due to a complex combination of causes. It is estimated, for 
example, that over the decades, thousands of pastoralists have been forcibly displaced from 
their homes in northern Kenya due to numerous causes, including violence, cattle raiding, 
land conflicts, natural and climatic disasters, human rights violations, border issues, 
activities of militant groups and the proliferation of small arms.15 Mass evictions, both from 
forest areas and urban centres, have also displaced significant numbers of persons, often 
without housing, humanitarian assistance or durable solutions being planned beforehand. In 
June 2005, up to 50,000 persons were reported to be forcibly evicted from the Mau Forest16 
and a further 12,000 persons were evicted in the latter part of 2009. The history of 
settlement in the Mau Forest is complex, and includes the stripping of the land of residents 
during the colonial period, land allocations by subsequent Governments in the 1990s (many 
now considered illegal or inappropriate),17 irregular settlement, and repeated waves of 
forced evictions.

</p>
<p>15. In a context where the majority of urban residents in the country, such as in Nairobi, 
live in informal settlements and slums due to the unavailability of affordable housing for 
the poor, mass evictions in these areas are also likely to continue causing significant levels 
of internal displacement and homelessness. In the Nairobi area alone, where over 50 per 
cent of the city&#8223;s 3.1 million population live in these informal settlements, thousands of 
households have reportedly been forcibly evicted without humanitarian assistance or 
alternative housing solutions, including from the Mitumba, Eastleigh, Kiang&#8223;ombe, KPA 
and Embakasi slums.18 
</p>
<p><b> III. Frameworks for the assistance and protection of internally 
displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic response 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. At the time of writing of the present report, the draft Internally Displaced Persons 
Bill (draft IDP bill), recently developed under the leadership of the Parliamentary Select 
Committee, had just been reviewed for consistency with relevant instruments and standards, 
including the 2010 draft National Policy on the Prevention of Internal Displacement and the 
Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons in Kenya (draft IDP policy), and 
finalized at a meeting in Mombasa in December 2011, by all the major stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>17. The draft IDP policy, which was elaborated through a process of collaboration 
between the Ministry of State for Special Programmes (MOSSP), the Ministry of Justice, 
National Cohesion and Constitutional Affairs (hereafter, Ministry of Justice), and the 
PWGID, and unveiled in March 2010, is largely based on existing international and 
regional instruments and standards on internal displacement. The policy, which is 
comprehensive in scope, encompasses all locations, phases of internal displacement and all 
its major causes, including displacement due to natural disasters; politically instigated or 
intercommunal hostilities; and forced evictions due to development or environmental 
conservation projects (when proper relocation and sustainable reintegration are lacking).19 
Other central aspects covered by the policy, which has been pending before cabinet since 
March 2010, include: data collection on IDPs; relevant institutional frameworks, including 
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; principles applicable to the prevention of internal 
displacement, and protection from arbitrary displacement; displacements occurring both 
outside and within an emergency context; protection and assistance during displacement; 
and durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>18. The draft National Disaster Management Policy, developed in 2009 and which is 
aimed at institutionalizing disaster management and disaster risk reduction, and establishing 
coordination mechanisms, has also been pending for some time. However, this policy was 
followed by the National Disaster Response Plan, which by the end of 2010 had been 
mainstreamed into all Government ministries. The plan is in keeping with the Kenya Vision 
2030, which articulates the country&#8223;s concept of development, including the strengthening

<p>of its capacity to adapt to climate change.20 The Government of Kenya has undertaken a 
number of other initiatives intended to prevent or minimize the extent and impact of 
internal displacement. These include, inter alia: the Evictions and Resettlement Guidelines 
(2009), the draft National Policy on Human Rights (2010), and the draft National Policy on 
Peace-building and Conflict Management (2009).21 The new Kenyan Constitution, with its 
Bill of Rights, is also expected to provide protection against arbitrary displacement, and 
human rights protection at the different stages of displacement. At the regional level, Kenya 
has ratified the Great Lakes Protocol on the Protection and Assistance to Internally 
Displaced Persons, which requires member States to implement the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement, but at the time of writing the State had not yet ratified the African 
Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons 
(Kampala Convention). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. Kenya did not formally recognize or register IDPs until the 2007/2008 post-election 
violence, when it also designated MOSSP as the institutional focal point responsible for 
internal displacement, including the mitigation and resettlement of IDPs, and the 
coordination of disaster risk reduction programmes. The draft IDP policy reaffirms this 
mandate and highlights the Ministry&#8223;s policy-implementation and coordination role, 
envisages the establishment of a new national consultative coordination committee on 
internal displacement, and specifically affirms the role of a number of other actors, 
including civil society, IDP representatives and KNCHR.22 
</p>
<p>20. Currently, MOSSP works closely with the Ministry of Lands, in the framework of 
the Inter-Ministerial Committee on IDPs, for the identification and purchase of land for the 
resettlement of IDPs; the Ministry of Finance, which makes the budgetary allocation for the 
purchase of the land; and the Ministry of State for Provincial Administration and Internal 
Security, which implements resettlement programme activities at the local level.23 Within 
MOSSP, the Department of Mitigation and Resettlement is responsible for the assistance 
and resettlement of IDPs following the 2007/2008 post-election violence and the 
implementation of the National Humanitarian Fund for Mitigation of Effects and 
Resettlement of Victims of Post 2007 Election Violence (hereafter, National Humanitarian 
Fund), set up in 2008 in order to support the resettlement of IDPs, and related livelihood 
and other programmes.24 MOSSP has set up regional offices in Central Province and in the 
north and south of the Rift Valley Province, where District Commissioners are responsible 
for coordinating IDP protection and assistance needs at their respective levels with relevant 
Regional Commissioners, who co-chair the Nakuru and Eldoret PWGID meetings. 
</p>
<p>21. MOSSP further works to address potential displacement related to natural disasters, 
and implements disaster relief and rehabilitation programmes, through the distribution of 
food and emergency shelter. While mainstreaming activities relating to disaster risk 
reduction have taken place, at the time of writing, the Ministry had only two staff dedicated 
to this field. Other key actors responsible for responding to natural disasters include the 
Kenya Red Cross Society, the Crisis Response Centre and the Interim Coordinating

<p>Secretariat within the Office of the Prime Minister, which also responds to forest 
evictions.25 
</p>
<p>22. The national PWGID brings together the key stakeholders working in the area of 
IDPs, including the Government, civil society, United Nations agencies and IDP networks, 
with the objective of enhancing the capacity of the Government and its overall response to 
internal displacement in the country. It is co-chaired by the Ministry of Justice and 
KNCHR. Beyond co-chairing the PWGID, KNCHR has maintained a strong focus on the 
human rights of IDPs in the country since becoming operational in 2003. It has established 
regional offices and field monitors; investigates allegations of human rights violations 
against IDPs; advocates on their behalf; monitors the situation of IDP camps, areas of 
returns and other sites through visits; and investigated Government management of the IDP 
Humanitarian Fund in 2009, when it found evidence of embezzlement.26 
</p>
<p>23. More recently, the Kenyan Parliament set up the Parliamentary Select Committee on 
Internally Displaced Persons, with a broad mandate to look into existing institutions, 
policies, laws and programmes relating to IDPs, the main causes of internal displacement, 
and an estimate on the number of IDPs; and to make comprehensive recommendations to 
address internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>24. According to official figures, the Government has spent, inter alia: over 4 billion 
Kenya shillings on the IDP resettlement program; K Sh 377 million in the repair of IDP 
houses and infrastructure; and approximately K Sh 1.3 billion on relief food for IDPs 
during the financial years 2008-2011.27 
</p>
<p><b> B. International response 
</b></p>
<p>25. The response of the international community to internal displacement in Kenya has 
included a comprehensive range of activities, such as contributing to the monitoring of the 
peace process which stopped the last post-election violence, and current community 
peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts at the national and provincial levels. Through the 
Kenyan Red Cross Society and other operational partner organizations, and with the 
coordination of MOSSP, the United Nations and international non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) provided emergency assistance (for example shelter, water, 
education and sanitation facilities),28 and contributed to durable solutions through funding 
and expertise, including to the IDP resettlement programme, to which the African 
Development Bank also provided funding.29 
</p>
<p>26. International expertise and other types of support have also aimed to strengthen the 
capacity of the Government of Kenya to respond to internal displacement and its root 
causes. These included: a United Nations cluster system (which later become the PWGID) 
set up in January 2008 to support the Government in addressing internal displacement 
during the post-electoral emergency phase; collaboration in 2008 between the Government 
and UNHCR on a profiling exercise to determine the number of IDPs; collaboration with 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and OCHA on disaster management 
and early recovery; and the participation of international experts in a number of relevant

<p><b> IV. Protection of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection from forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>27. In addition to the initiatives discussed above in section III, the Government of 
Kenya, with the support of the international community, has taken a number of other 
significant measures to prevent future forced displacement, in particular due to political, 
ethnic and electoral violence. The National Dialogue and Reconciliation Accord, which 
ended the 2007 post-election violence, identified four action areas to address the causes of 
the crisis, reconcile affected communities, and prevent such conflicts in the future. Some of 
these areas specifically refer to issues related to internal displacement, such as agenda 2, 
which articulates the need to address the humanitarian crisis and promote reconciliation and 
reconstruction, and agenda 4, which relates to the root causes of the violence which induced 
internal displacement, such as land, poverty and inequality.31 A subsequent impact 
assessment of the Accord, undertaken in October 2009, highlighted priority actions for 
avoiding future violence and displacement, including the adoption of a new constitution; 
judicial and police reforms; and a transparent electoral process.32 
</p>
<p>28. Efforts to implement such actions and the Accord have included legislation 
criminalizing hate speech and imposing penalties for the mobilization of violence (2008); 
the setting up of the National Cohesion and Integration Commission in 2009, the 
institutional body responsible for operationalizing the above legislation and monitoring 
relevant activities; the establishment of the TJRC, described above; and the adoption of the 
new Constitution in 2010. Other initiatives aimed at preventing and mitigating the impact 
of internal displacement have included the establishment of early warning and response 
mechanisms to deal with conflict and natural disasters.33 One such mechanism is the 
national chapter of the Conflict Early Warning and Early Response Network (CEWARN), 
coordinated by the National Steering Committee on Peace-Building and Conflict 
Management and a network of District Peace Committees, which bring together 
representatives from the Government, civil society, the United Nations and other actors.34 
Joint conflict-mapping initiatives by the Government, civil society and the United Nations 
have also taken place. Considered particularly successful, one such joint initiative deployed 
field monitors across the country in order to identify warning signs (for example, forced 
movements, sexual and gender-based violence, destruction of property) and set up 
coordination centres in &#8220;hot spots&#8221; to respond to incidents of violence in advance of the 
2010 referendum on the Constitution. 35 In anticipation of the 2012 national elections, the 
commissioners of an enhanced and reformed Independent Electoral and Boundaries 
Commission were sworn in on 14 November 2011. 
</p>
<p>29. While these constitute considerable achievements, many of the root causes of 
internal displacement have persisted. As of May 2010, and according to an audit of the 
reform agenda and assessments by civil society, many of the intended objectives of the

<p>Accord had not been achieved, including addressing the long-standing grievances related to 
land and historical injustices.36 With regard to the much-awaited land reforms, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that these should, among other things, ensure the integration of and a 
cohesive approach to related internal displacement issues. He also believes that more 
information and attention is necessary with regard to incidents of sexual and gender-based 
violence in the context of the 2007/2008 post-election violence and other displacement 
situations, including with a view to prevention. 
</p>
<p>30. Moreover, significant internal displacements have taken place despite the above 
initiatives, including due to inter-ethnic clashes, conflicts over land, and State-led 
disarmament programmes related to pastoralist communities, such as the 2009 Government 
disarmament operations which led to several deaths and the displacement of hundreds of 
people from a number of communities, and a similar operation in the Mount Elgon region 
in 2008, which also resulted in the displacement of thousands of persons.37 As detailed 
elsewhere in the present report, displacements have also taken place as a result of 
development and environmental conservation projects, with evictions often being 
conducted without effective redress and compensation mechanisms for affected 
communities and without sufficient assistance or alternative durable solutions in place. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection during displacement 
</b></p>
<p>31. Based on his country visit and on his field visits to sites of displacement, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that the lack of a clear policy and legal framework on IDPs and 
effective response systems has resulted in ad hoc approaches and uneven assistance and 
protection. This has been exacerbated by the different categorization of IDPs, namely IDPs 
affected by the 2007/2008 post-election violence who were profiled or registered in the 
national database (which has been restricted to the 6,800 households identified from the 
2007/2008 post-election violence and formally recognized by MOSSP based on the data 
collected as of 31 December 2008), and all other IDPs who fall outside this category and 
are not formally recognized. With regard to registered post-election violence IDPs, the 
Special Rapporteur found that the protection and assistance extended to them has largely 
been inadequate, including due to the lack of sufficient or nutritious food, access to 
adequate shelter, water and sanitation facilities, and other services such as education and 
health care. In relation to the second category, he found that the large number of IDPs who 
are neither registered nor recognized have either been entirely excluded from any assistance 
and protection programmes or have received only sporadic emergency assistance, such as 
food relief. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Registered internally displaced persons and those assisted as part of Operation 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;<b>Return Home</b>&#8221;<b>  
</b></p>
<p>32. According to Government figures, the 2007/2008 post-election violence resulted in 
the internal displacement of nearly 664,000 persons, 314,000 of whom sought refuge with 
host communities and were considered &#8220;integrated&#8221;, while the rest sought safety in 118 
camps. In the immediate aftermath of the post-election violence, the Government of Kenya, 
with the support of the international community, provided emergency assistance to 
displacement-affected communities in the form of food and non-food assistance, emergency 
tents, water, sanitation, protection and health-care services. It also provided the 350,000 
IDPs who left the camps and returned home as part of the Operation Rudi Nyumbani (or

<p>&#8220;Return Home&#8221;) with assistance during the transition period and until they could re-
establish themselves on their farms.38 
</p>
<p>33. However, at the time of the visit, 4,885 households registered in the national IDP 
database (out of the initial 6,800), were still living in camps.39 The majority were small-
scale business people from areas such as the Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Eldoret counties, 
who were not included in Operation Return Home, which had been aimed primarily at the 
prompt return of farmers in May 2008. According to the Status Report of MOSSP, dated 
June 2011, there were also 6,978 households who did not own land previously but who 
organized themselves into self-help groups (registered with the Ministry of Gender, 
Children and Social Development) and purchased parcels of land by regrouping the 
individual cash payments received from the Government (K sh 10,000 as start-up capital). 
These households settled in 20 tented camps. A further group of 2,593 IDP households who 
returned to Turkana County after having been displaced from various parts of the Rift 
Valley Province are awaiting resettlement to 1,400 acres (567 ha) of land allocated by the 
Turkana County Council and Lodwar Municipal Council, and another group of 158 
households, still living in eight transit camps, are awaiting the identification of land for 
resettlement by the Government.40 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit the Mawingu and Pipeline IDP 
camps in the Central Province and Rift Valley Province, respectively. The Mawingu camp 
is the largest of the self-help IDP camps, with an estimated population of 2,000 households 
(12,000 persons). The IDPs purchased 160 acres (65 ha) of land by pooling the individual 
ex gratia Government payments of K sh 10,000. However, because the portion of land was 
deemed unsustainable for the IDP population (originally 3,308 households), the 
Government plans to resettle the remaining households. A number of issues touching on 
food and non-food assistance, shelter, health, sanitation, lack of access to education, and 
camp management were of concern to the IDPs in the camp. The distribution of food 
assistance, consisting primarily of maize and cooking oil, was reportedly irregular and the 
amounts insufficient, and was a source of tension in the camp due to allegations (under 
court proceedings) by some IDPs that the camp leader had been diverting IDP food 
supplies. 
</p>
<p>35. In the focus groups with IDP women, the lack of attention to the nutritional needs of 
special groups was highlighted, including the lack of supplementary food assistance to 
lactating mothers, persons taking HIV anti-retroviral drugs (estimated at 250 persons), and 
the absence of any infant-feeding programmes. Also mentioned was the lack of adequate 
access to health facilities, and primary education for the children, many of whom reportedly 
were out of school or could not attend regularly due to hunger and the lack of money to pay 
for school fees.41 IDPs, many of whom reported to be suffering from respiratory diseases, 
such as asthma and pneumonia, were living in generally deplorable conditions in small, 
worn-out tents which left them exposed to the elements and provided insufficient levels of 
privacy. In addition to addressing these concerns, the Special Rapporteur also believes that 
it is necessary to put in place an oversight system in order to ensure the proper management 
of assistance by camp leaders, and to ensure that IDPs who have invested their ex gratia

 41 While primary school is in principal free in Kenya, the lack of sufficient teachers and supplies in

</p>
<p>funds into the purchase of the common parcel of land do not lose these funds and/or their 
share in the land when they are finally resettled. 
</p>
<p>36. During his visit to the Pipeline IDP camp, which had a total population of 916 
households (approximately 6,000 persons), the Special Rapporteur found IDPs living in 
similarly deplorable, emergency-like conditions four years on, including: leaking tents; 
latrines which were full and reported to overflow when it rained; irregular food assistance; 
lack of access to primary education for most children; and serious health concerns. Some 
IDPs in the camp reported being repeatedly displaced since 1992. The visit of the Special 
Rapporteur to the camp coincided with community meetings in the camp by the TJRC, 
which he was invited to attend. During these meetings, concerns were raised regarding the 
health of camp residents, including those with HIV/AIDS, respiratory and other diseases 
resulting from the harsh living conditions, which, according to the IDPs, have led to early 
deaths, including of young children. It was also reported that many IDPs in the camp who 
had been injured in the 2007/2008 post-election violence had not received any or adequate 
treatment, and most still suffered from psychological trauma. 
</p>
<p>37. Some IDPs also raised concerns regarding the lengthy process of resettlement, and 
the discrepancies between the local IDP databases and the central database system 
maintained by MOSSP, which resulted in the names of many &#8220;bona fide&#8221; IDPs being left 
out of the resettlement programme. Without proper verification, this group will be 
considered by MOSSP as &#8220;fake&#8221; IDPs. The camp had a large number of widowed women, 
which exacerbated livelihood issues, and many residents had lost personal identification 
documents during the displacement. In the cases of both the Mawingu and the Pipeline 
camps, the IDPs did not consider return to their places of origin to be a viable durable 
solution due to the trauma and violence they had suffered. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-registered internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Post-election violence IDPs 
</i></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by the de facto exclusion of various groups of 
post-election violence IDPs from any assistance, protection or durable solutions. These 
include post-election violence IDPs who did not register by the cut-off date, those whose 
registration was rejected by the national database due to discrepancies with registration 
systems at the local level, and the estimated 314,000 &#8220;integrated&#8221; IDPs who were not 
profiled or registered and sought refuge in host communities. Although little information is 
available regarding the situation of integrated IDPs, a large percentage are believed to have 
sought safety within host communities, with friends or relatives or to have rented their own 
accommodation in urban areas,42 including Nairobi. The Special Rapporteur has received 
reports that more recently some have been forming into groups and coming forward to ask 
for assistance and durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>39. Moreover, he believes that the lack of government assistance, protection or 
monitoring of the situations of these IDPs, particularly vulnerable groups, such as children 
and female-headed households, has resulted in serious human rights concerns and the lack 
of durable solutions for many. In the course of his country visit, the Special Rapporteur 
received reports and had the opportunity to speak to street children and affected families, 
whose cases illustrate specific vulnerabilities, the lack of durable solutions and the fragility 
of unsupported hosting arrangements. In one case, the Special Rapporteur interviewed a 
mother taking care of several children on her own, who had found herself destitute and

<p>living in makeshift housing in Eldoret after family hosting arrangements, which had 
supported her during her displacement, had broken down. Four of the children with her, 
some as young as 5 years of age, had to resort to living on the street due to hunger, and 
some lacked any personal identification documents. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur has also received more general reports of an increase in the 
number of separated and unaccompanied children, child-headed households, and children 
connected to the street, many of whom are believed to be IDPs, in a number of towns and 
cities in the aftermath of the post-election violence, including in Molo, Kitale, Naivasha, 
Nakuru and Eldoret. In this regard, he was pleased to learn that a street-children profiling 
project was undertaken in the Rift Valley Province (under the auspices of the national 
PWGID and its child protection subgroups) in order to identify why children were joining 
the streets, assess their situation, find durable solutions, and enhance emergency 
preparedness for vulnerable children ahead of the 2012 elections.43 Findings from the 
project, as of December 2011, found that 37 per cent of children profiled were IDPs, and 
that of those, 44 per cent had lost livelihoods, and 97 per cent had dropped out of school. It 
was also found that of those who entered street life more recently in 2011, 23 per cent cited 
the drought as the push factor.44  
</p>
<p>41. According to information provided to the Special Rapporteur, the experience of the 
2007/2008 post-election violence revealed important gaps with regard to protection 
mechanisms for internally displaced children, including the lack of a viable system for the 
identification, registration and tracing of separated children in Kenya. This led to serious 
concerns in the context of the post-election violence, including with regard to: child-headed 
households, such as in Molo in 2008, where children as young as 7 years of age were left 
caring for younger siblings, and exposed to serious protection risks (including survival sex); 
and children placed in Charitable Children&#8223;s Institutions (CCIs) across the country, either 
because they had become separated or because the parents felt unable to secure their safety 
or provide for them after being displaced. In the case of the latter, children were often 
handed over to CCI recruiters, with little or no information and procedures, raising 
concerns about possible criminal intent. Also of concern, was that most of these CCIs were 
unregistered institutions,45 and did not keep accurate records of parents and guardians, 
making family tracing/reunification difficult. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that 
since 2008, the Government, in collaboration with a number of partners, including the 
United Nations Children&#8223;s Fund (UNICEF), has begun to establish mechanisms relevant to 
separated children, including the national Inter-Agency Database on Separated Children, 
and that by August 2009, a total of 5,769 children out of 7,010 had been reunified with their 
families.46 However, he urges the Government, with the support of other stakeholders, to 
address reports from recent protection assessments in drought-affected areas, such as 
Turkana and the North Eastern Province, revealing similar child protection problems, and 
to put in place child-protection preparedness plans ahead of the 2012 national elections. 
</p>
<p>42. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with IDPs who had experienced 
unassisted and sometimes multiple and secondary displacements, including since the 1990s. 
</p>
<p>In this respect he underlines the compounded vulnerabilities that have affected these IDPs, 
and in particular vulnerable groups, and the need to address their remaining protection, 
assistance and durable-solution needs.

</p>
<p><i> (b) Other categories of non-identified/non-registered IDPs  
</i></p>
<p>43. Other categories of IDPs who have been displaced over the years due to a variety of 
causes (including natural disasters, conflicts over resources, inter-clan/communal conflicts, 
and forced evictions due to development and environmental conservation projects) have not 
been eligible for registration in the IDP database, nor been acknowledged as IDPs in most 
cases, and received either limited (food aid, for example) or no assistance. While internal 
displacements due to factors such as natural disasters have traditionally been for short 
periods, their increased frequency and severity, including due to climate change, point to 
more chronic situations likely to involve new, more prolonged or definitive displacements &#8211; 
and requiring more comprehensive displacement responses. 
</p>
<p>44. The figures are telling. For example, while an estimated 16,000 persons were 
affected by drought and required food aid in 1975, this figure reached 4.4 million during 
1999-2001, and an estimated 3.5 million during 2004-2006.47 In 2011, a combination of 
drought-induced crop failure, poor livestock conditions, rising food prices and eroded 
coping capacities led to a food crisis, rendering 3.75 million people in Kenya food insecure, 
and to the worst malnutrition records in a decade.48 In 2010, an inter-agency mission to 
Maasai areas found displacement patterns induced by climate change.49 Increasingly severe 
and more frequent droughts, affecting in particular northern pastoralist communities, have 
eroded traditional livelihood strategies, made such communities increasingly dependent on 
aid, resulted in conflicts with other communities over resources and encroachment on lands, 
and forced many to search for new forms of livelihoods, including in urban areas.50 
However, there has been a tendency in Kenya to consider that these groups are not 
displaced, since they are by definition mobile. Moreover, increased patterns of 
encroachment on lands (in search of increasingly scarce water and pasture) belonging to 
other communities, the commercialization of cattle rustling, and the proliferation of small 
arms, have led to more frequent and violent conflicts and State-led disarmament 
programmes, which have framed many of the issues primarily in relation to security and 
criminality.51 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur believes that strategies to respond to these increased 
vulnerabilities, potential new displacements, and current displacement trends already 
affecting pastoralist communities and others, will need to be more comprehensive and 
systematic in the future. These should include: profiling of vulnerable and affected 
communities, disaster risk reduction, prevention and mitigation of displacement, adaptation 
strategies (e.g. regarding alternative livelihoods and land use) and development policies that 
include displacement considerations. Similarly, more comprehensive and precautionary 
strategies will need to be employed to address intra-city displacement, particularly in 
Nairobi. While difficult to monitor, displacement within Nairobi, due especially to political 
and ethnic violence and forced evictions, appears to be significant. In the wake of the last 
post-election violence, many IDPs fled to the city, but there was also displacement among 
city residents themselves, who fled to an estimated 34 IDP sites in the city or stayed with 
relatives and friends.52 
</p>
<p>46. Forced evictions, primarily by Government for development projects (e.g., transport, 
slum upgrading projects, or other infrastructure development) and by private landlords,

<p>have increased significantly since 2004.53 This has more recently begun to raise concerns, 
including by the international community, about the humanitarian gap in responding to 
emergencies and displacement in urban settings, including those relating to demolitions and 
evictions. For example: no humanitarian assistance was reportedly provided to the 3,025 
households displaced following the demolition of the Mitumba slums in November 2011; 
residents of the Eastleigh slums bordering the military base were rendered homeless; and 
others displaced from the Kiang&#8223;ombe, KPA and Embakasi slums were similarly affected.54 
Given the estimated 168 informal settlements in Nairobi which house over 2 million 
people, and the rapid increase in urbanization, mostly into informal settlements due to the 
lack of adequate low-cost housing,55 the Special Rapporteur is concerned by the potential 
for increased intra-city displacements and homelessness due to forced evictions and urban 
violence, and the increased risks of tragic man-made (e.g. fires) or natural disasters in 
slum/informal settlement areas. In addition to the need to respect relevant human rights, 
internal displacement and eviction standards,56 he stresses the need for improved planning 
and preparedness by the Government in order to ensure an adequate response to the 
humanitarian impact on concerned populations and clear resettlement plans in advance of 
evictions. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by the situation of many forest evictees, 
who have been displaced due to environmental conservation projects.57 During the country 
visit, he had the opportunity to visit displacement sites of IDPs who had been evicted from 
the Mau Forest complex in the latter part of 2009, when an estimated 12,000 people were 
displaced into makeshift camps in the periphery of the forest. That population is now spread 
over seven IDP satellite camps. In one such camp, the Tiriyta camp, with a population of 
approximately 868 persons, he found that people, who are largely of the Ogiek community, 
were living in emergency-like conditions, years after having been displaced, under worn-
out tents which no longer offer any real shelter from the harsh climatic conditions, 
receiving small amounts of food aid at irregular intervals, and had no meaningful access to 
health or educational facilities. According to reports received, the conditions in the other 
Mau Forest IDP camps were very similar. Like the Tiriyta camp, most were isolated, and 
nearly inaccessible due to the lack of any adequate roads, making it extremely difficult for 
the IDPs to access services and assistance, and to effectively draw attention to their 
situation. In order to supplement food aid, women and children relied on obtaining scarce 
work in neighbouring farms. 
</p>
<p>48. Focused discussion groups with women in the camp further highlighted: the fact that 
many children could not attend school at all or on a regular basis due to hunger, the need to 
work or the inability of families to pay school fees; the dangers of collecting firewood (e.g. 
attacks by men or animals); the lack of bedding, clothing for children, and infant-feeding 
formulas (for those unable to breastfeed); maternal and infant health care; and the needs of 
vulnerable groups and the sick. There were also reports of deaths among children due to the 
very difficult life conditions, and exposure to cold and rain. The Special Rapporteur stresses 
that there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance to address these gaps, and ensure 
basic life conditions until durable solutions are identified. He further notes that, to date, the

<p>residents of the camp had received no compensation or monetary allowances. According to 
information and documents provided by some families in the camp, members of the 
community had been evicted under the British administration, and in some cases later sold 
or reinstated small plots of land by the Government of Kenya, but they had all suffered 
multiple displacements afterwards. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>49. In the aftermath of the 2007/2008 post-election violence, the Government launched 
Operation &#8220;Return Home&#8221; in May 2008, five months after the violence had slowed down, 
in order to close the camps and facilitate the return of 350,000 IDPs back to their pre-
displacement areas. The National Humanitarian Fund was established in order to support 
this process, including through funds for the logistical movements, the reconstruction of 
homes (households were entitled to K Sh 25,000, or approximately US$ 350), and the 
replacement of basic household and farming items.58 The wider humanitarian community 
also provided assistance in the form of, inter alia: non-food items, food assistance, and 
support to re-establish basic services, such as schools, and the reconstruction of homes in 
return areas. The programme targeted mostly farmers who owned land they could return to, 
with a view to effect returns in time for the sowing of the next harvest. 
</p>
<p>50. Other programmes initiated by the Government (with the support of the international 
community) to facilitate durable solutions included various initiatives to promote 
reconciliation and the peaceful reintegration of returnees; programmes providing assistance 
with housing and livelihoods to returning farmers; and the establishment of new police 
stations and increased patrols in affected areas. As of February 2011, MOSSP, with the 
support of the African Development Bank, was still running a four-year project to 
reconstruct houses in return areas and provide fertilizers and farm inputs to returnees, and a 
project with UNDP on sustainable livelihoods in violence-affected regions.59 
</p>
<p>51. Despite these initiatives, a significant number of IDPs remained in IDP camps, in 
transit camps, and in camp-like self-help groups at the time of the visit. They included 
groups who feared return for security reasons, those who had no land to return to, such as 
artisans and small-scale business people, squatters, farmers who had been renting land, and 
others who could not effectively take part in the 2008 Operation Return Home, which was 
directed primarily at land-owning farmers. This, as well as other factors, sparked 
controversy with regard to Operation Return Home, including criticisms that it favoured 
land-owning IDPs; that undue pressure and incentives were employed to move IDPs out of 
camps and to return, raising questions about the voluntariness of returns; and that the 
operation should have been complemented early on with confidence- and peacebuilding 
activities in areas of return. There were also allegations regarding the misappropriation of 
funds from the National Humanitarian Fund.60 
</p>
<p>52. In the course of the country visit, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit 
a number of sites of return and resettlement, including Burnt Forest returnee farms in the 
Lelmolok, Lorian, Ndugulu and Muchorwe areas, and the Giwa resettlement farm. In 
returnee farms he found that there was often a lack of basic services, such as sanitation 
facilities, access to water and health facilities; infrastructure such as roads; assistance with 
livelihoods; and sustained psychosocial services. The lack of teachers, many of whom left

<p>the area after the violence, and the inability of families to pay for school fees, were noted in 
various returnee communities, as well as the situation of vulnerable groups, including 
significant numbers of widows, who lacked livelihoods and the ability to support their 
children. 
</p>
<p>53. In some locations, discussions with affected communities revealed a perception by 
some that reintegration assistance should assist both host communities and IDPs, that non-
farmer IDPs were not assisted despite being poorer, and that important gaps in the profiling 
and reconstruction process for returnees meant that many had not received assistance to 
reconstruct their homes. Problems related to the latter were reportedly often due to the fact 
that when the reconstruction of housing was being planned, receiving families needed to be 
on site at the location in order to undergo a verification exercise (often undertaken by the 
construction agencies) as a condition for qualifying for house reconstruction. Potential 
beneficiaries who were away at the time of verification were thus ineligible for the housing 
reconstruction, and were still living in tents at the time of the visit. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur noted with satisfaction the community peacebuilding and 
reconciliation activities being undertaken at the national and provincial administration 
levels, and encouraged both the Government and civil society to continue supporting these 
programmes, many of which may be at risk of being cut due to insufficient funding, but 
which are critical to the sustainability of durable solutions and the prevention of future 
internal displacement. 
</p>
<p>55. With regard to resettlement activities, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by 
reports regarding the lack of information and meaningful consultation processes undertaken 
with IDPs and host communities in advance of the actual resettlement. He notes that in 
many cases, land was reportedly purchased by the Government without any prior 
consultations with IDP communities, and that in most instances these had not been afforded 
the possibility to see the site of resettlement, to ensure its viability and security or to 
become acquainted with the host community, in advance of being moved. He further 
highlights that a process of consultation and sensitization of host communities is also 
essential to ensure sustainable solutions and promote a community-based approach. At the 
Giwa resettlement farm (one of the first sites of IDP resettlement), he found that there was a 
lack of any sanitation facilities, but was pleased to note that IDPs had access to fertilizers 
and seeds, had most of their houses reconstructed, in addition to a primary school, and had 
not been subject to any tensions with the host community.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> Kenya has experienced repeated waves of internal displacement in its recent 
history due to political, ethnic and land-related disputes, as well as a number of other 
</b></p>
<p><b>causes. Addressing the root causes provoking many of these displacements is essential 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the prevention of forced displacement in the future, including the repeated post-
</b></p>
<p><b>election violence displacement episodes that have impacted the country in the last two 
</b></p>
<p><b>decades. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that under the agenda 4 reforms, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government is putting in place frameworks, mechanisms and institutions to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address the root causes of displacement in the country. However, the Kenyan 
</b></p>
<p><b>population is also affected by multiple other factors likely to exacerbate internal 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacements, including, inter alia: more severe and frequent natural disasters, both 
</b></p>
<p><b>sudden and slow onset, due to the effects of climate change and other factors; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>environmental conservation and development projects; land and resource-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflicts; and forced evictions, especially in urban areas. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> Moreover, pre-existing conditions, such as the high percentage of persons living 
below the poverty line, poor access to rights and services, and important challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>related to governance, render populations less resilient and more vulnerable to 
</b></p>
<p><b>internal displacement. The situation of many IDPs currently displaced has revealed 
</b></p>
<p><b>these vulnerabilities, important gaps in data collection and institutional responses, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>an urgent humanitarian need to address their dire living conditions and human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Some of dynamics of internal displacement in the country have also pointed to a risk 
</b></p>
<p><b>of multiple and secondary displacements. While the Government of Kenya, with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>support of the international community and civil society, has taken significant steps to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address internal displacement, the magnitude and variety of internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges in the country underline the need for a more concerted, effective and 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive response, with a view to resolving current displacement situations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventing and managing future ones. 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> In view of the above, the Special Rapporteur makes the following 
recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations to the Government of Kenya 
</b></p>
<p><b><i> (a) A comprehensive national strategy 
</i></b></p>
<p>59. <b>Develop a comprehensive national strategy on internal displacement based on a 
four-pronged programme and a human rights-based approach, supported by 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient financial allocations, which includes: the adoption of a policy and legislative 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework, consistent with international and regional standards; capacity-building, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in technical aspects such as registration, data collection, and assistance and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection-programme management; prevention and mitigation of internal 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement; and durable solutions. </b></p>
<p><b><i> (b) IDP legislative, policy and institutional frameworks 
</i></b></p>
<p>60. <b>Adopt the draft national IDP policy and the draft IDP bill, and ratify the 
Kampala Convention at the earliest opportunity. In this regard, ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing legislation is in place, as well as relevant protocols and guidelines. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>line with the above, strengthen national institutional frameworks and coordination 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms, including through, inter alia: the allocation of sufficient financial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human resources; capacity-building; strengthening participatory mechanisms for 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement-affected communities; and maintaining inter-agency mechanisms such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as the Protection Working Group on Internal Displacement (PWGID). Adopt a 
</b></p>
<p><b>national disaster management policy (currently in draft form) and strengthen relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional and coordination mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p><b><i> (c) Data collection 
</i></b></p>
<p>61. <b>In cooperation with the international community and civil society:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Develop accurate, efficient and disaggregated data-collection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>database/registration systems which are comprehensive and inclusive of all categories 
</b></p>
<p><b>of IDPs. Data-collection systems must be timely, adapted to the context, and aim to 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitate assistance, protection and durable solutions;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In relation to IDPs currently displaced but not included in the present 
</b></p>
<p><b>registration/database system, undertake at the earliest opportunity a comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>data-collection exercise (including data on IDPs uprooted due to post-election 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, natural disasters, and development or environmental conservation projects), 
</b></p>
<p><b>with a view to considering how best to identify, assess and respond to their assistance, 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection and durable-solution needs, with particular attention to vulnerable groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b>With regard to post-election violence IDPs in particular, include in this exercise: 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable groups, persons who registered locally but were not accepted in the central 
</b></p>
<p><b>data bank, those unable to register before the cut-off date, and those referred to as 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;<b>integrated IDPs</b>&#8221;<b>.  
</b></p>
<p><b><i> (d) Address urgent humanitarian needs of current IDPs in camp-like and other settings  
</i></b></p>
<p>62. <b>Review and address on an urgent basis the assistance and protection needs of 
persons currently displaced, with a view to ensuring their immediate humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs and human rights, until durable solutions are identified. Many IDPs who have 
</b></p>
<p><b>been displaced for years and have been receiving inadequate assistance, including in 
</b></p>
<p><b>camp-like settings, are living in deplorable conditions likely to have a detrimental 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on their health and general welfare unless their living conditions are 
</b></p>
<p><b>improved. In particular, assess and respond to the urgent needs of vulnerable groups, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including children, many of whom are too exposed to the elements, at risk of 
</b></p>
<p><b>malnutrition, suffer from a variety of diseases, and have little or no access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education. Where IDPs live in remote or difficult-to-access areas, mechanisms should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be put in place to ensure regular monitoring and response to their humanitarian 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation, and their access to information and participatory processes. A similar 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercise to address the urgent humanitarian needs should also be established for IDPs 
</b></p>
<p><b>outside camp settings, including for post-election violence IDPs and other IDPs in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly vulnerable position, such as separated or unaccompanied children and 
</b></p>
<p><b>child-headed households. </b> 
</p>
<p><b><i> (e) Durable solutions  
</i></b></p>
<p>63. <b>Adopt a broader, more flexible approach to durable solutions comprised of 
resettlement, return and local integration, and which includes but is not limited to 
</b></p>
<p><b>land-based solutions, with a greater emphasis on livelihoods, documentation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to basic services. Ensure that the choice of durable solutions by IDPs is 
</b></p>
<p><b>informed, voluntary and safe; that they are provided with a meaningful opportunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>for consultation and the opportunity to visit sites of return or potential resettlement 
</b></p>
<p><b>before making a decision; and that a process of consultation and sensitization with 
</b></p>
<p><b>host or return communities is undertaken in order to ensure sustainable durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions and a community-based approach.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Strengthen community peacebuilding and reconciliation activities at the 
national and local levels, with an emphasis on sites of return and resettlement for 
</b></p>
<p><b>post-election-violence IDPs. These activities continue to be critical to sustainable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions and the prevention of future internal displacement. In sites of return and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resettlement, address the lack of basic services, such as sanitation facilities. Review 
</b></p>
<p><b>and address cases of uneven application of compensation, housing and land allocation 
</b></p>
<p><b>to post-election-violence IDPs, and identify potential beneficiaries who may have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>excluded for various reasons.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>With regard to unregistered IDPs, and with the support of the international 
community and civil society: undertake, on a non-discriminatory basis, programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>to facilitate durable solutions for IDPs, many of whom have been displaced for several 
</b></p>
<p><b>years, such as forest evictees; take into consideration the claims of IDPs with a </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/54/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>particular attachment to their land and area of origin; and assist non-registered post-
</b></p>
<p><b>election-violence IDPs, including </b>&#8220;<b>integrated IDPs</b>&#8221;<b>, with outstanding durable-
</b></p>
<p><b>solution needs. Ensure that efforts in the areas of urban planning, national 
</b></p>
<p><b>development strategies and land reforms include a cohesive approach to internal 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement issues, and the rights of IDPs. With regard to the latter, consider the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment of a national land commission. 
</b></p>
<p><b><i> (f) Prevention and mitigation of internal displacement  
</i></b></p>
<p>66. <b>In addition to peacebuilding and reconciliation activities, continue supporting 
and strengthening other mechanisms, such as the National Cohesion and Integration 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission and early warning monitoring systems, and put in place contingency 
</b></p>
<p><b>plans, as part of preparedness planning in advance of the 2012 national elections.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Strengthen overall national capacity with regard to natural disasters (both 
sudden and slow onset) and the prevention and mitigation of internal displacement, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through enhanced: research; monitoring; disaster risk reduction and early 
</b></p>
<p><b>warning; operational and policy responses (for example, relating to livelihoods and 
</b></p>
<p><b>food security); and related regional and international cooperation, including in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>context of adaptation and responses to climate change.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Provide specialized support to urban planning and national or regional 
development processes, with a view to ensuring these are sensitive to the prevention 
</b></p>
<p><b>and mitigation of internal displacement and the rights of IDPs, and adopt eviction 
</b></p>
<p><b>guidelines in line with international standards.  
</b></p>
<p><b><i> (g) Vulnerable groups  
</i></b></p>
<p>69. <b>Ensure that all IDP activities and data-collection mechanisms support 
assistance to vulnerable groups, including, inter alia: particularly vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p><b>of women; IDP women more broadly, with regard to protection from discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>(for example, with respect to the right to information, participation, documentation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and all entitlements) and sexual and gender-based violence; internally displaced 
</b></p>
<p><b>children; the chronically ill; and disabled or older persons. Share Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>definitions of vulnerable groups/persons with the national and international response 
</b></p>
<p><b>community. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Recommendations to the international community 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Continue to support the Government of Kenya, through capacity-building, 
technical assistance, financial commitments, and participation in inter-agency IDP 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and processes (for example, the PWGID), with a view to: strengthening 
</b></p>
<p><b>national protection and response mechanisms on internal displacement; addressing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the immediate humanitarian and protection needs of IDPs; and promoting durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions. In close collaboration with the Government and affected populations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue to support peacebuilding and reconciliation activities, and contingency plans 
</b></p>
<p><b>ahead of the 2012 national elections. Ensure the inclusion of IDP-related issues in 
</b></p>
<p><b>development programmes of the United Nations and the international donor 
</b></p>
<p><b>community. Coordinate closely with the United Nations Resident 
</b></p>
<p><b>Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator in Kenya, regional mechanisms, the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations, and national and international organizations.
