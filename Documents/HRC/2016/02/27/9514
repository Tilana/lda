 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders, 
Hina Jilani, here presents her seventh report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council 
decision 1/102 in which the Council decided to extend exceptionally for one year the mandate 
and mandate-holders of all the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights, of the 
Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.  It follows the report she 
had submitted to the sixty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights, pursuant to 
Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2000/61 and 2003/64, which reviewed the six years of 
implementation of the mandate entrusted to her.  
</p>
<p> Chapter I of the report gives an account of the activities undertaken by the 
mandate-holder during the reporting year.  It draws the attention of Member States to 
the 372 communications that have been sent under the mandate during the past year.  More 
detailed information on these communications is contained in addendum 1 to the present report.  
This chapter also includes some reflections on the participation of defenders and defenders&#8217; 
organizations in the work of the Human Rights Council to date.  
</p>
<p> Chapter II focuses on the situation of human rights defenders working in the field of 
economic, social and cultural rights.  It gives an overview of the legal context for the activities of 
these defenders, followed by a description of the different economic, social and cultural rights 
defenders are currently working to promote.  This chapter also highlights violations against the 
rights accorded to these defenders by the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights (Declaration on Human Rights Defenders).  
</p>
<p> Chapter III focuses on human rights defenders who are at particular risk and considers 
the risks involved when defending the rights of indigenous people and minorities, lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender and intersex persons and women human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p> In chapter IV, the Special Representative outlines some recommendations to the 
United Nations, States, intergovernmental organizations, national human rights institutions, 
non-governmental organizations and defenders, on the situation of defenders working in the field 
of economic, social and cultural rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD OF REVIEW 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is presented pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 1/102 
in which the Council decided to extend exceptionally for one year the mandates and 
mandate-holders of all the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights, of the 
Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Representative would like to remind the Council of her report prepared for 
the sixty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights and presented to the Human 
Rights Council at its second session (E/CN.4/2006/95).  This report described the development 
and implementation of the mandate since its creation in 2000 in Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2000/61.  The Special Representative also brings to the attention of the Council 
addendum 5 to her sixth annual report, which contained a comprehensive country-by-country 
compilation of developments in the situation of defenders globally (E/CN.4/2006/95/Add.5).  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Communications transmitted to Governments 
</b></p>
<p>3. Since the establishment of the mandate in 2000 the Special Representative sent more 
than 1,500 communications.  Altogether, these communications dealt with the cases of more 
than 1,137 defenders and 279 organizations working to promote and protect human rights.  
During the past year the Special Representative sent 372 communications to 78 countries.  At the 
time of writing, 40 of these countries had provided her with responses to one or more of her 
communications.  All communications sent and responses received during the period covered by 
this report are included in addendum 1 to the present report (A/HRC/4/37/Add.1).  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Representative did not carry out any official country visits during the 
reporting period.  An official visit to Serbia was postponed as the dates conflicted with the 
second session of the Human Rights Council.  A proposed follow-up visit to Guatemala was also 
postponed by the Government which declared it could not receive the Special Representative 
until 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Cooperation with the United Nations system and  
intergovernmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Representative has continued throughout the reporting period to put 
emphasis on cooperation with all bodies of the United Nations and other intergovernmental 
organizations.  The Special Representative was invited to participate in conferences, round tables 
and seminars with several such organizations, on issues related to her mandate.  She would 
particularly like to mention that she established contact with the Secretary of the newly 
established Peacebuilding Commission in order to draw attention to the role of human rights 
defenders in building and sustaining peace as outlined in the report she submitted to the 
General Assembly at its sixtieth session (A/60/339 and Corr.1).  She hopes that a recognition and 
understanding of this role will lead to better utilization of the tremendous potential of the work 
of human rights defenders in the peace-building initiatives of the United Nations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Cooperation with non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Representative has continued her interaction with civil society at the 
international, national and local levels.  The Special Representative regrets that due to time 
constraints she was not able to participate in all conferences and seminars to which she was 
invited.  On occasions where the Special Representative could not be present she tried, as far as 
possible, to have one of her staff represent her.  These occasions have marked the progress in the 
building and strengthening of defenders&#8217; networks and in developing better understanding of the 
Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to 
Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights (hereafter &#8220;the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders&#8221;) for its effective implementation and a better protection of all human 
rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>7. During the reporting year, the Special Representative participated in numerous events 
organized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including the World Social Forum in 
Karachi, Pakistan, the Carter Center Conference in Atlanta, United States of America, the 
World Forum of Human Rights in Nantes, France, the First International Conference on lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender human rights in Montreal, Canada, and the 2nd Human Rights 
Defenders&#8217; Forum in Asia, held in Bangkok.  
</p>
<p><b>E. Non-governmental organizations&#8217; participation in  
the work of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>8. In relation to the participation of NGOs in the work of the Human Rights Council, the 
Special Representative would like to remind States about the provisions of the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders, and, in particular, of article 1, which provides that &#8220;(e)veryone has the 
right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels&#8221;, 
and article 5, which provides that &#8220;(f)or the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at 
the national and international levels:  (a) to meet or assemble peacefully:  (b) to form, join and 
participate in NGOs, associations or groups; (c) to communicate with non-governmental or 
intergovernmental organizations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>9. Most NGOs have relayed to the Special Representative their appreciation of the work of 
the NGO liaison office at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) and many have welcomed the practise of &#8220;interactive dialogues&#8221; with the 
special procedures after the presentation of their reports to the Human Rights Council.  
Nevertheless many NGOs have found that their ability to contribute to the deliberations of the 
Council are affected by a lack of predictability in time and modalities of the debates in the 
sessions of the Council (such as agenda items, time frames of debates, speaking time for 
delegates, etc.).  They believe that, in the absence of a more suitable distribution of items on the 
agenda, the benefits of the multiple sessions of the Council could be lost, if NGOs are unable to 
travel more frequently to Geneva because of financial or other constraints.  It is also crucial to 
retain the opportunity for interaction between non-governmental actors, including human rights 
defenders, provided by the gathering at the sessions of the former Commission on Human 
Rights.  This issue is of particular concern for NGOs from the South and for several other NGOs 
that do not have a Geneva office.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>10. NGOs need to be reassured that civil society participation in the work of the Human 
Rights Council will remain vital and be broadened.  The Special Representative urges the 
Council to give due attention to these issues and to allay any concerns of the civil society 
stakeholders whose importance and relevance to the functions of the Council cannot be 
underestimated. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>11. On the invitation of the Office of the High Commissioner in Cambodia, the Special 
Representative visited Cambodia from 9-12 December to mark Human Rights Day.  She 
participated on a panel discussion on Human Rights and Poverty organized by the Cambodian 
Human Rights Committee, a coalition of over 20 human rights organizations and was a keynote 
speaker at an all-day event in the Olympic stadium of Phnom Penh where over 9,000 participants 
were present.  The event was organized by some 30 NGOs.  
</p>
<p><b>II. THE WORK OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS IN THE FIELD  
OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Representative has observed that in a significant number of cases brought to 
her attention, denial of economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) has spurred action by 
defenders, that has led to the violation of their human rights.  While this reality is more marked 
in the Asian and the Latin American regions, it is a global trend that has become relevant to any 
discussion on strategies for the protection of defenders.  By focusing this report on the situation 
of human rights defenders working in the field of ESCR, the Special Representative wishes to 
emphasize that not only are the rights that these defenders seek to promote inalienable to the 
international human rights framework, but the activities they conduct in this respect are also fully 
protected by the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.  This focus is also, in part, her 
response to questions that have sometimes been raised regarding the status of those promoting 
ESCR as defenders of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Legal context for activities for the promotion of  
economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>13. The following is a brief overview of ESCR protected by selected internationally 
recognized human rights instruments and of other provisions of such instruments that have 
relevance to activities conducted for the protection of these rights.  The main instruments are the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and some common articles in the ICESCR and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  Relevant provisions of other 
human rights instruments are subsequently outlined.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>14. In UDHR articles 16 (rights in marriage), 17 (the right to property), 22 (the right to social 
security), 23 (the right to work, including the right to form trade unions), 24 (the right to rest and 
leisure), 25 (the right to an adequate standard of living), 26 (the right to education), and 27 (the 
right to freely participate in the cultural life of the community and the right to the protection of 
moral and material interests) deal directly with ESCR.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the preamble to the ICESCR, the States parties recognize that &#8220;in accordance with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from 
fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his 
ESCR, as well as his civil and political rights&#8221;.  The preamble to the ICESCR further considers 
&#8220;the obligation of States under the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect 
for, and observance of, human rights and freedoms&#8221;.  The preamble then goes on to state that the 
States parties realize that &#8220;the individual, having duties to other individuals and to the 
community to which he belongs, is under a responsibility to strive for the promotion and 
observance of the rights recognized in the present Covenant&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. The ICESCR and the ICCPR share a common article 1 which provides, inter alia, that 
&#8220;(a)ll peoples have the right of self-determination.  By virtue of that right they freely determine 
their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.  All 
peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources without 
prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the 
principle of mutual benefit, and international law.  In no case may a people be deprived of its 
own means of subsistence&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>17. The economic, social and cultural rights, discussed further in section B below in the 
context of various activities of defenders, are protected by the following provisions in the 
ICESCR:  article 6 (the right to work); article 7 (the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just 
and favourable conditions of work); article 8 (the right of everyone to form trade unions and join 
the trade union of his choice, including, inter alia, the right to strike); article 9 (the right to social 
security); article 10 (widest possible protection to be accorded to the family; marriage with the 
free consent of intending spouses; special protection to be accorded to mothers during a 
reasonable period before and after childbirth; special measures of protection and assistance for 
all children and young persons); article 11 (the right of everyone to an adequate standard of 
living, including adequate food, clothing and housing); article 12 (the right to enjoy the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health); article 13 (the right to education); and 
article 15 (the right of everyone, inter alia, to take part in cultural life).  Furthermore, States 
parties have an obligation to guarantee that all ESCR are exercised &#8220;without discrimination of 
any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status&#8221; (art. 2 (2)) and must be applied equally to men and women 
(art. 3).  It is in the context of this provision that in chapter III below, the Special Representative 
focuses on defenders who are at particular risk, namely those who defend the rights of 
indigenous people and minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) 
persons and women human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Economic, social and cultural rights in other relevant  
international human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>18. The economic, social and cultural rights mentioned above are elaborated upon and 
protected by a number of conventions and declarations in addition to ICESCR.  The following is 
not an exhaustive overview of these and the rights protected in them, but an outline of some of 
the most important ones. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on 
Human Rights in Vienna on 25 June 1993, which the community of States reaffirmed, inter alia, 
that &#8220;(a)ll human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. The United Nations Millennium Declaration adopted by the heads of State and 
Government on 8 September 2000 includes commitments in relation to peace, security and 
disarmament; development and poverty eradication; protecting our common environment; 
human rights, democracy and good governance; protecting the vulnerable; meeting the special 
needs of Africa; and strengthening the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>21. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families is a relevant instrument in relation to labour rights and trade union 
activities of migrant workers and those working to promote and protect their rights.  
</p>
<p>22. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
guarantees protection against all forms of discrimination against women, also in the field of 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>23. The Convention on the Rights of the Child elaborates on the rights of children and 
defines these rights in the context of their survival, development, protection and participation. 
</p>
<p>24. The Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (2001) is an important document in 
relation to defenders&#8217; work on this aspect of the right to health.  Of particular importance in this 
regard is its article 33 which acknowledges the &#8220;particular role and significant contribution of 
people living with HIV/AIDS, young people and civil society actors in addressing the problem of 
HIV/AIDS in all its aspects [&#8230;]&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>25. The Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities (1992), and United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples adopted by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 1/2 on 29 June 2006 are both 
important instruments in relation to the protection of ESCR of indigenous peoples and 
minorities.  
</p>
<p>26. The Declaration on the Right to Development (1986) states that &#8220;the right to development 
is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled 
to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in 
which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized&#8221; (art. 1). 
</p>
<p><b>4.</b> <b>Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>27. In the preamble to the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, the General Assembly 
reaffirms the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Covenants on Human Rights &#8220;as basic elements of international efforts to promote universal 
respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms [&#8230;]&#8221;.  The legitimacy of 
activities for the promotion of ESCR is reflected, two paragraphs later, in the acknowledgement 
of the &#8220;valuable work of individuals, groups and associations&#8221; in the elimination of violations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>including those resulting from &#8220;apartheid, all forms of racial discrimination, [...] and from the 
refusal to recognize the right of peoples to self-determination and the right of every people to 
exercise full sovereignty over its wealth and natural resources&#8221;.  The reiteration &#8220;that all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and 
should be promoted and implemented in a fair and equitable manner, without prejudice to the 
implementation of each of those rights and freedoms&#8221; has further strengthened the concept that 
regardless of the immediate objectives in the minds of defenders their activities have an 
accumulative impact on all human rights.  The Declaration on Human Rights Defenders refers to 
&#8220;all human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221; throughout the text.  The protection accorded to 
defenders by the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders is, therefore, not in any way 
dependent on whether the focus of the work of the defender(s) in question is on civil and 
political rights or ESCR. 
</p>
<p>28. The Declaration on Human Rights Defenders entrusts States with the prime responsibility 
to adopt such steps to create political as well as social and economic conditions as may be 
necessary for the enjoyment of &#8220;rights and freedoms in practice&#8221; (art. 2).  Article 8 provides for 
the right to draw attention to any aspect of the work of governmental bodies &#8220;that may hinder or 
impede the promotion, protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221; 
and confides to civil society a responsibility for promoting the right of everyone to &#8220;a social and 
international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and other human rights instruments can be fully realized&#8221; (art. 18).  State policies 
that undermine social rights and result in social conflict, or those that deprive the population of 
their economic rights, are a contravention of the obligation to create the social and economic 
conditions referred to in article 2.  Activities of defenders to draw attention to the failure of the 
State in this respect are within the scope of protection provided by the Declaration on Human 
Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p>29. Social action for the realization of rights is increasingly manifested through collective 
and public action.  As described later in the report, this form of protest or resistance to violations 
has become most vulnerable to obstruction and repression.  Collective action is protected by 
article 12 of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, which recognizes the right to 
participate, individually or in association with others, in &#8220;peaceful activities against violations of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221; and entitles those &#8220;reacting against or opposing&#8221; 
actions that affect the enjoyment of human rights to effective protection under national law.  
Read together with article 5, recalling the right to freedom of assembly, and article 6 providing 
for freedom of information and its dissemination, peaceful collective action is a legitimate means 
of drawing public attention to matters concerning human rights. 
</p>
<p>30. This form of public action, when taken in connection with ESCR, is also a means of 
promoting awareness of these rights.  Article 14.1 of the Declaration on Human Rights stresses 
the responsibility of the State to take all &#8220;appropriate measures to promote the understanding by 
all persons under its jurisdiction of their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights&#8221; 
(art. 14.1).  The State is, therefore, obliged to encourage initiatives taken by all interested actors 
to promote this understanding through means recognized in the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Relevant general comments of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>31. In its general comments, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(CESCR) has elaborated on the precise nature of States parties&#8217; obligations under the Covenant.  
For instance, the first two paragraphs of general comment No. 3 (1990) make it clear that while 
States&#8217; obligations are recognized as being subject to available resources, article 2.1 imposes 
immediate obligations, which include undertaking to guarantee ESCR without discrimination of 
any kind and to take positive steps towards the realization of all ESCR. 
</p>
<p>32. Similarly, general comment No. 9 (1998) on &#8220;The domestic application of the Covenant&#8221; 
recognizes in its first paragraph that the Covenant adopts a broad and flexible approach in the 
fulfilment of States&#8217; obligations which enables the particularities of the legal and administrative 
systems of each State, as well as other relevant considerations to be taken into account.  The 
CESCR, however, emphasizes in the following paragraph that &#8220;this flexibility coexists with the 
obligation upon each State party to use all the means at its disposal to give effect to the rights 
recognized in the Covenant&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. In light of these general comments, defenders who work for the implementation of ESCR 
should be seen as a force in inducing States parties to take positive steps towards ratifying and 
implementing the Covenant and the rights it recognizes. 
</p>
<p>34. Additionally, general comment No. 3 (1990) on &#8220;The nature of States parties&#8217; 
obligations&#8221; emphasizes in the concluding paragraph that &#8220;international cooperation for 
development and thus for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights is an obligation 
of all States&#8221;.  This relates both to the work of defenders in &#8220;developed countries&#8221; as well as 
those working in &#8220;developing&#8221; countries.  Both use their advocacy to insist on modes of 
cooperation that assure availability of resources and their proper utilization for development that 
is conducive to realizing the ESCR. 
</p>
<p>35. The CESCR, in general comment No. 10 (1998) on &#8220;The role of national human rights 
institutions in the protection of economic, social and cultural rights&#8221;, notes, in paragraph 3, that 
&#8220;it is essential that full attention be given to economic, social and cultural rights in all of the 
relevant activities of these institutions&#8221;.  The Committee goes on to suggest a list of activities 
that can be undertaken, such as:  &#8220;(c) providing technical advice, or undertaking surveys in 
relation to economic, social and cultural rights, including at the request of the public authorities 
or other appropriate agencies&#8221; and &#8220;(f) monitoring compliance with specific rights recognized 
under the Covenant and providing reports thereon to the public authorities and civil society 
[&#8230;]&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Human rights defenders and their work on economic, social and 
cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Representative, since the establishment of the mandate, has sent at 
least 368 communications to Governments concerning defenders promoting ESCR.  Defenders 
and their families have been threatened verbally, in writing and through the use of symbolic acts, 
such as deliveries of funeral wreaths to their families.  Defenders have been attacked in 
demonstrations, meetings, and other kinds of assemblies.  Both defenders and members of their </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>families have been physically attacked, kidnapped, tortured and even killed.  These violations 
have allegedly been perpetrated both by the State or its agencies, and non-State entities. 
</p>
<p>37. The following seven subsections deal with the activities of defenders within specific 
areas of ESCR.  In each section, the activities of defenders within this specific area is analysed 
through cases of violations against the rights of defenders in this area.  These cases are based on 
communications sent to Governments by the Special Representative since the establishment of 
the mandate, and the geographical focus of violations is identified only with reference to these 
communications.  The next section provides a general overview of the challenges faced by 
defenders working across the spectrum of ESCR and the violations of the rights recognized by 
the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Land rights, natural resources and environmental issues 
</b></p>
<p>38. On the issue of land rights and national resources, article 1 (2) of ICESCR stipulates that 
&#8220;All peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources 
without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based 
upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.  In no case may a people be deprived 
of its own means of subsistence.&#8221;  This comes in addition to the previously mentioned article 17 
of the UDHR on the right to property.  Section IV of the Millennium Declaration is devoted to 
&#8220;Protecting our common environment&#8221; and the Member States reaffirm their &#8220;support for the 
principles of sustainable development [&#8230;]&#8221; and resolve to &#8220;adopt in all our environmental 
actions a new ethic of conservation and stewardship [&#8230;]&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>39. Since the establishment of the mandate, the Special Representative has sent 81 
communications dealing with violations of the rights of defenders working on issues of land 
rights, natural resources such as oil, gas, forests and water, environmental issues such as 
pollution and waste-dumping and related issues. 
</p>
<p>40. Defenders working on land rights, natural resources or environmental issues seem to be 
particularly vulnerable to attacks and violations of their rights under the Declaration on Human 
Rights Defenders in countries of Latin America and in parts of Asia.  The Special Representative 
has sent a high number of communications to the Governments of Brazil (12 cases) and 
Guatemala (9 cases).  Forty-five communications were sent to Governments in South America 
and 23 cases were sent to Governments in Asia. 
</p>
<p>41. Land rights and natural resources is an area where a large part of the defenders come 
from indigenous populations and minority groups.  These populations are often working to 
secure their right to utilize and live on the land they consider to be theirs.  The Special 
Representative provides more information on the challenges they face in chapter III, section A, 
below, dealing with indigenous peoples and minority groups. 
</p>
<p>42. Women as a group are particularly vulnerable concerning issues of land rights and, in 
particular, inheritance rights.  Defenders are working against discriminatory inheritance laws and 
customary practices that deprive women of their equal rights to own, inherit and control 
property, including land and housing.  The Special Representative provides more information on 
the challenges they face in chapter III, section C, below, on women human rights defenders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Representative has acted on cases of violence and threats against journalists 
who have been highlighting the issue of land rights and natural resources in their work.  In 
November 2006, the Special Representative sent a communication to the Government of Russia 
concerning the alleged attack on a journalist active in covering the issue of land rights in the 
context of the seizure of farmland.  The journalist was allegedly attacked while attending a 
meeting on this issue. 
</p>
<p>44. The work of environmental activists is often carried out in close connection with issues 
of land rights and natural resources.  Additionally it has close links, inter alia, to the rights to 
health, food and water.  This issue has been addressed through several communications and in 
many of the reports of the Special Representative in relation to her official country visits.  
Following her visit to Kyrgyzstan in 2001, the Special Representative expressed concern at the 
plight of defenders who had denounced the dumping of nuclear waste and its impact on the 
environment (see E/CN.4/2002/106/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>45. According to the statistics of communications sent by the Special Representative, the 
second most vulnerable group when it comes to the danger of being killed because of their 
activities in the defence of human rights, are defenders working on land rights and natural 
resources.  The Special Representative has sent communications on at least 35 defenders who 
have been allegedly killed for this reason since the establishment of the mandate.  In the 
Philippines alone, more than 14 defenders working on issues of land rights and agrarian reform 
have reportedly been killed during 2006. 
</p>
<p>46. Defenders working on land rights often organize themselves in the form of social 
movements.  These are usually broad grassroots-based movements with a more horizontal 
organizational structure than for instance most NGOs.  These movements and the defenders who 
are actively involved in those movements have faced several specific challenges.  Two that 
should be mentioned include accusations of not being properly registered and therefore deemed 
illegal, whereas the reason behind the non-registration often is that the movements do not have 
the organizational structures that are needed to enable registration with the authorities, such as a 
permanent headquarters or a secretariat.  Another challenge continues to be that defenders 
engaged in social movements are accused of &#8220;forming criminal gangs&#8221; and the like. 
</p>
<p>47. In October 2006, the Special Representative sent a communication to the Government of 
Brazil concerning a case where a defender working with the Landless Workers&#8217; Movement 
(MST) was arrested and allegedly accused of &#8220;forming a criminal gang&#8221; and &#8220;inciting crime&#8221;.  
Concerns were expressed that the defender had been arrested and detained because of his 
activities in defence of workers&#8217; ESCR.  In March 2005, the Special Representative sent a 
communication, to the same Government, regarding a defender who had been killed, allegedly as 
a direct result of her work on defending the rights of rural workers and on land reforms in Brazil. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Labour rights, including trade union activities 
</b></p>
<p>48. Article 6 of ICESCR provides that States parties &#8220;recognize the right to work, which 
includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely 
chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right&#8221;.  The Covenant 
further deals with the right of everyone to &#8220;the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>work [&#8230;]&#8221; (art. 7) and the right of everyone to &#8220;form trade unions and join the trade union of his 
choice, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, for the promotion and protection 
of his economic and social interests [&#8230;]&#8221; (art. 8). 
</p>
<p>49. The question of labour rights is the most prevalent issue when it comes to alleged 
violations against defenders working on ESCR (115 cases).  The alleged violations are very 
serious and include summary executions, torture, violent repressions and death threats. 
</p>
<p>50. Repression of defenders working on labour rights, especially to those working on this 
issue through trade unions, is prevalent in a large number of countries.  During each of her 
official country visits, the Special Representative has met with trade union activists who have 
reported violations of the rights recognized by the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.  
However, with respect to cases reported to the Special Representative, it is in Latin America that 
most threats to the physical integrity of trade union activists have been reported. 
</p>
<p>51. Defenders working on labour rights remain the most vulnerable group and 190 
communications have been sent concerning defenders who have been killed because of their 
work in this field.  Over a period of 10 months from January through October 2001, the Special 
Representative has received reports of 112 trade union activists assassinated in Colombia alone.  
She was also informed of 11 cases of assassinations in the Philippines in 2006.  These figures do 
not include unsuccessful assassination attempts or death threats. 
</p>
<p>52. The majority of the defenders who work on labour rights do so within the framework of 
trade union work.  Many Governments are not willing to view trade union activists as defenders 
of the right to work and all the rights connected to it, such as the right to form trade unions and 
the right to strike.  In the majority of the cases where the Special Representative has sent 
communications to Governments on attacks or threats against trade union members, the 
authorities are alleged to have been behind these threats and attacks.  After her visit to Nigeria 
in 2005, the Special Representative reported that raids by security forces against unions appeared 
to be a common practice (see E/CN.4/2006/95/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Representative has addressed cases where journalists are working to promote 
the rights of workers through investigative journalism.  One example is the case of a 
correspondent for the newspaper <i>La Tribune </i>in Lumumbashi, Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, who reportedly published an article on 5 June 2003 on the poor working conditions 
of miners in Likasi.  Subsequently, the journalist was sentenced to five years in prison for 
&#8220;criminal defamation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Marriage, mothers and children 
</b></p>
<p>54. Article 10 of the ICESCR is primarily concerned with protecting children and affords the 
widest possible protection and assistance to the family particularly while it is responsible for the 
care and education of independent children.  It also provides protection to children and young 
persons from economic and social exploitation.  Children&#8217;s rights are most comprehensively set 
forth in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which enjoys almost universal 
ratification. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>55. Although article 10 of ICESCR refers only to women in a limited context as either wife, 
mother or child, it nevertheless offers important protection by saying marriage must be entered 
into with free consent of intending spouses and providing special protection to mothers during a 
reasonable period before and after childbirth.  The Special Representative has acted on cases 
concerning defenders raising issues related to article 10, such as the trafficking of women and 
forced marriages, as well as forced abortion and/or forced sterilization of women. 
</p>
<p>56. Women&#8217;s right to non-discrimination is most comprehensively set forth in the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which enjoys 
near universal ratification (185 countries), although a number of States have entered extensive 
reservations to articles 2 and 16 on cultural or religious grounds.  Cultural relativism still 
presents a formidable challenge for defenders fighting for women&#8217;s rights to equality and a 
dignified life where violence is not tolerated. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Representative has sent 36 communications to Governments, since the 
establishment of the mandate concerning defenders raising issues besides those already 
mentioned above, such as child labour, sexual exploitation of children, children in prison and 
human rights education for children. 
</p>
<p>58. The majority of those communications were addressed to countries in Asia (12) and in 
the Middle East (10). 
</p>
<p>59. In May 2004, the Special Representative sent a communication to the Government of 
Peru concerning a case in November 2003 when almost 150 street children of Lima, along with 
some adults accompanying them, were allegedly victims of excessive force on the part of the 
police during the repression of a demonstration organized by associations committed to the cause 
of street children.  In February 2005, a communication was sent to the Government of Nepal 
concerning the arrest of a defender combating child labour and trafficking. 
</p>
<p>60. Since September 2005, the Special Representative has sent six joint communications to 
the Government of China concerning a blind human rights lawyer and his wife who investigated 
villagers&#8217; claims that the city authorities were employing extensive violence in implementing 
government birth quotas, such as forced sterilizations and/or abortions.  The lawyer has been 
recently sentenced to over four years&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;gathering crowds to disrupt traffic&#8221; and 
&#8220;intentional destruction of property&#8221; and his wife faces similar charges.  Their lawyers have also 
suffered numerous and serious human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Housing rights and forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>61. The right to adequate housing has received wide recognition as a fundamental human 
right.  In article 11 of ICESCR, States parties recognize the &#8220;right of everyone to an adequate 
standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and 
to the continuous improvement of living conditions&#8221;.  In its general comment No. 4 (1991) on 
&#8220;The right to adequate housing&#8221;, CESCR has concluded that forced evictions are prima facie 
incompatible with the requirements of the Covenant and, in its general comment No. 7 (1997) 
dealing more specifically with forced evictions, the Committee has sought to define what 
amounts to an unlawful eviction. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>62. Since the establishment of the mandate, the Special Representative has sent 24 cases 
concerning defenders working on housing rights. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Representative has received information from all regions including 
Cambodia, China, India, the Philippines and South Korea; Angola, Sudan and Zimbabwe; 
Argentina, Ecuador and Guatemala; Israel; Turkey and Croatia. </p>
<p>64. Defenders working on the right to adequate housing also advocate for non-discrimination 
against minorities in securing housing.  They campaign against illegal or forced evictions in 
relation to projects such as dam building, the construction of highways and railway lines, gas 
pipelines and different kinds of &#8220;urban development&#8221; projects, including &#8220;city beautification&#8221; or 
the preparations for the Olympic Games.  They also work against collective punishment by 
forced evictions and the rights of internally displaced persons.  After her visit to Thailand 
in 2003, the Special Representative expressed concern over violence and other acts allegedly 
committed against defenders protesting against a gas pipeline project and a dam  
(E/CN.4/2004/94/Add.1).  In June 2006, the Special Representative issued a joint statement with 
the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard 
of living and on the right to non-discrimination in this context expressing concern regarding the 
action of the Government of Cambodia to prevent access to human rights defenders to monitor 
the forced eviction of over a thousand Bassac residents in Phnom Penh. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Representative has acted on at least 12 cases where defenders have been 
killed because of their work on housing rights. 
</p>
<p>66. In her mission report on her visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the 
Special Representative refers to individual defenders and groups who campaign against house 
demolitions (see E/CN.4/2006/95/Add.3, para. 13).  The Special Representative reiterated her 
concerns regarding the killing of Rachel Corrie who was run over by an Israeli army bulldozer in 
Rafah refugee camp while attempting to stop the levelling of houses on 16 March 2003.  The 
situation of human rights defenders engaged with the right to housing is also reflected in her 
mission report to Angola (E/CN.4/2005/101/Add.2). 
</p>
<p><b>5.  The right to food and water 
</b></p>
<p>67. The right to food is also a component of article 11 of ICESCR.<b>1</b>  Similarly, the right to 
water is clearly included in this category, since it is &#8220;one of the most fundamental conditions for 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  According to paragraph 2 of article 11, the States parties, recognizing the &#8220;fundamental right 
</p>
<p>to everyone to be free from hunger&#8221;,  &#8220;shall take, individually and through international 
cooperation, the measures, including specific programmes, which are needed:  (a) to improve 
methods of production, conservation and distribution of food [&#8230;] and (b) taking into account the 
problems of both food-importing and food-exporting countries, to ensure an equitable 
distribution of world food supplies in relation to need&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>survival&#8221;<b>2</b> as it is also inextricably related to the right to health (art. 12.1) and to the right to life 
contained in the ICCPR.  CESCR provides the most detailed account of the right to water in 
international law in general comment No. 15. 
</p>
<p>68. Since the establishment of the mandate, the Special Representative has sent five 
communications concerning defenders working on the right to food or the right to water.  One 
communication was sent to the Government of China in September 2005 concerning the arrest of 
a defender working to provide food and shelter to starving North Korean refugees.  Another 
communication was sent to the Government of Colombia concerning the killing of an Embera 
indigenous leader who had been working to secure the right to land, food and health for 
indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  The right to health 
</b></p>
<p>69. Article 12 of ICESCR stipulates the &#8220;right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health&#8221; which is &#8220;closely related to and dependent 
upon the realization of other human rights, as contained in the International Bill of Rights, 
including the rights to food, housing, work, education, human dignity, life, non-discrimination, 
equality, the prohibition against torture, privacy, access to information, and the freedoms of 
association, assembly and movement&#8221;.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>70. Since the establishment of the mandate, the Special Representative has 
sent 36 communications on defenders working on the right to health.  Some of these 
communications are also included in some of the other sections, in particular the section on the 
family and labour rights (see paragraphs 48-60 above). 
</p>
<p>71. Communications concerning defenders working on the right to health have been sent to 
countries of all regions.  Ten communications were transmitted to the Government of Israel and 
concerned cases where personnel from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society or other Palestinian 
or international organizations working to promote and protect civilians right to health in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory have been attacked or threatened. 
</p>
<p>72. In this context, the Special Representative recalls a case transmitted to the Government of 
Israel in 2003, concerning a report from 2002 indicating that the head of the Palestinian Red 
Crescent Society emergency medical service in the city of Jenin had been killed in an attack on 
his ambulance while he was attempting to rescue a 9-year-old girl. 
</p>
<p>73. Many defenders who promote the right to health are working on issues connected to 
combating HIV/AIDS.  The Special Representative is aware of the fact that such defenders are 
faced with challenges in terms of having their work recognized as human rights work in addition 
to the stigma attached to this health issue. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  General comment No. 15 (2002), on &#8220;The Right to Water (articles 11 and 12 of the 
</p>
<p>Covenant).&#8221; 
<b>3
</b>  General comment No. 14 (2000), para. 3. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>74. In July 2004, the Special Representative wrote to the Government of China concerning 
husband and wife defenders, who were both HIV-positive and wanted to protest about the 
inadequate health care and services for those infected with HIV/AIDS in Shangqiu city.  They 
were allegedly arrested whilst trying to petition the National Health Department about this issue.  
In August 2004 a communication was sent to the Government of Nepal concerning members of 
the Blue Diamond Society, an NGO that provides outreach work for LGBTI persons and 
campaigns to combat HIV/AIDS.  A private writ had been filed to close down the organization 
on the grounds that it &#8220;promoted homosexuality&#8221; and 39 members were arrested on the street 
without charge and held without food or water for 15 hours.  Three members were alleged to 
have been beaten and raped by the police.  In December 2005, a communication was sent to the 
Government of Jamaica, concerning Lenford &#8220;Steve&#8221; Harvey who was killed allegedly because 
of his activities in the defence of the rights of marginalized people in Jamaican society, including 
persons living with HIV/AIDS.  In August 2006, a communication was sent to the Government 
of Myanmar concerning 11 members of Friends with Red Ribbon who were alleged to have been 
detained on the grounds that they had failed to report that they would be staying in a monastery 
overnight and planning an event to commemorate those having died of HIV/AIDs. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  The right to education 
</b></p>
<p>75. States parties recognize &#8220;the right of everyone to education&#8221; in articles 13 and 14 
of ICESCR. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Representative has sent communications on 12 cases of defenders working to 
promote and protect the right to education.  Many of the defenders working to promote and 
protect labour rights are also active in teachers&#8217; unions and unions for university employees. 
</p>
<p>77. In June 2004, the Special Representative sent a communication to the Government of 
Iran concerning a defender who had been arrested, allegedly because of his work on educational 
projects for children from the Arab minority in Khuzestan. 
</p>
<p><b>C. General summary of violations of the rights of defenders active in the field 
of economic, social and cultural rights and challenges they face 
</b></p>
<p>78. According to the information received by the Special Representative, defenders working 
in all of the fields mentioned in the section above, face violations of their rights by the State 
and/or face violence and threats from non-State actors because of their work.  Violations of their 
rights seem to take all the forms that violations of the rights of defenders working in the field of 
civil and political rights take.  There are some differences though, perhaps the most important 
being that defenders working in the field of ESCR often have a harder time having their work 
accepted as human rights work.  This might have several effects, including difficulties attracting 
funding, a lack of coverage from the media to violations of these defenders&#8217; rights, and a lack of 
attention paid to these violations and a hesitation in seeking remedial measures at the domestic or 
international level. 
</p>
<p>79. Even when they do not experience active repression, defenders working on ESCR often 
report that they receive no response from the authorities to concerns they express regarding these 
rights.  Again this is often a consequence of the above-mentioned misconception that defenders 
working in the field of ESCR are not &#8220;real&#8221; human rights defenders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>80. Often the national legal framework is weak in terms of regulating ESCR.  The Special 
Representative noted after her visit to Nigeria in 2005 that land laws, especially tended to protect 
the interests of the oil and gas companies over community interests (E/CN.4/2006/95/Add.2, 
para. 77).  This is one of the factors that can lead to defenders working in any field of ESCR, 
being seen as challenging the economic or social policies adopted by States as a model for 
development, rather than being seen as defenders aiming for the implementation of international 
commitments and internationally recognized human rights. 
</p>
<p>81. Furthermore, the Special Representative has been informed that there is often a lack of 
redress mechanisms available to defenders and communities to ensure the effective protection 
and justiciability of their ESCR.  This makes the work they do to promote and protect these 
rights even more valuable and important. 
</p>
<p>82. As described in some of the above subsections, defenders have been the victims 
of different sorts of attacks and threats from State authorities and non-State groups.  Since 
the establishment of the mandate, the Special Representative has acted on cases of at 
least 241 defenders working for ESCR who have been killed.  Most of these incidents have taken 
place in countries of Latin America, notably in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.  In the report after 
her visit to Guatemala in 2002, the Special Representative noted that it was alleged that members 
of private security firms, with the participation or acquiescence of the National Civilian Police 
(PNC), were responsible for some of the killings of defenders active in the work to promote and 
protect land rights and labour rights (E/CN.4/2003/104/Add.2, para. 43).  Also in her report on 
her visit to Thailand, the Special Representative expressed deep concern over numerous cases of 
alleged or attempted murder of defenders representing hill tribes and labour rights movements 
(see E/CN.4/2004/94/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>83. In several communications and in her reports after official country visits, the Special 
Representative has expressed concern over alleged collusion between local or national 
authorities and the private sector, which have led to violations against defenders working on 
ESCR.  In her mission report on Thailand, the Special Representative expressed concern over 
such collusion in attacks and threats against defenders addressing environmental issues, labour 
rights and land rights (E/CN.4/2004/94/Add.1).  Also, in her report on Guatemala, the Special 
Representative reported that defenders had told her that there were indications that clandestine 
groups were involved in attacks against defenders.  It was alleged that these groups were linked 
to the security forces, in particular military intelligence (E/CN.4/2003/104/Add.2, para. 85). 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Representative would like to refer to her report to the sixtieth session of 
the General Assembly, which dealt with the right to freedom of association in relation to the 
activities of human rights defenders (A/60/339 and Corr.1), and to her report to the 
sixty-first session of the General Assembly, which dealt with the issue of freedom of assembly in 
relation to the work of defenders (A/61/312), and she would like to emphasize that the 
conclusions and recommendations contained therein, as well as in all her other reports, should be 
considered as equally applicable to all human rights defenders, including those working to 
promote and protect ESCR. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  DEFENDERS AT PARTICULAR RISK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Defending the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities 
</b></p>
<p>85. On 29 June 2006, the Human Rights Council in its resolution 1/2 adopted and 
recommended to the General Assembly for adoption the text of the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which welcomes the fact that indigenous peoples are 
organizing themselves for political, economic, social and cultural enhancement.  The preamble 
also acknowledges that &#8220;the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights affirm the fundamental importance of the right to self-determination of all peoples&#8221;, while 
article 3 specifically provides that &#8220;Indigenous people have the right to self-determination.  By 
virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their 
economic, social and cultural development.&#8221;  Furthermore, the preamble of the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders stresses that human rights and fundamental freedoms apply to all 
&#8220;without distinction of any kind&#8221; and acknowledges mass, flagrant or systematic violations such 
as those resulting, inter alia, from colonialism, foreign domination or occupation and from the 
refusal to recognize the right of peoples to self-determination and the right of every people to 
exercise sovereignty over its wealth and natural resources.&#8221;<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>86. Since the establishment of the mandate, the Special Representative has sent 80 
communications on defenders working to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples 
and minorities.  Several of these communications have been sent jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people.  
Included in this section are defenders from indigenous peoples and minorities who are active in 
all fields of ESCR.  Following from this, their cases are also included in other subsections above.  
The majority of these kinds of cases are concerned with indigenous peoples involved in struggles 
over land rights and rights to use and to free disposal of their natural wealth and resources.  This 
trend is also supported by the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>87. The majority of such cases are reported from countries in Latin America (39 cases).  The 
region with the second largest number of defenders from this group is Asia (19 cases). 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Other relevant instruments are the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (in particular 
</p>
<p>Part I, para. 19 (minorities) and para. 20 and Part II, paras. 28 to 32 (indigenous)).  Article 19 
reaffirms, inter alia, the &#8220;obligation of States to ensure that persons belonging to minorities may 
exercise fully and effectively all human rights and fundamental freedoms without any 
discrimination and in full equality before the law in accordance with the Declaration on the 
Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities&#8221;.  
Article 20 further recognizes the &#8220;inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous 
people to the development and plurality of society and strongly reaffirms the commitment of the 
international community to their economic, social and cultural well-being and their enjoyment of 
the fruits of sustainable development.  States should ensure the full and free participation of 
indigenous people in all aspects of society, in particular in matters of concern to them.  [&#8230;]&#8221; 
(art. 20). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>88. Since May 2004 the Special Representative has sent several communications to the 
Government of Chile concerning the matriarchal leader of a Mapuche community in the 
municipality of Cunco de la IX Region.  Both the defender and members of her family, including 
her mother and grandmother in the past, have been victims of physical attacks because of her 
work to defend the human rights of her community and for protesting against illegal logging.  In 
June 2004 her house was completely destroyed by a fire.  The body of her uncle, who was the 
leader of a neighbouring community, was later found in the burnt-down house, where it was 
thought the body had been placed after he had been killed in another location.  No investigation 
has been carried out, even after the events were reported to the national police and the Regional 
Prosecutor.  In May 2004, the same defender, who was pregnant, was allegedly beaten by 
policemen causing her to miscarriage.  In August and October 2006, communications were sent 
concerning the arrest of her son who has been charged under &#8220;anti-terrorism&#8221; legislation.  The 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
peoples has referred to Chile as one of the three countries where the most violations against 
defenders of human rights of indigenous people are taking place, in addition to Colombia and the 
Philippines. 
</p>
<p>89. In June 2006, the Special Representative sent a communication to the Government of 
China concerning the arrests and ill-treatment of the sons of a prominent defender working on 
the rights of the minority Uighur community in the north-west region of Xinjiang.  In 
December 2006 the Special Representative sent a communication to the Government of China 
concerning a Tibetan teacher and author of an unpublished manuscript entitled &#8220;The Restless 
Himalayas&#8221;, which discusses political and social issues such as sovereignty, religion, history and 
geography and who was planning a project addressing women&#8217;s rights in Tibet.  He was 
reportedly sentenced in September 2005 to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment for &#8220;endangering State 
security&#8221; and his sentence was upheld on appeal. 
</p>
<p>90. In cases of violations of the rights of indigenous defenders, it is sometimes alleged that 
private companies or landholders are responsible for attacks or threats against the defender(s). 
</p>
<p>91. Defenders from indigenous groups, in particular in some countries in Latin America and 
Asia, are vulnerable to serious attacks and killings.  In the large majority of the cases where 
defenders from indigenous or minority groups have been killed, no investigation has been carried 
out by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>92. In February 2005, the Special Representative transmitted a communication to the 
Government of Honduras concerning members of the Indigenous Council of the Olominas 
Community who were attacked by armed men.  One defender was killed and death threats were 
later made to the surviving defenders and thereby witnesses to the killing. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Defending the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender  
and intersex persons 
</b></p>
<p>93. Both ICESCR (art. 2 (2)) and ICCPR (art. 2 (1)) contain non-discrimination clauses, and 
article 7 of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders specifically provides that &#8220;everyone has 
the right, individually and in association with others to develop and discuss new human rights 
ideas and principles and to advocate their acceptance&#8221;.  The 1993 Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action confirmed that &#8220;(a)ll human rights are universal, indivisible and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>interdependent and interrelated.  [&#8230;]  While the significance of national and regional 
particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, 
it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote 
and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221; and thus, to ensure that the protection of 
international human rights norms is universally applied. 
</p>
<p>94. Since the establishment of the mandate, the Special Representative has acted on 36 cases 
of alleged attacks and threats against defenders of LGBTI rights in all regions. 
</p>
<p>95. Communications have been sent to Belarus, the Holy See, Latvia, Moldova, Poland, 
Russia, Turkey, Nigeria, Uganda, India, Nepal, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Honduras, Jamaica 
and Iran.  Defenders have been threatened, had their houses and offices raided, they have been 
attacked, tortured, sexually abused, tormented by regular death threats and even killed.  A major 
concern in this regard is an almost complete lack of seriousness with which such cases are 
treated by the concerned authorities. 
</p>
<p>96. In numerous cases from all regions, police or government officials are the alleged 
perpetrators of violence and threats against defenders of LGBTI rights.  In several of these cases, 
the authorities have prohibited demonstrations, conferences and meetings, denied registration of 
organizations working for LGBTI rights and police officers have, allegedly, beaten up or even 
sexually abused these defenders of LGBTI rights.  The authorities have generally attempted to 
justify action against these defenders by arguing that &#8220;the public&#8221; does not want these 
demonstrations to take place, or these organizations to be registered, or that &#8220;the people&#8221; do not 
want LGBTI people in their community.  The Special Representative recalls articles 2 and 12 of 
the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders to remind States of their responsibility for 
protecting defenders against violence and threats.  States are also responsible for, inter alia, 
ensuring that all programmes for training of law enforcement officers and public officials include 
appropriate elements of human rights teaching (art. 15). 
</p>
<p>97. In December 2004, the Special Representative communicated her concerns to the 
Government of Jamaica regarding published comments of the Police Federation&#8217;s Public 
Relations officer condemning the role of &#8220;so-called&#8221; human rights organizations and dismissing 
concerns regarding violence against LGBTI defenders, stating that &#8220;the Government and police 
cannot be held responsible for &#8230; the cultural responses of the population &#8230;&#8221;.<b>5</b>  In January 2006, 
the Special Representative sent her concerns to the Government of Nigeria concerning a draft 
bill which would, if approved, introduce criminal penalties for public advocacy or associations 
supporting LGBTI rights.  In June 2006, a communication was sent to the Government of Poland 
concerning the Director of the National In-Service Training Centre who was dismissed by the 
Minister for Education, allegedly for his involvement in the publication and dissemination of a 
Council of Europe manual on human rights education for young people, which included issues in 
relation to sexual orientation.

</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  This was allegedly in response to Human Rights Watch&#8217;s publication &#8220;Hated to death:  
</p>
<p>Homophobia, Violence and Jamaica&#8217;s HIV/AIDS epidemic&#8221; (16 November 2004). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Women human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>98. Legal basis:  In article 7 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, States agreed to take all appropriate measures to eliminate 
discrimination against women in the political and public life of the country and, in particular, to 
ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right:  &#8230; (c) to participate in NGOs and 
associations concerned with the public and political life of the country. 
</p>
<p>99. The Special Representative has consistently reiterated that women defenders are more at 
risk of certain forms of violence and restrictions and become vulnerable to prejudice, exclusion 
and public repudiation by State forces and social actors especially when engaged in the defence 
of women&#8217;s rights (see E/CN.4/2002/106, paras. 80-94).<b>6</b>  In 2002 the Special Representative 
spearheaded a three-year international campaign culminating in the World Conference on 
Women Human Rights Defenders, held in Sri Lanka, which brought together leading gender 
experts and women human rights defenders from over 70 countries in the world.<b>7</b>  In her report 
to the sixty-second session of the Commission, the Special Representative emphasized that there 
is no better protection for women human rights defenders than the strength and support of their 
own movements and recommended that additional protection measures are therefore needed to 
provide women&#8217;s rights defenders with a secure environment for their work (E/CN.4/2006/95, 
para. 10).  In her 2006 report to the General Assembly, she reiterated that those defending 
LGBTI rights and women defenders face particular challenges (A/61/312, paras. 71-73). 
</p>
<p>100. Since the establishment of the mandate, the Special Representative has acted 
on 449 cases of violations of women human rights defenders concerning 1,314 defenders.  
Sixty-five of these communications have been sent jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women. 
</p>
<p>101. The Special Representative has acted on alleged attacks and threats against women 
human rights defenders in all regions.  More than four communications each have been sent to 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, the Sudan and Zimbabwe; Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela; 
Azerbaijan, Belarus, the Russian Federation, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan; Cambodia, 
China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines; Iran, Israel and 
Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>102. Killings of women human rights defenders:  The Special Representative has sent 
communications on 43 cases where women human rights defenders have been killed.  In 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  The report focuses on women human rights defenders and the specific violations they face in 
</p>
<p>the course of their work because of their sex and gender. 
<b>7
</b>  Held in Colombo, Sri Lanka from 29 November to 2 December 2005.  The conference focused 
</p>
<p>on identifying and developing new strategies for protecting women defenders against a range of 
sources and types of abuse by States, non-State actors, families and communities, and sexual and 
sexuality-based attacks.  The website www.defendingwomen-defendingrights.org continues to be 
a resource tool for women&#8217;s rights defenders. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>July 2006, the Special Representative wrote to the Government of the Philippines concerning the 
killing of Annaliza Abanador-Gandia, a pro-democracy activist and leader of a womens&#8217; rights 
organization who had been followed by two unidentified men and shot dead.  In October 2006, 
the Special Representative wrote to the Government of Iraq concerning the alleged shooting 
by 10 men of Faliha Ahmed Jabori, head of the women&#8217;s rights organization, Maternity and 
Childhood, and to the Government of Russia concerning the murder of Anna Politkovskaia, a 
prominent human rights defender and journalist. 
</p><p>103. In numerous cases from all regions, police, military or government officials are the 
alleged perpetrators of violence, including sexual violence and death threats against women 
human rights defenders.  In February 2006, a joint communication was sent to the Government 
of China concerning a housing rights activist and cyber dissident who was arrested by police.  In 
March and April 2006, joint communications were sent to the Government of the Sudan 
concerning two cases where a humanitarian organization assisting women who have suffered 
gender-based sexual violence as a result of the conflict in Darfur and an organization offering 
legal aid to women were obstructed by the Humanitarian Aid Commission, a government 
agency.  In the first instance the organization was ordered to hand over all its assets and close its 
health and nutrition centres and its food distribution unit.  In the second case, the organization&#8217;s 
assets were declared frozen because they had applied for funding from the European Union.  
In April 2006, a joint communication was sent to the Government of Zimbabwe concerning 
a 65-year-old human rights defender and former Chairwoman of the Porta Farm Residents&#8217; 
Committee, who spoke out against forced evictions that took place in 2004 and 2005.  She 
received death threats and was allegedly threatened with expulsion from the community if she 
continued to interact with human rights groups. 
</p>
<p>104. In her report on her visit to Brazil (A/HRC.4/37/Add. 2), the Special Representative has 
reported on the plight of widows of rural workers who are now leading a movement.  She was 
deeply distressed at the allegation that elements opposing their work had resorted to labelling 
them as prostitutes in an attempt to undermine their social credibility in communities where they 
live and work. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The progressive achievement of economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR) or the 
obligation of the State being dependent on the availability of resources should not be 
misunderstood as allowing States to adopt policies that violate these rights or negate the 
probability of their realization.  The Special Representative recommends appropriate 
guarantees in national constitutions that give full legitimacy and recognition to activities 
for the promotion and protection of these rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>106. <b>Where ESCR are expressed as principles of State policy in the national constitution 
and not as fundamental rights, States must ensure that these principles are not deviated 
from and that civil society actors have the full opportunity to participate in discussions of 
social or economic policies or projects.  In particular they must have the opportunity to 
monitor the effects of such policies and projects, to register their objections and to receive 
responses from the State with regard to any action that undermines the right to strive for 
attaining these rights.</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>107. <b>Judiciaries must, in particular, be vigilant and consistent in upholding the right to 
peaceful action for attaining social and economic rights.  This becomes extremely 
important considering the mounting pressure on defenders of judicial prosecution for 
carrying out activities protected by the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.</b> 
</p>
<p>108. <b>In line with the preamble of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, where it is 
stressed that &#8220;the prime responsibility and duty to promote and protect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms lie with the State&#8221;, the Special Representative urges States to adopt 
appropriate measures to disseminate and to ensure full observance of the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders by all State authorities in order to make sure that all defenders 
come under the protection of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, including those 
working in the area of ESCR.</b> 
</p>
<p>109. <b>The Special Representative recommends that States show increased tolerance for 
criticism and see human rights defenders working in the field of ESCR as a resource and 
make use of the often specialized knowledge of defenders in order to achieve the realization 
of all ESCR.</b> 
</p>
<p>110. <b>In relation to the above, the Special Representative urges Governments to improve 
access to information for human rights defenders, as well as access to authorities, also at 
the local level, and to public meetings in order to express their concerns and 
recommendations and to participate in assessing the impact of State policies on the 
realization of ESCR and the actions of private actors in the field of ESCR. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Special Representative suggests that the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, as well as Governments, as a part of their support for the work of 
defenders, encourage defenders and defenders&#8217; organizations to submit shadow-reports to 
the Committee on the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>112. <b>The Special Representative encourages Governments to combat impunity for 
attacks and threats against human rights defenders working in the area of ESCR, as well 
as in all other areas, in accordance with article 9 of the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders.</b> 
</p>
<p>113. <b>The Special Representative reminds Governments of their commitments through 
the Millennium Declaration.  She urges them to facilitate human rights defenders&#8217; activities 
that contribute towards achieving the goals of the Millennium Declaration.</b>
