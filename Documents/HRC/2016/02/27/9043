<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited the Republic of Colombia in response 
to an open invitation extended to all the thematic mechanisms of the Human Rights Council. The 
visit took place from 1 to 10 October 2008. The Working Group visited the capital and the 
departments of Arauca and Valle del Cauca. In Bogot&#225;, D.C., and in the departmental capitals of 
Arauca and Cali the delegation held discussions with the executive, the judiciary and civil 
society organizations. The Group visited 10 detention centres, including 4 prisons, 2 juvenile 
detention centres and 2 police stations. It held meetings, in private and without witnesses, with 
about 150 detainees, and collective interviews with about 400. The Working Group expresses its 
appreciation to the national and departmental authorities for their full cooperation in carrying out 
its mandate. 
</p>
<p> The report describes the different institutions and regulations that make up the institutional 
and legal framework on detention. It cites the progress made and setbacks encountered in 
applying the new accusatorial criminal procedure, in ensuring that National Police officers 
respect the time limits on detention in police stations, and in keeping records up to date. It 
highlights the work of the Office of the Procurator-General, an old Colombian institution that is 
part of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, and acts as guarantor in judicial proceedings to ensure that 
due process and the right to defence are respected. It also draws attention to the work of the 
judges responsible for procedural safeguards, who are, in fact, constitutional judges in criminal 
proceedings. The report expresses the Working Group&#8217;s satisfaction at the existence of the 
judicial services centres and work done in prisons by the human rights committees, which are 
elected by the prisoners by secret ballot. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes the gap between the Constitution - an instrument recognized 
worldwide for its democratic nature, in both its genesis and content - the law, and reality. It 
criticizes the practice of administrative pretrial detention by the National Police; mass or 
multiple arrests by the military in rural areas; detentions in the poor areas of the big cities, 
especially of beggars, the destitute and members of ethnic and sexual minorities; military 
round-ups and enlist conscription. The Working Group expresses its concern at the problem of 
&#8220;false positives&#8221; whereby the bodies of young persons who have disappeared in the big cities 
crop up a short time later hundreds of kilometres away, identified as guerrillas killed in combat. 
It criticizes the absence of criminal enforcement judges in prisons, prison overcrowding, 
especially in the La Picota, Villa Hermosa and Palmira prisons, and the practice of citizen&#8217;s 
arrests. 
</p>
<p> In its conclusions, the Working Group highlights Government efforts to provide the 
country with legislation that guarantees the protection of basic rights through, for example, the 
promulgation of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, but criticizes certain lapses in legislation 
and case law since it was adopted. It notes the practice of mass detentions and the lack of solid 
evidence required to carry out an arrest, particularly when the only evidence is the accusation of 
former guerillas. The Group recommends that the Government eradicate the practice of mass 
arrests and administrative pretrial detention; eliminate the practice of detentions by military 
personnel and agents of private companies; appoint expedited procedure judges to clear any 
cases under the old Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No. 600) and strengthen the institutions 
responsible for protecting human rights. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group, established by the Commission on Human Rights through its 
resolution 1991/42 and whose mandate was extended for three years by the Human Rights 
Council in its resolution 6/4, visited the Republic of Colombia at the invitation of the 
Government from 1 to 10 October 2008. The delegation was headed by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group, Ms. Manuela Carmena Castrillo (Spain), who 
was accompanied by Mr. Roberto Garret&#243;n (Chile), a member of the Working Group. The 
delegation was accompanied by the Secretary of the Working Group and another official from 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. The visit 
took in the capital, Bogot&#225;, D.C., and the cities of Arauca and Cali. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group wishes to thank the Government of Colombia, the departmental 
authorities of Arauca, Cundinamarca and Valle del Cauca, the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia, which helped prepare the programme and 
provided logistical support during the visit, as well as the Colombian civil society and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Working Group enjoyed the full cooperation and total transparency of the national and 
departmental authorities at all levels. There was a constructive and sincere dialogue, and 
openness to the Working Group&#8217;s observations and recommendations. The Working Group 
visited the following detention centres: the prison and the Temporary Shelter for Young 
Offenders in Arauca; La Picota prison; the temporary holding cells of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office; 
the holding cells of the Department of National Security (DAS), the Virgen de la Paz Clinic and 
the El Redentor Working School for Young Offenders in Bogot&#225;; and the Villa Hermosa and 
Palmira prisons, and a police station in Cali. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group was able to interview anyone it wished to: persons held in pretrial 
detention, convicted prisoners, detainees&#8217; representatives, women, minors, parliamentarians, 
detained public officials and members of the armed forces, former members of unofficial armed 
forces and guerilla groups who have been arrested and demobilized, imprisoned members of 
paramilitary organizations, and detainees held in disciplinary cells. The majority were chosen at 
random. 
</p>
<p>5. During its visit the Working Group met various national and departmental authorities, 
representatives of the judiciary, magistrates, judges, prosecutors and representatives of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office at different levels, as well as officials from autonomous institutions. It held 
meetings with representatives of the executive, including the Deputy Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, the Deputy Minister of Justice, the Deputy Minister of Defence and other senior officials 
of those ministries and of the Presidential Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law 
Programme; judges of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the High Council of the 
Judiciary; the Attorney-General; the Procurator-General; representatives of the Office of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Advocate; and senior officers of the National Army and the National Police, senior staff 
of the Department of National Security and the National Institute of Penitentiaries and Prisons. 
In the departments of Arauca and Valle del Cauca the Working Group held meetings with 
departmental authorities, magistrates and judges, and with the Governor of Arauca, the 
commander of the 18th Brigade of the National Army in Arauca and the Director of the National 
Police in Cali. 
</p>
<p>6. The Working Group also interviewed representatives of various non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) active in the fields of human rights, the prison system and women&#8217;s and 
children&#8217;s rights, immigrants, indigenous people, and persons of African descent, as well as other 
vulnerable groups in the criminal justice system. The Working Group met with lawyers, jurists, 
academics, detainees&#8217; representatives, and officials of the agencies of the United Nations system 
in Colombia. It interviewed, in private without witnesses, approximately 150 detainees and had 
collective interviews with some 400. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. For almost 50 years Colombia has been beset by armed confrontation, involving, in 
addition to the armed State institutions, various illegal armed groups that attack the civilian 
population. Of those groups the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia) (FARC) and the Ej&#233;rcito de Liberaci&#243;n Nacional (National 
Liberation Army) (ELN) are still active; there are also anti-guerrilla paramilitary groups that 
claim to be self-defence groups. Colombia also suffers the serious consequences of illegal drug 
production and trafficking. The money generated from these illegal activities is fuelling the 
armed confrontation and undermining and corrupting the social institutions. Violence seems to 
have become a goal in itself: paramilitary groups are responsible for as many as 200 massacres 
per year and armed factions outdo one another in cruelty. 
</p>
<p>8. Since 2002, the current Government has been implementing the Democratic Security 
Policy which seeks, according to Government representatives, to recover State control of the 
territory and combat illegal armed groups, both guerilla and paramilitary. According to the 
Government, the policy has contributed to bringing the number of homicides down from 
289,837 in 2002 to 14,928 in 2008; the number of massacres from 680 in 2002 to 169 in 2008; 
the number of internally displaced persons from 392,928 in 2002 to 210,441 in 2008; and the 
number of kidnappings from 2,882 in 2002 to 521 in 2008. 
</p>
<p>9. In 1990, in this context of violence and under fierce but peaceful pressure from civil 
society, a Constituent National Assembly was convened. In 1991 that Assembly adopted a 
Constitution proclaiming that Colombia is a social State governed by law which recognizes and 
develops human rights. The 1991 Constitution is nationally and internationally recognized as 
democratic both for its genesis and its content. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.3

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10. Four institutions are responsible for the administration of justice: the Constitutional Court, 
the Council of State, the Supreme Court and the High Council of the Judiciary. The Office of the 
Attorney-General and the military criminal courts are also mentioned among the judicial 
institutions.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>11. The safeguarding and promotion of human rights, protection of the public interest and 
monitoring of the official conduct of those in public positions is the responsibility of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and is carried out by the Procurator-General, the Office of the People&#8217;s 
Advocate, local attorneys and municipal representatives.<b>2</b> The Office of the People&#8217;s Advocate 
forms part of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and performs its functions under the overall 
authority of the Procurator-General.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>12. The High Council of the Judiciary is responsible for managing the judicial ranking system, 
as well as settling jurisdictional conflicts, drawing up lists of candidates for the appointment of 
judicial officials, preparing the draft budget of the judicial branch, and sanctioning mistakes by 
officials of the judicial branch and by lawyers.<b>4</b> 
13. The Supreme Court is the highest court of ordinary jurisdiction. It can act as the court of 
cassation; try the President of the Republic and senior officials, and investigate and try members 
of Congress.<b>5</b> Since the Constitution came into force, it has shown great independence from the 
executive, which has been highly valued. Recently, at least two of its members have been 
publicly attacked by the highest authorities of the State, which some lawyers interviewed 
interpret as an attempt to undermine its independence. 
</p>
<p>14. Safeguarding the integrity and privacy of the Constitution is the responsibility of the 
Constitutional Court, which rules on unconstitutionality suits brought by citizens against laws 
and decrees with the force of law issued by the Government for their substantive content or 
errors of procedure in their form. The Constitutional Court issues final rulings on the 
constitutionality of international treaties and the laws approving them and revises judicial rulings 
connected with the protection of constitutional rights.<b>6</b> It is probably the most prestigious public 
institution in Colombia, and it enjoys a hallowed place as guarantor of basic rights.

<p> 
</p>
<p>15. The Council of State serves as the highest administrative court and acts as the supreme 
advisory body for the Government on administrative matters.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>16. Investigating crimes and charging suspects in the competent courts is the responsibility of 
the Office of the Attorney-General. Under the Constitution, it also ensures the protection of 
victims, witnesses and others involved in proceedings, and manages and coordinates the judicial 
police functions assigned to the National Police. 
</p>
<p>17. Article 116 of the Constitution and article 31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Act 
No. 906) establish the bodies that administer criminal justice and are responsible for deprivation 
of liberty: 
</p>
<p> (a) The Criminal Appellate Division of the Supreme Court; 
</p>
<p> (b) The criminal divisions of the higher district courts, including the Military Court; 
</p>
<p> (c) The criminal circuit courts and the specialized criminal circuit courts; 
</p>
<p> (d) Municipal criminal courts; 
</p>
<p> (e) Courts of mixed jurisdiction when they settle criminal matters; and 
 (f) Executive oversight and security measures courts. 
</p>
<p>18. The law also provides for trial by jury in criminal cases, although this has yet to be set up. 
19. Justices of the peace are responsible for settling individual or community conflicts fairly. 
The indigenous authorities may exercise their jurisdiction within their territorial limits and in 
accordance with their own rules and procedures, provided these do not contradict the 
Constitution and the laws. The Criminal Appellate Division of the Supreme Court rules on 
applications for legal protection or <i>amparo</i> and may even review the appellate decisions of 
circuit judges. 
20. The Office of the People&#8217;s Advocate is responsible for the public defenders of those who 
cannot afford legal representation. These are private practice lawyers who are contracted as 
court-appointed lawyers. The Office of the People&#8217;s Advocate has 37 regional and sectional 
operational units and 2,200 public defenders nationwide. They receive continuing training, 
which is why most practising lawyers aspire to work as public defenders. 
</p>
<p>21. Public defenders work in the adversarial criminal justice system, and in administrative, 
civil and family law. Their work is supervised by inspectors, some of whom were interviewed by 
the Working Group. There are also academic coordinators. In Valle del Cauca each public 
defender had to serve at an average of 100 trials per month. In Cali there is an office for 
criminalistics support financed by international contributions.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Legal framework for detention 
</b></p>
<p>22. The human rights treaties ratified by the Republic form part of the Constitution. Any law 
that contradicts them shall be deemed to be unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p>23. Article 28 of the Constitution establishes the legal prerequisites for deprivation of liberty. 
There must be legal grounds for detention, except in cases of flagrante delicto. The old Code of 
Criminal Procedure (Act No. 600 of 24 July 2000), which imposed an inquisitorial system, was 
replaced by the new Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No. 906 of 2004). The new Code was 
applied progressively, starting with the most populous areas: it has now been in force nationwide 
since 1 January 2008. Act No. 600 is still in force for crimes committed before 1 January 2005 
and for cases the investigation of which began before the new system had come into force. 
In practice, this has extended the application of earlier Act No. 600 to crimes committed up to 
31 December 2007 in some departments, such as Arauca. Under the system imposed by Act 
No. 600, the prosecutor investigates the case and the judge makes a ruling. In fact, the former 
serves more as an investigating magistrate than as a prosecutor. The prosecutor may issue arrest 
warrants. Although the sentence is pronounced orally in a public hearing, the rest of the 
proceedings take place in writing. 
</p>
<p>24. The new Code of Criminal Procedure, Act No. 906, establishes, as in most countries in 
Latin America, the adversarial system, which is oral and public. The National Police is 
responsible for the preliminary investigation to establish that a crime has been committed and 
identify the main suspects and accessories, and must submit an executive report to the competent 
prosecutor within 36 hours. The prosecutor must take charge of the investigation, determine if 
there are sufficient grounds to institute pretrial proceedings, and draw up a methodology for the 
investigation.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>25.  All bodies with judicial police functions - the National Police, Department of National 
Security, and the Technical Investigation Unit of the Office of the Attorney-General - are 
supervised and coordinated by the Office of the Attorney-General. 
</p>
<p>26.  Before issuing an arrest warrant, the supervisory judge verifies whether the principles of 
necessity, proportionality and reasonableness have been respected. All detainees must be 
promptly brought before the supervisory judge and within the maximum time limit of 36 hours. 
The judge must verify the legality of the detention and formalize the arrest in a preliminary 
hearing established specifically for that purpose (Act No. 906, art. 154). The judge must check 
that the detainee&#8217;s rights were respected when he or she was apprehended; whether he or she was 
informed of his or her rights; whether those rights were enforced, for example, allowing the 
detainee to make a telephone call; and that the person was not ill-treated. If the prosecutor 
believes that the detainee is the perpetrator of or accessory to a crime under investigation, he or 
she shall formally accuse the detainee at the preliminary hearing. 
</p>
<p>27. If the material evidence shows beyond reasonable doubt that a crime was committed and 
that the accused was the perpetrator or an accessory, the prosecutor shall file an indictment and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  Act No. 906, arts. 201 and 205. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the judge shall convene the indictment hearing within three days, during which time the 
discovery of evidence shall begin. The pretrial hearing subsequently takes place and the parties 
express their views on the evidence discovery process. The judge orders the taking of the 
evidence requested by the prosecution and the defence and sets a date and time for the oral 
proceedings.  
</p>
<p>28. The oral proceedings begin with the presentation of the case and continue with the 
examination of evidence, in the form of either testimony, expert witness accounts, documents, 
character witness accounts or eye witness accounts, followed by the allegations of the parties and 
participants, and concludes with the sentencing. 
</p>
<p>29. However, since oral adversarial criminal proceedings were instituted under Act No. 906, 
there have been certain setbacks in the system for guaranteeing personal freedom, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) Act No. 1098 of 2006, the Children and Adolescents Code, which prohibits reduced 
sentences or privileges if the victim is a child; 
</p>
<p> (b) Act No. 1121 of 2006, which establishes that no privileges shall be granted when a 
serious crime has been committed (for example, terrorism or drug trafficking); 
</p>
<p> (c) Act No. 1142 of 2007, which establishes that the seriousness of the crime shall 
influence the security measures, increases the penalties that can be applied and reduces the 
minimum criteria for pretrial detention. It is perhaps owing to this Act that pretrial detention is 
used in 65 per cent of cases. 
</p>
<p>30. Act No. 1153, known as the Minor Offences Act would have been another serious 
backward step had the Constitutional Court not subsequently declared it totally unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p>31. There is generally a widespread view that since the new Code was promulgated the trend 
has been to reduce the powers of the judges responsible for procedural safeguards. 
</p><p>32. Existing remedies include habeas corpus, remedy of protection, remedy of enforcement 
and remedy of the protection of public rights, all of which are clearly defined. Although habeas 
corpus can be applied by any court, not just a criminal court, it is not frequently used. It is not 
used in a court case or in connection with detention ordered by a competent judicial authority. If 
detainees are already suspects, they must seek their release from the judge responsible for 
procedural safeguards. In Colombia, there is a narrow interpretation of habeas corpus and it is 
usually used only in cases where the maximum time limit of 36 hours in police custody has been 
exceeded. There is no culture of habeas corpus appeals among non-governmental organizations. 
Applications for legal protection are filed in cases of threats to personal freedom.  
</p>
<p>33. During the meeting that the Working Group held with judges of the High Court of Justice 
of Valle del Cauca it learned that 275 habeas corpus appeals had been lodged in that jurisdiction 
in 2007, only 3 of them declared well-founded: 1 for a case of mistaken identity (the person was 
apprehended on 6 January 2007 and released 2 days later); another because the detainee had been 
held for 5 days in the police station; and the third because the detainee had not been tried within 
the maximum time limit of 90 days. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  OBSERVATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUP 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Report by National Police officers of the time limits on  
detention in police stations and proper record-keeping 
</b></p>
<p>34.  A range of legislative and managerial measures have been put in place in Colombia in 
order to ensure that when National Police officers arrest offenders they bring them before the 
judicial authorities within 36 hours of their arrest or apprehension, which is a significant 
achievement. 
</p>
<p>35. A large proportion of the police officers interviewed said that detainees should be brought 
before the authorities within the 36-hour period and not at the end of that period, as wrongly 
interpreted in other countries. The situation at the temporary holding cells of the central 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Bogot&#225; was different: the Working Group noted that several persons had 
been there for much longer than the permitted maximum of 36 hours - some had been there for 
almost three months. When asked, the Public Prosecutor stated that it was for reasons connected 
to the judicial process, as required by the investigation or the detainee&#8217;s protection.<b>9</b> 
36. During its visits to official detention centres, the Working Group observed that detainee 
records are generally well kept, recording the date and time of detention; the authority that 
approved the detention; the officer making the arrest; and the date and time the detainee was 
brought before a court. The signatures or fingerprints of detainees confirm this information. The 
interviews with the detainees made it possible to confirm these facts. However, the Working 
Group heard of unofficial detention centres, whose records it would obviously be impossible to 
check. The Government stated that it had no knowledge of the existence of any such unofficial 
detention centres.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Judicial services centres 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Working Group welcomes the initiative of establishing judicial services centres, called 
Immediate Reaction Units (URIs), which bring together in a single location representatives of 
the security police, judicial police, Office of the Attorney-General, Office of the People&#8217;s 
Advocate and the judges responsible for procedural safeguards. This obviously facilitates 
compliance with the 36-hour maximum time limit on detention and an expeditious preliminary 
hearing to formalize the arrest.

</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  One case involved a key witness in the investigation of the so-called &#8220;parapol&#237;tica&#8221; case: the 
</p>
<p>alleged connection between certain members of the legislature and paramilitary organizations. A 
person detained for drug trafficking was subjected to 16 proceedings and his interrogation lasted 
12 days. Another person detained for drug trafficking had been held since 11 July 2008. One 
detainee had heart trouble and suffered from diabetes. Another was there because of an express 
request from the investigator, enforced through a custody order. A third had been transferred 
from Cali and a fourth from Pasto (Nari&#241;o).  </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The work of the Office of the Procurator-General 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Working Group was able to appreciate the sterling efforts being made by the Office of 
the Procurator-General in relation to the protection of human rights, both in its role as Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and as guarantor of due process and the right to a defence in judicial 
proceedings. It is a long-standing Colombian institution, established in 1830, and has a 
disciplinary role with regard to public officials, including military and police officials. Its 
authorities jealously guard their autonomy and independence and demonstrated vast knowledge 
of the human rights situation in Colombia. 
</p>
<p>39. The Office of the Procurator-General plays an important role in apprehensions and arrests 
because it verifies fulfilment of the legal requirements. It also plays a preventive role: in Arauca, 
for example, it gave specific instructions to police officers not to carry out administrative 
detentions. Nevertheless, the passivity of this institution in the face of numerous cases of mass 
detentions has been criticized nationwide. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Offices of the Municipal Attorney 
</b></p>
<p>40. In the department of Valle del Cauca there are 118 municipal attorneys. Each is 
responsible for supervising three or four police stations, and 35 attorneys are responsible for 
supervising the department&#8217;s prisons. The offices of the municipal and district attorneys are 
public and are open to the community 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Working Group 
witnessed the useful work being done by one of these offices in the city of Cali. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Judges responsible for procedural safeguards 
</b></p>
<p>41. The existence and work of the judges responsible for procedural safeguards, who preside 
over the preliminary hearings established under the new Code, is also worth special attention. 
They are, in fact, constitutional judges in a criminal case. Their role is to protect personal 
freedom.  
</p>
<p><b>F.  Human rights committees in prisons 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Working Group was pleasantly surprised to discover in each prison block, or rather in 
each yard, human rights committees that had been democratically elected by the detainees by 
secret ballot. The committees coordinate their work with a guard who acts as a human rights 
ambassador. The ambassadors help the detainees draft their requests for conditional release. The 
members of the committees seemed to be very familiar with the situations of those they 
represented and they showed the Working Group a selection of complaints and requests, the 
majority of which were related to prison conditions, but also to the lack of visits by enforcement 
judges and difficulties with interviews with lawyers. The committees are the concrete 
manifestation of the right of prisoners to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and to the 
protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>43. When consulted by the Working Group, the detainees referred in positive terms to the 
work of the committees. The committees&#8217; very existence helps reduce tension in prisons. The 
Working Group considers this to be an initiative that could be replicated in other countries. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>G.  The gap observed between the Constitution, the law and reality 
</b></p>
<p>44. Even though the institutional design of the Constitution as a protector of basic rights, the 
numerous international human rights instruments ratified and the progress made in the area of 
criminal procedure law show a fair degree of sophistication, there remains a marked contrast 
with reality. Although many of the sources consulted accept that there had been an improvement 
in the country&#8217;s security situation and that there are now fewer mass arrests, particularly in 
comparison with the period before 2005, arbitrary detentions are still taking place. 
</p>
<p>45. The Working Group heard allegations that prosecution was being used as a way of 
repressing certain categories of social worker, including municipal leaders, representatives of 
internally displaced persons, trade unionists, and journalists who are accused of slander and of 
making false criminal accusations. Particular concern was expressed for indigenous people, 
minors, pregnant women, female heads of household, immigrants and the poor. It is alleged that 
networks of security force informers who are paid have been set up for their information, as well 
as networks of unpaid collaborators. There were warnings of a policy of compensating those who 
provide information. Reintegrated guerrillas are forced to provide information, which often leads 
to detentions. 
</p>
<p>46. Various NGOs blamed the current situation on the Democratic Security Policy, designed 
by the President and implemented since 2002. The Deputy Minister of Defence explained to the 
Working Group that the aim of the policy is the recovery and control of the territory and to 
extend the State&#8217;s presence to areas from which it had defected. Under Act No. 975 of 2005 - 
known as the Justice and Peace Act - thousands of members of paramilitary organizations had 
handed in their weapons and demobilized, exempt from criminal responsibility and without 
trial.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>47. The Act proposes reduced sentences of a maximum of eight years for tried and 
convicted combatants. According to Government sources, some 3,000 persons have taken this 
option, while the estimate of the prosecutor&#8217;s office was 2,000. However, lawyers and 
members of NGOs estimate that only 245 persons have done so. According to the Government, 
3,593 members of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (United Self-Defence Forces of 
Colombia) (AUC) and 90 members of guerrilla groups have demobilized under the Justice and 
Peace Act. 
</p>
<p>48. According to the authorities, Act No. 975 has made it possible to solve 3,000 crimes, to 
find the bodies of 1,778 persons that had been executed and to locate 1,441 mass graves. 
However, some demobilized paramilitaries have formed new armed groups and returned to their 
criminal activities. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  The purpose of Act No. 975 of 2005 - known as the Justice and Peace Act - is to &#8220;facilitate 
</p>
<p>peace negotiations and the return, individually and collectively, of members of the illegal armed 
groups to civilian life while guaranteeing victims&#8217; rights to truth, justice and reparation&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.3

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>49. The Office of the Procurator-General estimates that there were 2,412 reports of arbitrary 
detention between 1 January 2002 and 30 September 2008. If all of these reports were genuine, it 
would mean that there were some 400 arbitrary detentions a year, although the number would 
appear to have decreased since 2005. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Administrative pretrial detention powers of the National Police 
</b></p>
<p>50. The administrative pretrial detention powers of the National Police have not been defined 
with the precision and rigour required by individual freedom. Although the Code of Criminal 
Procedure establishes that police officers may detain a person only when they have an arrest 
warrant from a competent judge or in cases of flagrante delicto, some police officers interpret 
this to mean that they have powers to detain persons for other broad and vague motives, without 
being subject to judicial review. This is the case with detentions of persons who are in a highly 
agitated state; bothering passers-by, drunkenness; or represent a risk to themselves and the 
inhabitants. As a result, police officers take citizens (usually the socially vulnerable) to police 
stations without any legal justification and, what is more, without keeping a log of the arrests or 
the detention period. 
</p>
<p>51. National Police officers continue to detain citizens to check their identity or to determine 
whether they have a criminal or police record. These motives do not justify depriving citizens of 
their liberty, which must always be considered a protected legal right. Some authorities 
explained that these citizens were not being detained, but simply &#8220;held&#8221;, which was justified by 
Constitutional Court judgement No. C-024 of 1994. The Working Group considers the term 
&#8220;held&#8221; to be a euphemism because these persons are in fact deprived of their liberty. The 
Working Group received allegations that minors had been detained by the National Police, not 
for having committed an offence, but for a &#8220;manifest proclivity to commit an offence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>52. In 2008, complaints against National Police officers submitted to the Office of the 
Attorney-General numbered 839, 26 of them related to illegal deprivation of liberty and illegal 
holding. Under article 38, paragraph 2, of Act No. 734 of 2002, any officer who receives three 
administrative sanctions in five years shall be disqualified for a period of three years. In serious 
cases, the officer is dismissed, which has happened in 353 cases. 
</p>
<p>53. It would be desirable for new legislation to define clearly the powers of detention of the 
National Police in these cases, confirming the validity of the legal prerequisites for detention and 
that it is not possible to detain persons simply with a view to checking their identity, determining 
whether they have outstanding legal penalties or protecting the detainee, in its case law of the 
aforementioned Constitutional Court judgement No. C-024 of 1994, allowed for enforcement of 
article 77 of the National Police Code and the abuse of administrative pretrial detention, which, 
furthermore, is applied without the necessary safeguards. Although the Court considered that this 
measure could be applied in exceptional cases and only when there were well-founded, objective 
and clear reasons for doing so, the National Police continue to detain persons, on the basis of 
mere suspicion, for purposes other than to check or confirm objective facts and without there 
being an urgent or imminently dangerous situation. This practice goes against the principles of 
legality, equality, non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.3 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>54. Recently, Constitutional Court judgement No. C-720 of 11 September 2007 declared 
unconstitutional article 192 of Decree-Law No. 1355 of 1970, a rule of the National Police Code 
that granted powers to station and substation chiefs to detain persons in a state of agitation. 
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group was told of plans to replace the current National Police Code with a 
new Civil Coexistence Act, which would provide better guarantees and be more geared to 
protecting citizens&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p><b>I.  Detentions in city neighbourhoods 
</b></p>
<p>56. The National Police is continuing its practice of carrying out round-ups or raids in big 
cities, justifying the practice as a preventive measure. Communities of sexual minorities 
complained of being detained frequently because of their appearance or clothes. Beggars, the 
destitute, vagrants, people who look suspicious, and even street vendors, whose goods are 
confiscated, are also detained. 
</p>
<p>57. In Cali, a joint inspection by the supervisory judge and the Office of the People&#8217;s Advocate 
confirmed the detention of 18 transsexuals who were deprived of their liberty for more 
than 36 hours and who were allegedly raped and mistreated. 
</p>
<p>58. Police authorities explained that on many occasions these practices took place at the 
request of mayors who wanted the parks and streets to be cleared of such people. For example, 
by decree No. 092 B of 30 April 2007, the Mayor of the Municipality of Buenaventura 
authorized the police to &#8220;carry out the checks necessary to hold temporarily persons who have 
outstanding issues with the law until their legal situation has been clarified&#8221;. The police 
proceeded to carry out mass detentions, including many Afro-Colombian minors. 
</p>
<p><b>J.  Detentions in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Working Group was informed that, although the army and the navy do not legally 
have powers of detention, the fact that it is impossible for the National Police to reach isolated 
rural areas or conflict zones means that soldiers assist the prosecutor&#8217;s office under Procedural 
Act No. 600. The army continues to carry out detentions and arrests, whether supported by 
orders issued by prosecutors, carrying out arrests accompanied by a prosecutor, or exercising the 
power of any citizen to arrest anyone in the act of committing an offence. 
</p>
<p>60. Although it is claimed that the number of mass or multiple detentions has decreased 
dramatically since 2005, the army continues in this practice. Soldiers frequently hold the entire 
population of a village or hamlet in a square or other specific location while demobilized or 
reformed deserters from guerrilla groups identify individuals, who are immediately detained. 
Given the inconsistencies in the statements, which are general and vague, and the absence of 
other evidence, the majority are usually released a short time later, but others are prosecuted. 
According to the military authorities, the army merely accompanies the prosecutors and secures 
the perimeter. Detentions are also carried out on the basis of information contained in databases 
that have not been updated or in military intelligence reports. The armed forces&#8217; archives have 
thus become a source of detentions. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>61. Mass detentions usually take place in remote rural areas of the country (mainly in the 
departments of Antioquia, Arauca, Bol&#237;var and Norte de Santander), where Act No. 600 is 
applied to events that took place before 1 January 2005 or to investigations that had begun before 
the new system came into force in the different departments. 
</p>
<p>62. The Working Group received numerous accounts and reports regarding the lack of equity 
demonstrated by prosecutors and judges in assessing evidence: the former when requesting 
precautionary measures and bringing charges, and the latter when formalizing arrests and 
sentencing. The testimony of a former member of a guerrilla group who has been reintegrated 
into society or demobilized suffices, with no other evidence, for an arrest warrant to be issued. 
It is claimed that there is a directive, covered by military secrecy, offering a minimum 
of 3.6 million pesos (about $1,600) for each insurgent demobilized and establishing a rate for 
accusatory testimony against former comrades. It has not been possible to prove the existence of 
this directive. 
</p>
<p>63. Among others, the Group learned about the cases of Cajib&#237;o, Santa Rosa, and Caruto in the 
department of Cauca; the cases of Florida and Pradera; the case of El Queremal in the 
municipality of Dagua (all of those affected have now been released) and the case of the 
<i>Corregimiento</i> (indigenous community) of Cisneros (municipality of Buenaventura). In this last, 
36 campesinos, indigenous persons and Afro-Colombians were detained during a mass arrest 
on 27 July 2003. It was alleged to be a case of flagrante delicto as there was known to be 
guerrilla activity in the area. On 5 March 2006, staff from the prosecutor&#8217;s office, the 
Department of National Security and the army, after rounding up the inhabitants in the village 
of Puerto Jord&#225;n, separated 13 persons for whom they had an arrest warrant. On 12 and 
13 August 2006, 13 persons were arrested in the municipality of Fortul, the majority of them 
social leaders and members of trade unions. On 2 and 3 June 2007, 15 persons were detained 
in Arauquita, Arauca. The municipal attorney was detained on 12 January 2008 together 
with 10 other persons. On 15 June 2008, 16 persons were detained in various rural districts of 
Arauca. 
</p>
<p>64. This situation has led to the theory that the State has used the law and the courts to press 
criminal charges against persons who are obviously innocent, usually social, municipal and trade 
union leaders, with a view to stigmatizing them and to justify further repressive measures. In 
Arauca, members of the communal action committees of the municipal districts have been 
detained simply on the basis of the testimony of two former guerrillas. The National Police in 
Arauca informed the Working Group that it had carried out 809 arrests in 2007, and 369 between 
January and September 2008. All those arrested had been handed over to the support unit of the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>65. Act No. 600, which governs these detentions, does not distinguish between the accusation 
and the decision to deprive the accused of liberty. Although it is possible to appeal for the 
detention to be declared unlawful, the necessary distinction, which requires the deprivation of 
liberty to be carried out by a different body to that which ordered it, is lacking. 
</p>
<p><b>K.  Round-ups, forced enlistment and &#8220;false positives&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Working Group notes with concern the arrests carried out by military personnel, in 
particular the practice of round-ups, despite the fact that the army does not have legal powers to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.3 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>do so. On some occasions, soldiers have orders to arrest a few persons, but arrest many more. 
One variation is forced enlistment: mass detentions of young persons with a view to checking 
their military status. Those who are deemed to have failed to register, to respond to being called 
up or to have performed military service are taken to the barracks for forced recruitment. The 
Deputy Minister of Defence declared that every young male must carry on his person his military 
service record or the document confirming the postponement of his military service because 
military service is not only the right, but the obligation of all male citizens. By and large, it is not 
the army, but illegal armed groups who forcibly recruit minors. The Working Group considered 
complaints from conscientious objectors who said that their objections were not taken into 
account. The Working Group has already deemed that the refusal to recognize the right of 
conscientious objection contravenes international human rights law. 
67. The most serious concern is that senior State authorities have supported mass arrests.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>68. A situation that has alarmed Colombian civil society and the international community is 
the practice of &#8220;false positives&#8221;. With a view to obtaining privileges, recognition or special leave, 
soldiers detain innocent people without any valid reason and then execute them. Their bodies 
appear the day following their disappearance tens of kilometres away and are identified as 
members of illegal armed groups killed in combat. These are mainly vulnerable people - street 
dwellers, adolescents from poor areas of big cities, drug addicts and beggars - who are dressed in 
a uniform and executed. In some cases, for example in Soacha, young people are tricked with 
promises of work and transferred to a place where they are finally executed. 
</p>
<p>69. This practice led to the recent - but somewhat tardy - resignation of the 
Commander-in-Chief of the army and the dismissal of 27 soldiers on the President&#8217;s orders. 
These cases will be dealt with by the ordinary courts. 
</p>
<p>70. Eight adults and one 17-year-old disappeared between January and August 2008 in 
Soacha, a slum area of the capital. Their bodies were buried in separate unmarked graves in the 
cemetery of Oca&#241;a, Norte de Santander, 400 kilometres from Bogot&#225;. Two other victims 
appeared in Cimitarra. It was claimed that they were guerrillas who were killed in combat. In 
fact, they were poor adolescents from a disadvantaged neighbourhood. It was obviously thought 
that their disappearance would go unnoticed. In the region of Bajo Ariari, the bodies of various 
disappeared campesinos were presented tens of kilometres away as guerrillas who had been 
killed in combat. The Working Group was informed that more than 3,000 members of the army 
are under investigation by the Office of the Attorney-General and the Office of the 
Procurator-General, some for cases of &#8220;false positives&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  On International Human Rights Day, during a coffee growers&#8217; congress, the President 
</p>
<p>recognized that &#8220;last week I said to General Castro Castro that in that zone [Caldas, and 
Risaralda] we could not continue with mass arrests of 40 or 50 persons every Sunday, rather we 
would have to aim for 200, to speed up the imprisonment of terrorists and to strike back at these 
organizations. These have been mass arrests, but not arbitrary ones. They were in full conformity 
with the law. They were carried out following the careful examination of the evidence.&#8221; See 
www.presidencia.gov.co. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>71. Even when persons are released, they are stigmatized by the detention. If people are 
subsequently found executed, it is said that they had been detained on a previous occasion, 
implying that they had been members of an illegal armed group. That is what happened to 
the eminent academic, Alfredo Correa, who, after being accused by former guerrillas of 
belonging to an armed group, arbitrarily detained, stigmatized and released, was killed 
on 17 September 2004. 
</p>
<p>72. In 2008, mass detentions were carried out in Barrancabermeja, in Magdalena Medio and in 
Caquet&#225; (where the Consolidation Plan, which replaced the Patriot Plan, is being implemented). 
The majority were released, but those that remain in detention are mainly leaders of trade unions 
and campesino or women&#8217;s organizations. In San Vicente del Cagu&#225;n, the prosecutor&#8217;s office 
issued 59 arrest warrants, and 12 community leaders are still in detention. In May 2008, the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office in Remolinos del Cagu&#225;n issued 25 arrest warrants for terrorism, rebellion 
and drug trafficking; only 10 persons remain in detention. This confirms allegations that the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office is rather quick to issue arrest warrants. In Uni&#243;n Pereira, the army carried out 
mass arrests: the inhabitants were detained in a sports complex where their identity documents 
were confiscated and they were filmed with a video camera. 
</p>
<p>73. There were also mass detentions in Caquet&#225; (following which five persons remain in 
detention) and Putumayo (15 persons remain in detention; one of the detainees, Mr. Heriberto 
P&#243;veda V&#225;squez, who was terminally ill, died in prison). Various leaders of the Campesino 
Association of Valle del R&#237;o Cimitarra have been detained. Five hundred students from the 
Del Valle University are under investigation. In April 2008, three were detained; one remains in 
detention. There were also mass detentions in Arauca, Arauquita, Saravena and Montes de 
Mar&#237;a. The prosecutor&#8217;s office decided not to press charges in the cases where the detainee had 
spent more than six months in pretrial detention because there was insufficient evidence to go to 
trial. 
</p>
<p>74. On 12 January 2008 there were mass detentions in the municipality of Arauquita. In recent 
years the criminal courts of Arauca have had to be transferred to Bogot&#225; for security reasons. 
The majority of the cases relate to the offences of rebellion and terrorism, for which the Special 
Prosecutor against Terrorism, located in the capital is the competent authority. This necessitates 
the transfer of detainees to Bogot&#225;. The difficulties posed by this transfer regarding the exercise 
of the right to a defence and of equality of arms are understandable considering the distance 
separating detainees from their defence counsel and the difficulties involved in submitting and 
examining exculpatory evidence and in ensuring that the defence witnesses can appear before the 
court. 
</p>
<p>75. Similarly, the right to a defence is also called into question by the fact that the unit of the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office responsible for these investigations, called the support unit, is located within 
the barracks of the 18th Brigade. While this does not affect the organizational independence of 
the two institutions, it makes physical access to the prosecutor&#8217;s office difficult for defence 
witnesses. </p>

</p>
<p><b>L.  Serious delays in judicial proceedings 
</b>76. Although the introduction of the adversarial system of criminal justice and oral 
proceedings represent an extraordinary step forward in terms of guarantees against arbitrary 
detentions, the Working Group observes that there are still serious delays in the criminal 
proceedings under Act No. 600. Given the principle of prompt process in adversarial criminal 
proceedings, it is feared that judges, prosecutors, procurators and public defenders may forget 
about those who are in detention under Act No. 600, as has happened in other countries. To give 
an indication, of the 103 public defenders in Cali, only 3 have been assigned to proceedings 
under the earlier Code.  
</p>
<p><b>M.  Absence of enforcement judges in prisons 
</b>77. The Working Group found that the absence of enforcement judges in prisons was a 
generalized complaint among detainees, particularly in the Villa Hermosa prison in Cali. The 
enforcement judges&#8217; workload seems excessive: some of them are responsible for a very large 
number of cases. This often prevents them not only from having direct, periodic and regular 
contact with detainees, but also from visiting prisons on a regular basis. There are 102 
enforcement judges. In Arauca, an enforcement judge was appointed as recently as 2008. 
78. The weaknesses that the Working Group noted while observing the deprivation of liberty 
procedures require vigilant action by these judges, who must ensure the observance of all the 
guarantees established by law and make sure that prisoners who deserve to enjoy the prison 
privileges allowed by law, particularly conditional release, may do so.  
</p>
<p><b>N.  Prison overcrowding 
</b></p>
<p>79. At the time of the Working Group&#8217;s visit in October 2008, 69,600 persons were being 
deprived of liberty in Colombia in 140 prisons administered by the National Institute of 
Penitentiaries and Prisons, a decentralized institution under the Ministry of the Interior and 
Justice. Another 30,400 persons were being held under house arrest or subjected to other 
restrictions on their freedom. Sixty-five per cent of the prison population had been convicted 
and 35 per cent had been charged. 
</p>
<p>80. According to official sources at the National Institute of Penitentiaries and Prisons 
(INPEC), overcrowding has climbed to 28.9 per cent. In 2006, it was only 17 per cent and the 
increase is due to the Minor Offences Act. The Working Group&#8217;s visit took place during 
&#8220;Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week&#8221;, which was organized at the request of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights within the framework of the celebration 
of the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In this regard, the 
Working Group cannot fail to highlight its concern at the high degree of overcrowding observed 
in the prisons of La Picota in Bogot&#225;, Villa Hermosa and Palmira in Cali, and the prison in 
Arauca. La Picota has 3,605 inmates, 3,019 of them convicted and 584 charged. Villa Hermosa 
houses 2,286 convicts and 1,794 accused and is at 160 per cent of its capacity. In the same 
city, the prison of Palmira houses 3,019 convicts and 584 accused. The Arauca prison 
houses 309 prisoners, 253 of them are charged and 56 convicted. </p>

<p>81. Some of those interviewed claimed that no daylight entered the blocks where they were 
housed, that they could not go out into the yard and, in other cases, sick prisoners complained 
that they did not receive the specialized medical attention they needed, thus violating the Body 
of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>82. The Working Group was informed that holding detainees incommunicado had been 
proscribed, but not in all establishments. It also criticized the delay in implementing release 
orders once the release papers had been received. Once the prison receives those papers, the 
authorities check whether or not the person has been summoned before any other courts. Only 
when it has received a negative response from all the courts does it release the prisoner. This 
process could be started sufficiently in advance so as to avoid extending the person&#8217;s 
imprisonment beyond their sentence. 
</p>
<p><b>O.  Citizen&#8217;s captures and arrests  
</b></p>
<p>83. In some areas of the country, the authorities have delegated to private security company 
employees, as well as to mining and oil companies and other individuals, the powers to carry out 
arrests, which should always be restricted to public officials as a matter of State authority. It is 
untenable to argue that these powers stem from the obligation to detain anyone committing an 
offence in flagrante delicto in the absence of the security forces or when the number of security 
force personnel is limited. Flagrante delicto refers to specific cases limited in time and cannot be 
used to justify this practice, which simply conceals the State&#8217;s failure to fulfil its basic 
responsibilities. The fact is that these calls on individuals to detain persons are perceived by their 
intended audience, as well as by all of Colombian society, as an incitation and a delegation of 
duties to deprive citizens of their liberty without any authority taking responsibility. According 
to the Government, cases of flagrante delicto are clearly defined and judges apply a narrow 
interpretation of the definition.  
</p>
<p><b>P.  Detention of persons with mental disabilities  
</b></p>
<p>84. The Working Group visited the Virgen de la Paz Clinic in Bogot&#225;, governed by the 
hospital authority of San Juan de Dios and under contract to the Ministry of Social Protection. 
During the Group&#8217;s visit, this clinic housed 35 patients, although at times it has housed as many 
as 75. Many had already been sentenced and their sentences included a period of detention in a 
psychiatric facility.  
</p>
<p>85. The clinic also received patients who had not been sent by the courts, but who had been 
brought by their families. In these cases the psychiatrist&#8217;s report had been confirmed by the 
forensic medical expert.<b>12</b> Any detainee who does not agree with their detention may apply for a 
writ of habeas corpus. The authorities declared that, sometimes, even when the doctors 
considered that patients were ready for release, their families refused to receive them and they 
had to remain in the clinic.

<p><b>Q.  Detention of minors 
</b>86. In Bogot&#225;, D.C., the Working Group visited the El Redentor Working School and, in 
Arauca, the Temporary Shelter for Young Offenders. The Group noted that the latter was a type 
of depot or warehouse with bars on the windows, with a warden on duty, where an 11-year-old 
girl was detained for possession of psychoactive substances. Children in trouble with the law, 
indigenous minors and destitute adolescents are commonly detained there. 
</p>
<p>87. Act No. 1098, the Children and Adolescents Code, has been in force in Colombia (but not 
yet in Bogot&#225;) since 15 March 2007. The Act is an attempt to apply the principle of the best 
interests of the child as enshrined in international instruments and establishes a juvenile criminal 
justice system. The new Code is based on the premise that the minor is responsible and that the 
penalties imposed on minors should aim to rehabilitate, educate and protect. Under the new 
system, the police force for children and adolescents apprehends young offenders and brings 
them before the supervisory judge, accompanied by the Family Ombudsman, within 36 hours of 
their apprehension. Minors can be tried only from the age of 15 years. Minors aged 14 cannot be 
tried, found criminally responsible or deprived of liberty, but they are brought before a judge to 
answer for their actions. The penalty of supervised freedom can be imposed on them, with the 
commitment to present themselves periodically before the Colombian Family Welfare Institute 
(ICBF), or semi-confinement (where they attend a rehabilitation centre only in the daytime). 
</p>
<p>88. The majority of detained minors are in detention for the illegal possession of weapons, 
theft, drug trafficking, homicide, attempted homicide and personal injury. The maximum penalty 
that can be imposed on them is eight years for crimes against humanity, even though the 
maximum penalty under the old Minors&#8217; Code was only three years.<b>13</b> The penalty can be 
reduced by half if the young offender pleads guilty to the charges. There is always the possibility 
of appealing to a hybrid court made up of criminal and family magistrates. The most common 
offences involving adolescents are theft, trafficking and possession of drugs and illegal 
possession of weapons. 
</p>
<p>89. Minors aged between 14 and 16 years may be deprived of liberty only if they have 
committed the offences of homicide, kidnapping or extortion. Minors aged between 16 
and 18 years may be detained in establishments of the Colombian Family Welfare Institute 
(ICBF) only if they have committed offences warranting a sentence of six years&#8217; imprisonment 
(sexual abuse, domestic violence or aggravated theft). The new Children&#8217;s Act is not yet in force 
in the department of Cundinamarca. 
</p>
<p>90. Between 15 March 2007 and 31 August 2008, 5,000 minors in Bogot&#225; alone were 
processed through the Criminal Justice System for Adolescents for committing an offence. Of 
those, 200 are in pretrial detention and 100 have already been sentenced.

<p><b>R.  Detention of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>91. The Department of National Security is responsible for migration and manages the arrival 
and departure of foreigners at the ports, airports and land borders. It authorizes extensions of 
permission to remain in the country, issues identity cards for foreigners, safe-conducts and 
judicial certificates for foreigners and collaborates with the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees in determining refugee status.<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>92. More than a destination country for migrants, Colombia is a transit country for persons, 
mainly from South America and Asia, who intend to continue their journey onwards to the 
United States of America. Department of National Security officials informed the Working 
Group that they had observed, since June 2008, an increase in the flow of Chinese migrants 
coming from Ecuador, seeking to travel to the United States of America via the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela. On 21 September 2008, eight Chinese citizens, including four minors, 
were found concealed in a truck transporting garlic between Ipiales, on the border with Ecuador, 
and C&#250;cuta, on the border with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>93. Foreigners who are in an illegal situation, either because they have no visa or their visa has 
expired, are detained prior to being deported. If they cannot be deported before the legal time 
limit has expired they must be released.  
</p>
<p>94. Colombia is mainly a country of emigration: almost 50,000 Colombians leave the country 
every month. The main destinations are the United States of America, Spain, France and 
Switzerland, as well as Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Many are victims of 
people-smuggling and they can pay over 20,000 United States dollars to be transported to 
another country. Unlike what occurs in other countries, Colombians deported from another 
country for illegal immigration are not detained on their arrival in Colombia.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Working Group highlights certain efforts made by the Government of Colombia 
to provide the country with a legal framework for detention that observes all the 
guarantees established in international human rights instruments, such as the entry into 
force of Act No. 906, the new Code of Criminal Procedure.  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> It regrets, however, that there have also been some backward steps, such as those 
highlighted in paragraph 28 above, and that the new criminal procedure legislation has 
been brought in alongside the old, as established under Act No. 600, for offences committed 
while the latter was still in force, for the simple reason that the events took place prior to 
the entry into force of the new legislation. Similarly, Act No. 1142 decreases to a large 
extent the effectiveness of the new legal system.

<p> 
</p>
<p>97.<b> The Working Group considers that, in accordance with article 9, paragraph 3, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, pretrial detention should be used only 
in exceptional circumstances, and that deprivation of freedom of persons whose guilt has 
not yet been proven by a court should be avoided. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The Group noted that the prosecutor&#8217;s office issues a great many arrest warrants 
without significant objective evidence and based solely on the testimony of former 
guerrillas who have been demobilized or reintegrated into society and who obtain 
privileges for their testimony. The targets of these arrests, under warrants that are based 
on insufficient evidence, are often human rights defenders, community leaders, trade 
unionists, indigenous people and campesinos. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> In the Group&#8217;s view, mass detentions do not allow each person to be treated as an 
individual in criminal proceedings, which are meant to determine the guilt of each accused 
person.  
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The lack of legal regulation of administrative pretrial detention, and the failure to 
implement the rigorous requirements of Constitutional Court judgement No. C-024 of 1994 
have led to many arbitrary detentions. Similarly, the delegation - express or accepted - to 
companies or individuals of powers to detain, as well as the loose interpretation of flagrante 
delicto have also led to many arbitrary detentions. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> The Working Group noted a fierce tension between the judicial and executive 
branches, which manifested itself in a strike of the judiciary that lasted more than 40 days 
and was taking place during the Group&#8217;s visit. The strike affected the legal framework for 
detention which basically concerns the guarantees resulting from the work of the judges. 
</b>102.<b> The Working Group considers that public defenders are, in the majority of cases, 
doing their jobs professionally and to a high standard. However, some detainees reported 
cases of corruption among the lawyers performing this task, which calls into question their 
positive assessment and considers such cases must be duly eradicated. 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> In the light of the above observations, the Working Group suggests that the 
Government of Colombia should consider the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Repeal the legal provisions that contradict the legal framework for detention in 
the Code of Criminal Procedure contained in Act No. 906; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Amend its legislation so that the new Code is valid for any offence, regardless of 
the date on which it was committed, while maintaining the exception for proceedings that 
were already under way under Act No. 600; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.3 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Put a stop to the practice and justification of administrative pretrial detention 
from the law, and from the actions and public discourse of the authorities and give due 
consideration to the draft Civil Coexistence Code; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Put a stop to mass detentions that deprive persons of liberty even though no 
individual arrest warrant has been obtained in advance and the individual has not been 
caught in flagrante delicto; and to arrests with warrants that are based on insufficient 
evidence, such as the testimony of former guerrillas; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Eradicate from discourse and practice the support for or justification of any 
detention carried out by members of the armed forces, ensuring that they do not have 
powers of deprivation of liberty, imposing appropriate penalties for any such detentions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Adopt the policy recommended in the previous section also in respect of illegal 
arrests made by agents of private security, mining or oil company agents or other 
individuals; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Provide and ensure that, when members of the army, navy or agents of private 
companies detain a person, the National Police officials at the places of detention, the 
prosecutors and the judges that receive them identify those who carried out the arrest and 
question them about the detention and the events that led to it; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Appoint judges specializing in expedited procedures, as well as prosecutors and 
public defenders to bring to a swift end trials that are still under way under Act No. 600 
and clarify their working conditions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Ensure that all State bodies responsible for human rights participate and 
assume their responsibilities in combating corruption in the judicial systems; 
 (k) Investigate and follow up any army or navy operations that lead to the civilian 
deaths, injuries or detentions, through independent and impartial prosecutors and judges, 
rejecting the intervention of military courts. 
 (l) Invite the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers to the 
country with a view to collaborating to establish the necessary framework for the 
relationship between the judiciary and the executive, as the rupture between the two has 
prevented the judiciary from properly performing its role as guarantor of basic rights - 
which has undertaken - and, which was one of the factors that led to the strike of the 
judges, who are not covered by guaranteed irremovability, which took place during the 
Working Group&#8217;s visit.
