<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 18/117, the present report is submitted 
to update previous reports on the question of the death penalty, including the last 
quinquennial report of the Secretary-General (E/2010/10 and Corr.1 and 2) and reports 
submitted to the Council (A/HRC/4/78, A/HRC/8/11, A/HRC/12/45, A/HRC/15/19, 
A/HRC/18/20, A/HRC/21/29 and A/HRC/24/18).  
</p><p>2. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/11, the report also includes 
information on the human rights of children of parents sentenced to the death penalty or 
executed.  
</p>
<p>3. The report covers the period from June 2013 to May 2014 and is based on 
information received from States and other relevant sources, including national human 
rights institutions, United Nations agencies, international and regional intergovernmental 
bodies and non-governmental organizations. Attention is drawn to the forthcoming report 
of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly on a moratorium on the use of the death 
penalty, which will outline national and international efforts made towards the 
implementation of General Assembly resolution 67/176 on a moratorium. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Changes in law and practice 
</b>4. Changes in law include new legislation abolishing or reinstating the death penalty, 
restricting it or expanding its scope, as well as ratification of international and regional 
human rights treaties that provide for the abolition of the death penalty. Changes in practice 
comprise mainly non-legislative measures, including executive and judicial measures, 
reflecting a new approach regarding the use of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Member States that have abolished the death penalty for all crimes  
</b></p>
<p>5. Some 160 States have abolished or introduced a moratorium on the death penalty 
either in law or in practice, or have suspended executions.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Member States that have restricted the scope of the death penalty or 
are limiting its use 
</b></p>
<p>6. In several de facto abolitionist States, as well as in States that continue to apply the 
death penalty, some noticeable initiatives restricting its use were recorded during the 
reporting period.  
</p>
<p>7. In Antigua and Barbuda, the Offences against the Person (Amendment) Act, 2013 
was amended to remove the mandatory imposition of the death penalty.1 Bangladesh 
abolished the death penalty for children by enacting the Children Act 2013.2  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The bill was adopted by the House of Representatives on 30 August 2013 and by the Senate on 
</p>
<p>12 September 2013. The final version of the Act is available from http://laws.gov.ag/acts/2013/a2013-
4.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 Section 52 of Act No. 24 of 2013 states: &#8220;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any 
</p>
<p>law, no child shall be sentenced to death, transportation or imprisonment&#8221;.  </p>


<p>8. In Benin,3 Comoros (A/HRC/26/11, para. 10), Mongolia4 and Suriname,5 draft laws 
to remove the death penalty from national laws are currently under consideration. Viet Nam 
reported that it is drafting amendments to its Penal Code to reduce the number of crimes 
punishable by death. 
</p>
<p>9. In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Justice appointed a special committee in October 2013 
to review the Penal Code with a view to abolishing the death penalty. In June 2013, the 
National Assembly of Tajikistan established a working group to study public opinion on the 
death penalty. In China, the authorities passed a resolution affirming their intention to 
progressively reduce the number of crimes punishable by death. As part of its reporting to 
the Human Rights Council, China noted that it would continue its efforts in that regard in 
accordance with its economic and social development (A/HRC/25/5/Add.1, para. 186.17). 
Thailand reported that it intended to propose legislation to abolish the death penalty.6 
</p>
<p>10. In many States, a constitutional reform process provided an opportunity for 
discussions on the death penalty and led to proposals to abolish or restrict the use of the 
death penalty. For example, in Zimbabwe, a new Constitution was adopted in 2013. It 
provides for the death penalty only for murder committed in aggravating circumstances and 
prohibits its imposition on women or on men who were under 21 or over 70 years at the 
time of the commission of the crime. In Ghana, the Constitutional Review Implementation 
Committee submitted a draft bill for the amendment of the 1992 Constitution, in which it 
recommended replacing the death penalty with life imprisonment.7 Sierra Leone indicated 
that the current review of its Constitution would present an opportunity for the examination 
of the question of the death penalty.8  
</p>
<p>11. In some States, the judiciary restricted the scope of the use of the death penalty. For 
instance, the High Court of Botswana declared that the mandatory death penalty (sect. 203 
of the Penal Code) was unconstitutional.9 In India, the Supreme Court issued a ruling 
recognizing that poverty, socioeconomic or psychic compulsions and undeserved 
adversities in life are some of the mitigating factors to be considered as a basis for 
commuting a convict&#8217;s death sentence to life imprisonment.10 The Supreme Court of India 
also adopted guidelines on clemency and the treatment of death row prisoners.11 In Uganda, 
sentencing guidelines for courts of judicature were issued with the aim of strengthening 
humane, predictable and consistent sentencing. The guidelines include special rules on

circumstances.12 
</p>
<p><b> C. Member States that have ratified or committed themselves to ratifying 
international instruments providing for the abolition of the death 
penalty 
</b></p>
<p>12. As of 30 May 2014, 81 States had ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
penalty.13  
</p>
<p>13. During the reporting period, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, 
El Salvador and Poland acceded to the Second Optional Protocol, and Angola signed it.  
</p>
<p>14. During the universal periodic review process of the Human Rights Council, several 
States, including the Central African Republic (A/HRC/25/11, paras. 104.2&#8211;104.11), the 
Congo (A/HRC/25/16, paras. 111.9&#8211;111.18), Cambodia (A/HRC/26/16, para. 118.1 and 
118.2), Comoros (A/HRC/26/11, paras. 110.1&#8211;110.10), C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (A/HRC/27/6, para. 
128.8&#8211;128.9) and Equatorial Guinea (A/HRC/27/13, para. 134.38), accepted 
recommendations to ratify the Second Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Member States that have introduced moratoriums on or suspension 
of executions 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Government of Equatorial Guinea adopted presidential resolution 426 of 
13 February 2014, in which it established a temporary moratorium on the application of the 
death penalty and expressly called for the imposition of prison terms instead of the death 
penalty. The Government of Pakistan decided to continue its moratorium on the use of 
capital punishment. The President of the United Arab Emirates ordered a general stay on 
executions. In the United States of America, the Governor of the State of Washington 
announced the introduction of a moratorium on the death penalty in February 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Member States that have reintroduced the use of the death penalty, 
extended its scope or resumed executions 
</b></p>
<p>16. During the reporting period, the scope of the death penalty was expanded in Algeria, 
Brunei Darussalam, Bahrain, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, the 
Sudan and the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>17. In Algeria, an amendment to the Penal Code was adopted in December 2013 to 
impose the death penalty for kidnappers of children if the victims were later found dead. 
Bahrain<b> </b>adopted a law that expanded the scope of capital punishment to include individuals 
responsible for bomb attacks that have caused casualties.14 Bangladesh enacted the Children 
Act 2013, which allows capital punishment for the authors of acts of terrorism using 
children. In Nigeria,<b> </b>laws were adopted making kidnapping a capital crime in the Bayelsa, 
Edo and Delta States.

 Decree No. 20 of 31 July 2013. </p>


<p>18. Brunei Darussalam adopted a new penal code that imposes the death penalty for 
numerous offences. The new code also introduces stoning to death as the specific method of 
execution for rape, adultery, sodomy and extramarital sexual relations.  
</p>
<p>19. Papua New Guinea extended capital punishment to sorcery-related killings, 
aggravated rape and robbery with violence; it also approved new means of execution, 
including lethal injection, hanging, electrocution, firing squad and death by deprivation of 
oxygen.15 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) expressed regrets over Papua New Guinean legislative action to resume the use 
of the death penalty and noted that such measures marked a significant regression in the 
human rights progress that Papua New Guinea had made, and contradicted the global trend 
towards the abolition of the death penalty.16 
</p>
<p>20. Maldives adopted a new regulation in April 2014 that provides for the imposition of 
the death penalty for intentional murder, even for individuals who are under 18. OHCHR 
expressed deep concern about the new regulation of Maldives to implement the death 
penalty, which ended the country&#8217;s 60-year moratorium on the death penalty.17  
</p>
<p>21. In the United States of America, a law known as the Timely Justice Act was adopted 
in the State of Florida, which requires the Governor to sign a death warrant within 30 days 
of the conclusion of clemency review and to schedule execution within 180 days of the 
issuance of the warrant.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Making information on the use of the death penalty available 
</b></p>
<p>22. In accordance with General Assembly resolution 67/176, States should make 
available relevant information with regard to their use of the death penalty, including 
accurate data on the number of persons sentenced to death, the number of persons on death 
row and the number of executions. 
</p>
<p>23. During a panel discussion on the human rights of children of parents sentenced to 
the death penalty or executed, convened by the Human Rights Council in September 2013 
at its twenty-fourth session, several States and non-governmental organizations, noted that 
the Human Rights Committee, the Committee against Torture, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment had all expressed concerns 
regarding the lack of transparency surrounding executions. They also recalled that the 
human rights mechanisms viewed the failure to provide information concerning executions 
as amounting to a violation of international human rights law (see A/HRC/25/33, para. 25). 
</p><p>24. However, as noted by the Secretary-General in previous reports (A/HRC/4/78, 
A/HRC/8/11, A/HRC/12/45, A/HRC/15/19, A/HRC/18/20, A/HRC/21/29 and A/HRC/24/18), it is 
difficult to obtain up-to-date and accurate global figures on the application of the death 
penalty, owing to the continued lack of transparency on the part of some Governments. In 
Belarus, China and Viet Nam, data on the use of the death penalty is classified as a State 
secret, the disclosure of which constitutes a criminal offence. Furthermore, difficulties in 
obtaining information are compounded in countries affected by conflict, where it may not

<p>be possible to obtain sufficient reliable information to confirm the number of executions 
and other relevant details.  
</p>
<p>25. Furthermore, information regarding the actual date of executions is reportedly 
withheld from family members and lawyers of death row prisoners until the completion of 
the executions in some States, including Belarus, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Sudan 
and Viet Nam. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus 
expressed concern about the circumstances of the execution of a death row prisoner in April 
2014. Reportedly, the date of his execution was not known to his family members and 
lawyers, who only learned about it after the sentence had already been carried out. The 
Special Rapporteur noted that the way the death penalty was carried out in that case 
amounted to inhuman treatment.18<b> </b>During the universal periodic review process of the 
Human Rights Council, Botswana accepted the recommendation to provide information to 
concerned families, so that they know in advance the date of execution of their relatives 
(A/HRC/23/7 and Corr.1, para. 115.60). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Imposition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>26. During the reporting period, executions were carried out in at least 22 States. Some 
States resumed executions19 after a few years&#8217; suspension. In his report to the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/25/26) on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, the Secretary-General expressed his concern at the sharp rise in executions in that 
country. He noted that the new Government continued the previous administrations&#8217; heavy 
reliance on the death penalty to combat crimes (see also A/HRC/23/47/Add.5). A 
significant increase in the number of executions was also reported in Iraq for individuals 
convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Law.20 The United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq 
and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have repeatedly and publicly 
reported that the international safeguards protecting the rights of those facing the death 
penalty are not implemented in the country.21 
</p>
<p>27. Despite its recent amendments to criminal laws and procedures, aimed at restricting 
the application of the death penalty, China, according to some sources, has continued to 
execute thousands of individuals annually.22

<p><b> V. Application of safeguards guaranteeing protection of the 
rights of those facing the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Restriction of use of the death penalty to &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p>28. In accordance with article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, States that have not yet abolished the death penalty should only impose it 
for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;. In international human rights jurisprudence, that term has 
been interpreted as allowing the death penalty to be applied only to the crime of murder or 
intentional killing.23 However, the death penalty continues to be applied in some countries 
for crimes or acts not involving intentional killings, such as &#8220;drug-related offences&#8221;, 
&#8220;consensual sexual acts&#8221;, economic and political crimes, robbery, blasphemy, witchcraft 
and sorcery. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Use of the death penalty for &#8220;drug-related offences&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>29. Drug-related offences do not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; (see 
A/50/40, para. 449, and A/55/40 (Vol. I), para. 464). There is no persuasive evidence that 
the use of the death penalty is a greater deterrent than other methods of punishment in 
eradicating drug trafficking or other drug-related offences. Nevertheless, 32 countries or 
territories24 continue to impose the death penalty for drug-related offences in their 
legislation. In some countries, drug offences account for the majority of death sentences 
handed down and executions carried out.  
</p>
<p>30. Human rights treaty bodies continue to address the issue of the use of the death 
penalty for drug crimes. For instance, the Human Rights Committee recommended that 
Indonesia review its legislation to ensure that crimes involving narcotics are not punishable 
by death (CCPR/C/IDN/CO/1, para. 10).  
</p><p>31. The International Narcotics Control Board discussed the imposition of the death 
penalty for drug-related offences at its 109th session, held in February 2014. Subsequently, 
in a note verbale addressed to all Member States issued on March 2014, the Board 
encouraged States that still imposed the death penalty for drug-related offences to abolish 
that punishment. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Use of the death penalty for consensual sexual acts between adults 
</b></p>
<p>32. The use of the death penalty for acts in connection with consensual sexual relations 
and activities do not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes.&#8221; At least 10 States25 
continue to impose and carry out the death penalty in connection with actual or purported 
engagement in consensual sexual acts, such as &#8220;adultery&#8221; and &#8220;sodomy&#8221;. Laws 
criminalizing actual or purported engagement by adults in consensual sexual relations, 
including extramarital sex and premarital sex, contravene international human rights law 
and standards (see, for example, A/53/40 (Vol. I), para. 119).  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>33. In addition, although the language of such laws may be gender neutral and may not 
appear to directly discriminate against women, in practice, their application and 
enforcement often disproportionately affect women&#8217;s enjoyment of their rights. Studies 
repeatedly demonstrate that women are more likely to be sentenced to death for such 
crimes, owing to deeply entrenched discriminatory societal attitudes and the biases against 
women suspected of adultery or of engaging in extramarital relationships among the 
judiciary and law enforcement officers (A/HRC/23/49/Add.5, para. 6).26  
</p><p>34. Imposition of the death penalty for offences relating to consensual adult homosexual 
conduct continues to be provided for in the legislation of a few States. The Human Rights 
Committee expressed concerns that, in Mauritania, homosexuality is a crime punishable by 
death. Such punishment violates the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (arts. 2, 6, 17 and 26) and the Committee recommended that Mauritania 
decriminalize homosexuality (CCPR/C/MRT/CO/1, para. 8). While reviewing a periodic 
report of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights expressed concern over the criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual activity 
and the possibility that convicted persons may be subject to the death penalty 
(E/C.12/IRN/CO/2, para. 7).  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Use of the death penalty for blasphemy, apostasy and religious offences 
</b></p>
<p>35. In some countries, conversion from Islam or the renunciation of Islam is considered 
apostasy and a capital crime. The death penalty has also been extended on the basis of 
sharia law to cases of blasphemy. According to international human rights jurisprudence, 
none of those crimes meets the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes.&#8221; (CCPR/C/79/Add.85, 
para. 8). 
</p><p>36. Twelve States have continued to impose the death penalty for the &#8220;crime&#8221; of 
apostasy: Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia,27 Maldives, Mauritania, 
Nigeria,28 Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, the Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.29 
Five States continued to allow capital punishment for blasphemy: Afghanistan, Brunei 
Darussalam, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab 
Emirates. In four States, armed groups were also implementing sharia punishment, 
including death, for &#8220;offences&#8221; to religion: Al-Shabaab in Somalia, Boko Haram and other 
armed groups in Nigeria, the Taliban in Afghanistan and jihadist groups in the Syrian Arab 
Republic. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Use of the death penalty for &#8220;acts of terrorism&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>37. Serious concerns have been raised, including by United Nations human rights bodies 
and mechanisms, about the adoption and application in many States of legislation 
containing overly broad and vague definitions of terrorist offences. The High 
Commissioner for Human Rights has noted that such laws fail to comply with the principle 
of legality, as they do not provide reasonable notice of what actions they cover, or are so 
broad that they cover actions that either should not reasonably be deemed terrorist in nature 
or not considered to be crimes at all (A/HRC/22/26, paras. 21 and 34). In such cases, the

<p>application of the death penalty remains a serious concern, in particular where such acts do 
not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, and may amount to violations of article 6 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>38. Executions relating to acts of terrorism or crimes of a political nature were carried 
out in Bangladesh, Belarus, China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, India, Somalia and 
the Sudan, and possibly in other countries. Furthermore, hundreds of death sentences were 
handed down, albeit not carried out, in terrorism-related cases in Algeria, Bangladesh, 
Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and Libya.  
</p>
<p>39. Concerns have been raised over the adoption of new counter-terrorism legislation or 
the amendment of existing laws in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Nigeria and the Syrian Arab 
Republic which prescribe the death penalty for overly broad or vaguely defined &#8220;terrorist&#8221; 
activities. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Mandatory use of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to the jurisprudence of human rights mechanisms, the mandatory use of 
the death penalty is not compatible with the limitation of capital punishment to the &#8220;most 
serious crimes&#8221;.30 Nevertheless, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, 
Pakistan and Singapore continue to impose mandatory death sentences.31  
</p>
<p>41. The Human Rights Committee continues to address the issue in its individual 
communications. In one case involving the imposition of a mandatory death sentence for 
acts of murder in Ghana, the Committee referred to its jurisprudence that the automatic and 
mandatory imposition of the death penalty constituted arbitrary deprivation of life, in 
violation of article 6, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. Laws that impose the death penalty without any possibility of the defendant&#8217;s 
personal circumstances or the circumstances of the particular offence being taken into 
account32 constitute violations of the right to life under the Covenant.33 
</p>
<p>42. During its universal periodic review, Barbados accepted the recommendation that it 
eliminate the mandatory death penalty (A/HRC/23/11/Add.1, para. 18). Uganda proposed 
the Law Revision (Penalties in Criminal Matters) Miscellaneous Amendment Bill 2013 to 
repeal mandatory death penalty provisions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Fair trial guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>43. The imposition of a death sentence upon the conclusion of a trial in which the 
provisions of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have not 
been respected constitutes a violation of the right to life.34 Furthermore, forcing an

<p>individual to make or sign, under duress, a confession admitting guilt violates both article 7 
(prohibiting torture and inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment) and article 14, paragraph 3 
(g) (prohibiting compulsion to testify against oneself or confess guilt) of the Covenant.35  
</p><p>44. Bahrain, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, the Sudan and 
the Syrian Arab Republic provided information regarding the legal guarantees and 
safeguards provided in their respective jurisdictions. Such guarantees and safeguards 
include the right to public trial, the right to legal presentation and counsel, including the 
provision of a counsel financed by the State, respect for the principle of presumption of 
innocence, the right to appeal and freedom from torture.36 
</p>
<p>45. In some States where individuals were sentenced to death or executed, however, the 
death penalty was imposed after proceedings that may not meet international fair trial 
standards. In many cases, sentences were based on &#8220;confessions&#8221; that were allegedly 
extracted through torture or other ill-treatment. Other prevalent global issues include failure 
to supply qualified interpreters for court hearings, failure to provide a written record of 
proceedings, inconsistent and unfair sentencing practices, failure to accept or consider 
mitigating factors, the absence of a meaningful legal aid framework resulting in indigent 
defendants being effectively deprived of legal representation and the imposition of the 
death penalty by military and special courts and tribunals. 
</p>
<p>46. United Nations human rights mechanisms have continued to express concern over 
the lack of fair trial in death penalty cases in a number of States. For instance, in November 
2013, the High Commissioner for Human Rights urged the Government of Bangladesh not 
to implement death sentences in cases before the International Crimes Tribunal, particularly 
given concerns over the fairness of the trials. She emphasized that the tribunal should 
ensure the highest standards of proceedings, if it was to reinforce the rule of law in 
Bangladesh and the fight against impunity for the mass atrocities committed in 1971. 
Subsequently, two Human Rights Council special procedure mandate holders expressed 
similar concerns that the International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh did not uphold the 
most stringent fair trial and due process guarantees.37  
</p>
<p>47. The High Commissioner for Human Rights also expressed concern about the 
imposition of the death penalty by courts in the Gaza Strip in the State of Palestine. She 
emphasized that the death penalty could only be imposed after a fair trial, which is 
currently not legally or practically possible in Gaza. She also expressed serious concern 
about ill-treatment and torture during the interrogation of persons later sentenced to death, 
and urged the authorities in the Gaza Strip not to carry out planned executions and to 
implement a moratorium.38  
</p>
<p>48. With regard to the executions that took place in Somalia in March 2014, OHCHR 
expressed concerns that the hasty judicial process, in which there were only nine days 
between the alleged killings and the executions, had deprived suspects of full fair trial 
guarantees, including the right to legal representation and the right to appeal.

<p>49. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and other 
Human Rights Council special procedure mandate holders also urged several States, 
including Belarus,39 Egypt,40 the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea,41 the Islamic 
Republic of Iran42 and Papua New Guinea43 to maintain stringent respect for due process 
and fair trial guarantees in death penalty cases.  
</p>
<p><b>  Arbitrary use of the death penalty in mass trials 
</b></p>
<p>50. During the reporting period, a new phenomenon of sentencing large groups of 
individuals in mass trials emerged and led to major concerns that such mass trials violate 
the international human rights standards of fair trial guarantees and other safeguards. In 
Viet Nam, 33 people were sentenced to death for drug trafficking in a mass trial, reportedly 
without any adequate legal representation. In Bangladesh, a special court set up to 
prosecute crimes committed during a mutiny in Dhaka in 2009 sentenced 152 paramilitary 
personnel to death in November 2013. A trial court in Egypt imposed death sentences on 
more than 1,000 people in two mass trials for the alleged killing of a police officer and 
other violent activities committed during the country&#8217;s 2013 political crisis.  
</p>
<p>51. Those trials were marred by procedural irregularities, including lack of adequate and 
timely access to lawyers, and instances of trials in absentia. In many cases, reports indicated 
that a number of suspects who were detained in custody died after they were tortured. The 
courts that conducted the mass trials also admitted evidence obtained under torture. 
Furthermore, the exact charges against each defendant were not clear, given that, in many 
cases, they were not individually read out in court. The courts also did not adhere to the 
presumption of innocence. Pursuant to general comment No. 32 (2007) on the right to 
equality before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial of the Human Rights Committee, the 
presumption of innocence, which is fundamental to the protection of human rights, imposes 
on the prosecution the burden of proving the charge, guarantees that no guilt can be 
presumed until the charge has been proved beyond reasonable doubt, ensures that the 
accused has the benefit of doubt and requires that persons accused of a criminal act must be 
treated in accordance with that principle. 
</p>
<p>52. The Secretary-General, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and Human 
Rights Council special procedure mandate holders expressed serious alarm concerning the 
imposition of the death penalty during those mass trials. In her statement regarding the 
mass trial in Bangladesh for the alleged perpetrators of a mutiny in 2009, the High

March 2014, Port Moresby. </p>


<p>Commissioner stated that the crimes committed during the mutiny were utterly 
reprehensible and heinous, but that conducting mass trials of hundreds of individuals, 
torturing suspects in custody and sentencing them to death after trials that failed to meet the 
most fundamental standards of due process did not achieve justice.44 
</p><p>53. With regard to the mass sentencing in Egypt in March 2013, the High Commissioner 
and special procedure mandate holders expressed deep concern about numerous procedural 
irregularities reported during the proceedings.45 The Secretary-General stated that the 
verdicts clearly did not meet basic standards of fair trial, particularly those that imposed the 
death penalty, and could undermine the prospects for long-term stability in Egypt.46 
Furthermore, in a joint statement, a group of human rights experts from the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the United Nations also expressed 
concerns about the mass trial in Egypt, and stated that such a &#8220;mockery of justice&#8221; would 
undermine the justice and reconciliation process in the country.47 
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to consular services for non-citizens 
</b></p>
<p>54. Access to consular services is an important aspect of the protection of non-citizens 
facing the death penalty abroad. Under international law, the denial of the right to consular 
notification leads to the violation of due process and the execution of a foreign national 
deprived of his or her right to consular services constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of life, 
in contravention of articles 6 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.  
</p>
<p>55. Reportedly, non-citizens, including migrant workers, remained disproportionately 
affected by the death penalty in the Asian and Middle Eastern regions. For instance, at least 
149 people, including many non-citizens, convicted of drug-related offences are reportedly 
on death row in Indonesia; 247 Indonesians are on death row in other countries. In 
Malaysia, death sentences have been issued against at least 37 foreign nationals, mostly for 
drug offences. Saudi Arabia executed at least 37 non-citizens. The death penalty was 
disproportionately used against migrant workers from Asia and Africa. Some 125 Filipino 
migrant workers are on death row abroad. In the United Arab Emirates, about half of the 
death sentences pronounced during the reporting period were imposed on non-citizens, who 
make up over 80 per cent of the population. Sixty Mexicans are on death row in the United 
States.48 
</p>
<p>56. Several States have established specific programmes to support their nationals who 
are sentenced to the death penalty while abroad. For instance, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Indonesia established the Legal Aid and Protection of Indonesians Overseas Unit,

Affairs of the Philippines provided legal assistance to Filipino migrant workers facing death 
sentences abroad.50 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico established a legal support 
programme, known as the Mexican Capital Legal Assistance Program, for Mexicans facing 
the death penalty in the United States of America. Between its inception in 2000 and 
February 2014, the programme intervened in 1,001 cases of first-degree murder and the 
interventions led to the prevention or reversal of the death penalty in 878 cases.51

Arias Tamayo, one of the 51 Mexican nationals subject to the International Court of Justice

statement regretting the decision of the State of Texas to proceed with the execution 
without review and reconsideration in accordance with the <i>Avena</i> decision, and noted that 
the execution illustrated the critical importance for the Congress to pass the Consular 
Notification Compliance Act, which would provide an additional mechanism for the United 
States to meet its international obligations.53 Despite repeated national and international 
calls to suspend further executions, another Mexican national was executed in the State of 
Texas in April 2014, in violation of the <i>Avena </i>decision.54

rights law of the execution of persons for crimes committed before they were 18 years of

that, under their legislation and practice, neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment

<p>period, at least 4 of the 14 States, namely the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, the 
State of Palestine (Gaza) and Yemen, executed children.  
</p><p>60. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) estimated that, in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, over 160 persons, who allegedly committed crimes before the age of 18, 
face the risk of execution. The adoption of the revised penal code in 2013 in the country 
(specifically its child-related provisions that prohibit the application of the death penalty to 
children in certain cases) created a more enabling environment for the implementation of 
juvenile justice standards for children in conflict with the law. In partnership with the 
judiciary, UNICEF supported the implementation of child-related provisions of the revised 
penal code. It noted, however, that it was still too early to assess the extent to which the 
revised penal code contributed to reducing the number of capital sentences issued in cases 
involving juveniles. It recommended that the Government, prior to its adoption of the new 
penal code, ensure a special review of the cases of those children who had been sentenced 
to death. 
</p>
<p>61. Saudi Arabia reportedly executed two individuals for crimes they had committed 
before the age of 18. Saudi Arabia justifies the execution of juveniles on the ground that 
their childhoods end when they reach puberty, according to the concept of <i>bulugh</i> under 
sharia. It also carried out <i>qisas</i> (retaliatory punishment). UNICEF reported that the Saudi 
Shura Council had recently approved a law on the protection of children from abuse which 
defines children as individuals under the age 18, in accordance with the provisions of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The law is currently awaiting the approval of the 
Head of State.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Persons with mental or intellectual disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>62. In accordance with international human rights standards, the death penalty should 
not be imposed on persons with mental or intellectual disabilities.55 The judiciary in several 
States took the initiative of addressing the issue of the use of the death penalty against 
persons with mental or intellectual disabilities. For instance, the Supreme Court of India 
commuted the death sentences of two individuals to life imprisonment on the ground of 
mental illness. It also ruled that all death row prisoners should have regular mental health 
checks and appropriate medical care.56 In Japan, in March 2014, a district court released 
Iwao Hakamada, who had been on death row since 1968 and developed mental illness as a 
result of the decades he had spent in isolation.  
</p>
<p>63. Some States, however, reportedly continued to execute persons with mental and 
intellectual disabilities. In the United States of America, after the Supreme Court rejected a 
stay of execution, the State of Florida executed an individual in August 2013 despite his 
decades-long history of mental illness.57 In April 2014, the State of Texas executed Ramiro 
Hern&#225;ndez Llanas, a Mexican national whose IQ level fell within the parameters of 
intellectual disability. Despite precautionary measures issued by the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights in Mr. Hern&#225;ndez&#8217;s case, the United States failed to 
preserve his life pending a petition before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in 
violation of its international legal obligations derived from the Charter of the Organization

<p>of American States and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man.58 The 
recent execution of persons with intellectual and mental disabilities in the country raised 
concerns about the implementation of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of 
<i>Atkins v. Virginia</i> (case No. 536 U.S. 304), which prohibits the execution of such 
individuals.  
</p>
<p>64. In May 2014, the United States Supreme Court issued another decision in <i>Hall</i> <i>v.</i> 
<i>Florida </i>(case No. 572 U. S. ____ (2014)) with regard to the use of the death penalty against 
persons with mental and intellectual disabilities. In that decision, the Court further 
elaborated the notion of the <i>Atkins</i> decision and held that it was unconstitutional to refuse to 
take into account mental factors other than an IQ test. It stated that the death penalty was 
the gravest sentence society might impose. Persons facing that most severe sanction must 
have a fair opportunity to show that the Constitution prohibits their execution.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Human rights of children of parents sentenced to the death 
penalty or executed 
</b></p>
<p>65. In September 2013, the Human Rights Council held a panel discussion on the human 
rights of children of parents sentenced to the death penalty or executed. The panellists 
highlighted the devastating impact on children, including long-term damage to their mental 
health, when a parent is accused of a capital crime. They highlighted that the emotional 
trauma caused at the time of arrest continued even decades after the execution or the 
parent&#8217;s release. The panel discussion addressed various areas requiring the adoption of 
measures: the best interests of the child and the provision to children of parents facing the 
death penalty of care, assistance, information and access to their parents on death row.59 
</p>
<p>66. The situation and the needs of those children have been increasingly taken into 
consideration by several United Nations bodies, including the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child, the Human Rights Council in its universal periodic review and the General 
Assembly. In September 2013, in concluding observations adopted following the review of 
a periodic report of Kuwait, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that 
Kuwait assess and fully take into account the best interests of the child in judicial 
proceedings where parents are involved and when sentencing parents to death 
(CRC/C/KWT/CO/2, paras. 31 and 32). During the review of a periodic report of China, the 
Committee asked the Chinese delegation whether courts took into account the best interests 
of the child when imposing the death penalty on a parent (CRC/C/SR.1833, para. 21). In its 
list of issues for India, the Committee asked the Government to provide specific details on 
measures taken to guarantee the right of the child to have his or her interests taken as a 
primary consideration for children whose parents are involved in criminal proceedings, 
specifically in sentencing and cases involving capital punishment (CRC/C/IND/Q/3-4, para. 
4). Subsequently, in its periodic report, India informed the Committee of the adoption by 
the Government of<b> </b>Rajasthan of a scheme to provide alternative care to children without 
parental care and support and that children whose parents received life imprisonments or 
death sentences were among those included in that scheme (CRC/C/IND/3-4, sect. 5, para. 
35). 
67. In January 2014, at its sixty-fifth session, in addition to asking questions relating to 
the sentencing and execution of child offenders (CRC/C/SR.1849, paras. 16, 22, 24, 26&#8211;32 
and 38), the Committee on the Rights of the Child asked Yemen what support was provided

<p>to children of death row inmates and what measures were taken to ensure that they did not 
face discrimination as a result of their parents&#8217; situation (ibid., para. 38). At the same 
session, the Committee asked the Congo whether the judicial system made any provisions 
for children whose parents were on death row or serving lengthy prison sentences; what 
protection, if any, was afforded to them; and how their best interest was translated in that 
context (CRC/C/SR.1847, para. 58). <b> 
</b>68. At the seventeenth and eighteenth sessions of the Working Group of the Universal 
Periodic Review, Member States sent written questions relating to the situation of children 
of parents under death row or executed to Afghanistan, China, Malaysia, Nigeria, Saudi 
Arabia, Viet Nam and Yemen.60 Those written questions addressed issues such as: the 
number of individuals on death row; the number of individuals on death row with children 
and the number of affected children; the number of death sentences and executions since 
the previous universal periodic review and how many affected individuals have/had 
children; the support provided to those children; whether families, including children, have 
the right to visit or, if unable to visit, to communicate in other ways; whether the 
visiting/communication regime is the same as for other prisoners; whether family members 
have the right to be informed of an execution before it takes place and, if so, how are they 
informed and what is the notice period; and whether children and other family members of 
a person sentenced to death have the right to a final meeting before an execution is carried 
out. At the seventeenth session of the Working Group, Croatia<b> </b>recommended that Malaysia 
ensure that children without parental care due to parental incarceration or execution are 
provided for, including with support for physical and mental health (A/HRC/25/10, para. 
146.185).61 
69. In its resolution 68/147 on the rights of the child, adopted without a vote on 18 
December 2013, the General Assembly acknowledged that a parent&#8217;s deprivation of liberty, 
sentencing to death or life imprisonment had a serious impact on children&#8217;s development, 
and urged States, in the framework of their national child protection efforts, to provide the 
assistance and support those children may require (para. 57). 
70. Children of parents facing the death penalty abroad are also confronted with 
additional challenges: they require specific practical, emotional and/or financial assistance. 
Children who are in the same country as the sentenced parents may be imprisoned with 
their parent and need help to be repatriated to the country of origin or to stay near the 
parent, depending on factors such as the children&#8217;s age and the availability of other suitable 
persons to take care of them.  
</p>
<p>71. In a statement delivered in March 2014, the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Violence against Children noted that the loss of a parent is traumatic and 
irreversible but, unlike a natural death, when it is officially performed by the authorities of 
a country, it becomes particularly confusing and frightening for a child. Children find it 
hard to explain their situation, and are increasingly tempted to deny it and hide their 
feelings. In that regard, the Special Representative underscored that the sentencing of a 
parent to the death penalty compromises the enjoyment of a wide spectrum of children&#8217;s 
rights. She also mentioned that there is enough evidence to recognize the urgency of 
ensuring a protective environment for children of parents sentenced to death or executed;

<p><b> VIII. Conclusions 
</b>72. <b>The trend towards the universal abolition of the death penalty is continuing. 
However, numerous concerns remain with regard to the lack of respect for relevant 
international human rights norms and standards in States where the death penalty is 
still imposed. Until the death penalty is fully abolished, retentionist States must ensure 
that the death penalty is imposed only for those crimes that involve intentional killing. 
The death penalty should not be imposed for &#8220;drug offences&#8221;, &#8220;consensual adult sex&#8221;, 
&#8220;blasphemy&#8221; or any other acts that do not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221;. States should abolish the mandatory death penalty, where it still exists. States 
must also ensure that the highest level of compliance with fair trial and other 
international human rights norms and standards are met in all death penalty cases. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The lack of data on the number of executions or individuals on death row is a 
serious impediment to debate on the abolition of capital punishment. It will also be 
important, for the effectiveness and transparency of such a debate, to ensure that the 
public has access to balanced information, including accurate information and 
statistics on criminality and the various effective ways to combat it, without resorting 
to capital punishment. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>States that still use the death penalty on persons who committed crimes before 
the age of 18 must stop that practice. When the death penalty is abolished, they must 
avoid sentencing children to life imprisonment as an alternative punishment. States 
must take account of article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which 
explicitly requires that deprivation of liberty be used only as a last resort and for the 
shortest appropriate period of time.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The effects of the death penalty system in its entirety, including the social, 
economic and psychological impact on the children and family members of those 
executed or under a death sentence, must be further examined. States that still use the 
death penalty should recognize the urgency of ensuring a protective environment for 
the children of parents sentenced to death or executed, preventing discrimination and 
stigma, and providing them with assistance for their recovery and reintegration.
