<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 11/3 on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the 
Human Rights Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to organize a &#8220;two-day seminar aimed at identifying opportunities and 
challenges in the development of rights-based responses to trafficking in persons with a 
view to acknowledging emerging good practices and further promoting the practical 
application of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking&#8221;(para. 9).  
</p>
<p>2. The seminar was organized in coordination with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children. In accordance with the resolution, it 
brought together &#8220;Governments &#8230; relevant special procedures, treaty bodies, United 
Nations specialized agencies and programmes, regional, intergovernmental, and non-
governmental organizations, national human rights institutions, academics, medical experts 
and representatives of victims&#8221; (para. 9). The seminar considered both challenges and 
opportunities in implementing a human rights approach to trafficking, with a particular 
focus on how the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking have and can be used to structure and facilitate such an approach. 
</p>
<p>3. The seminar was announced on the OHCHR web site. On 28 April 2010 a note 
verbale was sent to all permanent missions. 
</p>
<p>4. In addition to experts invited by the Office of the High Commissioner (see the list of 
experts in annex II), representatives from 59 States Members of the United Nations took 
part: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, 
Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cambodia, Chad, China, Colombia, 
Congo, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, Eritrea, France, Germany, Haiti, Hungary, India, Indonesia, 
Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Japan, Jordan, Lesotho, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, 
Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Republic of Moldova, 
Russian Federation, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, 
Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, 
Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, Uruguay, Venezuela (Bolivarian 
Republic of) and Viet Nam; a representative from the Holy See also attended. A number of 
Member States also brought national experts on countering trafficking to address the 
seminar. Members of the Intergovernmental Organization (IGO) Contact Group on Human 
Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling, convened and coordinated by OHCHR since 2000, 
also took part in the seminar, including representatives of the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM), International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), United Nations 
Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT), Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research 
Institute (UNICRI), Council of Europe, Coalition against Trafficking in Women, ECPAT 
International, International Federation Terre des Hommes, the International Federation of 
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. 
</p>
<p>5. In its resolution 11/3, the Human Rights Council also requested OHCHR to: 
&#8220;disseminate the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking, and to collect the views of the stakeholders, including Governments, observers 
of the United Nations, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized agencies and 
programmes, regional bodies, non-governmental organizations and national human rights 
institutions, on the Recommended Principles and Guidelines, as well as on experiences and 
emerging good practices while applying them, and to make available to the Council a 
compilation of these views as an addendum to the above-mentioned report&#8221; (para. 10). A </p>


<p>note verbale to this effect was sent to all permanent missions in Geneva on 10 July 2009. 
The requested compilation of views, reflecting responses to the note verbale, is submitted in 
the document A/HRC/15/27/Add.1.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the seminar 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Opening of the seminar 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Chair for the first day of the Seminar, the Director of the Research and Right to 
Development Division of OHCHR, welcomed participants and explained the objectives and 
structure of the seminar. She then introduced the three opening speakers: the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; the President of the Human Rights 
Council, Ambassador Alex Van Meeuwen, and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children.  
</p>
<p>7. In her opening address, the High Commissioner for Human Rights congratulated the 
Human Rights Council for convening the important event. She noted that it was taking 
place 10 years after the adoption of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Trafficking Protocol), a landmark 
international agreement that had provided structure and impetus for the development of a 
strong legal framework around the issue of trafficking in persons. The High Commissioner 
affirmed that the work of her office in that area was guided by the rights-based approach 
enshrined in the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking. In response to a need reflected in observations from stakeholders, OHCHR had 
begun developing a detailed commentary to the Principles and Guidelines. It was hoped 
that the commentary to the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking, which was also to be informed by the results of the seminar, would 
help States, United Nations agencies, intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) to promote, support and implement effective rights-based responses 
to trafficking. The High Commissioner emphasized the important role to be played by 
survivors of human trafficking in helping to shape effective rights-based responses to 
combating trafficking. She informed participants of an event, to be held by OHCHR at the 
fourteenth session of the Human Rights Council event on 2 June 2010, which was aimed to 
give voice to the experience and the views of survivors.  
</p>
<p>8. The President of the Human Rights Council affirmed the Council&#8217;s commitment to 
the issue of trafficking and informed participants that the Council would consider the 
proceedings of the Seminar and its recommendations in September. He noted that six 
delegations from the five regional groups were also co-sponsoring the panel of survivors of 
trafficking mentioned by the High Commissioner. The President of the Human Rights 
Council highlighted the strong link between trafficking and human rights: trafficking 
violated the right to life, the right to decent work that was freely chosen, and the right to 
protection against discrimination, arbitrary detention, forced labour, debt bondage, forced 
marriage and commercial sexual exploitation. The Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, under consideration at the current 
meeting, were the first articulation of the human rights-based approach to trafficking and 
had provided a valuable contribution to the mainstreaming of human rights in the work of 
States, regional organizations and United Nations agencies in combating trafficking.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
welcomed the convening of the seminar. She noted that the Principles and Guidelines had 
been an important resource for the work of her mandate. The Special Rapporteur noted that </p>


<p>both international treaty law and the Principles and Guidelines affirmed the importance of 
human rights in combating trafficking. She confirmed that such an approach was important 
to ensure justice for victims and a fair trial for perpetrators. As it was the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s role to offer practical solutions to States, the seminar&#8217;s focus on sharing of 
good practices was expected to be extremely helpful.  
</p>
<p>10. Introductory remarks from the floor were then made by the Permanent 
Representative of Germany, Ambassador Reinhard Schweppe, and the Deputy Permanent 
Representative of the Philippines, Ambassador Denis Lepatan, the two main co-sponsors of 
Human Rights Council resolution 11/3. Both representatives welcomed the Council&#8217;s 
decision to convene the seminar, noted the growing acceptance of a rights-based approach 
to trafficking and affirmed the importance of the Principles and Guidelines in guiding the 
development and implementation of such an approach. They also noted that much remained 
to be done to ensure that victims&#8217; rights were respected and protected. While the human 
rights approach was widely accepted, there was still a considerable implementation gap.  
</p>
<p>11. The Permanent Representative of the United States of America, Ambassador Betty 
E. King, agreed that the Principles and Guidelines were important as a guide to Member 
States committed to ending trafficking and protecting human rights. The Permanent 
Representative introduced a video address to the seminar participants from the United 
States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who affirmed the commitment of the Government 
of the United States to working together with States to end trafficking and related 
exploitation.  
</p>
<p>12. The Permanent Representative of Egypt, Ambassador Hisham Badr, then delivered 
introductory remarks. He confirmed his country&#8217;s commitment to the rights-based approach 
reflected in the Principles and Guidelines and noted significant developments within Egypt. 
A short film was then shown, outlining the nature and extent of trafficking and its effect on 
victims.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>13. In explaining the organization of work, the Chair noted that Human Rights Council 
resolution 11/3 requested the seminar to focus on: &#8220;rights-based responses to trafficking in 
persons with a view to acknowledging emerging good practices and further promoting the 
practical application of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking&#8221;. The Chair explained that the seminar would accordingly be organized 
as follows: (a) Introduction to the Principles and Guidelines, followed by three substantive 
sessions on good practices, challenges and opportunities with respect to the implementation 
of a human rights approach to various elements of trafficking; (b) Victim protection and 
support; (c) Criminal justice responses; and (d) Prevention. For each session a three-person 
expert panel would introduce the relevant area and share their experiences and insights, 
followed by a plenary discussion involving representatives of States, intergovernmental 
organizations, national human rights institutions and civil society. Panel members would be 
provided with a brief opportunity to provide concluding remarks before an expert 
respondent provided conclusions drawing on the various presentations and interventions 
made during the panel and the plenary discussion periods.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>14. This section provides a summary of the expert presentations and of the themes and 
ideas that emerged during the plenary discussion.  </p>


<p><b> A. Introduction to the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking  
</b></p>
<p>15. The OHCHR Adviser on Trafficking commenced the session by introducing 
participants to the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking. The Adviser noted that the Principles and Guidelines had withstood the test of 
time; over the past eight years they had enjoyed increasing support from States, 
international organizations and civil society. The Principles and Guidelines were cited in 
interpretative texts for both the Trafficking Protocol and the Council of Europe Convention 
on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005). They were referred to in many 
regional policy documents and had been used extensively by States to evaluate their 
responses and to develop new laws and approaches to trafficking. The concept of a rights-
based approach to trafficking was outlined, noting the importance of focusing not just on 
rights but also on obligations of States and others. The Adviser pointed out that a rights-
based approach to combating trafficking meant that its conceptual framework must be 
normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed 
towards promoting and protecting human rights. States needed practical guidance to put 
that into practice. The victim should be at the centre of the approach and it was necessary to 
analyse the obligations of States and redress the discriminatory practices that underlay 
trafficking and maintained impunity for traffickers. There was also a growing recognition 
that unconditional support and assistance to victims, advocated by the Principles and 
Guidelines, made operational sense as it often ensured the victims&#8217; cooperation in the 
prosecution of their exploiters. The Adviser emphasized the strong connection between 
trafficking and the violation of human rights, particularly for vulnerable groups, such as 
women, children, migrant workers and asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p>16. Ms. Anne Gallagher, an international legal expert on trafficking in persons, affirmed 
the important role that the Principles and Guidelines had played in guiding the development 
of a comprehensive legal and policy framework around trafficking. She highlighted the 
changes that had taken place over the past decade, including the growing acceptance of a 
number of key principles that went to the heart of a rights-based response to trafficking. It 
was currently widely accepted, for example, that trafficked persons should not be 
criminalized or detained for status-related offences; that provision of support and assistance 
should not be conditional on victims&#8217; willingness or ability to testify; and that despite 
trafficking often being a &#8220;private&#8221; violation, States were under a positive legal obligation to 
diligently investigate and prosecute cases of trafficking in persons and provide victims with 
access to effective remedies. The speaker expressed the view that States and the 
international community must work to ensure that the strong legal framework that currently 
existed around trafficking was translated into effective policies and practices that would 
make a difference to the lives of the many individuals who were exploited for private profit.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Panel 1: Opportunities and challenges in relation to victim protection 
and support 
</b></p>
<p>17. The first panel was composed of: Ms. Cecilia Quisumbing, one of the 
Commissioners of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines; Ms. Ruchira 
Gupta, founder and President of Apne Aap Women Worldwide; and Ms. Marta Requena, 
Secretary of the Council of Europe&#8217;s Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in 
Human Beings (GRETA).  
</p>
<p>18. Ms. Quisumbing reminded participants of the root causes of trafficking, including 
poverty, inequality, discrimination and a lack of enjoyment of fundamental human rights. A 
rights-based approach was important because it highlighted the role of the State as the </p>


<p>primary duty bearer. The special attention afforded to victims in that approach did not exist 
in criminal justice. Law enforcers needed to admit that human rights should be part of their 
obligations. That might have a knock-on effect on other areas of their work and, for 
instance, help in preventing torture in detention. The speaker referred to the particular 
manifestations of trafficking in her country, including mail-order brides, child soldiers, the 
removal and sale of organs, and international adoption, and noted the importance of 
comprehensive legislation. Strong victim identification procedures were also essential, 
particularly in view of the fact that in law enforcement responses in that area were often 
reactive. Human rights commissions could play an important role in protecting victims and 
holding the State to account. The speaker&#8217;s institution had concluded an agreement with the 
national Government to work together in combating trafficking. 
</p>
<p>19. Ms. Gupta pointed out that no one chose to be born poor, low-caste or female; 
slavery was not inevitable; and that victims of trafficking sought the dismantling of the 
systems and structures that enabled their exploitation. They were claiming their right to 
food, housing, education and a livelihood as the best way to ensure protection against 
trafficking. The speaker noted that measures aimed at alleviating suffering or preventing 
further harm were not sufficient without action to address demand for trafficking. She noted 
the prevalence of internal trafficking and observed that border management approaches had 
no impact on that aspect of the phenomenon. Those targeted for sexual exploitation and 
cheap labour tended to be poor and/or young, belong to minority populations and to have a 
history of abuse and little family support. For victims and potential victims, comprehensive 
assistance and protection programmes that addressed their vulnerabilities were vital, such 
as legal protection together with rehabilitation and viable economic options. Traffickers and 
end-users must be prosecuted and appropriately punished. 
</p>
<p>20. Ms. Requena introduced the Council of Europe&#8217;s Convention on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings, an instrument that integrated a strong rights-based approach 
to the issue. The Convention, which currently had 27 States parties and an additional 16 
signatories, was open to all States and the European Union. The Convention was 
strengthened through an independent mechanism charged with monitoring implementation 
of its provisions. The speaker highlighted a recent decision by the European Court of 
Human Rights that had affirmed the legal responsibility of States to protect victims and to 
effectively investigate trafficking cases. The Court had also concluded that in that particular 
case trafficking fell within the concept of &#8220;slavery and forced labour&#8221;, prohibited by the 
European Convention on Human Rights. The speaker concluded by noting that the Council 
of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings affirmed many of 
the core positions set out in the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights 
and Human Trafficking. As a legally binding instrument, the Convention should be able to 
enhance the impact and further the application of the Principles and Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>21. In the plenary discussions that followed the expert presentations, interventions were 
made by representatives of 10 States (Uruguay, Egypt, Germany, Belarus, Eritrea, China, 
Cyprus, Russian Federation, the Philippines and Mexico), ILO, IOM, UNICEF, the 
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Fundaci&#243;n Mujeres en 
Igualdad (Argentina), Anti-Slavery International, Equality Now/European Women&#8217;s 
Lobby, ECPAT International and the Soldiers&#8217; Mothers Association of St. Petersburg 
(Russian Federation).  
</p>
<p>22. All speakers participating in the plenary session affirmed the importance of a human 
rights-based approach to victim protection and support. It was noted by a number of 
speakers that such an approach required all efforts to ensure that trafficked persons were 
accorded all human rights, including those to which they were entitled as victims of crime 
as well as victims of human rights violations. International law imposes further and </p>


<p>additional obligations on States with respect to certain groups who have been especially 
vulnerable to trafficking, including women, children, migrant workers and asylum-seekers.  
</p>
<p>23. Issues that were particularly highlighted during the plenary session included: the 
special vulnerabilities of victims and victim-witnesses; the need for research and strategy to 
address the increased vulnerabilities of special groups, such as young men mandatorily 
conscripted into the army and particularly vulnerable to being trafficked for labour 
exploitation in slavery-like conditions; the link between trafficking and corruption; the need 
for strong, integrated and cooperative identification procedures; victim access to legal 
remedies and compensation as an instrument of restorative justice and a recognition of the 
violence suffered by victims; the need for specificity in combating certain forms of 
trafficking such as trafficking for sexual exploitation; the link between trafficking and 
migrant smuggling; the importance of special measures to ensure child victims of 
trafficking are identified, protected and assisted; the impact of migration and labour policies 
on trafficking; and the need to empower migrants and vulnerable workers to claim their 
rights. Several participants noted that human rights were not a central focus of the 
Trafficking Protocol and that instruments such as the Principles and Guidelines had been 
essential in ensuring that obligations under the Trafficking Protocol were implemented 
within a broader framework of internationally accepted human rights.  
</p>
<p>24. The three panellists each provided a brief response at the conclusion of the plenary 
debate. Ms. Requena affirmed that the human rights approach was the only way to tackle 
trafficking in human beings. Protection of the private lives of trafficking victims was a 
consideration important for avoiding the stigmatization of victims. There was also a need to 
develop specific criteria and procedures for affirming victim status in a way that avoided 
further stigmatization. Ms. Gupta noted that migration was only one element in the creation 
of vulnerability and responses should take that into account. She addressed the issue of 
consent and the need to differentiate between child and adult victims while recognizing that 
young people might have entered into a trafficking situation as minors. Ms. Quisumbing 
referred participants to article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, noting that 
all individuals and States have responsibilities to build an international order in which all 
people can enjoy human rights. She urged all countries to establish national human rights 
institutions through which to monitor human rights violations, and to ratify the relevant 
international instruments, including the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.  
</p>
<p>25. Ms. Gallagher, the nominated respondent for this session, then took the floor. In 
responding to the various interventions she highlighted the issue of remedies as an area of 
common concern. Despite being a basic legal entitlement, access to remedies was routinely 
denied to victims of trafficking. The importance of victim identification was also 
highlighted; failure to identify victims directly impacted on the ability of the State to 
deliver on the rights to which those persons were entitled. The speaker noted that concerns 
over &#8220;consent&#8221; were misplaced. International law is clear on the point that no person can 
consent to his or her own unlawful exploitation. The speaker concluded the session with an 
acknowledgement of the &#8220;macro&#8221; issues that underlay trafficking. That phenomenon was, 
after all, the predictable outcome of certain global and political realities. Those included 
migration regimes that restricted the ability of individuals to secure legal access to preferred 
destinations; international and domestic trade policies that liberalized the movement of 
money, good and services but not labour; and the internalization, diversification and 
explosive growth of the global sex industry. Those essentially economic determinants were 
reinforced by powerful social structures that exacerbated vulnerabilities among particular 
groups, including women, children and migrants, and that nurtured demand for the main 
products of trafficking.  </p>


<p><b> C. Panel 2: Opportunities and challenges in relation to criminal justice 
responses  
</b></p>
<p>26. The Chair introduced the speakers for Panel 2: Ms. Cindy Dyer, a former United 
States prosecutor and representative of Vital Voices Global Partnership; Mr. Knut Brattvik, 
representative of the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL); and Ms. 
Marieta Kane, Ministry of Justice of Mauritania.  
</p>
<p>27. In her presentation, Ms. Dyer emphasized the importance of a coordinated 
community response, involving NGOs and the judicial, medical and religious communities, 
as key to the provision of a human rights-based approach to trafficking. She also pointed to 
the critical need of effective training of law enforcement officials. Developing partnerships 
between community-based NGOs and the criminal justice system could assist victims in 
their access to services. She stressed the connection among the access of victims to 
services, the use of specialized law enforcement prosecutors and the creation of an 
environment in which victims were willing to testify.  
</p>
<p>28. Mr. Brattvik highlighted the practice and implementation of a victim-centred 
approach in the anti-trafficking work of INTERPOL. He identified a need for more reliable 
information on practices such as forced labour and organ trafficking. Although INTERPOL 
was not an operational organization, it had been able to provide tools and assistance, 
including analytical assistance, to Member States. Its close working relations with other 
international agencies had enhanced the value of several tools developed by INTERPOL. In 
particular, the speaker outlined a tool to be launched in October 2010 designed to help 
safeguard people from becoming victims, including a list of questions already translated 
into 40 languages. International cooperation would continue to be an important weapon in 
the fight against trafficking. States should work to strengthen the institutions and processes 
that make such cooperation possible. 
</p>
<p>29. Ms. Kane provided a brief summary of Mauritania&#8217;s response to trafficking, a 
phenomenon which the State considered to be a major obstacle to the equitable 
development of society. Highlights included the adoption of a new law; training and 
awareness-raising for law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and the community; and 
strong working partnerships with human rights NGOs and the media. Recognized as a 
trans-ethnic and multidimensional societal phenomenon, trafficking needed to be tackled 
through comprehensive programmes, integrating protection of political, legal, economic, 
social and cultural rights. The speaker noted the importance of addressing underlying 
vulnerabilities to trafficking through innovative approaches such as microfinance and 
rehabilitation, especially targeting rural communities, which were particularly vulnerable 
and often the main source of victims of trafficking and domestic servitude.   
</p>
<p>30. In the subsequent plenary discussion, interventions were made by representatives of 
four States (Egypt, the United States of America, the United Arab Emirates and Italy), as 
well as by UNODC, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of OSCE, the 
Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines, the Coalition against Trafficking in 
Women and the University of the Free State (South Africa).  
</p>
<p>31. The debate highlighted the critical importance of an effective criminal justice 
response as one aspect of a broader, rights-based approach to the phenomenon. A criminal 
justice response to trafficking that prioritized rights and sought to both end impunity for 
traffickers and secure justice for victims was an important component of any lasting 
solution to trafficking. It was noted by many speakers that there was increasing awareness 
and agreement on the elements of an effective criminal justice response to trafficking. 
Many of those elements, such as criminalization of trafficking; prosecution of traffickers; 
the elimination of safe havens and confiscation of assets, were set out in the Trafficking </p>


<p>Protocol. Speakers noted that the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking added an important human rights dimension to that by 
emphasizing, for example, the rights of suspects and the requirements of a fair trial, and the 
need to ensure that victims of trafficking could use the legal system to secure remedies for 
the harm that had been caused to them. 
</p>
<p>32. Specific issues also raised by participants included: the ongoing problem of a lack of 
understanding of trafficking among officials and the community; the need for specialist 
agencies, including investigators and courts; the important role played by law enforcement 
in protecting victims of trafficking; the need to address demand; the rights of trafficked 
persons upon their return and the need to monitor such returns; the detention of victims of 
trafficking; and the importance of ensuring that responses to trafficking were consistent 
with international human rights standards. Good practices identified by participants 
included non-conditional provision of assistance; measures to ensure the protection of 
victim identity; and training of criminal justice officials to increase professionalism and 
integrate an understanding of human rights.  
</p>
<p>33. As with the previous panel, the three panellists each provided a brief response at the 
conclusion of the plenary debate. Ms. Kane stressed the importance of raising awareness at 
the village level about existing laws that prohibit trafficking, and the need to provide 
educational campaigns among vulnerable populations. She also underscored the importance 
of respecting victims &#8211; providing them with the opportunity to speak of their experiences 
and to access justice. Mr. Brattvik highlighted the link between practices of trafficking and 
financial benefits for traffickers. He emphasized the importance of a human rights-based 
approach to investigations and prosecutions. Ms. Dyer reiterated the point that prosecutors 
had a central role to play in an effective criminal justice response to trafficking. Improving 
prosecutor awareness and understanding would be vital to ensuring victim rights and 
redress.  
</p>
<p>34. As the respondent for the second session, Ms. Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, OSCE 
Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, 
identified partnerships between criminal justice agencies and civil society as a central 
component of an effective criminal justice response. She pointed out that the criminal 
justice aspect was, of course, only one part of an effective national response. Even a vastly 
improved response in that area would not be able to fully address a problem as complex and 
widespread as trafficking. The respondent stressed the need for more rigorous and uniform 
victim identification and assistance procedures, guided by the principles of respect for the 
rights of victims, unconditional assistance, and social inclusion as the final outcome. There 
was an urgent need to address and avoid secondary victimization, which was an unfortunate 
and common side effect of many interventions. The respondent exposed several common 
misconceptions and assumptions: that the rights of victims were sufficiently protected by 
simply respecting criminal procedure rules; and that victims&#8217; rights and the interests of the 
prosecution would coincide. Ongoing and institutionalized training of all criminal justice 
officials was an essential aspect of any serious effort to develop an effective and rights-
based criminal justice response to trafficking.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Panel 3: Opportunities and challenges in relation to prevention 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Chair for the second day of the session, the Chief of the OHCHR Rule of Law, 
Equality and Non-discrimination Branch, introduced the speakers for the third panel: Ms. 
Zohra Rasekh, member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women; Ms. Ludy Green, advocate for financial independence for victims and their 
children and founder of Second Chance Employment Services, and Ms. Pregaluxmi </p>


<p>Govender, activist, former member of parliament and Commissioner on the South African 
Human Rights Commission.  
</p>
<p>36. In her presentation, Ms. Rasekh focused on the health consequences of trafficking, 
particularly for girls and women. Such consequences were particularly severe in a conflict 
situation such as that being experienced in Afghanistan. She identified the main factors 
affecting trafficking in Afghanistan as displacement, poverty, drugs and corruption as well 
as an absence of good governance and rule of law. The speaker recalled an instance of 
bidding taking place on a 3-year-old boy, although usually it was little girls who were sold 
into forced marriage or to stop family feuds. In 2008, 40 boys who had been trafficked as 
camel jockeys had been brought back from Saudi Arabia, but some had since returned there 
because their parents were too poor to care for them. In her capacity as a member of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the speaker noted that 
trafficking was a growing issue of concern for the Committee and now regularly addressed 
in its dialogues with the 186 States Parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, particularly in connection with legislation and 
protection.  
</p>
<p>37. Ms. Green referred to her own background, in particular seeing her abused mother 
trapped because she was financially dependent. She emphasized the problems of financial 
dependence and lack of employment opportunities that could contribute to trafficking and 
prevent victims from escaping exploitative situations. The widespread problem of domestic 
violence was also noted as increasing the vulnerability of women and children in particular. 
The speaker outlined the efforts of her organization to address those underlying 
vulnerabilities. Working in shelters she noticed how often women returned to their abusers 
or to the shelters, because there were no job opportunities for them. With her background in 
human resources management, she wanted to create chances for those victims by offering 
them a comprehensive service, including job placement, legal services, housing, training 
and access to health care. Second Chance Employment Services, which had 400 volunteers, 
was based on the premise that everyone had skills. It pre-screened applicants to ensure they 
were able to commit to full-time employment. Over 600 women had been placed so far, 
many of them in well-paying jobs with health benefits. She recounted the story of one 
woman who had been trafficked through many countries since she was 11 years old and 
who was eventually provided with the assistance and support she required through the help 
of the speaker&#8217;s employment agency.  
</p>
<p>38. Ms. Govender noted that the Principles and Guidelines highlighted the importance 
of addressing demand and the factors that made people more vulnerable to trafficking. 
According to the panellist, while South Africa was often held up as a model of good 
practice in many areas, little had been done, thus far, to address the problem of trafficking. 
The factors underlying trafficking were clearly not being addressed. International trade 
agreements, for instance, cost many women their jobs and forced them into insecure or 
even dangerous employment situations. Government spending appeared to favour military 
hardware and sporting events, such as the World Cup, over initiatives that would provide 
jobs and reduce the vulnerabilities that could lead to trafficking. The speaker noted that, for 
example, the jobs which were created to support the World Cup were often not given to the 
people of her country, and that the building contracts were concentrated in the hands of 
only a few developers.   
</p>
<p>39. The three panel presentations were followed by a plenary discussion focusing on the 
issue of prevention. Interventions were made by representatives of eight States (Slovakia, 
South Africa, Turkey, the Republic of Moldova, Brazil, Indonesia, Egypt and Viet Nam), as 
well as from representatives of INTERPOL, the Commission on Human Rights of the 
Philippines, the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, 
UN.GIFT, Equality Now/European Women&#8217;s Lobby, Fundaci&#243;n Mujeres en Igualdad </p>


<p>(Argentina), the Suzanne Mubarak International Women&#8217;s Peace Movement (Egypt), 
International Federation Terre des Hommes (Switzerland), the Women&#8217;s International 
League for Peace and Freedom and the International Catholic Child Bureau.  
</p>
<p>40. The plenary discussion affirmed the importance of States, the international 
community and civil society taking seriously the obligation to actively prevent trafficking 
and related exploitation. It was generally agreed that that required the underlying causes of 
trafficking to be addressed. The factors most commonly cited as &#8220;causes of trafficking&#8221; 
included those that: (a) increased vulnerability of victims and potential victims; (b) created 
or sustained demand for the goods and services produced by trafficked persons; and (c) 
created or sustained an environment within which traffickers and their accomplices could 
operate with impunity. From that perspective, prevention could be seen to include a wide 
range of measures &#8211; from providing women with fair and equal migration opportunities, to 
strengthening the criminal justice response in order to end impunity and deter future 
trafficking-related crimes.  
</p>
<p>41. Other issues raised during the plenary discussion included: the need to focus on root 
causes and on longer-term strategies; the importance of prevention programmes focusing on 
corruption; the need to analyse how anti-trafficking funds were spent, in particular those 
allocated for prevention; mainstreaming of anti-trafficking approaches in development 
policies as a means of addressing vulnerability; opportunities to involve business in 
prevention by encouraging zero tolerance to trafficking and helping businesses clean up 
their supply chain; addressing the particular vulnerabilities of minorities who were often 
excluded from the labour market; the link between prevention and migration including 
child migration and the challenge of ensuring that prevention did not stop movement; the 
importance of reducing demand and punishing businesses that recruited trafficked labour; 
and the insufficiency of an approach that prioritized awareness campaigns over other 
prevention strategies that were looking into the broader context. 
</p>
<p>42. Good practices identified by respondents included the interviewing of victims by 
trained officials; non-criminalization of prostitution; non-discriminatory access to 
assistance and justice; witness protection, international cooperation, strong birth registration 
procedures; and training of consular officials to identify and help victims of trafficking in 
the country of exploitation. The important role of the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund 
on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, established in 1999, in supporting organizations 
working on prevention of trafficking was acknowledged. Klara Skrivankova, a member of 
the Board of the Fund, appealed to Member States to consider donating to the Fund. The 
role of multi-agency efforts, such as UN.GIFT, as vehicles for collaboration among United 
Nations agencies and IGOs on prevention of trafficking was noted. 
</p>
<p>43. Following the plenary discussion, each of the three panellists made brief concluding 
remarks. All referred to the importance of strengthening the capacity of those who are at the 
forefront of preventing trafficking including NGOs. The need for coordination of efforts 
was also generally noted: the task of preventing trafficking and of reintegrating victims 
required a collaborative approach. All stressed the need to work together to prevent 
trafficking and to reintegrate victims. The speakers also agreed that there was a need to 
better track prevention efforts in order to assess impact and identify good practices that 
could be shared. The Principles and Guidelines provided a robust framework for prevention 
at both national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>44. In concluding, the nominated respondent for the session, Mr. Mike Dottridge, an 
international expert on trafficking, observed that the Principles and Guidelines took a strong 
human rights approach to prevention. Poverty was often mentioned in connection with 
prevention but it was worth noting that poverty was a context for trafficking, not only a 
cause. Not all poor people were trafficked. It was necessary to recognize the subtleties of 
the challenges facing people in less developed countries and regions. Over the past decade, </p>


<p>awareness had increased, but the messages varied. For example, there was often a subtext to 
prevention programmes that migration was dangerous and should be stopped, which was 
neither rights-based nor empowering for the many individuals who needed to move to find 
work. Too few prevention campaigns were subject to impact assessment. With respect to 
demand, the speaker questioned whether there was indeed any agreement on what that 
entailed. Would efforts to reduce demand lead to blanket measures or to targeted ones? He 
also pointed out that different interventions would be required to address different types of 
demand. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children, summed up the findings and conclusions of the Seminar. Most importantly, 
on the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking, she affirmed, based on the statements and discussions of all participants, 
that the tool had proved to be a valuable resource for States, the international 
community and civil society. Many participants were able to provide specific examples 
of how the Principles and Guidelines had influenced law, policy and practice. The 
seminar confirmed that a human rights approach to combating human trafficking 
was one that was normatively based on international human rights standards and 
operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights. In a practical sense 
such an approach worked to end the impunity of perpetrators while also securing 
justice and rights for those who had been trafficked and preventing future trafficking. 
Seminar participants affirmed that such an approach currently enjoyed widespread 
support and that there was growing agreement as to the key elements of an effective, 
rights-based approach to trafficking. The Principles and Guidelines had been 
instrumental in guiding the development of rights-based responses and were widely 
appreciated by all stakeholders.  
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The Special Rapporteur noted that the Principles and Guidelines did much 
more than promote a rights-based approach to trafficking; they provided substantive 
and detailed guidance on the content of such an approach and on how it could be 
effectively integrated into anti-trafficking responses. Because they were firmly based 
on international law, the Principles and Guidelines complemented and reinforced the 
international legal framework around trafficking, including the human rights law and 
the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime. Seminar participants welcomed the forthcoming 
commentary to the Principles and Guidelines which, it was felt, would significantly 
enhance their impact and usefulness.  
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>Referring to the challenges of victim identification, protection and support, the 
Special Rapporteur affirmed that States had a clear legal obligation to provide 
protection and support to victims of trafficking. Such protection and assistance should 
be provided on a non-conditional and non-discriminatory basis. That obligation might 
rest primarily on countries of destination but would also involve countries of origin 
and transit. As the Principles and Guidelines made clear, victims should not be 
criminalized for status-related offences. They should also not be detained in 
immigration centres, prisons or shelters. Failure to identify victims of trafficking was 
a serious obstacle to recognition and protection of their rights. All States must work 
harder to ensure that victims are quickly and accurately identified. Victims must also 
be allowed to access remedies, including compensation, for the harms committed 
against them. All persons had a right to be protected against trafficking and victims </b></p>


<p><b>had a right to be protected against further harm. The situation of child victims 
required special attention to their vulnerabilities and their special rights.  
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>In relation to criminal justice responses to trafficking, the Special Rapporteur 
highlighted the increasing acceptance of a fundamental link between criminal justice 
responses to trafficking and victim protection. There was no &#8220;single&#8221; approach to that 
issue: each one reinforced each other and a response to trafficking that prioritized one 
approach over another was unlikely to be effective. Criminal justice responses to 
trafficking should be aimed at both ending the impunity of traffickers and securing 
justice for victims. States must take care to ensure that victim involvement in the 
investigation and prosecution of their exploiters is safe and does not cause further 
harm. That required active support, respect for privacy and special attention to the 
needs of child victims who are also witnesses.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>In relation to prevention, the Special Rapporteur noted that prevention cut 
across many areas of anti-trafficking work. States were under an international legal 
obligation to prevent trafficking and that required them to consider and deal with the 
many factors that contributed to the vulnerability that underlined much trafficking. 
Seminar participants had canvassed a wide range of such factors, including: unjust 
migration regimes; global trade policies that exacerbated inequalities within and 
between countries; discrimination against vulnerable groups, including women, 
children, migrants and minorities; and demand for the goods and services produced 
through trafficking. Measures such as ensuring the financial empowerment of women, 
providing job opportunities, raising awareness, working with business and training of 
officials were all important strategies to prevent trafficking and related exploitation. 
Prevention also required the consideration of entrenched issues such as corruption. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>The Special Rapporteur concluded by affirming the legitimacy and value of a 
human rights approach to trafficking: an approach where &#8220;the trafficked person is 
the centre of law, policy and action&#8221;. She pointed out that prioritizing human rights 
did not mean that other objectives or approaches were to be considered unimportant 
or invalid. For example, States remained entitled to develop strong criminal justice 
responses to trafficking. In fact, the Principles and Guidelines identified a number of 
specific obligations in that regard. States also remained free, within constraints 
imposed by international law, to develop migration strategies that seek to address 
trafficking. However, at each step of every response, the human rights impact of that 
step and of the overall response must be considered and monitored. The ultimate 
objective of responses to trafficking should be to protect individuals from trafficking-
related violations of their human rights and to provide assistance when such violations 
are not, or cannot, be prevented. The Principles and Guidelines were an authoritative 
statement of the human rights approach to trafficking, showing how it could work in 
practice. Over the past eight years understanding in that area had grown 
considerably. However, despite important progress, many challenges remained. 
Keeping human rights at the forefront of the thinking about trafficking would help 
ensure that those challenges could be met and overcome. Participants agreed that the 
international human rights system, including the Human Rights Council and the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, had an important role to play in 
encouraging and directing further development in that area. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>In closing the seminar, the Chair underlined that the level of discussion and 
engagement during the seminar had been particularly high. The Chair thanked 
panellists, experts and participants, including the many Member States in attendance. 
Civil society representatives had been extremely generous in sharing their 
experiences, thereby contributing to the identification of good practices and 
opportunities. The Chair referred to the events on trafficking that would take place </b></p>


<p><b>during the upcoming session of the Human Rights Council, including the panel of 
survivors of trafficking, an exhibition on trafficking for domestic servitude and the 
presentation of the report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children (A/HRC/14/32). She also thanked the co-sponsors and 
then closed the Seminar. </b></p>
