<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report supplements the main report submitted by the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/17/30). It 
reflects specific situations alleged to be affecting the independence of judges or lawyers or 
violating the right to a fair trial in 44 countries and 1 another actor. Further, it includes 
replies received from the Government of the country concerned in response to specific 
allegations together with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations.  
</p>
<p>2. The report presents summaries of the urgent appeals and allegation letters 
transmitted by the Special Rapporteur to governmental authorities between 16 March 2010 
and 15 March 2011, and of the press releases issued during the same reporting period. 
During this period, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 97 communications and issued 6 
press statements on situations of particular concern or to highlight a specific event.1 In this 
connection, the Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that the communications presented 
in the report exclusively reflect allegations she received and subsequently acted upon. 
Allegations containing insufficient information, and falling outside the scope of the 
mandate, or on which due to time or other constraints the Special Rapporteur was not in a 
position to act, are not included in the report. 
</p>
<p>3. A summary of the replies received from States concerned during the period between 
1 May 2010 and 10 May 2011 is also provided. In certain instances, the Government&#8217;s 
response was obtained late and referred to allegations that were presented in the previous 
report (A/HRC/14/26/Add.1). In those cases, the Special Rapporteur has included the 
respective replies in the section of communications received including a summary of the 
communication sent, in order to facilitate the reader&#8217;s comprehension. Furthermore, 
translations of replies which had not been received within the required delay to be included 
in last year&#8217;s report are also summarized in the present report. 
</p>
<p>4. It may be noted that certain responses to urgent appeals or allegation letters sent 
during the reporting period, and for which the Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the 
Governments, could not be included in the report owing to the fact that they were either not 
translated in time or received after 10 May 2011. To the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s regret, they 
will therefore be reflected only in next year&#8217;s report.  As per established practice of the 
Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur has summarized 
the details of the correspondence sent and received.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Statistical data 
</b></p>
<p>5. The following charts of statistical data are aimed at providing the Human Rights 
Council with an overview of developments which occurred in 2010 and the first trimester 
of 2011.  
</p>
<p>6. As illustrated by the charts, action has to be taken in all parts of the world and 
covered a very wide range of issues. Since it is far from uncommon that situations affecting 
the judiciary occur in contexts in which other democratic institutions are also at risk, or 
where a variety of human rights are being violated &#8211; for example the right to life, the right 
not to be subjected to torture and ill-treatment, the right to freedom of expression, women&#8217;s 
rights, children&#8217;s rights indigenous people&#8217;s and minorities&#8217; rights - the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s action often had to be taken jointly with other special procedures. Thus, 
</p>
<p>  
 1 This excludes press releases issued prior to country missions and end-of-mission statements. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>approximately 89 % of communications were sent to Governments jointly with other 
special procedures <b>(see chart 1)</b>. This also reflects the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s will to work in 
close collaboration with other mandate holders so as to strengthen the impact of the special 
procedures system.

<p> 
7. As noted earlier, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 97 communications during 
the reporting period, of which 8 urgent appeals, 75 joint urgent appeals, 3 allegations letters 
and 11 joint allegations letters. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the responses received from 18 Governments to 
communications sent over the period under review, namely from the Governments of 
Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bolivia, the People&#8217;s Republic of China, 
Guatemala, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mauritania, 
Morocco, the Russian Federation, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Venezuela and the 
Republic of Yemen. She notes that the response rate of replies received from Governments 
for the reporting period 2010-2011 remains constant in comparison with the previous 
reporting period 2009-2010. Of the 97 communications which were sent to 44 States and 1 
other actor referred to in this report, she received 41 replies representing about 42 % 
response rate. However, this figure does not include 10 additional replies which referred to 
allegations that were presented in the previous report. During the reporting period 2009-
2010, 106 communications were sent and 45 replies received, representing the same 
response rate, 42% <b>(see chart 2)</b>.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur underlines that it is crucial that governments share their 
views on the allegations received with her. She welcomes and encourages further 
cooperation from governments in response to communications sent by her mandate. Early, 
precise and detailed answers allow for a dialogue which, in many cases, leads to a 
clarification of the matters and often even to a settlement of the case. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to communications sent during the reporting period covered in the 
previous report, and for which no replies had been received within the required delay, the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the replies transmitted in 2010 in response to 10 of those 
previous communications by a number of Governments, namely by the Governments of the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Syrian Arab Republic 
and Venezuela.  </p>

</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur highlights her preoccupation with the proportion of specific 
allegations of serious human rights violations that remain unanswered, particularly where 
the cases at hand concerned serious and revealed systemic violations affecting not only the 
judiciary, but the institutional structures of the Member State at large. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur notes that replies are often received with a considerable delay and 
encourages Member States to reply to her communications within reasonable deadlines, in 
particular when they concern time sensitive issues, which may have irreversible 
consequences for the subjects of the appeals. 
</p>
<p>12. The figures provided below do not include the replies by Governments for which a 
translation was not available for last year&#8217;s report, as they were reflected in data published 
in the previous report A/HRC/14/26/Add.1.

East and North Africa region (23,5%), the Latin America and the Caribbean region 
(17,5%). The Africa region has received 9,5% of the communications. Finally, he Europe,

<p><b> 
</b>14. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications addressed to the Governments on alleged 
human rights violations covered a wide range of issues <b>(see chart 4)</b>. The main areas of 
concern were threats to lawyers, including acts of interference in the discharge of their 
professional functions (28%). Issues relating to the fairness of judicial proceedings which 
include the right to be informed of the charges and undue delays in judicial proceedings, 
amount to 21% of the cases. In about 14% of the communications, a lack of access to a 
lawyer is alleged, often observed in places of detention. There were concerns on the 
independence of the judiciary in about 10% of the cases, in particular interference in the 
judicial functions and threats to lawyers and prosecutors. Lawsuits against lawyers relating 
to civil, criminal and disciplinary charges constitute 7% of the cases. 6% concern 
allegations relating to the lack of access to courts. Cases which raise issues regarding 
impunity amount to 5% of the communications. 4% of the cases relate to military courts 
trying civilians, and the same percentage concerns restriction on the freedom of expression 
of lawyers. Finally, 10% cover other issues, such as freedom of expression of lawyers, 
impunity, access to a lawyer in private, tenure, removal and appointment of judges, and 
disbarment of lawyers. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur has included in the present report a table of communications 
sent and replies received from governments to provide the Human Rights Council with an 
overview of developments in 2010 and the first trimester of 2011.  
</p>
<p>16. The table indicates the type of communication, the subject of the communication 
and provides a summary of the types of violations alleged. The Special Rapporteur has 
classified the communications thematically depending on the nature of the alleged 
violations raised. Furthermore, the table indicates the status of the replies and the date the 
response provided by the Government has been received. </p>

<p><b>  Argentina 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comunicaci&#243;n enviada 
</b></p>
<p>17. El 27 de abril de 2010, la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados y 
abogados, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los 
derechos humanos, enviaron un llamamiento urgente se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del 
Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el ataque que se habr&#237;a producido contra 
el estudio jur&#237;dico de la abogada <b>Mar&#237;a Isabel Caccioppolis</b>. Dicha abogada representar&#237;a 
al Profesor C&#233;sar Manuel Rom&#225;n, querellante en la causa por violaci&#243;n de los derechos 
humanos acontecida en 1976 contra adolescentes del Centro de Estudiantes de la Escuela 
Normal de Concepci&#243;n del Uruguay en la provincia argentina de Entre R&#237;os. 
</p>
<p>18. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 8 de abril de 2010, personas desconocidas 
habr&#237;an ingresado por la fuerza en la oficina de la Sra. Mar&#237;a Isabel Caccioppolis y habr&#237;an 
provocado importantes destrozos. Los individuos habr&#237;an robado documentos y prendido 
fuego a papeles y a un ordenador. Las llamas habr&#237;an alcanzado importante documentaci&#243;n 
que la abogada ten&#237;a en su poder con relaci&#243;n a diferentes causas por violaciones de 
derechos humanos. 
</p>
<p>19. La Sra. Mar&#237;a Isabel Caccioppolis, que ya habr&#237;a sido objeto de intimidaciones en el 
pasado, es una profesional conocida por representar a los querellantes en las causas que se 
tramitan por violaciones de los derechos humanos durante la dictadura militar en 
Concepci&#243;n del Uruguay. Parece que no se tratar&#237;a de un hecho aislado ya que otros 
estudios de abogados querellantes en las mismas causas en Paran&#225;, capital de Entre R&#237;os, 
habr&#237;an sufrido ataques parecidos.  
</p>
<p>20. Asimismo, hechos similares habr&#237;an tenido lugar en otras partes del pa&#237;s durante los 
&#250;ltimos meses. El 30 de diciembre de 2009, dos hombres armados se habr&#237;an introducido en 
la Secretar&#237;a de Derechos Humanos de la Provincia de Buenos Aires y habr&#237;an robado 
material relacionado con cr&#237;menes de lesa humanidad cometidos durante la dictadura as&#237; 
como otros documentos de investigaciones sobre delitos que involucrar&#237;an a la Polic&#237;a 
provincial. Una comunicaci&#243;n fue enviada por la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos, el 21 de enero de 2010. 
</p>
<p>21. Se temi&#243; que el ataque contra el gabinete jur&#237;dico de la Sra. Mar&#237;a Isabel 
Caccioppolis, as&#237; como contra otros estudios de abogados querellantes en las mismas y en 
otras causas, sean indicios de intentos de intimidaci&#243;n a defensores de los derechos 
humanos y, en particular a abogados, que intentan recabar informaci&#243;n y defender casos 
sobre violaciones de derechos humanos y libertades fundamentales ante la justicia 
argentina.  
</p>
<p><b>  Comunicaci&#243;n recibida 
</b></p>
<p>22. En una carta fechada el 3 de agosto de 2010, el Gobierno respondi&#243; al llamamiento 
urgente con fecha de 27 de abril de 2010. 
</p>
<p>23. El d&#237;a 8 de abril de 2010, la Dra. Mar&#237;a Isabel Caccioppolis se comunica 
personalmente con el Sr. Subsecretario de Derechos Humanos de Entre R&#237;os, anotici&#225;ndolo 
del robo e incendio de parte de su estudio jur&#237;dico en esa madrugada y que la Polic&#237;a de la 
Provincia de Entre R&#237;os hab&#237;a tomado la denuncia de lo acontecido, estando la misma 
radicada en el Juzgado de Instrucci&#243;n de turno a cargo del Dr. Mariano Mart&#237;nez de la 
ciudad de Concepci&#243;n del Uruguay.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>24. Inmediatamente el Gobierno de Entre R&#237;os, dispuso por la custodia personal de la 
Dra. Mar&#237;a Isabel Caccioppolis ante los sucesos acaecidos y por expreso pedido de la 
misma.  
</p>
<p>25. En conocimiento que el robo e incendio del estudio jur&#237;dico podr&#237;a tener 
connotaciones relacionadas con el juicio que lleva adelante sobre la denuncia del Prof. 
C&#233;sar Rom&#225;n, querellante en la causa por violaciones de derechos humanos acontecidas en 
1976 contra adolescentes del Centro de Estudiantes de la Escuela Normal de la Ciudad de 
Concepci&#243;n del Uruguay, la Subsecretar&#237;a de Derechos Humanos se comunic&#243; con el 
querellante quien esta radicado en la Ciudad de Mar del Plata, a quien se le ofreci&#243; custodia 
personal por intermedio del Subsecretario de Derechos Humanos de la Provincia de Buenos 
Aires. La Dra. Caccioppolis no ha presentado ninguna queja en este organismo, siendo 
recibida personalmente por el Sr. Ministro de Gobierno, la Secretaria de Justicia, Seguridad 
y Derechos Humanos, y el Sr. Jefe de la Polic&#237;a de Entre R&#237;os, donde se le brind&#243; todo el 
apoyo requerido.  
</p>
<p>26. Ni este Gobierno, ni ninguna organizaci&#243;n de derechos humanos de Entre R&#237;os ha 
recibido denuncias sobre atentados o intimidaciones a otros abogados querellantes en la 
Provincia de Entre R&#237;os. 
</p>
<p>27. Sobre las investigaciones judiciales, la Dra. Mar&#237;a Isabel Caccioppolis es querellante 
en la causa y este organismo no cuenta con informaci&#243;n sobre las investigaciones 
judiciales, tom&#225;ndose conocimiento que los autores del hecho fueron apresados, 
imput&#225;ndose las autor&#237;as de los hechos y neg&#225;ndoseles a la excarcelaci&#243;n al d&#237;a de la fecha. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comentarios y observaciones de la Relatora Especial 
</b></p>
<p>28. La Relatora Especial agradece la respuesta del Gobierno de Argentina a la 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 27 de april de 2010 y en particular, el informe transmitido por la 
Subsecretar&#237;a de Derechos Humanos de Entre R&#237;os. 
</p>
<p>29. En este sentido, la Relatora aprecia las medidas tomadas por el Gobierno de Entre 
R&#237;os para asegurar la seguridad de la abogada Mar&#237;a Isabel Caccioppolis, asi como los 
efuerzos por parte del Sr. Ministro de Gobierno, de la Secretaria de Justicia, Seguridad y 
Derechos Humanos, y del Sr. Jefe de la Polic&#237;a de Entre R&#237;os de las autoridades p&#250;blicas 
para brindarle a la Sra. Caccioppolis el apoyo requerido. Asimismo, la Relatora aprecia la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, indicando que los autores del hecho fueron apresados y sanctionados. 
</p>
<p>30. La Relatora Especial quisiera subrayar la importancia de garantizar un ambiente 
seguro que permita a los abogados de derechos humanos llevar a cabo su trabajo, de 
acuerdo con los Principios B&#225;sicos sobre la Funci&#243;n de los Abogados, aprobados por el 
Octavo Congreso de las Naciones Unidas sobre Prevenci&#243;n del Delito y Tratamiento del 
Delincuente, celebrado en La Habana (Cuba) del 27 de agosto al 7 de septiembre de 1990.

<p>31. On 15 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism sent a 
urgent appeal concerning the arrest and detention of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Ali Abdulemam</b>. 
Mr. Abdulemam is the creator and manager of the www.bahrainonline.org news website, </p>

<p>and a blogger who regularly wrote articles regarding media freedom and freedom of 
expression in Bahrain. 
</p>
<p>32. According to the information received, on 4 September 2010 at approximately 9:00 
p.m., Mr. Abdulemam was arrested following a summons, via a telephone call, for 
questioning by the National Security Apparatus (NSA). Since his arrest, Mr. Abdulemam 
has been denied access to legal representation, and doubts exist as to whether or not he has 
been presented before the Public Prosecutor within the time limits proscribed by law. 
He was denied access to family members until 29 September 2010.

<p>33. Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest was reportedly declared by the Ministry of Interior to form 
part of an investigation into an alleged &#8220;terrorist network accused of planning and executing 
a campaign of violence, intimidation and subversion in Bahrain&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>34. According to article 27 of the 2006 &#8220;Law to Protect Society from Acts of 
Terrorism&#8221;, which was invoked by the authorities in the arrests of Mr. Abdulemam and 
various other human rights defenders, a suspect may be detained for a maximum of 15 days 
before either being brought before the Public Prosecutor must question the suspect within 
three days and either order him remanded or released. Government officials have claimed 
that Mr. Abdulemam was presented before the Public Prosecutor soon after his arrest. On 
22 September 2010 it was announced by officials that, beginning on 27 September 2010, all 
detained human rights activists would be allowed to receive visits from their families. Mr. 
Abdulemam&#8217;s brother, Mr. Hossein Abdulemam, visited the Office of the Public Prosecutor 
in order to apply for permission to visit Mr. Abdulemam in detention. He was, however, 
subsequently informed by an official at said Office that Mr. Abdulemam had not been 
brought before the Public Prosecutor and that there is neither any record of, nor personal 
number assigned to him, at the Office. 
</p>
<p>35. Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s initial 15-day detention period expired on 19 September 2010; if 
true, the aforementioned lack of knowledge regarding the case at the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor would suggest that Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s detention continues in contradiction of 
said legislation. 
</p>
<p>36. Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s wife was allowed to visit him in detention for the first time on 29 
September 2010; however, Mr. Abdulemam has yet to be granted access to his lawyer.  
</p>
<p>37. The Ministry of the Interior has allegedly denied that Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest was 
in any way related to his political views. However, since 5 September 2010 - the day 
following Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest - the BahrainOnline.org website has been unavailable 
both within Bahrain and abroad. Furthermore, it is feared that Mr. Abdulemam has been 
compelled to reveal the password for his Internet service.  
</p>
<p>38. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Abdulemam may be 
related to his peaceful and legitimate work in defence of human rights, particularly with 
respect to freedom of expression. Furthermore, mindful of the allegation that Mr. 
Abdulemam has yet to be granted access to his lawyer and brought before the Public 
Prosecutor, serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>39. In a letter dated 15 November 2010, the Government responded to the urgent appeal 
dated 15 October 2010. It was underlined that the Government has not, and does not, target 
nor prosecute any individual based on their peaceful views or opinions. Further, Bahrain is 
committed to the rule of law, and to following the proper legal and constitutional 
procedures designed to protect the rights of all in society. In the case of Mr. Abdulemam, it 
was indicated that the summary set out in the communication is inaccurate.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>40. Mr. Abdulemam was arrested on 4 September on the basis of evidence of his 
membership of a terrorist network. Investigations have found the network to be responsible 
for inciting and planning terrorist acts, inciting hatred and contempt against the 
government, threatening public order and endangering the safety and security of the 
Kingdom. The aim of the network is to overthrow and change the political system of the 
country by force, dissolve the constitution and obstruct the enforcement of its provisions. 
The network recruited nationals and foreigners, youngsters and adults, and incited them to 
commit acts of riot, violence and vandalism, disturbance of civil peace, attacking security 
personnel, nationals and foreigners residing in Bahrain, terrorizing them and damaging their 
private property.  
</p>
<p>41. All such acts are punishable crimes pursuant to Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. This law grants Judicial Officers the right 
subject to the emergence of sufficient evidence, to issue a protective custody order for a 
period not exceeding five days, and if necessary, permission may be obtained from the 
Public Prosecution to extend the custody to a period not exceeding 10 days. Such 
permission is strictly granted if the Judicial Officer provides sufficient evidence that the 
extension of the custody is essential for the continuation of the investigations. Given the 
nature of Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s suspected crimes, he was arrested under this Law No. 58 of 
2006 with respect to Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts, and not under 
Bahrain&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that suspects must be brought before 
the Public Prosecution within 48 hours of arrest.  
</p>
<p>42. Prior to the elapse of the five day protective custody, Mr. Abdulemam was duly 
referred to the Public Prosecution on 9 September 2010, which commenced and handled 
criminal proceedings. Following intensive investigations by prosecutors, Mr. Abdulemam 
was charged under the Penal Code No. 15 of 1976 and Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. He is currently facing the following 
charges: joining an outlawed organization with the aim of violating the law and disrupting 
provisions of the constitution and to prevent public authorities from exercising their duties, 
using terrorism and violence; inciting to acts of sabotage, destruction and arson, publicly 
instigating sectarian hatred which disturbs civil peace; and spreading provocative 
propaganda, news and false statements to destabilize public security and cause damages to 
public interests. 
</p>
<p>43. Contrary to the fears expressed in the communication, on 23 September, the Public 
Prosecution gave permission to the families of defendants in this case to visit those in 
custody, and Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s family subsequently visited him on 29 September.  
</p>
<p>44. In relation to the Working Group&#8217;s concern regarding whether the acts shall be 
criminalized as terrorist, the first two conditions (means used and intent) put forward by the 
group will be demonstrated. Firstly, with respect to the means used. The sabotage groups 
have been committing acts of violence, rioting, vandalizing private and public properties, 
carrying out arsons, blocking highways and crippling all forms of life activities. These 
groups have added violence to their acts by using Molotov bombs, homemade bombs and 
sharpened iron bars. Molotov bombs are considered as improvised incendiary weapons and 
are primarily intended to set targets ablaze and destroy them. In fact, two police were killed 
in two separate horrific attacks by Molotov bombs: a policeman, and an innocent Pakistani 
passer-by, father of five. 
</p>
<p>45. Secondly, it is clear that the intent of these acts was to undermine public order, and 
to cause fear among the general population, for example by carrying out their attacks at 
night to spread even greater fear among the general public. Indeed, some of the suspects 
have admitted that this was their intent. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p>46. Therefore, given that the acts of the groups in question clearly amount to serious 
(sometimes deadly) violence, and given that their intent was to cause fear among the 
population and to disrupt public order, it can clearly be seen that the activities amount to 
acts of criminal terrorism.  
</p>
<p>47. It is worth mentioning that Mr. Abdulemam, along with other members of the 
network, have sought to label their acts of violence as human rights activism or peaceful 
demonstrations or protest. It goes without saying that inciting to acts of riot, violence and 
vandalism under the guise of promoting and protecting human rights is a flagrant violation 
of Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which stipulates that everyone 
has the right to life, liberty and security of person. The Government of Bahrain is bound to 
protect individuals and groups against the abuse of these fundamental rights.  
</p>
<p>48. Mr. Abdulemam is the creator of the <i>www.bahrainonline.org</i> website, which he has 
managed for many years. He provided that he has created this forum to instigate sectarian 
hatred and to spread provocative propaganda, news and false statements to destabilize 
public security and damage public interest. The leaders and members of the terrorist 
network have used this website, with the knowledge and observance of Mr. Abdulemam, to 
incite acts of sabotage, violence and terrorism. Furthermore, this website is known to praise 
such acts by posting footage and photos of the destruction and damage caused by those 
groups, along with glorifying them as heroes. Mr. Abdulemam has confirmed that he was 
funded by leaders of the terrorism network for doing so. 
</p>
<p>49. With regard to the concern expressed by the Working Group with respect to the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdulemam, it is underlined that the 
Government of Bahrain fully reaffirms its adherence to the provisions stipulated in the UN 
Body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons under any form of Detention or 
Imprisonment. All persons under any form of detention are treated in a humane manner and 
with respect for their physical and mental integrity and inherent dignity of the human 
person. Any arrest, detention or imprisonment is only carried out strictly in accordance with 
the provisions of the law and by competent officials or persons authorized for that purpose. 
Convinced that the adoption of this Body of Principles would make an important 
contribution to the protection of human rights, Bahrain has prohibited by law any act 
contrary to the rights and duties contained therein. 
</p>
<p>50. Mr. Abdulemam is charged with criminal offences. He preserves his right to be 
presumed innocent and is treated as such until proved guilty in a public trial according to 
law, at which he has all the guarantees necessary for his defence. In this connection, 
Bahrain restates its commitment to preserving the suspect&#8217;s right to fair proceedings before 
an independent and impartial tribunal to determine the criminal charges against him. The 
law guarantees the independence of the judiciary and the probity and impartiality of judges. 
In this context, attention is drawn to article 104 of the Constitution of Bahrain, which 
stipulates &#8220;No authority shall prevail over the judgment if a judge, and under no 
circumstances may the course of justice be interfered with.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>51. Mr. Abdulemam has exercised his constitutional and legal rights with regard to his 
legal representation. Although he has refused to appoint a counsel for himself and no 
counsel has taken the initiative to represent him, he was legally represented in the first court 
hearing that was held publicly on 28 October 2010. As provided by the relevant legislation, 
if a suspect does not have legal counsel, one will be assigned to him by the court at its 
expense. Further, judgments of the criminal court may be challenged before the courts of 
Appeal, while the Courts of Cassation can examine the compliance of the judgments of the 
foregoing courts with the law.  
</p>
<p>52. Finally, leaders and members of the terrorist network, along with all citizens of 
Bahrain, preserve their right of the legitimate and peaceful work in the defence of human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b>  
</p>
<p>rights, as enshrined in the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. They also preserve the 
right of freedom of expression and opinion, as enshrined in the Constitution of Bahrain 
which provides that everyone has the right to express his opinion and publish it by word of 
mouth or in writing under the rules and conditions laid down by law, provided that the 
fundamental beliefs of Islamic doctrine are not infringed, the unity of the people is not 
prejudiced, and discord or sectarianism is not aroused. Legal action is only exercised 
against those who deviate from the scope of the legitimate and peaceful work in the defence 
of human rights and freedom of expression and recourse to the execution of acts amounting 
to the abuse of law. 
</p>
<p>53. In conclusion, the Government of Bahrain reaffirms its guarantee to provide all 
necessary measures to ensure that Mr. Ali Abdulemam is not deprived arbitrarily of his 
liberty and is entitled in full equality to fair proceedings before an independent and 
impartial tribunal. Bahrain acknowledges the significant role of the Human Rights Council 
in the contribution to the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals, and fully supports its efforts in 
promoting universal respect for human rights along with its determination to examine 
thoroughly all the cases brought to its attention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response to the 
communication dated 15 October 2010 which clarifies the case of Mr. Abdulemam. The 
Special Rapporteur takes note of the criminal charges retained against Mr. Ali Abdulemam 
and of the information indicating that he was referred to Public Prosecution on 9 September 
2010. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the information that in the absence of a lawyer 
appointed to the suspect, legal counsel is assigned to him/her by the court at its expense. 
She further notes the information which indicates that Mr. Abdulemann was legally 
represented in the first court hearing that was held publicly on 28 October 2010. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall that legal representation should be provided 
at all stages of criminal proceedings in accordance with the Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers. 
</p>

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>55. On 17 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers; Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent 
an urgent appeal concerning the detention of <b>Ms. Moshrefa Mishu</b>, a leftist political 
activist, General Secretary of the Ganatantrik Biplobi (Democratic Revolutionary) Party 
and President of the Garment Workers Unity Forum (GWUF). 
</p>
<p>56. According to the information received, on 14 December 2010, Ms. Mishu was 
arrested by members of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police and taken into custody by the 
Detective Branch of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police and detained in the Dhaka Central Jail. 
</p>
<p>57. It is reported that prior to her arrest, in the evening of 13 December 2010, Ms. Mishu 
received two calls on her mobile phone. Both callers claimed to be journalists wishing to 
interview her and asked her to stay home. It is further reported that on previous occasions, 
Ms. Mishu had received calls from unidentified phone numbers, including alleged death 
threats from the callers who would introduce themselves as officers of intelligence agencies 
and the Special Branch of police. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>58. In the early morning of 14 December 2010, at approximately 1:35 a.m., twelve 
plain-clothed persons comprising nine heavily armed men and three women forcibly 
entered into Ms. Mishu&#8217;s house. According to the information received, they claimed to be 
members of the Detective Branch of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police. Reportedly, they 
searched the house without a search warrant. Ms. Mishu was taken to the local police 
station without being presented with an arrest warrant. She was told that they were 
instructed to follow the orders of the &#8220;upper level of the government&#8221; and that if Ms. Mishu 
failed to follow their orders, they would use force against her. They did not allow the 
family to make any phone calls to the authorities, friends or relatives.  
</p>
<p>59. According to the information received, Ms. Mishu was not allowed to carry her 
emergency medicines, inhaler and clothes despite repeated requests. Ms. Mishu was put 
into a vehicle, which was not recognizable as belonging to the police, and driven around the 
city for few hours before reaching the office of the Detective Branch of the Dhaka 
Metropolitan Police located at 36 Minto Road at approximately 5:00 a.m. It is reported that 
on 14 December 2010, from 7:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Ms. Mishu was interrogated by 
Additional Deputy Commissioner of the Detective Branch Mr. Nazrul Islam, Assistant 
Commissioner Muniruz Zaman and Assistant Commissioner Nasir. The subject of 
interrogation related to Ms. Mishu&#8217;s visits abroad, the funders of her political activities, her 
relationship with external groups in China as well as her attachment with the workers&#8217; 
movements for an increase of wages in the Ready Made Garment (RMG) sector in 
Bangladesh. It is reported that the police repeatedly insisted on her signing on a blank piece 
of paper. Ms. Mishu refused to follow such orders and was allegedly subjected to several 
death-threats by the police officers.  
</p>
<p>60. According to the information received, Ms. Mishu was informed by the police that 
she was the subject of three pending cases. The first two cases were registered with the 
Kafrul police station (dated 30 June 2010, No. 76(6) 10, Government Register No. 386/10, 
under Sections 143, 149, 323, 324, 325, 332, 333, 353, 427, and 114 of the Penal Code; and 
dated 9 December 2010, No. 21(12) 10 of the Kafrul police, Government Register No. 
854/10, under Sections 143, 448, 379, 427, and 506 of the Penal Code). The third case was 
lodged with the Khilkhet police of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police on 12 December 2010 
(No. 13 (12) 10 of Khilkhet police, Government Register No. 255/10, under Sections 147, 
148, 149, 332, 333, 353, 436, 379, 427, and 109 of the Penal Code). 
</p>
<p>61. It is further reported that Ms. Mishu was produced before the Chief Metropolitan 
Magistrate Court of Dhaka in the first two cases. The police submitted a petition requesting 
10 days remand for Ms. Mishu. In the first case, the Magistrate Mr. A. I. H. granted remand 
for two days to the Kafrul police. In the second case, he rejected the remand petition.  
</p>
<p>62. Subsequently, Ms. Mishu was produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate&#8217;s 
Court of Dhaka for the third case. The police submitted another petition seeking 10-days 
remand. The First Additional Magistrate Mr. A. H. R. B. ordered the Khilkhet police to 
submit the &#8216;Case Diary&#8217; on the following day. On 19 December 2010, instead of Mr. A. H. 
R. B., Metropolitan Magistrate, Mr. M. A. M. heard the remand petition of the Khilkhet 
police. During the hearing, Ms. Mishu&#8217;s health condition deteriorated due to a chronic 
bronchial asthma and spinal pain. The Metropolitan Magistrate Mr. M. A. M. rejected a bail 
petition of Ms. Mishu&#8217;s lawyer. Allegedly, the Magistrate stated as follows &#8220;I have strict 
direction from the Government that in any situation and at any cost not to grant bail to 
Mishu&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>63. According to the information received, the Magistrates involved in the cases against 
Ms. Mishu entertained all the petitions for remand written in plain paper by the police 
without a prescribed application on Bangladesh Police Form No. 90. According to the 
source, the validity of such petitions is doubtful. It is reported that in accordance with the 
directives passed by a Divisional Bench of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>of Bangladesh, as reported in Dhaka Law Report No. 55, a Magistrate should form a 
medical board to examine a detainee before sending the person to police remand. It is also 
alleged that during the periods of remands granted by the Magistrates, Ms. Mishu was taken 
into the custody of the Detective Branch of the police rather that of Kafrul or Khilkhet.  
</p>
<p>64. It is reported that in the light of Ms. Mishu&#8217;s critical health condition during the 
Court&#8217;s hearing on 19 December 2010, the Magistrate ordered to arrange medical treatment 
and she was subsequently taken to the National Hospital, which in turn referred to the 
Bangbandhu Sheikh Muzib Medical University. Ms. Mishu was not admitted to the latter 
due to an intervention of a police officer. As a result, she was transferred to the Dhaka 
Medical College Hospital but was refused treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>65. On 9 March 2011, the Government of Bangladesh acknowledged receipt of the 
communication and indicated that it would be forwarded to the concerned authorities for 
their necessary inquiry and actions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>66. On 21 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; and Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent 
an urgent appeal concerning the situation of <b>Mr. Salauddin Quader Chowdhury</b> (aged 
63), a Member of Parliament from the opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP).  
</p>
<p>67. According to the information received, in the early hours of 16 December 2010, Mr. 
Chowdhury was arrested by the security forces of Rapid Action Battalion, Detective Branch 
police, and the Directorate-General Foreign Intelligence at his apartment in Benani 
neighbourhood in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is reported that the arrest was linked to an incident 
in June where a car was set on fire in Dhaka, killing a passenger. Reportedly, Mr. 
Chowdhury has not been charged, nor has he had access to a lawyer since his arrest and 
was only allowed to meet his relatives for the first time on 22 December 2010.  
</p>
<p>68. It is further reported that following his arrest on 16 December 2010, Mr. Chowdhury 
was subjected to torture by the Bangladeshi security forces during interrogation at a private 
residence, with a physician accompanying them. Mr. Chowdhury was reportedly tortured 
for several hours, including by applying electrodes to his genitals, beating him, slitting his 
stomach with razors and twisting his toenails and fingernails with pliers. It is further 
reported that Mr. Chowdhury was repeatedly revived after falling unconscious during the 
ordeal. Only when his condition further deteriorated under interrogation, was he taken to 
the Bangabandhu Medical Hospital for treatment (at 7:30 a.m. in the morning of 16 
December 2010). Reportedly, video footage taken in the hospital grounds showed Mr. 
Chowdhury as weak, in pain, unable to walk on his own and with an apparent blood stain 
on his shirt. After an hour in the hospital, Mr. Chowdhury was reportedly taken to the 
headquarters of the Detective Branch of the Police, where he was again subjected to torture, 
including by further electrocution. It is alleged that when Mr. Chowdhury was first visited 
by his relatives on 22 December 2010, he was in a critical health condition, his genitals and 
nose were still bleeding three days after the most recent electrocution, and there were cut 
marks on his stomach and bruises all over his body.  
</p>
<p>69. The arrest and alleged torture of Mr. Chowdhury had been widely reported in the 
local media. Following several media inquiries, the Inspector General of Police reportedly 
denied that Mr. Chowdhury had been tortured and informed the media that on the morning 
of 16 December 2010, he was taken to hospital to be treated for an asthma condition. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>70. It is further reported that Mr. Chowdhury was likely to undergo additional 
interrogation by the police following the charges of involvement in crimes against 
humanity and a subsequent arrest warrant brought against him on 19 December 2010, by 
Bangladesh&#8217;s International Crimes Tribunal, which had been set up to try crimes committed 
during the 1971 war of independence. On 22 December 2010, following the Court order, 
Mr. Chowdhury was reportedly placed in Dhaka Central Prison pending proceedings in 
both the June and the 1971 cases. It is reported that Mr. Chowdhury was not present at the 
Court hearing and had not been allowed to meet his lawyers. He had reportedly been kept in 
the holding cell downstairs and was later transferred to a remote prison outside Dhaka. 
</p>
<p>71. Despite the reported deterioration in his health, Mr. Chowdhury has since his arrest 
reportedly been denied access to independent, specialized medical treatment. Moreover, the 
Government has reportedly actively sought, through the courts, to ensure that such access is 
denied. Reportedly, on 2 January 2011, in response to Mr. Chowdhury&#8217;s wife&#8217;s petition to 
the High Court Division of the Supreme Court seeking admission to a cardiac hospital for 
independent medical treatment, the High Court Division ordered on 3 January 2011, that 
Mr. Chowdhury be given access to medical treatment within two days. However, following 
an appeal by the Government, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court stayed the order 
for six weeks on 4 January 2011.  
</p>
<p>72. It is further reported that on 5 February 2011, upon arrival in Kashipur Central Jail 
where Mr. Chowdhury was being detained, Mr. Chowdhury&#8217;s relatives were told that he 
was unwell and physically unable to see them. Only when the ambulance arrived to take 
Mr. Chowdhury to hospital, was the family able to see him. It is claimed that Mr. 
Chowdhury&#8217;s health severly deteriorated while in Kashipur Central Jail, and may have had 
a stroke. It is alleged that Mr. Chowdhury was taken to the Government Bangubandhu 
Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, but that he refused to be treated there and 
claimed to have recognised the doctors who have participated in reviving him after he was 
repeatedly tortured in December 2010. It is reported that Mr. Chowdhury was taken back to 
prison and possibly put into solitary confinement.  
</p>
<p>73. It is also reported that on 6 February 2011, the family members were not allowed to 
see Mr. Chowdhury in Kashipur Central Jail and were told by the prison guard that the 
visiting hours were over and that they should try to come back another day. In an attempt to 
visit Mr. Chowdhury on 8 February 2011, the family members and Mr. Chowdhury&#8217;s 
lawyer were told by the prison doctor that Mr. Chowdhury refused to meet them as he was 
weak and physically unable to walk.  
</p>
<p>74. Serious concern is expressed about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. 
Chowdhury in view of his deteriorating health condition. Further concern is expressed 
about the allegations according to which Mr. Chowdhury has not been provided with an 
independent medical examination or treatment. Finally, concern is expressed about the 
failure to investigate allegations of torture to which Mr. Chowdhury has reportedly been 
subjected while in the prison.

<p>77. On 28 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning information submitted to their attention indicating that the <b>Belarusian Helsinki 
Committee</b> was requested by the Ministry of Justice to submit a copy to it of the letter 
addressed to the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. The 
Belarusian Helsinki Committee is an independent, non-political, non-profit public 
association which works to promote and protect human rights providing legal assistance 
and regularly holding human rights seminars and training courses. We have also received 
information concerning alleged interference in the professional discharge of functions of 
lawyers in connection with the 19 to 20 December 2010, demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>78. According to information received, on 12 January 2011, the Belarusian Helsinki 
Committee (BHC) posted on its website information that it had sent a letter to the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers.  Immediately after, the head of 
department of non-commercial organizations of the Ministry of Justice reportedly sent a fax 
to the BHC requesting it to provide him with the text of letter within 30 minutes.  
</p>
<p>79. On the same day a statement was issued by the Ministry of Justice accusing the 
BHC of distorting information contained in reports issued by the Ministry regarding the 
demonstrations. The Ministry also alleged that the information sent by the BHC to 
international organizations distorted the present state of affairs in the country and that such 
conduct was tantamount to a violation of legislation governing Non-Governmental 
Organizations.  
</p>
<p>80. We have also received reports alleging interference in the lawyers&#8217; discharge of 
professional functions in their capacity as defense counsel of those clients associated with 
the demonstrations which occurred on 19 and 20 December 2010. It is alleged that arrested 
persons are prevented from meeting their lawyers in private and the frequency of visits by 
counsel to meet their clients is restricted.  
</p>
<p>81. We are informed that national legislation governing confidentiality of investigations 
provides for &#8220;secrecy of investigation&#8221;. It is alleged that the provision is being used by 
investigators at the Minsk City Department of Interior as a means of prohibiting lawyers 
from disseminating any information related to the investigation and the whereabouts of 
those arrested in connection with the demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>82. On 29 December 2010, the Ministry of Justice issued a statement alleging that 
comments made by some lawyers providing legal defense to people arrested in connection 
with the demonstrations violated the professional ethics of lawyers. The statement alleged 
that some lawyers were misrepresenting information relating to investigations, 
opportunities for their clients to seek legal assistance, their clients&#8217; health status and prison 
conditions, and the work of law enforcement bodies.   
</p>
<p>83. On 5 January 2011, the Ministry of Justice is alleged to have sent letters to several 
lawyers including <b>Ms. Tamara Sidarenka</b> and <b>Mr. Paval Sapelko</b>.  
</p>
<p>84. The letter sent to Ms. Tamara Sidarenka, alleged that on 24 December 2010, during 
an interview she falsely represented that she was prevented from meeting her client and that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>
<p>such conduct undermined lawyers obligations to maintain professional and personal dignity 
and violated professional ethics of the legal profession .We are informed that the Ministry 
of Justice ordered Ms. Sidarenka to take measures to prevent such misrepresentation of 
information. She was instructed to inform the Ministry on measures taken to implement the 
order by 15 January 2011, otherwise her license would be revoked.  
</p>
<p>85. The letter sent to Mr. Paval Sapelko, who is representing one of the presidential 
candidates arrested during the demonstration, alleged that he had made incorrect statements 
against the college of lawyers, the treatment of his client and the conditions of his 
detention. It also alleged that he had made comments regarding pressure from the State on 
the work of State lawyers, especially in the defense of his client. We are informed that the 
Ministry of Justice requested the Minsk City Bar to take disciplinary action against Mr. 
Sapelka. On 10 January 2011, Mr. Sapelko received a letter from the Ministry of Justice 
that disciplinary action had been initiated to revoke his license.  
</p>
<p>86. There have also been other reports of interference. For example, on 4 January 2011, 
the Collegium of the Ministry of Justice endorsed a decision of the Ministry&#8217;s Bar 
Qualification Commission made on 3 January 2011, to suspend the license of Ms 
Valiantsina Bus&#8217;ko, an advocate of Hrodna Regional Bar. She was suspended for her 
participation in the demonstrations. In addition, on 10 January 2011, the General 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office initiated a case against <b>Mr. Mikhail Volchak</b> for divulging 
information related to a criminal investigation against the former Senior Investigator of the 
General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office who was investigating corruption cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>87. In a letter dated 1 February 2011, the Government acknowledged receipt of the 
communication dated 28 January 2011 and indicated that the aforementioned appeal cannot 
be brought to the attention of relevant Belarusian authorities due to the absence of its 
translation from English into Russian.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>88. On 10 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers sent an urgent appeal concerning the alleged pattern of intimidation and 
interference in the discharge of the professional functions of lawyers, including the lawyers 
named <b>Mr. Uladzimir Toustsik, Ms. Tamara Harayeva, Mr. Aleh Aheyeu, Ms. 
Tatsiana Aheyeva </b>and <b>Mr. Pavel Sapelka</b> in connection with the December 2010 
demonstrations and events. 
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur drew to the attention of the Government of Belarus that 
allegations of intimidation and interference in the discharge of professional duties of 
lawyers had been previously addressed in the joint urgent appeal dated 28 January 2011 
sent jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression; and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders and a joint urgent appeal was also sent on 25 February 2011 concerning 
multiple allegations of harassment, arrests and interrogation of numerous human rights 
defenders including human rights lawyers in Belarus following the presidential elections 
held in December 2010.  
</p>
<p>90. According to the information received, on 29 December 2010, the Ministry of 
Justice issued a statement, published on its official website, alleging that a number of 
lawyers had breached the legislation on the legal profession and professional ethics by 
presenting information about investigations, their clients&#8217; opportunities to avail themselves 
of legal assistance, their clients&#8217; health status and conditions of detention, and the work of 
the law enforcement bodies of the country in a biased manner. The Ministry further </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b>  
</p>
<p>recommended that the head of the Minsk City Bar Association take immediate measures to 
ensure full compliance with the legislation and requirements of professional ethics by 
lawyers. 
</p>
<p>91. Reportedly in January 2011, the Minsk City Bar Association which had not found 
any breaches of professional ethics by lawyers, refused to initiate disciplinary proceedings. 
In this context, it is alleged that the Ministry of Justice organized and undertook an 
inspection of the Minsk City Bar Association, the results of which were considered at 
meetings held by the Bar Qualification Commission and the Ministry of Justice Board. 
According to the results, several lawyers whose names are Mr. Uladzimir Toustsik, Ms. 
Tamara Harayeva, Mr. Aleh Aheyeu and Ms. Tatsiana Aheyeva were found guilty of 
breaches of the legislation on the legal profession and professional ethics. Subsequently, 
their licenses to practise as lawyers were reportedly revoked by the Ministry of Justice on 
14 February 2011. It is further alleged that the Ministry instructed the Minsk City Bar 
Association to take immediate actions to secure legal assistance for the former clients of the 
aforementioned lawyers and has sent several requests calling for disciplinary measures 
against lawyers. 
</p>
<p>92. The following information concerning the four lawyers mentioned above has in 
particular been brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, as well as the case of 
<b>Mr. Pavel Sapelka</b>: 
</p>
<p>93. a) <b>Mr. Uladzimir Toustsik</b>, a lawyer practising in Minsk, with license No. 1337 of 
25 January 2008, is the defence lawyer of Ms. Iryna Khalip, the wife of the former 
presidential candidate, Mr. Andrei Sannikau. Ms. Khalip was allegedly held in detention by 
the State Security Committee (SIZO KGB) from 20 December 2010 to 29 January 2011, 
and was represented by Mr. Toustsik in this case. It is however alleged, that she had to 
renounce his legal services due to pressure by KGB officers and threats to withdraw Mr. 
Toustsik&#8217;s license to practise as a lawyer. On 14 February 2011, the Ministry of Justice 
decided to disbar Mr. Toustsik for breaches of professional ethics of the legal profession, 
notably for his alleged refusal to provide Ms. Iryna Khalip with legal assistance. 
Information received indicates that Mr. Toustsik will challenge this decision on the basis of 
its legal irregularities.  
</p>
<p>94. b) <b>Ms. Tamara Harayeva</b>, a lawyer with license No. 227 of 26 December 2003, 
practising at the legal consultation office No. 2 of Savetski district in Minsk (Melezha 
Street 4), reportedly took over the legal defence of Ms. Khalip, former client of attorney 
Toustsik. It is reported that on 4 February 2011, Ms. Harayeva notified Ms. Khalip&#8217;s 
parents that she had to withdraw from representing her due to the intimidation being 
exerted. Subsequently, the Ministry of Justice reportedly decided to revoke Ms. 
Harayaeva&#8217;s license on 14 February 2011 for alleged breaches of professional ethics of the 
legal profession, notably for her alleged refusal to provide Ms. Iryna Khalip with legal 
assistance. 
</p>
<p>95. c) <b>Mr. Aleh Aheyeu</b>, a lawyer with license No. 745 of 20 February 2004, practising 
at the legal consultation office of Leninski district in Minsk (Ulyanauskaya Street 4), and a 
member of the Minsk City Bar Presidium, is the defence lawyer of Mr. Ale&#347; Michalevi&#269;, a 
former presidential candidate currently detained at the KGB detention facility for having 
allegedly staged massive protests. It is alleged that on 14 February 2011, KGB officers 
attempted to seize Mr. Aheyeu&#8217;s working documents. On the same day, the Ministry of 
Justice reportedly decided to disbar Mr. Aheyeu for alleged breaches of professional ethics 
of the legal profession and for providing inaccurate information.  
</p>
<p>96. d) On 14 February 2011, the license No. 344 of 26 December 2003 of<b> Ms. Tatsiana 
Aheyeva</b>, member of the Judicial Board of Zavodski district in Minsk (Partyzanski Avenue </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>91), was reportedly revoked for alleged breaches of professional ethics of the legal 
profession and for providing inaccurate information.  
</p>
<p>97. e) On 4 March 2011, <b>Mr. Pavel Sapelka</b> was reportedly excluded from the Minsk 
City Bar Association by decision of its Board, on recommendation of the Ministry of 
Justice. Mr. Sapelka, with license No. 1337 of 25 January 2008, had been working as a 
lawyer in office No. 2 of Savetski district in Minsk (Melezha Street 4) since 1994. It is 
reported that he was defending three well-known politicians, Mr, Andrei Sannikau, former 
presidential candidate, also accused of having organized the protests of 19 December 2010 
and currently detained in the KGB jail (Committee of State Security); Mr. Pavel 
Seviarynets, Head of Electoral Headquarters of the former presidential candidate Mr. Vitali 
Rymasheyvsky, detained in the same facility on the same charges as Mr. Sannikau; and Mr. 
Dzmitry Dashkevich, leader of &quot;Young Front&quot;, a pro-democratic youth organization. 
</p>
<p>98. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was informed that defence lawyers involved in 
at least 17 cases involving former presidential candidates or other persons suspected or 
accused in relation to the events which took place on 19 December 2010, have been 
prevented from meeting with their clients since December 2010. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>99. In a letter dated 14 March 2011, the Government acknowledged receipt of the 
communication dated 10 March 2011 and indicated that the aforementioned appeal cannot 
be brought to the attention of relevant Belarusian authorities due to the absence of its 
translation from English into Russian.  
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>100. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official reply to communications 
dated 28 January and 10 March 2011. She considers response to her communications as an 
important part of the cooperation of Governments with her mandate, and calls upon the 
Government of Belarus to transmit responses to the above-mentioned communications. 
</p>
<p>101. She also expresses her concern at the information received, alleging a pattern of 
intimidation and interference in the discharge of the professional functions of lawyers. In 
this respect, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the need to guarantee the right of 
lawyers to freely represent their clients and perform their professional activity without fear, 
intimidation and interference. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur would like to stress 
once again the importance for Governments to respect and take into account the Basic 
Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted in Havana, Cuba, by the Eighth United Nations 
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, from 27 August to 7 
September 1990, aimed at assisting Member States to protect and ensure the proper role of 
lawyers.

</b></p>
<p>102. El 27 de mayo de 2010, la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados 
y abogados, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la 
informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n a la <b>cesaci&#243;n</b>, el 17 de mayo de 2010, <b>de 22 Magistrados 
de Segunda Instancia por el Consejo de la Magistratura</b> del Estado Plurinacional de 
Bolivia.  
</p>
<p>103. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, dichos Magistrados habr&#237;an sido cesados en 
virtud de que no constaba en sus expedientes personales haber aprobado el examen de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b>  
</p>
<p>competencia para su ingreso en la Judicatura. Sin embargo, dichos Magistrados habr&#237;an 
ingresado al Poder Judicial durante los a&#241;os 1999 y 2000, cuando no se requer&#237;a tal 
examen, mediante una convocatoria p&#250;blica del propio Consejo de la Magistratura, es decir, 
del mismo Consejo que hoy les destituye. Los jueces habr&#237;an ingresado a la carrera judicial 
por concurso de m&#233;ritos en le cual se examin&#243; detenidamente sus antecedentes y 
capacidades, tanto personales como profesionales. 
</p>
<p>104. Igualmente, se inform&#243; que, una convocatoria para que rindiesen tal examen en 2007 
habr&#237;a sido declarada nula por el Tribunal Constitucional en virtud de una acci&#243;n de 
garant&#237;as. Seg&#250;n se expres&#243;, dicha declaraci&#243;n de nulidad, emitida por la m&#225;xima autoridad 
jurisdiccional constitucional, produce efecto de cosa juzgada y deber&#237;a alcanzar a brindar la 
seguridad del derecho reconocido, dado que la cosa juzgada es un principio general b&#225;sico 
del derecho que se vincula con el principio de orden p&#250;blico de<i> &#8220;non bis in idem&#8221;.</i> 
</p>
<p>105. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Consejo de la Magistratura carecer&#237;a por lo tanto 
de competencia para dictar el Acuerdo 033/2010 que dispuso el cese de los 22 Magistrados 
de Segunda Instancia, cuya destituci&#243;n atentar&#237;a contra el principio de la cosa juzgada y 
contra la seguridad del derecho reconocido y ser&#237;a en clara contravenci&#243;n con los principios 
generales b&#225;sicos del Derecho y de las garant&#237;as del debido proceso. 
</p>
<p>106. Se ha informado tambi&#233;n que tras de producirse la destituci&#243;n de los 22 
Magistrados, sus Juzgados fueron allanados, las cerraduras de sus puertas cambiadas y sus 
ordenadores y discos duros revisados. Finalmente, se informo que tres de los cuatro 
integrantes del Consejo de la Magistratura que ordenaron el cese habr&#237;an sido nombrados 
en febrero de 2010 por el Poder Ejecutivo. 
</p>
<p>107. Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por la destituci&#243;n de los 22 magistrados, la cual representa 
un grave ataque contra la independencia del Poder Judicial del Estado Plurinacional de 
Bolivia, as&#237; como para la independencia e imparcialidad de los jueces y magistrados 
bolivianos. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comunicaci&#243;n recibida 
</b></p>
<p>108. En una carta fechada el 12 de agosto de 2010, el Gobierno respondi&#243; al llamamiento 
urgente con fecha de 27 de mayo de 2010. 
</p>
<p>109. Conforme a lo manifestado en el informe remitido por el Consejo de la Judicatura en 
fecha 19 de julio de 2010, los se&#241;ores vocales [22 magistrados] nunca se sometieron al 
Subsistema de Ingreso a la carrera judicial vigente con anterioridad a las citadas 
designaciones. Los se&#241;ores vocales cesados fueron designados entre las gestiones 1999 y 
2000, con base a una convocatoria p&#250;blica que s&#243;lo exig&#237;a el sometimiento a un concurso 
de m&#233;ritos, en contravenci&#243;n a la Ley del Consejo de la Judicatura que establece en sus 
art&#237;culos 24 y 25 el sometimiento de los postulantes a concurso de m&#233;ritos, examen de 
oposici&#243;n y cursos de capacitaci&#243;n. Las designaciones mencionadas por contener vicios de 
nulidad pretendieron subsanarse mediante el Acuerdo N&#176; 374/006 de 3 de octubre de 2006, 
que dispuso convocar a un examen de oposici&#243;n de dichos operadores de justicia, sin 
embargo tal determinaci&#243;n no fue acatada por los vocales, quienes impugnaron la decisi&#243;n 
agotando los recursos administrativos y plantearon una acci&#243;n de Amparo constitucional, 
acci&#243;n que fue declarada procedente mediante la sentencia constitucional N&#176; 0495/2007-R 
de 13 de junio de 2007. 
</p>
<p>110. En la Sentencia de referencia, el Tribunal Constitucional argument&#243; que la 
destituci&#243;n de un juez, solo emerge de una sentencia condenatoria ejecutoriada, situaci&#243;n 
que &#8211;seg&#250;n el Consejo de la Judicatura&#8212; sucedido por un error de interpretaci&#243;n, toda vez 
que si bien un juez no puede ser destituido por no haber rendido su examen de oposici&#243;n, 
&#233;ste si podr&#237;a ser ratificado o cesado en sus funciones, en tal sentido la cesaci&#243;n y 
destituci&#243;n se encuentra claramente diferenciados y responde a causas ajenas entre s&#237;, de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>acuerdo a los art&#237;culos 40 y 41 del Reglamento del Sistema de la Carrera Judicial. El 
Consejo de la Judicatura manifest&#243; en su informe que eran m&#225;s de 10 a&#241;os, que se mantuvo 
latente la irregularidad en las designaciones de los se&#241;ores Vocales cesados, dado que, al 
margen de no haber sido sometidos a un examen de oposici&#243;n, como requisito sine qua non 
para ingresar a la Carrera Judicial, tampoco pretendieron salvar esta omisi&#243;n acogi&#233;ndose a 
la convocatoria de examen de oposici&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>111. Asimismo, previamente el 14 de febrero de 2003, el Tribunal Constitucional en la 
sentencia constitucional N&#176; 0014/2003, se habr&#237;a referido a la situaci&#243;n de los jueces, 
estableciendo que <i>&#8220;(&#8230;) los funcionarios o servidores judiciales ingresaran al sistema de 
carrera judicial, cumpliendo con las condiciones y requisitos previstos en la ley; no se 
opera de manera autom&#225;tica, lo que significa que, quienes ingresaron al Poder Judicial 
con el anterior sistema, deben concluir su periodo de mandato y luego someterse a las 
condiciones y requisitos previstos para ingresar al nuevo sistema</i>&#8221;, sentencia que fue 
desconocida por los vocales citados, dando por hecho su incorporaci&#243;n a la carrera judicial. 
</p>
<p>112. El informe del Consejo de la Judicatura destaca que nadie puede ser evaluado si no 
fue debidamente incorporado en la carrera judicial, en resguardo del principio de legalidad 
y al amparo de la SC N&#176;0014/2003, se dispuso dar por concluida la relaci&#243;n laboral con los 
se&#241;ores vocales ilegalmente designados en las gestiones 1999 y 2000, para lo cual se emiti&#243; 
el Acuerdo N&#176; 033/2010 de 3 de mayo de 2010. 
</p>
<p>113. El Consejo de la Judicatura inform&#243; que los vocales cesados al no haber cumplido 
con todos los requisitos de ingreso a la carrera judicial, no gozaban de continuidad e 
inamovilidad funcionaria; y el Consejo de la Judicatura, como m&#225;xima autoridad 
administrativa y disciplinaria del &#211;rgano Judicial, tiene el deber y la obligaci&#243;n jur&#237;dica de 
cumplir y hacer cumplir la Constituci&#243;n y las leyes; en el caso particular, se dispuso la 
cesaci&#243;n al amparo de la atribuci&#243;n conferida en materia de Recursos Humanos establecida 
en el Art&#237;culo 13 numeral 4) de la Ley N&#176; 1817, Ley del Consejo de la Judicatura, que 
dispone <i>&#8220;Administrar los sistemas de carrera judicial y selecci&#243;n de personal de los 
funcionarios judiciales y personal administrativo&#8221;.</i> 
</p>
<p>114. La Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica del Estado prev&#233; un conjunto de garant&#237;as jurisdiccionales y 
acciones de defensa a favor de las personas cuando sus derechos fundamentales se 
consideran suprimidos o restringidos. En el caso particular la cesaci&#243;n de un funcionario 
puede ser impugnada mediante un recurso de revocatoria ante la misma autoridad que 
dispuso la cesaci&#243;n y mediante la acci&#243;n contenciosa administrativa ante la Corte Suprema 
de Justicia, asimismo cuando dichas instancias se encuentren agotadas el Estado brinda la 
acci&#243;n de Amparo Constitucional como acci&#243;n extraordinaria y subsidiaria  de protecci&#243;n 
de derechos conforme el Art&#237;culo 128 de la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica del Estado.  
</p>
<p>115. La Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica del Estado en los Art&#237;culos 13 y 14 establece que los 
tratados y convenios internacionales sobre Derechos Humanos prevalecen y mantienen su 
vigencia y ejercicio a&#250;n en estados de excepci&#243;n, as&#237; como establece en los Art&#237;culos 8 y 9 
que el Estado boliviano propugna entre sus valores y fines la igualdad de oportunidades y la 
construcci&#243;n de una sociedad justa, de la misma forma que establece el Art&#237;culo 21 numeral 
2) de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de Derechos Humanos. En ese contexto el respeto y sujeci&#243;n 
a la carrera judicial, dispuesta por la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica y la ley buscan precautelar y 
garantizar ambos bienes, siendo que por el contrario su desconocimiento implica un acto 
arbitrario, injusto y atentatorio al derecho de otras personas. 
</p>
<p>116. El Consejo de la Judicatura se&#241;al&#243; que la decisi&#243;n tomada es absolutamente 
compatible con las normas internacionales de protecci&#243;n de los Derechos Humanos, porque 
ha reivindicado para la sociedad boliviana, el derecho de contar con los mejores jueces, 
luego de someterse a todas las fases que conforman el Sistema de Ingreso a la carrera 
judicial. Finalmente, conforme al art&#237;culo 178 de la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica del Estado, <i>que </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>40</b>  
</p>
<p><i>dispone que se constituyen en garant&#237;a de la independencia judicial, el desempe&#241;o de los 
jueces de acuerdo a la Carrera Judicial y la autonom&#237;a presupuestaria de los &#243;rganos 
Judiciales,</i> la Ley del Consejo de la Judicatura, Ley N&#176; 1817, incorpora y regula el sistema 
de la carrera judicial, compuesto por diferentes mecanismos que debidamente cumplidos y 
ejecutados constituyen una garant&#237;a de estabilidad e inamovilidad para todo funcionario

</p>
<p><b>  Comentarios y observaciones de la Relatora Especial 
</b></p>
<p>117. La Relatora Especial agradece la vasta respuesta brindada por el Gobierno de 
Bolivia a la comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 27 de mayo de 2010 y en particular, el informe 
transmitido por el Ministerio de Justicia, el Viceministerio de Justicia y Derechos 
Fundamentales, la Direcci&#243;n General de Justicia y Derechos Fundamentales y la 
Profesional Especializada ADF.  
</p>
<p>118. Sin embargo, quisiera recordar que, a la luz de los Principios b&#225;sicos relativos a la 
independencia de la judicatura, espec&#237;ficamente los numerales 11 y 12, los jueces deber&#225;n 
tener garantizada la permanencia en su cargo por los periodos establecidos, as&#237; como su 
independencia y seguridad; igualmente, deber&#225; serles garantizada su inamovilidad, tanto a 
los nombrados mediante decisi&#243;n administrativa como a los elegidos.  
</p>
<p>119. E tal sentido, llama la atenci&#243;n de la Relatora, el hecho de que los 22 vocales de 
segunda instancia, hubieran sido nombrados como jueces desde hace m&#225;s de diez a&#241;os, y 
que no haya sido sino en fecha reciente, cuando su nombramiento hubiera sido considerado 
como irregular por parte del Estado. Sorprende que, a&#250;n cuando los 22 jueces se hubieran 
visto beneficiados en 2007 por el Amparo Constitucional que declar&#243; nula la convocatoria 
que pretend&#237;a sujetarlos a la realizaci&#243;n de un examen, y por ende, tuvieran garantizada su 
inamovilidad, el Consejo de la Magistratura haya decidido emitir en 2010, un Acuerdo 
ordenando la separaci&#243;n de su cargo. Llama la atenci&#243;n de la Relatora el hecho de que, una 
decisi&#243;n judicial tomada en &#250;ltima instancia y, reconocida por el propio Estado como 
acci&#243;n extraordinaria y subsidiaria de protecci&#243;n de derechos conforme al propio texto 
Constitucional, no haya sido tenida en cuenta, pues ello contraviene adem&#225;s el principio 
general b&#225;sico de cosa juzgada y afecta la independencia judicial.  
</p>
<p>120. Sumado a lo anterior, la Relatora considera conveniente recordar que, trat&#225;ndose de 
la suspensi&#243;n o separaci&#243;n del cargo de un juez, &#233;sta debe tener origen en la incapacidad o 
comportamiento que lo inhabilite para continuar desempe&#241;&#225;ndose como tal; la decisi&#243;n de 
separaci&#243;n tiene que ser llevada a cabo a la luz de un procedimiento cuya decisi&#243;n final 
deber&#237;a estar sujeta a revisi&#243;n independiente. En el caso, dichos supuestos parecen no haber  
tenido  lugar. Finalmente, sorprende el hecho de que tras la separaci&#243;n del cargo de los 22 
vocales, las cerraduras de sus juzgados hubieran sido cambiadas y sus ordenadores y discos 
duros revisados. 
</p>
<p>121. La Relatora Especial quisiera subrayar la importancia de que el Estado garantice la 
independencia del poder judicial, el respeto a las decisiones judiciales tomadas conforme a 
derecho, as&#237; como la estabilidad de los operarios de justicia.

<p>122. El 7 de junio de 2010, Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados y 
abogados, junto con el Grupo de Trabajo sobre la Detenci&#243;n Arbitraria, enviaron un 
llamamiento urgente se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida 
con respecto al arresto del Sr. Juan Urabo Pereira Olmos y del Sr. Alex Peter Pardo 
Paniagua. 
</p>
<p>123. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el Dr. Juan Urabo Pereira Olmos -
antiguo Presidente de la Asociaci&#243;n de Magistrados y actual vocal (y antiguo Presidente) de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>la Corte Superior de Distrito de la Provincia de Pando - y el co-juez en dicha Corte 
Superior, abogado Alex Peter Pardo Paniagua, habr&#237;an sido arrestados el 21 de mayo de 
2010 en la ciudad de Cobija en momentos en que ingresaban al Tribunal, por miembros de 
la Polic&#237;a. Horas despu&#233;s habr&#237;an sido conducidos en un vuelo de Boliviana de Aviaci&#243;n a 
la ciudad de La Paz, y habr&#237;an sido detenidos en los locales de la Fuerza Especial de Lucha 
Contra el Crimen (FELCC). 
</p>
<p>124. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la raz&#243;n de su detenci&#243;n estar&#237;a motivada en haber 
aceptado, en ejercicio de sus funciones de jurisdicci&#243;n constitucional, un amparo 
constitucional ordenando el traslado a El Porvenir, desde La Paz, del expediente del caso 
del enfrentamiento del 11 de septiembre de 2008, durante el cual se produjo la muerte de 13 
personas y un n&#250;mero indeterminado de heridos y de desaparecidos. 
</p>
<p>125. Asimismo se informa que estas detenciones - motivadas por resoluciones judiciales 
adoptadas en el marco de actividades jurisdiccionales - habr&#237;an creado una situaci&#243;n de 
grave preocupaci&#243;n en la Judicatura boliviana, ya alarmada por el anuncio de la destituci&#243;n, 
el pasado 17 de mayo, de 22 Magistrados de segunda instancia, que se habr&#237;an producido 
sin las debidas garant&#237;as judiciales y en clara contravenci&#243;n de los principios generales 
b&#225;sicos del derecho y de las garant&#237;as del debido proceso de ley. 
</p>
<p>126. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Sr. Pereira Olmos habr&#237;a sido puesto en libertad en 
la ma&#241;ana del d&#237;a 22 de Mayo, mientras que el Sr. Pardo Paniagua habr&#237;a sido formalmente 
acusado de prevaricaci&#243;n y de haber tomado decisiones ilegales. 
</p>
<p>127. Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que estas detenciones, denuncias y acusas 
por prevaricaci&#243;n en caso de fallos y resoluciones adoptadas en el marco de actividades 
jurisdiccionales, afectan la independencia del Poder Judicial en Bolivia y pueden afectar la 
independencia e imparcialidad de sus jueces. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comunicaci&#243;n recibida 
</b></p>
<p>128. En una carta fechada el 12 de agosto de 2010, el Gobierno respondi&#243; al llamamiento 
urgente con fecha de 07 de junio de 2010. 
</p>
<p>129. De acuerdo al Informe emitido por el Ministerio P&#250;blico, en fecha 21 de mayo de 
2010, la Fiscal&#237;a de Distrito de Pando procedi&#243; a la detenci&#243;n de los Sres. Juan Pereira 
Olmos, Peter Alex Pardo Paniagua y otro, en cumplimiento a la solicitud de cooperaci&#243;n 
emitida por la Fiscal de Materia asignada al Caso, posteriormente fueron trasladados a la 
ciudad de La Paz a trav&#233;s de una l&#237;nea a&#233;rea comercial, realiz&#243; el acompa&#241;amiento un 
Oficial Investigador del Ministerio P&#250;blico de Pando. En la ciudad de la Paz, los tres 
detenidos fueron entregados a las autoridades departamentales a horas 20:30 bajo acta de 
recepci&#243;n de detenidos signada el d&#237;a viernes 21 de mayo de 2010 suscrita por el Oficial 
Investigador y la Fiscal asignada al caso. 
</p>
<p>130. Es evidente que los Sres. Juan Pereira Olmos y Peter Alex Pardo Paniagua fueron 
detenidos en el departamento de Pando y puestos ante autoridad competente en la ciudad de 
la Paz, habi&#233;ndose cumplido ordenes de detenci&#243;n por no haber comparecido a una citaci&#243;n 
para prestar su declaraci&#243;n conforme a lo previsto por ley (art&#237;culo 224 del C&#243;digo de 
Procedimiento Penal), que fue recibida en dicha ciudad al haberse en ella efectuado la 
denuncia.  
</p>
<p>131. Los Sres. Alex Peter Pardo Panigua y Juan Pablo Urabo Pereira Olmos fueron 
detenidos debido a que los mismos no comparecieron a prestar su declaraci&#243;n Informativa 
por lo que en fecha 8 de enero de 2010 el Fiscal de Distrito de la Paz, en el marco de lo 
dispuesto en el art&#237;culo 136 del C&#243;digo de Procedimiento Penal, solicito cooperaci&#243;n 
directa dentro del Proceso Penal seguido por el Ministerio P&#250;blico contra los Sres. Alex 
Peter Pardo Paniagua y Juan Urabo Pereira Olmos por los supuestos delitos de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b>  
</p>
<p>Resoluciones Contrarias a la Constituci&#243;n y las leyes y Otros a la Fiscal&#237;a de Distrito de 
Pando para la detenci&#243;n de estas personas.  
</p>
<p>132. Consta en las citaciones diligenciadas que, el Sr. Alex Peter Pardo Paniagua ser&#237;a 
notificado a las 17:25 hrs. del 19 de enero de 2010 para presentar su declaraci&#243;n a las 15 
hrs. del viernes 29 de enero de 2010. Y que el Sr. Juan Urabo Pereira Olmos ser&#237;a 
notificado a las 9:15 del 20 de enero de 2010 para presentar su declaraci&#243;n a las 9:00 hrs 
del viernes 29 de enero de 2010. Las notificaciones con firma de recibido de las personas 
citadas en documento original se encuentra en el Cuaderno de Investigaciones a cargo de la 
Fiscal Asignada al caso.  
</p>
<p>133. Debido a que las personas citadas no se presentaron a prestar su declaraci&#243;n 
informativa, la Fiscal adscrita al caso dict&#243; la Resoluci&#243;n Fundamentada de Aprehensi&#243;n de 
fecha 11 de mazo de 2010, motivo por el cual se realiz&#243; la detenci&#243;n en cumplimiento a la 
Orden de Aprehensi&#243;n del ciudadano Peter Alex Pardo Paniagua de fecha 11 de mayo de 
2010 y la Orden de aprehensi&#243;n del ciudadano Juan Urabo Pereira Olmos de fecha 11 de 
mayo de 2010, ambas &#243;rdenes emitidas por la Fiscal asignada al caso de la ciudad de La 
Paz. 
</p>
<p>134. Las mismas fueron emitidas dentro de la etapa de investigaci&#243;n por el delito de 
resoluciones contrarias a la Constituci&#243;n y las Leyes y Prevaricato, caso signado con el N&#176; 
LPZ0907046, seguido por el L.G.C.M. contra los detenidos y otras 3 personas.  
</p>
<p>135. La Fiscal, emiti&#243; Resoluci&#243;n y Orden de aprehensi&#243;n en cumplimiento a lo 
establecido en el art&#237;culo 224 y 227 de la Ley N&#176; 1970 de 25 de marzo de 1999, c&#243;digo de 
Procedimiento Penal, art&#237;culo 14 de la Ley N&#176; 2175 y la l&#237;nea jurisprudencial sentada con 
las Sentencias Constitucionales Nos 284/02-R y 0327/04-R, las mismas que establecen que 
la aprehensi&#243;n es legal en caso de desobediencia a la orden de citaci&#243;n del Fiscal. 
</p>
<p>136. Esta orden, fue cumplida por la Fiscal&#237;a de Distrito y la Fuerza Especial de Lucha 
Contra el Crimen de Pando. De acuerdo al Informe de fecha 22 de julio de 2010, presentado 
por la Fiscal asignada al caso, no se tiene conocimiento de quejas instauradas en Instancias 
judiciales internas sobre la detenci&#243;n de los Sres. Alex Peter pardo Paniagua y Juan Pablo 
Urabo Pereira Olmos. 
</p>
<p>137. La Fiscal emiti&#243; Resoluci&#243;n de Imputaci&#243;n Formal contra el Sr. Alex Peter Pardo 
Paniagua por haber encontrado suficientes elementos de convicci&#243;n de su presunta 
participaci&#243;n en los delitos investigados, como se manifiesta en la Imputaci&#243;n Formal. El 
Sr. Pardo Paniagua cumple medidas sustitutivas a la detenci&#243;n preventiva. Respecto al Sr. 
Juan Urabo Pereira Olmos no existe Imputaci&#243;n Formal en su contra por lo que no existe 
interposici&#243;n de medidas restrictivas. 
</p>
<p>138. De acuerdo al informe presentado por el Ministerio P&#250;blico, se realiz&#243; la Imputaci&#243;n 
Formal del Sr. Alex Pardo Paniagua, ello debido a que existen indicios suficientes de la 
comisi&#243;n del delito de acuerdo a la investigaci&#243;n que se lleva a cabo en la Fiscal&#237;a de 
Distrito de la Paz por el delito de prevaricato y por dictar resoluciones contrarias a la 
Constituci&#243;n y las Leyes.  
</p>
<p>139. La legislaci&#243;n boliviana dispone en el C&#243;digo de Procedimiento Penal, Ley N&#176; 1970 
de 25 de marzo de 1999 que las etapas del Proceso constan de la Etapa Preparatoria , Juicio 
Oral y P&#250;blico y Recursos, sin embargo la Sentencia Constitucional N&#176; 1036/2002-R 
establece de forma mas espec&#237;fica las subetapas de la Etapa Preparatoria de la siguiente 
forma: Primera Fase, los actos iniciales de la investigaci&#243;n preliminar comienza con la 
denuncia, la querella o con la noticia fehaciente que reciben las autoridades llamadas por 
ley (Fiscal&#237;a-Polic&#237;a) sobre la comisi&#243;n de un delito; Segunda Fase, el desarrollo de la etapa 
preparatoria, comienza con la imputaci&#243;n formal, representa el inicio del Proceso Penal; y 
la Tercera Fase, que se denomina conclusi&#243;n de la etapa preparatoria y esta constituida por </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>43 
</b></p>
<p>los actos conclusivos entre los cuales se encuentra la presentaci&#243;n de la acusaci&#243;n formal 
por el Fiscal al Juez o presidente del Tribunal. 
</p>
<p>140. El proceso, actualmente se encuentra en esta etapa procesal, en la segunda fase, por 
los indicios sobre la participaci&#243;n del Sr. Peter Alex Pardo Paniagua en el hecho se emiti&#243; 
resoluci&#243;n de Imputaci&#243;n Formal de fecha 22 de mayo de 2010. Con la imputaci&#243;n formal 
empieza la etapa preparatoria, que puede durar seis meses, al cabo de los cuales debe 
concluir con una de las formas establecidas en el art&#237;culo 323 del C&#243;digo de Procedimiento 
Penal, las mismas son: 1. Acusaci&#243;n Formal, si se estima que la investigaci&#243;n proporciona 
fundamento para el enjuiciamiento p&#250;blico del acusado; 2. Suspensi&#243;n Condicional del 
Proceso, la aplicaci&#243;n de procedimiento abreviado, aplicaci&#243;n de un criterio de oportunidad 
o la promoci&#243;n de la conciliaci&#243;n; 3. Sobreseimiento, cuando resulte evidente que el hecho 
no constituye delito o cuando se estime que los elementos de prueba no son suficientes para 
fundamentar la acusaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>141. Al momento de la aprehensi&#243;n practicada en contra de los Sres. Juan Pereira Olmos 
y Peter Alex Pardo Paniagua, se respetaron sus derechos y garant&#237;as establecidos en la 
Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica del Estado y los Instrumentos Internacionales de derechos humanos. 
Conforme a lo establecido en la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica del Estado y el Pacto Internacional de 
Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos los Sres. Juan Pereira Olmos y Peter Alex Pardo Paniagua 
fueron detenidos siguiendo el procedimiento establecido en la normativa legal interna 
vigente y dentro de un proceso penal. 
</p>
<p>142. Por otra parte, de acuerdo al informe de la Fiscal&#237;a Especializada de Persecuci&#243;n de 
Delitos de Corrupci&#243;n (FEPDC) de Pando los Sres. Juan Pereira Olmos y Peter Alex Pardo 
Paniagua, durante su estancia en Pando no ingresaron a celdas policiales, no fueron 
esposados, permanecieron en el Despacho del Director Departamental de la Fuerza Especial 
de Lucha Contra el Crimen (FELCC) hasta que fueron trasladados a la ciudad de La Paz 
donde fueron entregados a las autoridades departamentales (Fiscal e Investigador asignados 
al caso) en dependencias de la  FELC. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comentarios y observaciones de la Relatora Especial  
</b></p>
<p>143. La Relatora Especial agradece la respuesta del Gobierno de Bolivia a la 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 7 de junio de 2010 y en particular, el informe transmitido por el 
Ministerio de Justicia, el Viceministerio de Justicia y Derechos Fundamentales, la 
Direcci&#243;n General de Justicia y Derechos Fundamentales y el &#193;rea de Derechos 
Fundamentales. 
</p>
<p>144. Sin embargo, la Relatora considera importante recordar que, conforme a los 
principios b&#225;sicos relativos a la independencia de la Judicatura, todas las acusaciones o 
quejas que sean formuladas contra un juez, como consecuencia de su actuaci&#243;n judicial y 
profesional, tienen que ser tramitadas con prontitud e imparcialidad con arreglo al 
procedimiento pertinente. Adem&#225;s, el examen de la cuesti&#243;n, al menos en la etapa inicial, 
deber&#237;a ser confidencial, salvo petici&#243;n expresa del juez en cuesti&#243;n, situaci&#243;n que al 
parecer, no se materializ&#243; en el presente caso, sobre todo, cuando ambas personas fueran 
detenidas en la entrada del recinto judicial en el cual se desempe&#241;aban como vocales. 
</p>
<p>145. Aunado a ello, la Relatora hace notar el hecho de que la detenci&#243;n de los dos jueces 
hubiera tenido lugar en la misma semana, justo 4 d&#237;as despu&#233;s, de la separaci&#243;n del cargo 
de otros 22 magistrados; estos episodios vividos en Bolivia, despiertan una profunda 
preocupaci&#243;n por la independencia y estabilidad de algunos miembros de la judicatura.  
</p>
<p><b>  Comunicaci&#243;n enviada 
</b></p>
<p>146. El 29 de de junio de 2010, la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de 
magistrados y abogados, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el <b>Juez Octavo de Instancia en lo Penal 
de Santa Cruz de la Sierra</b>, Sr. Luis Fernando Tapia Pachi.  
</p>
<p>147. De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Juez Tapia Pachi habr&#237;a sido objeto de 
acusaciones penales, incluyendo una orden de aprehensi&#243;n librada contra &#233;l, por haber 
aplicado los principios de juez natural y prevenci&#243;n en una causa de presunto terrorismo 
conocida como la causa del Hotel Las Am&#233;ricas. 
</p>
<p>148. El Juez Tapia Pachi se habr&#237;a limitado, en ejercicio pleno de su funci&#243;n 
jurisdiccional y en aplicaci&#243;n de los principios generales de derecho procesal penal antes 
se&#241;alados, a considerar que la causa mencionada deb&#237;a estar sujeta a la jurisdicci&#243;n de los 
tribunales de Santa Cruz de la Sierra, por ser el lugar donde ocurrieron los hechos y donde 
residen los implicados. Sin embargo, el caso habr&#237;a sido llevado a la ciudad de La Paz 
donde se habr&#237;a decidido acusar formalmente al Juez Tapia Pachi por los delitos de 
prevaricato, incumplimiento de deberes y de emisi&#243;n de resoluciones contrarias a la 
Constituci&#243;n y a las leyes. 
</p>
<p>149. Adem&#225;s, el Juez Tapia Pachi se encontrar&#237;a tambi&#233;n bajo una orden de aprehensi&#243;n 
por no haberse presentado a una audiencia de excepci&#243;n de incompetencia que &#233;l habr&#237;a 
presentado contra el Juez Noveno de Instrucci&#243;n en lo Penal de La Paz, reclamando 
jurisdicci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>150. Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que estos actos de denuncias y acusaciones 
por prevaricaci&#243;n y otros supuestos cr&#237;menes en caso de fallos y resoluciones adoptadas en 
el marco de actividades jurisdiccionales, puedan constituir ataques de tipo intimidatorio y 
menoscabar la independencia de la judicatura. Tambi&#233;n se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por el 
hecho que este tipo de actos contra jueces Bolivianos no parecen ser hechos aislados. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comunicaci&#243;n recibida 
</b></p>
<p>151. En una carta fechada el 12 de agosto de 2010, el Gobierno respondi&#243; al llamamiento 
urgente con fecha de 29 de junio de 2010. 
</p>
<p>152. Las alegaciones presentadas en el comunicado de la Relator&#237;a Especial no son 
ciertas, toda vez que la orden de aprehensi&#243;n librada en contra del Juez Tapia Pachi no se 
fundamenta en la aplicaci&#243;n de los principios de juez natural y prevenci&#243;n en la causa 
sustanciada por terrorismo, m&#225;s por el contrario, conforme la denuncia y la imputaci&#243;n 
formal presentada por el Fiscal de Materia Anticorrupci&#243;n, la orden de aprehensi&#243;n se 
origina en que: 
</p>
<p>153. En fecha 21 de mayo de 2009 el Juez Tapia Pachi emiti&#243; el Auto Interlocutorio N&#176; 
125/2009 en el cual consta la admisi&#243;n de una solicitud de acumulaci&#243;n e inhibitoria 
presentada por el se&#241;or B.G.M.J, dentro del proceso seguido por el Ministerio P&#250;blico en 
contra de presuntos autores por los delitos de terrorismo, sin que dicha persona este 
legitimada activamente por no tener la calidad de v&#237;ctima, y sindicado en el proceso 
conforme lo previsto por el art&#237;culo 308 del C&#243;digo de Procedimiento Penal vigente, 
declar&#225;ndose competente para ejercer el control jurisdiccional dentro de la investigaci&#243;n 
que sigue el Ministerio P&#250;blico por terrorismo, sustanciada ante el Juez de Instrucci&#243;n 
Cautelar en lo Penal del Distrito de La Paz. 
</p>
<p>154. La admisi&#243;n de la inhibitoria representa que un tercero que no fue mencionado, ni 
relacionado en el caso FELCC-SCZ0902862 instaurado a denuncia de S.A.C.,  tenga la 
posibilidad de intervenir en la tramitaci&#243;n del proceso, situaci&#243;n que atenta gravemente a 
las disposiciones del ordenamiento jur&#237;dico interno y espec&#237;ficamente a lo establecido por 
el C&#243;digo de Procedimiento Penal, configur&#225;ndose en un indicio de la comisi&#243;n de los 
delitos de Resoluciones contrarias a la Constituci&#243;n y a las Leyes (Art&#237;culo 153 C&#243;digo </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>Penal), Incumplimiento de Deberes, (Art&#237;culo 154), Impedir o estorbar el ejercicio de 
funciones (Art&#237;culo 161) y Prevaricato (Art&#237;culo 173). 
</p>
<p>155. La denuncia planteada en contra del Juez Tapia Pachi, adem&#225;s se&#241;ala que al 
admitirse la acumulaci&#243;n e inhibitoria, se habr&#237;a vulnerado la normas establecidas de la 
funci&#243;n judicial afectando los intereses de la colectividad, cuyo &#250;nico objetivo fue la 
paralizaci&#243;n de una investigaci&#243;n de car&#225;cter nacional en contra de presuntos actores de 
terrorismo, investigaci&#243;n originada en los hechos sucedidos en el Hotel las Am&#233;ricas el 16 
de abril de 2009, cuando se habr&#237;a desarticulado a un grupo de presuntos terroristas, 
situaci&#243;n que adem&#225;s configurar&#237;a el tipo penal de uso indebido de influencias (Art&#237;culo 
146 C&#243;digo Penal). 
</p>
<p>156. El caso del Juez Tapia Pachi fue originado a partir de una denuncia en su contra 
presentada por representantes del Ministerio de Gobierno en fecha 25 de agosto de 2009. A 
partir de dicha denuncia y debido a la orden de aprehensi&#243;n de fecha 7 de septiembre de 
2009, emitida por el Fiscal asignado al caso el Juez Tapia Pachi present&#243; ante la Corte 
Superior de Distrito un recurso de acci&#243;n de libertad, conforme lo establecido en los 
Art&#237;culos 125 y 126 de la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica del Estado, acci&#243;n que fue resuelta en fecha 
11 de septiembre de 2009, declar&#225;ndose procedente la misma y dejando sin efecto la 
citaci&#243;n emitida por el fiscal asignado al caso de esa fecha. 
</p>
<p>157. El se&#241;or Tapia Pachi no compareci&#243; debidamente ni justific&#243; impedimento leg&#237;timo 
en las audiencias de declaraci&#243;n informativa citadas, m&#225;s al contrario obstaculiz&#243; el proceso 
de investigaci&#243;n al haber presentado en dos ocasiones memoriales de recusaci&#243;n ante la 
Fiscal&#237;a de Distrito de La Paz, las mismas que fueron desestimadas mediante las 
Resoluciones N&#176; 1050/09 y N&#176; 1152/09 de fechas 2 de octubre y 26 de octubre 
respectivamente.  
</p>
<p>158. En ese sentido, tras haber sido citado el 8 de septiembre de 2009 y el 19 de octubre 
de 2009 para presentar su declaraci&#243;n informativa y debido a su inasistencia injustificada, 
el fiscal asignado al caso emiti&#243; la resoluci&#243;n de aprehensi&#243;n de fecha 7 de diciembre de 
2009 de conformidad al Art&#237;culo 224 de la ley 1970 que establece <i>&#8220;si el imputado citado no 
se presentara en el t&#233;rmino que se le fije, ni justificara un impedimento leg&#237;timo, la 
autoridad competente librar&#225; mandamiento de aprehensi&#243;n&#8221;. </i>La resoluci&#243;n de aprehensi&#243;n 
del caso, establece adem&#225;s que de acuerdo a la Sentencia Constitucional SC 1080/2004-r 
&#8220;(&#8230;) <i>el sistema procesal vigente, concretamente, el Art. 97 del CPP, exige que en la etapa 
preparatoria el denunciado presentar&#225; declaraci&#243;n ante el fiscal, previa citaci&#243;n formal, 
disposici&#243;n legal que es de inexcusable cumplimiento, en cuya virtud, el Fiscal como 
Director de la investigaci&#243;n, debe disponer la citaci&#243;n personal del imputado a objeto de 
asegurar de que este tome conocimiento de la denuncia que pesa en su contra, a fin de 
garantizar su derecho a la defensa y solo en el caso de que citado no se presentare en el 
t&#233;rmino que se le fije, ni justificar&#225; un impedimento leg&#237;timos, el Fiscal podr&#225; librar 
mandamiento de aprehensi&#243;n de acuerdo a lo dispuesto por el Art. 224 del CPP, caso 
contrario, la aprehensi&#243;n ordenada resulta ilegal&#8221;.</i> 
</p>
<p>159. Asimismo en fecha 20 de julio del presente a&#241;o, el Concejo de la Magistratura 
suspendi&#243; al Juez de sus funciones, argumentando abandono de funciones, en aplicaci&#243;n del 
Art&#237;culo 44 del Reglamento del Sistema de Carrera Judicial. A la fecha, el se&#241;or Tapia 
Pachi se encuentra pr&#243;fugo de la justicia. 
</p>
<p>160. La imputaci&#243;n formal presentada en contra del se&#241;or Tapia Pachi, se baso en el 
C&#243;digo Penal vigente que establece en el art&#237;culo 173 el delito de prevaricato se&#241;alando: 
<i>(&#8230;) El Juez que en el ejercicio de sus funciones dictare resoluciones manifiestamente 
contrarias a la ley ser&#225; sancionado con reclusi&#243;n de dos a&#241;os a cuatro a&#241;os. Si como 
resultado del prevaricato en proceso penal se condenare a una persona inocente, se le </i></p>

preventiva, la pena ser&#225; de reclusi&#243;n de tres a ocho a&#241;os. </i> 
</p>

<p><b>  Comentarios y observaciones de la Relatora Especial  
</b></p>
<p>163. La Relatora Especial agradece la respuesta del Gobierno de Bolivia a la 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 29 de junio de 2010 y en particular, el informe transmitido por el 
Ministerio de Justicia, el Viceministerio de Justicia y Derechos Fundamentales, la 
Direcci&#243;n General de Justicia y Derechos Fundamentales y el &#193;rea de Derechos 
Fundamentales. 
</p>
<p>164. Sin embargo, en el presente caso, la Relatora Especial lamenta que haya sido una 
decisi&#243;n judicial interlocutoria que solo admit&#237;a la solicitud de un tr&#225;mite a proceso, lo que 
generara la denuncia y posterior orden de aprehensi&#243;n en contra del Sr. Tapia Pachi. Por 
una parte, dicha resoluci&#243;n interlocutoria, habr&#237;a sido tomada en ejercicio de sus funciones 
como operador judicial, por tanto, la misma podr&#237;a haber sido objetada v&#237;a jurisdiccional 
por los interesados en el procedimiento principal, adem&#225;s que, al tratarse de una 
interlocutoria ni se decid&#237;a la suerte del juicio principal, ni se trataba de algo que no fuera 
susceptible de recurrirse en una instancia superior. Por ello, sorprende que la decisi&#243;n de 
Tapia no solo no fuera objetada, sino que, directamente fuera considerada materia de una 
denuncia penal por parte del poder ejecutivo, a trav&#233;s de la denuncia formulada por la 
representaci&#243;n legal del Ministerio de Gobierno.  
</p>
<p>165. Adem&#225;s, sorprende a la Relatora que a&#250;n cuando la orden de aprehensi&#243;n de 7 de 
septiembre de 2009 en contra de Tapia Pachi, hubiera quedado sin efectos en virtud del 
recurso de acci&#243;n de libertad declarado en su favor. Tapia Pachi, nuevamente fuera citado 
el 8 de septiembre y 19 de octubre de 2009 para rendir declaraci&#243;n informativa, y que, dada 
su inasistencia, el 7 de diciembre de 2009 se hubiera vuelto a emitir una orden de 
aprehensi&#243;n en su contra. Preocupa que, finalmente el 12 de mayo de 2010, se insistiera en 
se&#241;alar como motivo de imputaci&#243;n penal en contra de Tapia Pachi, la resoluci&#243;n de 
admisi&#243;n de una petici&#243;n en un proceso judicial; y que finalmente, el 20 de julio de 2010, el 
Consejo de la Magistratura decidiera suspender a Tapia Pachi, aduciendo el abandono de 
sus funciones. 
</p>
<p>166. La Relatora reitera que la independencia y seguridad de los jueces debe ser 
garantizada por el Estado, en tal sentido, considera de suma importancia subrayar el </p>

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>167. On 14 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation on human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding the situation of Mr. <b>Leang Sokchouen</b>, Mr. 
<b>Tach Vannak</b>, Mr. <b>Tach Le</b> and Mr. <b>Tach Khong Phoung</b>. Mr. Leang Sokchouen is a 
staff member of the local human rights NGO LICADHO working to protect human rights 
in Cambodia and to promote respect for civil and political rights by the Cambodian 
Government and institutions.  
</p>
<p>168. According to the information received, on 30 August 2010, Mr. Leang Sokchouen, 
Mr. Tach Vannak and Mr. Tach Le were sentenced to two years in prison and a two million 
riels fine (approximately US$ 500). Another defendant, Mr. Tach Khong Phoung, was tried 
<i>in absentia </i>and sentenced to three years imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>169. Mr. Leang Sokchouen and others were reportedly accused of distributing anti-
Government fliers in Takeo Province on 4 January 2010. Mr. Sokchouen was a longtime 
acquaintance of co-defendant Mr. Tach Khong Phoung but, according to reports received, 
he has consistently testified that he had no knowledge of the flier incident.  
</p>
<p>170. It has come to the attention of the Special Rapporteurs that the trial on 30 August 
was marked by a number of deficiencies that would indicate that the defendants did not 
enjoy a fair trial. According to the information received, Mr. Sokchouen was arrested 
without prior notice early on a Saturday morning and was held incommunicado for more 
than 33 hours. During this time, he was reportedly detained inside the Ministry of Interior&#8217;s 
National Police Headquarters without access to a lawyer; a violation of Article 98 of the 
Cambodian Code of Criminal Procedure.  
</p>
<p>171. It has been alleged that the official investigation report did not confirm that the 
police arrested the correct man since investigators identified the suspect in the alleged 
phone calls as &#8220;Mr. L. Sokly,&#8221; a Vietnamese national living in Phnom Penh&#8217;s Russei Keo 
district. Mr. Sokchouen is a Khmer national living in the Sen Sok district. 
</p>
<p>172. Furthermore, one of the defendants, Mr. Tach Vannak, who had initially claimed 
during his detention at the Ministry of Interior&#8217;s National Police that Leang Sokchouen had 
been involved in distributing the fliers, allegedly retracted part of his earlier statement 
during the hearing stating that he only implicated Mr. Sokchouen because of false promises 
made by police interrogators.  He claimed police promised him that he would be allowed to 
go back to his family in exchange for his cooperation. However, the judge reportedly 
ignored the retraction. The defendant also claimed that there was police misconduct, yet the 
judge allegedly ignored what was said in his courtroom and instead relied on police 
paperwork. 
</p>
<p>173. According to the information received, the evidence provided by the police against 
Mr. Sokchouen consisted of a list of phone numbers claiming Mr. Sokchouen and Mr. Tach 
Khong Phoung had called each other. Furthermore, the judge reportedly relied entirely on 
written statements and four alleged witness statements from police officers, all of which </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>48</b>  
</p>
<p>were produced by the prosecutor. It has been reported that none of these individuals were 
called to court by the investigating judge or cross-examined by the defence. 
</p>
<p>174. During the trial, the judge reportedly stated that in-court testimonies by the three 
accused &#8220;could not be trusted&#8221; and based his decision entirely upon the police report and 
interrogation.  Article 118 of the Cambodian Code of Criminal Procedure states that police 
reports can be used for &#8220;information only,&#8221; but that they may also be considered as 
evidence if they are not &#8220;proven false.&#8221; According to the information received, despite 
strong evidence that the police report was false, the judge did reportedly not evaluate its 
veracity. 
</p>
<p>175. According to reports received, the Court did not examine whether the distribution of 
the leaflets constituted a crime in the first place. During the hearing, there was allegedly 
only marginal examination of whether the leaflets and their dissemination constituted the 
crime of &#8220;disinformation&#8221; under article 62 of the UNTAC penal provisions which defines it 
as the &#8220;publication or dissemination of false information in bad faith with malicious intent, 
which has disturbed or is likely to disturb public peace&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>176. In his justification, the Prosecutor reportedly stated that the leaflets constituted 
criticism to Cambodia&#8217;s leadership and that they could have caused social unrest. In the 
announcement of the verdict, the trial judge did not provide any further elaboration on this 
argument. According to the information received, Mr. Leang Sokchouen has lodged an 
appeal to the verdict. 
</p>
<p>177. Concern was expressed about the situation of Mr. Leang Sokchouen, Mr. Tach 
Vannak, Mr. Tach Le and Mr. Tach Khong Phoung and the allegations that the conviction 
of Mr. Leang Sokchouen and the three other defendants may constitute a violation of the 
right to freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. In addition, concern was 
expressed that the prosecution of Mr. Leang Sokchouen, a human rights defender, on the 
basis of alleged questionable evidence may have an adverse impact on the working climate 
for human rights defenders in the country.

<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>179. The Special Rapporteur regrets the present report was finalized, the Government has 
not reponded to the communication dated 14 September 2010. She considers response to 
her communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with her 
mandate, and calls upon the Government of Cambodia to provide details about the issues 
raised in the aforementioned communication at the earliest possible date.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>180. On 27 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Tang Jitian</b> 
and <b>Mr. Lui Wei </b>who were facing the possibility of revocation of their lawyer&#8217;s license. 
Mr. Jitian was the subject of a previous joint urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers on 10 June 2009, and of a joint allegation letter sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteut on the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 7 November 2008. 
</p>
<p>181. According to information received, on 12 April 2010, Mr. Tang Jitian and Mr. Lui 
Wei received a notification from the Beijing Municipal Judicial Bureau that a complaint 
concerning their conduct had been submitted by the Luzhou City People&#8217;s Intermediate 
Court in Sichuan Province. The two lawyers were later charged with &#8220;disrupting courtroom 
order and interfering with the regular litigation process&#8221; and are facing the possibility of 
revocation of their lawyer&#8217;s license.  
</p>
<p>182. The charge emanated from a case in which the two lawyers were retained as counsel 
to represent a Falun Gong practitioner in April 2009. Their client had been charged with the 
offence of &#8220;using an evil cult to destroy implementation of the law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>183. At the hearing convened on 22 April 2010, the Beijing Municipal Judicial Bureau 
presented evidence that the lawyers disrupted court procedure during the trial in April 2009, 
by disobeying the presiding judge&#8217;s instructions prohibiting them from presenting a 
description of Falun Gong that contravened the official designation of it being an &quot;evil 
cult&quot;, and defended its legitimacy. The Special Rapporteurs were informed that no decision 
had been taken with regard to the hearing.  
</p>
<p>184. The Special Rapporteurs were also informed that there was increased interference 
with regard to lawyer&#8217;s discharge of their professional functions through harassment. 
Lawyers who represent clients in cases relating to religious and ethnic minorities and 
human rights defenders were said to be threatened with closure of their legal practices and 
revocation of their licenses.   
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>185. In a letter dated 5 July 2010, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 27 April 2010 but at the time the present report was finalized the reply of the 
Government had not been translated. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>186. On 26 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter with the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment concerning <b>Mr. Guo 
Xiaojun</b>, a Falun Gong practitioner from Shanghai.  
</p>
<p>187. Mr. Guo Xiaojun is a 40-year-old resident in Room 504, N&#176; 1 Lane 880 Cangyuan 
road, Minhang District, Shanghai. He started practicing Falun Gong in 1997. Guo Xiaojun 
worked formerly as a lecturer in the Computer Science Department of Shanghai Jiaotong 
University, however, he was dismissed in 2001 after his arrest and conviction for having 
distributed literature about Falun Gong. On 16 December 2004, Guo Xiaojun was released 
from a labour camp. 
</p>
<p>188. On 7 January 2010, Guo Xiaojun was re-arrested by the police of the Domestic 
Security Division, Baoshan District Public Security Bureau. Several policemen searched his 
home and confiscated his laptop computer, mobile phone, books and other personal 
belongings. Guo Xiaojun has since been detained in the Shanghai Baoshan District 
Detention Center. 
</p>
<p>189. On 18 January 2010, the director of the Domestic Security Division, Mr. Qiu Feng, 
and another policeman whose family name is Peng took Guo Xiaojun into a special 
interrogation room in the Baoshan District Detention Center and interrogated him from 
2:15 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Subsequently, Guo Xiaojun was taken into another special 
interrogation room in the Detention Center and was interrogated non-stop by a team of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>policemen lead by Qiu Feng from 5:45 p.m. on 18 January 2010 to 2:30 p.m. the following 
day without being allowed to sleep. The police allegedly forced him to confess through 
sleep deprivation and by refusing to provide him with food. When Guo Xiaojun tried to 
support his head with his hands, Qiu Feng violently pushed away his hands. Furthermore, 
the police reportedly threatened to arrest his wife Xu Wenxin, who is also a Falun Gong 
practitioner, and to send their young child back to his hometown if Guo Xiaojun did not 
confess. 
</p>
<p>190. In February 2010, his defense attorney, Mr. Liang Xiaojun, terminated the contract 
with Guo Xiaojun under the threats of the Beijing Judicial Bureau. One official of the 
Beijing Judicial Bureau had reportedly warned Liang Xiaojun that he could no longer 
practice as a lawyer if he continued to represent Guo Xiaojun. 
</p>
<p>191. On 6 July 2010, the Shanghai Baoshan District Court tried Guo Xiaojun and 
sentenced him to four years&#8217; imprisonment. The basis of the conviction was Guo Xiaojun&#8217;s 
confession obtained through threats and ill-treatment. Guo Xiaojun declared he would 
retract his confession and said that this confession was obtained through threats and torture, 
however, his speech was cut short by the judge. Guo Xiajun has appealed against the court 
verdict. His wife also filed complaints with the police, the court and prosecutors, however, 
the authorities have reportedly not responded to those complaints.

<p>193. On 9 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with The Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the 
situation of <b>Mr. Dhondup Wangchen</b>, also known as Dunzhu Wangqing and Dangzhi 
Xiangqian, co-director of the documentary film &#8220;Leaving Fear Behind&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>194. According to the information received, from October 2007 to March 2008, Mr. 
Dhondup Wangchen interviewed about a hundred Tibetans living in the Tibetan 
Autonomous region, and made a film based on these interviews, without official 
authorization from the authorities. The documentary was later smuggled abroad where it 
was edited and shared with foreign journalists during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.  
</p>
<p>195. On 26 March 2008, Mr. Dhondup Wangchen was arrested in Tongde county, near 
Xining, in connection to riots which broke out in Lhasa and Tibetan-populated regions of 
China. He was first detained at the Ershilibu detention center in Xining, then transferred to 
a Government-run guesthouse nearby, possibly for interrogation, and finally taken to the 
No. 1 Detention Center in Xining. On 12 July 2008, while held in the guesthouse, he briefly 
ran away and told an acquaintance that one of his hands became numb due to severe torture. 
In addition, it was reported that he had been suffering from hepatitis B, and was denied 
access to adequate medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>196. In July 2009, Mr. Li Dunyong, the lawyer chosen by Mr. Dhondup Wangchen was 
reportedly arbitrarily replaced by the judicial authorities in Xining with a Government-
appointed lawyer, without providing any justification. Mr. Li Dunyong was allowed to meet 
his client only once, in July 2009, who informed him that he had been severely tortured 
while in detention to extract a confession, and that he would plead not guilty during his 
trial. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>51 
</b></p>
<p>197. On 28 December 2009, the provincial court in Xining sentenced Mr. Dhondup 
Wangchen to six years imprisonment. The trial was reportedly held in secret. The Chinese 
authorities reportedly did not inform Mr. Dhondup Wangchen&#8217;s relatives about the trial, nor 
about the verdict. 
</p>
<p>198. According to information received, despite his fragile health condition, Mr. 
Dhondup Wangchen was forced to work 17 to 18 hours per day, sometimes during night 
shifts. He was also denied access to books sent to him in order to educate himself. 
</p>
<p>199. Mr. Jigme Gyatso, monk, co-director of the documentary was arrested during the 
same period, and was released on bail on 15 October 2008. He was reportedly tortured 
while in detention. 
</p>
<p>200. Serious concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Dhondup 
Wangchen and Mr. Jigme Gyatso, and the alleged acts of torture suffered in detention, are 
related to their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, while exercising their right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. Grave concerns were expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Dhondup Wangchen who remains detained. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received

<p>201. In a letter dated 21 December 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 9 November 2010, but at the time this report was finalized, the 
reply of the Government had not been translated.

<p>202. On 3 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; and Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment concerning the <b>pattern of 
arrests, detentions, enforced disappearances and intimidations of human rights 
defenders and lawyers</b> across the country. 
</p>
<p>203. According to the information received, on 20 February 2011, calls for protests 
inspired by the so-called &#8220;Jasmine Revolution&#8221; were made through the Internet in at least 
eighteen cities across the country. In this context, a large number of human rights activists 
and lawyers have allegedly been interrogated, arrested, detained, subjected to intimidation 
by the authorities, many of whom have also forcibly disappeared over the last few days. In 
a number of cases, some lawyers and activists have allegedly been placed under 
surveillance and/or house arrest, and some of their personal belongings, in particular 
computers, have been confiscated after their homes had been searched. 
</p>
<p>204. The following cases have in particular been brought to the attention of the Special 
Rapporteurs. The summary below is divided into two parts. While the first part addresses 
individual cases according to the specific city where the alleged violations have taken 
place, the second part addresses in particular the cases of three lawyers named <b>Mr. Jiang 
Tianyong, Mr. Tang Titian</b> and <b>Mr. Teng Biao</b>, for whom there are also allegations of 
interference in the discharge of their professional duties.  </p>

<p>205. On 25 February 2011, <b>Mr. Qian Jin</b> has allegedly been taken by National Security 
Police in Bangbu City and escorted to his home on the following day, where his computer 
was reportedly confiscated. It is alleged that he was then taken again by the police. A 
source indicated on 28 February 2011, that Mr. Qian Jin has been detained in Nanjing 
City&#8217;s Huaiyuan Psychiatric Hospital. 
</p>
<p>206. Moreover, the Special Rapporteurs have received information indicating that other 
activists based in the same province may have been harassed and questioned by the 
authorities. On 26 February 2011, police officers allegedly interrogated husband and wife<b> 
Mr. Zhang Lin</b> and <b>Ms. Fang Cao</b>. Reportedly, Mr. Zhang Lin was held in custody 
overnight and police officers searched the couple&#8217;s home, confiscating three computers.

unknown. 
</p>
<p>209. On the morning of 25 February 2011, human rights activist <b>Mr. Li Hai</b> was 
allegedly taken from his home outside Beijing by local police. It is further alleged that he 
returned home late in the evening, but was warned not to leave his home, go online, or 
attempt to contact anyone. On the following day, he reportedly sent a message to friends 
alerting them that he was being guarded by three men, and that if he turned his cell phone 
off it meant that there was trouble. Shortly after 3:00 p.m. on the same day, Mr. Li Hai&#8217;s 
cell phone was allegedly switched off. While information suggests that he may have been 
taken away by the police, his current fate and whereabouts are unknown.  
</p>
<p>210. It is further alleged that since 25 February 2011, Beijing police have been rounding 
up petitioners to prevent disturbances during the &#8220;Two Meetings&#8221; of the National People&#8217;s 
Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative 
Conference. On that day, about a dozen petitioners, including Jiangsu petitioner <b>Ms. Hao 
Xiuxia</b>, were reportedly taken to Jiujingzhuang prison. On the morning of 27 February 
2011, about 200 individuals, including Hubei petitioner <b>Mr. Zheng Daijing</b>, have allegedly 
been arrested and taken by police officers to Jiujingzhuang prison.

<p><i>  II.  
</i></p>
<p>235. On 16 February 2011, the three lawyers <b>Mr. Tang Jitian</b>, <b>Mr. Teng Biao</b> and<b> Mr. 
Jiang Tianyong</b> reportedly attended a meeting from 12:00 a.m. to about 2:30 p.m. to 
discuss the continued house arrest of the prominent blind legal activist Mr. Chen 
Guangcheng, which several of their lawyer friends had allegedly been unable to attend due 
to police posted outside their residences, preventing them from leaving their home. 
Following the meeting, the three lawyers were allegedly targeted by the authorities. Each of 
the cases is summarised below. 
</p>
<p>236. a) Mr. Tang Jitian has been a lawyer in Beijing since 2007, and was registered in 
Yanji Jilin province. He has reportedly provided legal representation to Falungong 
practitioners, people affected by HIV/Aids and Hepatitis B, and was actively involved in 
2008 in efforts to promote direct elections to the Beijing Bar Association and lawyers&#8217; 
rights. In April 2010, it is reported that he was disbarred for his work allegedly in relation 
to a case involving a Falungong practitioner. 
</p>
<p>237. On 16 February 2011, at about 6:48 p.m., Mr. Tang Jitian was allegedly taken by the 
police from his home in Beijing to Changwai police station in Xuanwu district, located in 
the same city, in car number 6077. The police reportedly searched his house and 
confiscated some of his belongings. 
</p>
<p>238. On 19 February 2011, Mr. Tang Jitian&#8217;s ex wife reportedly came to Beijing from her 
hometown to request information from the police about him without success and was 
escorted by the police back to Jilin province. It is further alleged that members of Mr. Tang 
Jitian&#8217;s family have been intimidated by the police and were reluctant to make a formal 
complaint about his detention. 
</p>
<p>239. The detention of Mr. Tang Jitian was widely covered by some websites such as 
<i>Twitter</i> and the Chinese microblog <i>Weibo</i> and by overseas human rights organisations. To </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>56</b>  
</p>
<p>date, his fate and whereabouts are unknown, as the police refuse to inform his family on the 
place where he is being detained. 
</p>
<p>240. b) Mr. Teng Biao, a prominent human rights defender and lecturer at the Chinese 
University of Politics and Law in Beijing, was not permitted to renew his lawyer&#8217;s license 
allegedly in reaction to his offer to defend Tibetans subject to criminal prosecution 
following the March 2008 protests in Tibet. Since then, he has provided legal assistance to 
a number of people facing the death penalty. Recently, he has reportedly set up the non-
profit organization China against the Death Penalty. We are also informed that Mr. Teng 
Biao regularly reports on alleged human rights violations in China, inter alia on <i>Twitter</i> and 
gives interviews to foreign correspondents in China on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>241. On 19 February 2011, the police reportedly visited him at his home and returned 
later to take him away. It is further alleged that the police took two computers, a copier-fax 
machine, printed materials, between 10 to 20 books on politics, between 20 to 30 
documentaries and dozens of photos of Chen Guangcheng from Mr. Teng Biao&#8217;s home, 
searched his office and questioned his staff. Reportedly, Mr. Teng Biao was kept in the 
Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau and his family has allegedly received no official 
notification of his detention. It is unclear where he is currently being detained. 
</p>
<p>242. c) Mr. Jiang Tianyong, currently a Beijing resident, was registered as a lawyer in 
Zhengzhou in Henan province. He reportedly used to defend a large number of cases of 
petitioners and in the defence of lawyers&#8217; rights and people living with HIV/Aids.  
</p>
<p>243. In July 2009, it is alleged that Mr. Jiang Tianyong was not allowed to renew his 
license to practice as a lawyer and thereby has been prevented from taking cases. Since 
then, he has reportedly worked as a legal advisor to the Aids NGO <i>Aizhixing</i>. 
</p>
<p>244. On 16 February 2011, Mr. Jiang Tianyong attended the meeting mentioned above to 
discuss the Chen Guangcheng case. Thereafter, at 3:50 p.m., Mr. Jiang Tianyong returned 
home where he reportedly received a phone call from Yang Fangdian police station of 
Haidian district requesting him to meet for questioning. It is alleged that Mr. Jiang 
Tianyong went to meet the police and at about 5:00 p.m., some friends received an SMS 
from him informing them that he had been beaten, the details of which he later reported on 
<i>Twitter</i>. He said that the police had pushed him several times and that the back of his head 
once hit the wall, causing him to feel dizzy. After some lawyers went to the police station to 
have him liberated, he was released from custody. 
</p>
<p>245. On 19 February 2011, between 3:00-4:00 p.m., Mr. Jiang Tianyong was reportedly 
taken away by the police in Changping District in front of his brother&#8217;s home, where he was 
staying with his wife. In their attempt to stop the police, his brother and his mother were 
allegedly beaten. Between midnight and 1:00 a.m., the police reportedly arrived at Mr. 
Jiang Tianyong brother&#8217;s home the same place again and asked to have Mr. Jiang 
Tianyong&#8217;s computer. Despite Mr. Jiang Tianyong&#8217;s wife opposition, the police allegedly 
took away the computer which was on the desk. Reportedly, local police informed his 
family that they had no record on him and that they would file him as a missing person. 
</p>
<p>246. Concerns have been raised that the human rights defenders and lawyers mentioned 
above may have been targeted in relation to their legitimate work in the defence of human 
rights and to prevent demonstrations in support of calls for massive pro-democracy protests 
across the country on 21 February 2011. Further concern is expressed about the physical 
and mental integrity of the persons named above whose fate and whereabouts remain 
unknown.

<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>148. On 19 May 2009, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of expression and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding two lawyers, <b>Mr. 
Zhang Kai</b> and<b> Mr. Li Chunfu</b>. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>149. Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu were hired by the family of Jiang Xiqing, a Falun Gong 
practitioner who died in the Chongqing Xishanping Reeducation Center on 28 January 
2009. Authorities stated that he died of a heart attack, but the family, suspicious of the 
cause of death, decided to hire a lawyer for legal support. A first lawyer was hired from 
Chongqing, but he declined to be retained by the family after having formally inquired with 
the police. Zhang Kai, from a Beijing Yijia Law Firm, and Li Chunfu, from the Beijing 
Globe Law Firm, were hired afterwards. On 13 May 2009, they met with their clients at 
their home in the Jiangjin District, Chongqing, to discuss the case. At around 4 p.m., four 
policemen went to the home claiming that they were delivering materials from the public 
security bureau&#8217;s judicial administrative office. They then started to interrogate the two 
lawyers and their clients. Subsequently, about 20 more individuals from the state security 
unit of the Jiangjin District Public Security Bureau and the Jijiang Police Substation also 
came to the house. When the police asked the two lawyers to show their identity cards, Li 
Chunfu presented his lawyer&#8217;s license and Zhang Kai his passport, which were, however, 
not accepted by the police. Subsequently, the police officers began pulling their hair, 
twisting their arms and beating them while pinning them on the ground. Afterwards, the 
two lawyers were handcuffed and taken to the police station. 
</p>
<p>150. At the police station, Zhang Kai was hung up with handcuffs in an iron cage and Li 
Chunfu was slapped in the face by a police officer. During their interrogation they were 
both threatened not to defend any Falun Gong cases. They were released at 12:40 a.m., on 
14 May 2009. Their hands were covered with bruises and scars; Zhang Kai&#8217;s hands were 
also numb and swollen and Li Chunfu had troubled hearing in one ear. They are currently 
being examined at the Jiangjin District People&#8217;s Hospital. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>248. In a letter dated 9 June 2009, the Government responded to the communication 
dated 19 May 2009 as follows. 
</p>
<p><i>(Translated from Chinese) 
</i></p>
<p>249. Receipt is hereby acknowledged of communication No. G/SO 214 (107-109) G/SO 
214 (3-3-16) G/SO 214 (53-24) CHN 12/2009 from the United Nations Human Rights 
Council&#8217;s Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Chinese Government 
has looked carefully into the matter referred to in the communication and wishes to make 
the following reply. 
</p>
<p>250. Zhang Kai is a lawyer with the Beijing Globe Yijia Law Firm. Li Chunfu is a lawyer 
with the Beijing Globe Law Firm. In May 2009, Zhang Kai and Li Chunfu set out for 
Chongqing. When the local public security office, acting in accordance with the law, sought 
to check their identities, they refused to produce valid identification documents and were 
extremely uncooperative. The public security office, in accordance with the law, brought 
them to the station for investigation. As soon as they had produced valid identification 
documents, the public security office let them leave. There was absolutely no beating or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>58</b>  
</p>
<p>illegal detention. The acts referred to in the letter do not correspond to what actually 
happened. 
</p>
<p>251. The Chinese Government respectfully requests that the foregoing be reproduced in 
the relevant United Nations documents. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>252. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response to the 
communication dated 19 May 2009. She would appreciate receiving substantive 
information regarding any investigations and inquiries carried out in respect of the 
allegations of ill-treatment of Mr. Zhang Kai and Mr. Li Chunfu, as requested in the 
communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  Concluding comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>253. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the replies sent by the Government to the 
communications dated 27 April 2010 and 9 November 2010. The summaries of the replies 
will be included in the next report, as they had not been translated at the time of finalizing 
the present report. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that no official reply was 
received to the communications dated 26 August 2010 and 3 March 2011. She considers 
response to her communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments 
with her mandate.  
</p>
<p>254. The Special Rapporteur remains in particular concerned about the reported pattern of 
arrests, detentions, enforced disappearances and intimidation of human rights lawyers and 
activists across the country. Like any other individuals, their right to life, liberty and 
security shall be guaranteed as enshrined in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. Nor shall they be subjected to arbitrary arrest in accordance with article 9 of the 
aforementioned Declaration and to ill-treatment in accordance with the Convention against 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to which China is a 
State party. In many cases, the reported allegations are believed to be linked whether to 
their work in the defense of human rights. 
</p>
<p>255. She urges the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China to transmit, at the 
earliest possible date, a comprehensive response to the outstanding communications and 
issues raised therein. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the need to 
guarantee the right of lawyers to freely represent their clients and perform their professional 
activity without fear, intimidation and interference. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to stress once again the importance for Governments to respect and take into 
account the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted in Havana, Cuba, by the 
Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders, from 27 August to 7 September 1990, aimed at assisting Member States to 
protect and ensure the proper role of lawyers, in particular principles 16 to 20.

<p>256. El 13 de septiembre de 2010, la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de 
magistrados y abogados junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores 
de los derechos humanos y el Relator Especial sobre las ejecuciones extrajudiciales, 
sumarias o arbitrarias enviaron un llamamiento urgente se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del 
Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la <b>situaci&#243;n del ex juez penal militar</b> 
capit&#225;n <b>Alexander Cort&#233;s</b>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>257. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida el primero de marzo de 2007, despu&#233;s de un proceso 
de selecci&#243;n por concurso de m&#233;ritos, el capit&#225;n Cort&#233;s asumi&#243; el cargo de juez 94 de 
instrucci&#243;n penal militar adscrito a la D&#233;cima S&#233;ptima Brigada con sede en Carepa, 
departamento de Antioquia. Durante su labor como juez militar, el se&#241;or Cort&#233;s habr&#237;a 
encontrado una gran cantidad de casos de muertes presentadas en combate, respecto de las 
cuales habr&#237;a existido abrumadora evidencia de que se trataba de ejecuciones 
extrajudiciales. Teniendo en cuenta que en el ordenamiento jur&#237;dico colombiano la 
investigaci&#243;n de este tipo de hechos, por tratarse de graves violaciones a los derechos 
humanos, est&#225; excluido de la competencia de la justicia penal militar y deben ser 
investigados por la justicia ordinaria, el juez Cort&#233;s habr&#237;a remitido 54 casos de ejecuciones 
extrajudiciales a la Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>258. Como consecuencia de un traslado ordenado en junio de 2009, el se&#241;or Cort&#233;s se  
habr&#237;a posesionado como juez quinto de instrucci&#243;n penal militar con sede en Chiquinquir&#225;, 
departamento de Boyac&#225;. A finales de 2009, la esposa del capit&#225;n Cortes, Mar&#237;a Elvira 
Espinosa Triana, habr&#237;a recibido una llamada de un teniente de la S&#233;ptima Divisi&#243;n con 
sede en Medell&#237;n en la que le habr&#237;an advertida que se cuidara, ya que se hab&#237;a realizado 
una reuni&#243;n con altos mandos militares en los que se habr&#237;an mencionado hechos graves en 
contra de su esposo. Adicionalmente, la se&#241;ora Espinosa, habr&#237;a sido despedida de su cargo 
como abogada de la Defensor&#237;a militar, tambi&#233;n a finales de 2009. Este organismo est&#225; 
encargado de proveer la defensa t&#233;cnica a los militares procesados por la justicia. El 
director de dicho organismo, le habr&#237;a manifestado que su contrato se terminaba, como 
consecuencia de las decisiones judiciales adoptadas por su esposo durante el 2009. 
Adicionalmente, le habr&#237;a advertido que, por esta misma raz&#243;n, su esposo se hab&#237;a ganado 
como enemigo al General Zapata, quien fue Comandante de la D&#233;cimo S&#233;ptima Brigada, 
donde el capit&#225;n Cort&#233;s se desempe&#241;aba como juez de instrucci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>259. Tambi&#233;n a finales de 2009, el Ej&#233;rcito Nacional habr&#237;a realizado un estudio de 
seguridad minucioso al capit&#225;n Cort&#233;s y a su c&#237;rculo familiar, el cual comprendi&#243; a su 
esposa y sus padres. En el desarrollo de este estudio se habr&#237;an recogido las direcciones y 
tel&#233;fonos de sus familiares. A la fecha no se conocer&#237;a el resultado de este estudio de 
seguridad.  
</p>
<p>260. El 12 de enero de 2010 el juez Cort&#233;s habr&#237;a sido desvinculado de su cargo aunque 
no habr&#237;a existido ning&#250;n proceso disciplinario en su contra, ni ning&#250;n llamado de atenci&#243;n 
en el que se dejara constancia de alguna conducta reprochable en el desempe&#241;o de sus 
funciones.  
</p>
<p>261. El 17 de julio de 2010 la revista Semana, la cual tiene amplia circulaci&#243;n nacional, 
habr&#237;a publicado el art&#237;culo &#8220;Los casos olvidados de los falsos positivos&#8221; y la entrevista con 
el capit&#225;n Alexander Cort&#233;s &#8220;Capit&#225;n nunca juzgara a Coronel&#8221;.  En el primero de estos 
art&#237;culos, como consecuencia de la informaci&#243;n que entreg&#243; el capit&#225;n Cort&#233;s, se habr&#237;an 
revelado detalles de diferentes casos de ejecuciones extrajudiciales ocurridos en la zona del 
Uraba antioque&#241;o que hab&#237;an sido presentados por miembros del Ej&#233;rcito nacional como 
muertos en combate. El art&#237;culo tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a revelado, con fundamento en grabaciones 
de audio, como el capit&#225;n Duv&#225;n Hern&#225;ndez despu&#233;s de una conversaci&#243;n con su superior 
habr&#237;a decidido presentar como una muerte en combate una ejecuci&#243;n extrajudicial. Para tal 
fin, el capit&#225;n se habr&#237;a comunicado con un paramilitar quien le consigui&#243; un arma que se 
habr&#237;a colocado al lado del cuerpo de la v&#237;ctima. La publicaci&#243;n de estos art&#237;culos habr&#237;a 
generado inter&#233;s en los principales medios nacionales radiales, los cuales habr&#237;an 
entrevistado dos d&#237;as despu&#233;s de la publicaci&#243;n de la revista al capit&#225;n Cort&#233;s.

<p>262. Como consecuencia de la protecci&#243;n solicitada a las autoridades estatales, ante el 
fundado temor de represalias por las denuncias realizadas, y por su actuaci&#243;n como 
funcionario judicial, el capit&#225;n Cort&#233;s habr&#237;a recibido un esquema de protecci&#243;n. Dicho 
esquema que consiste en la asignaci&#243;n de un veh&#237;culo y de un patrullero, ser&#237;a insuficiente. </p>

</p>
<p>En primer lugar, el veh&#237;culo no ser&#237;a blindado. En segundo lugar, el esquema no tendr&#237;a un 
tripulante por lo que el escolta asignado deber&#237;a hacer las veces de conductor, lo cual 
dificultar&#237;a la reacci&#243;n ante la eventualidad de un atentado.  
</p>
<p>263. Las deficiencias en el esquema de protecci&#243;n se habr&#237;an evidenciado el pasado 
s&#225;bado 21 de agosto de 2010 cuando desconocidos habr&#237;an ingresado, al parecer en horas 
de la tarde, al apartamento donde reside el capit&#225;n Cort&#233;s con su esposa. Afortunadamente, 
ellos no se encontraban all&#237;. Las personas que habr&#237;an ingresado al apartamento lo habr&#237;an 
hecho a trav&#233;s del patio del edificio, para lo cual habr&#237;an desoldado uno de los barrotes que 
protege este sector. Si bien no habr&#237;a sido hurtado ning&#250;n bien, este ataque contra la 
inviolabilidad del domicilio de la familia Cort&#233;s constituir&#237;a una nueva intimidaci&#243;n por la 
labor desempe&#241;ada por Alexander Cort&#233;s como juez penal militar y por sus denuncias sobre 
algunas de las ejecuciones extrajudiciales ocurridas en el Urab&#225; antioque&#241;o. Como 
consecuencia de estos hechos, se habr&#237;a ordenado a dos polic&#237;as de la estaci&#243;n del barrio 
San Fernando proteger el edificio donde reside la familia Cort&#233;s. Sin embargo, el domingo 
22 de agosto en horas de la ma&#241;ana dicha protecci&#243;n habr&#237;a sido levantada.  
</p>
<p>264. Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n que las recientes intimidaciones y amenazas de las que ha 
sido v&#237;ctima el Sr. Cort&#233;s se produjeron como consecuencia de su labor desempe&#241;ada como 
juez penal militar en la regi&#243;n de Urab&#225; antioque&#241;o, as&#237; como de sus recientes denuncias 
acerca de las ejecuciones extrajudiciales en dicha zona del pa&#237;s.

magistrados y abogados, conjuntamente con la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos y el Relator Especial sobre las ejecuciones 
extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias, enviaron un llamamiento urgente se&#241;alando a la 
atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la <b>situaci&#243;n de la 
fiscal &#193;ngela Mar&#237;a Buitrago</b>. 
</p>
<p>267. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la Dra. Buitrago fue nombrada a principios de 2005 
como fiscal encargada del caso del Palacio de Justicia y habr&#237;a iniciado una investigaci&#243;n 
sobre los presuntos cr&#237;menes por parte de miembros de las fuerzas armadas. Como 
consecuencia de su investigaci&#243;n, varios miembros de alto rango de las fuerzas armadas 
estar&#237;an siendo investigados o juzgados. En este contexto, hace algunos meses se habr&#237;a 
emitido la primera condena penal en el caso contra el Coronel retirado Alfonso Plazas 
Vega. 
</p>
<p>268. El 2 de septiembre 2010, el Fiscal General encargado, Guillermo Mendoza Diago, 
habr&#237;a pedido a todo el equipo de 11 fiscales que prestan servicios ante la Corte Suprema 
que presentaran sus dimisiones. Sin embargo, el Fiscal General encargado solo habr&#237;a 
aceptado dos de ellas, incluyendo la dimisi&#243;n de la Dra. Buitrago. La designaci&#243;n y 
separaci&#243;n de los fiscales forma parte del poder discrecional del Fiscal General. La 
destituci&#243;n de la Dra. Buitrago habr&#237;a tenido lugar unos d&#237;as despu&#233;s que &#233;sta hubiera 
llamado a indagatoria a tres generales colombianos en retiro por la ejecuci&#243;n extrajudicial 
del Magistrado Carlos Horacio Ur&#225;n. 
</p>
<p>269. El Fiscal General encargado habr&#237;a justificado esta decisi&#243;n aduciendo el escaso 
rendimiento de la Dra. Buitrago y su negligencia en el desempe&#241;o de unos casos asignados 
debido a la concentraci&#243;n de sus esfuerzos en el caso del Palacio de Justicia. En 
consecuencia, un procedimiento disciplinar habr&#237;a sido iniciado contra la Dra. Buitrago. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la Dra. Buitrago habr&#237;a estado presente en la Corte 285 
d&#237;as en 2009 y en 2010 para seguir todos los casos bajo su competencia. Ahora sus casos 
habr&#237;an sido repartidos entre 5 personas.  
</p>
<p>270. Seg&#250;n informes recibidos, la Dra. Buitrago habr&#237;a sido objeto de amenazas, 
intimidaciones e interferencias en su trabajo vinculadas con su actividad de investigaci&#243;n. 
La asignaci&#243;n del caso del Palacio de Justicia a otros fiscales podr&#237;a implicar importantes 
retrasos en este proceso lo cual podr&#237;a tener consecuencias procesales negativas de cara a 
asegurar que los responsables de estos delitos respondan ante la justicia.  
</p>
<p>271. La destituci&#243;n de la Dra. Buitrago tendr&#237;a consecuencias que ir&#237;an m&#225;s all&#225; del caso 
del Palacio de Justicia ya que la Dra. Buitrago habr&#237;a sido la fiscal encargada en varias 
investigaciones y procesos judiciales de alto perfil sobre violaciones de derechos humanos, 
tales como el juicio del ex Director del Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad, Jorge 
Noguera; o el proceso contra ex oficiales de alto rango de la previa administraci&#243;n como el 
Vicepresidente Francisco Santos y el asesor del Presidente Jos&#233; Obdulio Gaviria. Estos 
casos, al igual que el caso del Palacio de Justicia, se encontrar&#237;an en estado avanzado de 
instrucci&#243;n y la abrupta destituci&#243;n de la fiscal podr&#237;a representar un importante retroceso. 
Adem&#225;s, como consecuencia de la destituci&#243;n de la Dra. Buitrago, los fiscales de los 
respectivos casos podr&#237;an mostrarse reacios a proceder contra algunos de los inculpados.

habr&#237;an dado cuenta que un grupo de tres personas desconocidas les estaba siguiendo. 
Dicho grupo les habr&#237;a amenazado e intimidado, refiri&#233;ndose a su trabajo como defensores

habr&#237;a sido acusado formalmente por &#8220;homicidio agravado&#8221;. La acusaci&#243;n est&#225; relacionada 
con una investigaci&#243;n iniciada en 2008 y llevada a cabo por parte del Cuerpo T&#233;cnico de 
Investigaci&#243;n de Colombia, una unidad bajo la Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n por los delitos 
de &#8220;concierto para delinquir&#8221; y &#8220;homicidio agravado&#8221;. Durante el periodo de investigaci&#243;n, 
la acusaci&#243;n de &#8220;concierto para delinquir&#8221; habr&#237;a sido retirada. 
</p>
<p>281. El 14 de septiembre de 2010, a las 15:00 horas, el Cuerpo T&#233;cnico de Investigaci&#243;n 
de Colombia, habr&#237;a emitido una orden de captura contra el Sr. David Ravelo Crespo el 
cual habr&#237;a sido detenido ese mismo d&#237;a. Seg&#250;n se informa, el Sr. Ravelo Crespo estar&#237;a 
detenido desde esa fecha en la prisi&#243;n de la Picota en Bogot&#225;. 
</p>
<p>282. Las acusaciones habr&#237;an estado basadas en las declaraciones de cuatro paramilitares 
desmovilizados seg&#250;n las cuales el Sr. Ravelo Crespo habr&#237;a  mantenido nexos con la 
guerrilla Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) y habr&#237;a sido uno de los 
autores del asesinato del entonces Secretario de Obras P&#250;blicas de Barrancabermeja. 
</p>
<p>283. Desde el a&#241;o 2008, cuando la Fiscal&#237;a abri&#243; la investigaci&#243;n contra el Sr. Ravelo 
Crespo, &#233;ste habr&#237;a sido objeto de amenazas contra el y su familia, as&#237; como objeto de 
vigilancia por parte de desconocidos y, en dos ocasiones, objetivo de presuntos atentados 
contra su vida.  
</p>
<p>284. Anteriormente, entre 1993 y 1995, el Sr. Ravelo Crespo fue encarcelado bajo el 
cargo de rebeli&#243;n  pero se le absolvi&#243; de todos los cargos en primera y segunda instancia. 
De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, la decisi&#243;n de retirar el cargo de &#8220;concierto para 
delinquir&#8221; habr&#237;a estado relacionada co la absoluci&#243;n del cargo de rebeli&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>285. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, la criminalizaci&#243;n del Sr. Ravelo Crespo se

informe, ninguna de las comunicaciones enviadas haya sido respondida. Por ello, desea 
invitar al gobierno de Colombia, a proporcionar informaci&#243;n relevante a la mayor brevedad

</p>
<p>288. La Relatora desea expresar su preocupaci&#243;n por los hechos que, quienes han sido 
administradores de justicia &#8211;jueces y fiscales&#8212; y varios abogados, le han manifestado. 
Situaciones como la falta de procedimiento para determinar la separaci&#243;n del cargo de un 
juez o de un fiscal, as&#237; como las amenazas e intimidaciones ejercidas como represalia  por 
las determinaciones adoptadas en el desempe&#241;o de sus funciones, sobre todo cuando se 
trata de casos graves y sensibles, como son los relativos a situaciones emblem&#225;ticas de 
graves violaciones de derechos humanos. Preocupa tambi&#233;n a la Relatora, las noticias 
recibidas sobre las amenazas e intimidaciones, f&#237;sicas y verbales, perpetradas en contra de 
los abogados de derechos humanos; la denunciada aquiescencia estatal e incluso, la 
reportada negaci&#243;n o insuficiencia de apoyo cuando as&#237; ha sido solicitado, tras la puesta  en 
conocimiento estatal, del peligro que corre la vida e integridad f&#237;sica de esos abogados. 
Finalmente, para la Relatora es conveniente manifestar el incremento de su preocupaci&#243;n 
respecto al silencio del Gobierno, por cuanto a aqu&#233;llos casos que conciernen a abogados 
que ya han sido objeto de llamamientos urgentes en a&#241;os anteriores, casos que inclusive han 
sido objeto de conocimiento de la instancia regional de derechos humanos desde hace a&#241;os, 
y que al parecer podr&#237;an ser muestra, de una situaci&#243;n de criminalizaci&#243;n hacia los 
abogados que se dedican a la defensa de los derechos humanos.

Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the 
<b>worsening of the situation of human rights defenders and journalists in Egypt, in 
relation to the demonstrations which have been taking place across the country since 
25 January 2011</b>. 
</p>
<p>302. According to the information received, on 1 February 2011, Mr. Malak Adly, a 
lawyer from the Hisham Mubarak Law Center (HMLC) which has been providing legal 
assistance to protestors arrested in demonstrations, was arrested by security forces and his 
whereabouts remain unknown as of today.  
</p>
<p>303. On 3 February, the offices of the HMLC and the Egyptian Center for Economic and 
Social Rights, which have been supporting an impromptu medical center in a mosque near 
Tahrir Square to treat those injured in the protests, were raided by military police, 
accompanied by unidentified men in civilian clothes. They searched both offices, and 
confiscated the equipment and the mobile phones of several staff. More than 30 persons 
working for both centers, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, were reportedly 
arrested, beaten, and taken to an undisclosed location. 
</p>
<p>304. Those arrested include: 1) <b>Mr. Ahmed Seif El Islam</b>, former Director of HMLC; 
2) <b>Mr. Mohsen Beshir</b>, HMLC lawyer; 3) <b>Mr. Mostafa Al Hassan</b>, HMLC lawyer; 4) 
<b>Ms. Mouna Al Masry</b>, HMLC researcher; 5) <b>Mr. Al Sayed Feky</b>, HMLC lawyer; 6) <b>Mr. 
Mohamed El Taher</b>, HMLC staff member; 7) <b>Ms. Fatma Abed</b>, Front to Defend Egypt 
Protestors (FDEP) volunteer; 8) <b>Ms. Shahdan Abou Shad</b>, FDEP volunteer; 9) <b>Ms. 
Nadine Abu Shadi</b>, FDEP volunteer; 10) <b>Ms. Nadia Hashem</b>, FDEP volunteer; 11) <b>Mr. 
Ahmed Hamdy Mahmoud</b>, student from Assiut University; 12) <b>Mr. Said Haddadi</b>, 
Amnesty International; 13) Another Amnesty International staff member whose identity is 
known to the mandate-holders; 14) <b>Mr. Daniel Williams</b>, Human Rights Watch; 15) <b>Ms. 
Sofia Amara</b>, French citizen working for Magneto Press; and 16) <b>Mr. Pedro da Foneska</b>, 
Portugese Citizen working for Magneto Press. 
</p>
<p>305. In connection to these arrests, it is further reported that the offices of the HMLC 
were surrounded by supporters of the current Government, threatening with weapons the 
people inside the Center&#8217;s premises. After the aforementioned persons were arrested, thugs 
reportedly destroyed the premises of HMLC, including document and case files which will 
impact on the lives of victims defended by the Center. 
</p>
<p>306. On the same day, in the evening, <b>Mr. Amr Salah</b>, researcher at the Cairo Institute 
for Human Rights Studies, was arrested along with activists <b>Ms. Shadi Al Ghazali Harb</b>, 
<b>Mr. Nasser Abdel Hamid, Mr. Mohamed Arafat, Mr. Ahmed Douma, Mr. Amr Ezz, 
</b>and<b> Mr. Ahmed (surname unknown)</b> in El Haram area, Giza, Cairo. They are reportedly 
being detained in El-Haram police station. 
</p>

Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, which provides legal assistance to victims of torture, 
and threatened the personnel of the organisation. </p>

</p>
<p>308. Furthermore, security forces and unidentified men in civilian clothes have continued 
to harass national and international journalists covering the protests, searching their hotel 
rooms, and confiscating their equipment. <b>Mr. Rajesh Bhardwaj</b>, a journalist for CNN-
IBN, was reportedly arrested by security forces, before been released some hours later.

<p>309. At the time this report was finalized, no response to this communication had been 
received.  
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>310. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official reply to the 
communications sent and calls upon the Government of Egypt to provide at the earliest 
possible date a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations. 
</p>
<p>311. With regard to the communication dated 12 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government to indicate the reasons why Mr. Mes&#8217;ed Al Shaf&#8217;i, has not been 
brought before a court to determine the legality of his detention. In respect of the 
communication dated 4 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
provide information on the fate and whereabouts of the persons named above whose fate 
and whereabouts were unknown. She further urges the Government to provide detailed 
information on any investigations conducted in relation to these cases.

</b></p>
<p>312. El 1 de octubre de 2010, la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados 
y abogados y el Relator Especial sobre las ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o 
arbitrarias, enviaron conjuntamente, una carta de alegaci&#243;n se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente 
del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n relacionada con la <b>ejecuci&#243;n,</b> a las 15:30 horas del s&#225;bado 21 
de agosto de 2010, de los <b>ciudadanos ecuatoguineanos</b> <b>Jos&#233; Abeso Nsue</b>, <b>Manuel Ndong 
Aseme </b>y <b>Alipio Ndong Asumu</b>, ex oficiales de las Fuerzas Armadas, y <b>Jacinto Micha 
Obiang</b>, ex funcionario de Aduanas. 
</p>
<p>313. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, las ejecuciones por fusilamiento se habr&#237;an 
producido media hora despu&#233;s de leerse la sentencia condenatoria. El mismo tribunal que 
les juzg&#243; tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a condenado a 15 a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n a los ciudadanos Marcelino 
Nguema Esono y Santiago Asumu, militantes de Uni&#243;n Popular. Todos ellos habr&#237;an sido 
acusados de participar en el ataque al palacio presidencial de Malabo, ocurrido el 17 de 
febrero de 2009. Los cuatro fusilados habr&#237;an sido secuestrados en Nigeria, tra&#237;dos 
clandestinamente a Guinea Ecuatorial el pasado mes de enero y encerrados en las celdas de 
la c&#225;rcel principal de Malabo (Black Beach), donde tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an sufrido malos tratos. 
</p>
<p>314. Las ejecuciones habr&#237;an sido ordenadas por un tribunal militar en violaci&#243;n de la 
Ley Fundamental de Guinea Ecuatorial y de otras normas vigentes en materia penal. De 
hecho, seg&#250;n el art&#237;culo 11 de la reformada Ley Org&#225;nica del Poder Judicial, la 
competencia de la jurisdicci&#243;n militar estar&#237;a limitada al &#225;mbito estrictamente castrense 
respecto de los hechos tipificados como delitos o faltas por el C&#243;digo de Justicia Militar. 
Tambi&#233;n establecer&#237;a que cuando en la comisi&#243;n de los hechos aparecieran implicados 
personal castrense y civil, el conocimiento de la correspondiente causa competer&#225; a la 
jurisdicci&#243;n ordinaria. Sin embargo, a pesar del hecho que tres de los cuatro ciudadanos 
ejecutados hab&#237;an sido apartados de las Fuerzas Armadas hac&#237;a m&#225;s de 20 a&#241;os - y que </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>67 
</b></p>
<p>tanto el cuarto de ellos como los dos militantes de Uni&#243;n Popular arriba mencionados, eran 
civiles &#8211; la causa no ha sido determinada por un tribunal ordinario como hubiera 
correspondido. 
</p>
<p>315. Adem&#225;s, si bien el art&#237;culo 37, c) de la misma Ley Org&#225;nica del Poder Judicial, 
establecer&#237;a que las sentencias penales de la jurisdicci&#243;n militar podr&#225;n ser recurridas en 
casaci&#243;n ante la Corte Suprema de Justicia, no se hubiera dado posibilidad alguna a los 
condenados para que pudieran recurrir, sino que habr&#237;an sido fusilados treinta minutos 
despu&#233;s de la condena. 
</p>
<p>316. Tambi&#233;n se habr&#237;a violado el art&#237;culo 13, g) de la Ley Fundamental de Guinea 
Ecuatorial, que prev&#233; que nadie podr&#225; ser juzgado ni condenado dos veces por los mismos 
delitos, dado que Marcelino Nguema Esono y Santiago Asumu, que habr&#237;an sido juzgados y 
absueltos en el mes de marzo de este a&#241;o por los mismos hechos, habr&#237;an sido ahora 
nuevamente juzgados y condenados a 15 a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n por los mismos hechos. 
</p>
<p>317. Finalmente, se llamo la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno sobre el hecho de respetar de manera 
escrupulosa los derechos de toda persona, en condiciones de plena igualdad, a ser o&#237;da 
p&#250;blicamente y con justicia por un tribunal independiente e imparcial; sobre todo en casos 
en que puede resultar aplicada la pena capital. 
</p>

esta comunicaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observaciones de la Relatora Especial 
</b></p>
<p>319. La Relatora Especial lamenta que hasta la fecha, no se haya recibido respuesta 
alguna por parte del gobierno; la situaci&#243;n descrita es, a todas luces alarmante. La Relatora 
apreciar&#237;a una respuesta a esta comunicaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>320. Preocupa que de ser ciertos todos los hechos expuestos, conforme a los art&#237;culos 2.3, 
6, 9, 14 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, as&#237; como la Opini&#243;n 
General No. 32 del Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos, habr&#237;a tenido lugar en perjuicio de las 
seis personas se&#241;aladas, una concatenaci&#243;n de violaciones a los derechos humanos. Ello en 
virtud de que cuatro de ellos habr&#237;an sido privados de su libertad clandestinamente; todos 
ser&#237;an civiles al momento de ser juzgados por un Tribunal Militar; cuatro de ellos 
condenados a la pena capital con la inmediata denegaci&#243;n <i>de facto</i> para impugnar tal 
decisi&#243;n, puesto que la sentencia se habr&#237;a ejecutado media hora despu&#233;s de ser recibida; y 
dos de los seis referidas, habr&#237;an sido juzgadas dos veces por los mismos hechos, 
condenados en el segundo juicio ante la instancia militar, a una pena privativa de libertad 
de 15 a&#241;os, contraviniendo  el principio general de <i>non bis in idem,</i> universalmente 
reconocido.

informaci&#243;n recibida respecto al <b>proceso de elecci&#243;n de magistrados de la Corte de 
Constitucionalidad para el per&#237;odo 2011-2016</b>. que en esas fechas se llevara a cabo en 
Guatemala. Igualmente, se agradeci&#243; al gobierno las acciones anteriores llevadas a cabo por 
este mandato en los procesos de elecci&#243;n de magistrados de la Corte Suprema de Justicia y </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>68</b>  
</p>
<p>de la Corte de Apelaciones, que incluyeron, entre otras, un llamamiento urgente fechado el 
2 de octubre de 2009 y un comunicado de prensa emitido el 5 de octubre de 2009. 
</p>
<p>322. El art&#237;culo 269 de la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica de la Rep&#250;blica dispone que la Corte de 
Constitucionalidad estar&#225; integrada por cinco magistrados titulares, cada uno de los cuales 
tendr&#225; su respectivo suplente. Los magistrados durar&#225;n en sus funciones cinco a&#241;os y ser&#225;n 
designados en la siguiente forma: un magistrado por el pleno de la Corte Suprema de 
Justicia; un magistrado por el pleno del Congreso de la Rep&#250;blica; un magistrado por el 
Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica en Consejo de Ministros; un magistrado por el Consejo Superior 
Universitario de la Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala; y un magistrado por la 
Asamblea del Colegio de Abogados. 
</p>
<p>323. A pesar de que la Constituci&#243;n no establece un procedimiento para la elecci&#243;n de los 
magistrados por cada uno de los &#243;rganos antes se&#241;alados. La Ley de Amparo, Exhibici&#243;n 
Personal y de Constitucionalidad establece al respecto los par&#225;metros generales, a saber:  
</p>
<p> (a) La designaci&#243;n de magistrados titulares y suplentes por parte del pleno de la 
Corte Suprema de Justicia y por parte del pleno del Congreso de la Rep&#250;blica se realizar&#225; 
mediante convocatoria expresa, por mayor&#237;a absoluta de votos y de conformidad con los 
procedimientos que determinen sus leyes internas (art&#237;culo 154); 
</p>
<p> (b) La designaci&#243;n de magistrados titulares y suplentes por parte del Consejo 
Superior Universitario y por parte de la Asamblea General del Colegio de Abogados se har&#225; 
por mayor&#237;a absoluta de votos de los miembros presentes en el acto electoral en votaci&#243;n 
secreta. En este acto no se podr&#225;n ejercitar representaciones. La convocatoria para el acto 
electoral en ambos casos deber&#225; hacerse con una anticipaci&#243;n no menor de quince d&#237;as y 
deber&#225; publicarse en el Diario Oficial y en dos diarios de mayor circulaci&#243;n (art&#237;culo 155); 
</p>
<p> (c) No es impugnable el procedimiento interno para la designaci&#243;n de los 
magistrados por el pleno de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, por el pleno del Congreso de la 
Rep&#250;blica y por el Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica en Consejo de Ministros (art&#237;culo 156); y 
</p>
<p> (d) La designaci&#243;n de magistrados por el Consejo Superior Universitario de la 
Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala y por la Asamblea del Colegio de Abogados de 
Guatemala podr&#225;n ser impugnadas conforme a la ley; pero mientras se resuelvan las 
impugnaciones continuar&#225;n actuando los magistrados titulares y suplentes que deben ser 
sustituidos (art&#237;culo 156). 
</p>
<p>Finalmente, seg&#250;n el art&#237;culo 270 de la Constituci&#243;n y 151 de la Ley de Amparo, 
Exhibici&#243;n Personal y de Constitucionalidad, los requisitos para ser magistrado de la Corte 
de Constitucionalidad son: ser guatemalteco de origen; ser abogado colegiado; ser de 
reconocida honorabilidad; y tener por lo menos quince a&#241;os de graduaci&#243;n profesional.  
Adem&#225;s de estos requisitos, la Ley de Amparo, Exhibici&#243;n Personal y de 
Constitucionalidad agrega que los magistrados de la Corte de Constitucionalidad &#8220;deber&#225;n 
ser escogidos preferentemente entre personas con experiencia en la funci&#243;n y 
administraci&#243;n p&#250;blica, magistraturas, ejercicio profesional y docencia universitaria, seg&#250;n 
sea el &#243;rgano del Estado  que lo designe&#8221; (art&#237;culo 152). 
</p>
<p>324. De conformidad con la informaci&#243;n recibida, cada una de las instituciones que 
intervienen en la elecci&#243;n de magistrados a la Corte de Constitucionalidad establecieron 
diferentes criterios para desarrollar sus respectivos procedimientos, tal como se describe a 
continuaci&#243;n: 
</p>

Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica, expresar&#237;a a trav&#233;s de los medios de comunicaci&#243;n que no har&#237;a 
una convocatoria p&#250;blica para la designaci&#243;n del magistrado titular y del suplente que le 
corresponde elegir. Frente a esta manifestaci&#243;n del Presidente, diversas organizaciones de

</p>
<p> (d) <b>Consejo Superior de la Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala

</p>
<p>325. De conformidad con la informaci&#243;n disponible, todas las instituciones que 
intervienen en el proceso de elecci&#243;n convocaron p&#250;blicamente a las y los aspirantes a 
dicho cargo (Corte Suprema de Justicia; Congreso de la Rep&#250;blica; Consejo Superior

realizara con base en criterios transparentes y objetivos que aseguren la elecci&#243;n de 
magistrados independientes, probos y competentes. Se record&#243; al gobierno los est&#225;ndares 
internacionales que reafirman los principios se&#241;alados, relativos a la independencia de la 
judicatura y el informe de la misi&#243;n realizada por este mandato a Guatemala en 2009, con

</p>
<p>328. De acuerdo al Informe del Estado de Guatemala, la elecci&#243;n de Magistrados o 
Magistradas de la Corte de Constitucionalidad constituye uno de los procesos de mayor 
importancia y responsabilidad para la aplicaci&#243;n e interpretaci&#243;n de la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica 
de la Rep&#250;blica como norma fundamental rectora del desarrollo, la paz y la convivencia

PROCESO DE DESIGNACI&#211;N, que aunque no est&#225; previsto un procedimiento legal para 
que la Corte Suprema de Justicia designe un magistrado Titular y un Suplente al tribunal de 
referencia, en un Estado de Derecho cualquier decisi&#243;n p&#250;blica debe ser motivada,

se regir&#225; conforme a los siguientes principios: Transparencia; publicidad; nominaci&#243;n por 
capacidad, m&#233;ritos, idoneidad y &#233;tica; auditor&#237;a social; voto nominal de los magistrados; 
excelencia profesional; objetividad; independencia.

<p><b>  Comunicaciones recibidas 
</b></p>
<p>334. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n fechada el 6 de septiembre de 2010, el gobierno de 
Guatemala envi&#243; un informe actualizado relacionado al caso del Se&#241;or Am&#237;lcar Pop Ac, 
quien fuera objeto de un llamamiento urgente enviado el 19 de agosto de 2008, por el 
entonces Relator Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados y abogados, junto con la 
Relatora Especial para la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos y el Relator 
sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas. 
Es de mencionarse que el Estado habr&#237;a enviado en fecha 20 de marzo de 2009, sendas 
comunicaciones en respuesta al llamamiento mencionado. 
</p>
<p>335. El llamamiento de referencia, en su parte conducente se&#241;alaba que: El 2 de agosto de 
2008, el Sr. Amilcar Pop fue perseguido y amenazado con un arma de fuego, por los 
pasajeros de una pick-up blanca doble cabina con vidrios polarizados y sin placas, quienes 
llevaban m&#225;scaras que hac&#237;an imposible su identificaci&#243;n. Los individuos lo habr&#237;an 
amenazado de muerte. El Sr. Amilcar Pop, habr&#237;a logrado escapar, resultando lesionado, 
motivo por el cual se dirigi&#243; a un hospital. Una vez en el hospital, descubri&#243; que la pick-up 
se encontraba estacionada detr&#225;s de su coche. Sin embargo, cuando sali&#243;, ya no estaba all&#237;. 
Conforme a la informaci&#243;n recibida, a lo largo de los a&#241;os 2007 y 2008, los integrantes de 
la Asociaci&#243;n de Abogados y Notarios Mayas de Guatemala (AANMG) habr&#237;an recibido 
varias amenazas de muerte &#8211;por tel&#233;fono y correo&#8212; para que dejaran de proporcionar 
asistencia legal a las comunidades de San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez. Igualmente, se habr&#237;a 
informado que la AANMG hab&#237;a sido objeto de varias denuncias ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico 
por parte del Consejo Municipal por intimidaci&#243;n, amenazas y coacci&#243;n. Se aleg&#243; que 
dichas denuncias no est&#225;n sustentadas en ninguna evidencia. Asimismo, se inform&#243; que la 
AANMG habr&#237;a sido falsamente acusada de ser responsable del asesinato del Sr. Francisco 
Tepeu Piri, un habitante del Municipio de San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez, quien muri&#243; despu&#233;s de 
una protesta contra Cementos Progresos SA, la cual tuvo lugar el 21 de junio de 2008. Por 
todo lo anterior se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por las amenazas y acusaciones en contra del Sr. 
Amilcar Pop y de otros miembros de la AANMG, las cuales podr&#237;an estar directamente 
relacionadas con sus actividades de leg&#237;tima defensa de los derechos de las comunidades 
ind&#237;genas de San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez.  
</p>
<p>336. De la comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 6 de septiembre de 2010 por el gobierno de 
Guatemala, sobre el Informe Actualizado del Estado relacionado al caso del Sr. Pop, es de 
destacarse que, el 1 de junio de 2010 el Se&#241;or Amilcar de Jes&#250;s Pop Ac, habr&#237;a sido objeto 
de robo cuando se encontraba en un restaurante de comida r&#225;pida de la zona 9 de la ciudad 
capital, donde sustrajeron de su veh&#237;culo documentos personales y una laptop. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>73 
</b></p>
<p>337. Bajo el rubro acciones del Estado, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que, el mismo d&#237;a &#8211;1 de junio 
2010&#8212; el Sr. Pop interpondr&#237;a la denuncia respectiva ante la Fiscal&#237;a Distrital 
Metropolitana, Agencia Fiscal N&#176; 1 de la Unidad de Delitos Patrimoniales y Comunes del 
Ministerio P&#250;blico, bajo el n&#250;mero de Expediente MP001/2010/57953. El 17 de junio de 
2010, el Sr. Pop ser&#237;a citado con la el objeto de ratificar su denuncia, sin embargo, no se 
habr&#237;a presentado. Se citar&#237;a a los agentes de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil que se apersonaron 
al lugar de los hechos, quienes se presentaron el 29 de junio de 2010. 
</p>
<p>338. Adem&#225;s, el estado se&#241;al&#243; que ha pedido informes a:  
</p>
<p> 1) La Entidad Metropolitana Reguladora del Transporte y Tr&#225;nsito del 
Municipio de Guatemala, con el objeto de determinar si existen c&#225;maras de seguridad en el 
lugar donde se produjo el hecho;  
</p>
<p> 2) La Unidad Fiscal de Delitos contra Operadores de Justicia, con el objeto de 
Informar si en la referida fiscal&#237;a est&#225;n realizando las diligencias correspondientes para dar 
con los presuntos responsables de robo en contra del senior Pop. Al respecto, se informar&#237;a 
en forma verbal que el Senior Pop solicit&#243; que se nombraran investigadores para que 
iniciaran las investigaciones respectivas en el presente caso; 
</p>
<p> 3) Al n&#250;mero 110 de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil, para pedir copia de la denuncia 
telef&#243;nica presentada por el senior Am&#237;lcar Pop Ac; 
</p>
<p> 4) A la direcci&#243;n de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal &#8211;DICRI&#8212; del Ministerio P&#250;blico, 
para que nombre investigadores que inicien las investigaciones respectivas en el presente 
caso; 
</p>
<p>339. Se inform&#243; tambi&#233;n que, el Ministerio P&#250;blico habr&#237;a solicitado autorizaci&#243;n judicial 
para requerir al restaurante de comida r&#225;pida que informe si cuenta con circuito cerrado e 
indique qu&#233; empresa de seguridad presta el servicio y si existen medidas de seguridad y de 
protecci&#243;n para los clientes. Finalmente, la comisi&#243;n presidencial coordinadora de la 
pol&#237;tica del Ejecutivo en materia de Derechos Humanos, se comprometi&#243; a comunicar a los 
Relatores el avance de las investigaciones. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observaciones de la Relatora Especial 
</b></p>
<p>340. La Relatora especial agradece la respuesta del Gobierno de Guatemala a la 
comunicaci&#243;n referente al proceso de selecci&#243;n de los magistrados de la Corte de 
Constitucionalidad. Sin embargo, apreciar&#237;a recibir m&#225;s informaci&#243;n sobre todos los actores 
implicados en dicho proceso, en virtud de que la respuesta, &#250;nicamente hizo referencia a 
una de las convocatorias que a tal efecto fueron publicadas. Por ello, resulta necesario 
formular algunas consideraciones. 
</p>
<p>341. Llama la atenci&#243;n de la Relatora el hecho de que este sea el segundo comunicado 
concerniente a los procesos seguidos en Guatemala para elegir a sus magistrados. Recuerda 
que, en el periodo de actividades pasado, envi&#243; al gobierno un llamamiento urgente relativo 
a la falta de aplicaci&#243;n de los principios de transparencia, objetividad e idoneidad que deben 
imperar en este tipo de procesos. Llamamiento que, desafortunadamente, no encontr&#243; 
respuesta alguna, a&#250;n cuando era relativo a los operadores de justicia de la Corte Suprema 
de Justicia y la Corte de Apelaciones. Ahora, una vez m&#225;s, es llamado a la atenci&#243;n de la 
Relatora, situaciones que representan irregularidades en un proceso de elecci&#243;n de 
magistrados, ahora de la Corte de Constitucionalidad.  
</p>
<p>342. Fue puesto en conocimiento de la Relatora, la fundamentaci&#243;n constitucional y 
legislaci&#243;n que resulta aplicable a la elecci&#243;n de los 5 magistrados que han de conformar la 
Corte de Constitucionalidad. A la luz de la misma, fueron se&#241;aladas las 5 instituciones que 
tienen a su cargo la designaci&#243;n de cada uno de los magistrados &#8211;titular y respectivo 
suplente&#8212;. Ahora bien, si bien es cierto que se toma nota de la publicidad, que cuatro </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>74</b>  
</p>
<p>instituciones dieron, a las convocatorias y los plazos para la designaci&#243;n de los 
magistrados; pues ello es prueba de los esfuerzos por garantizar el principio de 
transparencia en la elecci&#243;n. No menos cierto es, que la Relatora lamenta que las cuatro 
convocatorias publicadas adolecieran, al menos de alguno de los siguientes aspectos: 
claridad respecto a los criterios de gradaci&#243;n para la evaluaci&#243;n de los aspirantes, ausencia 
de publicaci&#243;n del perfil requerido y, omisi&#243;n sobre el procedimiento para la presentaci&#243;n 
de objeciones a las designaciones. La Relatora considera que la ausencia de cualquiera de 
los anteriores aspectos, atropellan los criterios de objetividad e idoneidad que deben existir 
en los procesos de selecci&#243;n de magistrados. 
</p>
<p>343. Adem&#225;s, la Relatora manifiesta su profunda preocupaci&#243;n frente a la declaraci&#243;n 
presidencial, a trav&#233;s de los medios de comunicaci&#243;n, sobre la determinaci&#243;n de no publicar 
convocatoria alguna para efectuar la designaci&#243;n del magistrado; sobre todo teniendo en 
cuenta, que dicha designaci&#243;n por ning&#250;n motivo puede ser objeto de impugnaci&#243;n. La 
Relatora considera que este hecho, constituye un riesgo para la Independencia de la 
Judicatura, que contraviene la propia finalidad del Tribunal en cuesti&#243;n, pues conforme al 
propio texto constitucional, &#233;ste es concebido como un tribunal colegiado con 
independencia de los dem&#225;s organismos del Estado. Para la Relatora, esta situaci&#243;n puede 
resultar contraria a los principios 1 y 2 del Conjunto de Principios b&#225;sicos relativos a la 
independencia de la Judicatura, ya que podr&#237;a favorecer intromisiones, restricciones o 
influencias en el ejercicio de la funci&#243;n jurisdiccional.  
</p>
<p>344. La Relatora Especial considera conveniente recordar al estado de Guatemala, las 
recomendaciones formuladas por su antecesor tras su visita al pa&#237;s, as&#237; como invitar al 
Gobierno a tomar las acciones necesarias para garantizar la transparencia, objetividad, 
idoneidad en los procesos de elecci&#243;n de magistrados de los Altos Tribunales y asegurar la 
independencia de la funci&#243;n jurisdiccional. 
</p>
<p>345. Con la finalidad de subsanar las deficiencias del sistema de justicia en el pa&#237;s, invita 
la Relatora al gobierno de Guatemala, a dotar de claridad los procesos de elecci&#243;n de los 
juristas que ocupar&#225;n los cargos m&#225;s altos de las instancias judiciales. 
</p>
<p><b>  Honduras 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comunicaciones enviadas 
</b></p>
<p>346. El 24 marzo de 2010, el Relator Especial sobre la tortura y otros tratos o penas 
crueles, inhumanos o degradantes, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de 
magistrados y abogados, enviaron una carta de alegaci&#243;n se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente 
del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el <b>Decreto de amnist&#237;a aprobado 
por el Congreso Nacional de Honduras en 26 de enero de 2010. 
</b></p>
<p>347. Conforme a la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Congreso aprob&#243; el Decreto No. 02-2010, el 
cual otorga una amnist&#237;a general para los delitos pol&#237;ticos y delitos comunes conexos 
ocurridos durante el  per&#237;odo del 1 de enero de 2008 al 27 de enero de 2010. Los delitos 
incluidos en el Decreto son: traici&#243;n a la patria; delitos contra la forma de gobierno; 
terrorismo y sedici&#243;n. Del mismo modo, el decreto dispone la extensi&#243;n de la amnist&#237;a a los 
siguientes delitos comunes conexos: desobediencia, abuso de autoridad y violaci&#243;n de los 
deberes de los funcionarios, usurpaci&#243;n de funciones y delitos contra el ejercicio de los 
derechos garantizados por la constituci&#243;n. Se observa con preocupaci&#243;n la inclusi&#243;n en el 
Decreto del delito de abuso de autoridad, debido a que una amplia interpretaci&#243;n de este 
delito pudiera otorgar amnist&#237;a a presuntos perpetradores de violaciones de derechos 
humanos, incluidas las detenciones arbitrarias, en las que habr&#237;a habido un uso excesivo de 
la fuerza y malos tratos, sin que estas constituyan delitos pol&#237;ticos.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>75 
</b></p>
<p>348. Es tambi&#233;n preocupante que el tiempo abarcado por el decreto es de m&#225;s de dos 
a&#241;os, lo cual supera por un amplio margen el per&#237;odo en el que ocurri&#243; el golpe de Estado. 
A pesar de que se reconoce que el objetivo del Decreto es contribuir a la paz y a la 
reconciliaci&#243;n nacional, el vasto margen de tiempo hace imposible que v&#237;ctimas de 
violaciones de derechos humanos ocurridas con anterioridad al golpe de Estado puedan 
tener acceso a la justicia y fomenta la impunidad.  
</p>
<p>349. Tambi&#233;n se recibi&#243; informaci&#243;n sobre la decisi&#243;n de la Corte Suprema de Justicia de 
otorgar el sobreseimiento a seis militares de alto rango, quienes habr&#237;an sido acusados de 
abuso de autoridad por la detenci&#243;n y expulsi&#243;n del antiguo Presidente Manuel Zelaya en 
junio de 2009. La Corte Suprema habr&#237;a justificado la decisi&#243;n bajo el argumento de que la 
actuaci&#243;n de los militares hab&#237;a sido en defensa de la democracia hondure&#241;a y en 
protecci&#243;n de las vidas de las personas. 
</p>
<p>350. Se exhort&#243; al Gobierno a buscar una clarificaci&#243;n sobre los hechos expuestos, a fin 
de asegurar que los derechos de las v&#237;ctimas de violaciones de derechos humanos, incluida 
la tortura y los tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes, ocurridas durante el 
per&#237;odo abarcado por el Decreto de amnist&#237;a sean protegidos de conformidad, entre otros, a 
la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos, el Pacto Internacional de Derechos 
Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, la Declaraci&#243;n sobre la Protecci&#243;n de todas las Personas contra la 
Tortura y Otros Tratos o Penas Crueles, Inhumanos o Degradantes y la Convenci&#243;n contra 
la Tortura. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comunicaciones recibidas 
</b></p>
<p>351. La Relatora Especial no recibi&#243;, hasta la fecha, ninguna respuesta con respecto a esta 
comunicaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comunicaciones enviadas 
</b></p>
<p>352. El 21 de mayo de 2010, la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados 
y abogados, la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos 
humanos y el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de 
expresi&#243;n, de manera conjunta enviaron un llamamiento urgente haciendo referencia a su 
comunicaci&#243;n de fecha 16 de noviembre de 2009 en la que expresaron su preocupaci&#243;n en 
relaci&#243;n con los <b>actos de hostigamiento e intimidaci&#243;n en contra de magistrados, 
defensores p&#250;blicos y dem&#225;s auxiliares de justicia</b>. En particular, se expresaba 
preocupaci&#243;n sobre el hecho que la Corte Suprema de Justicia de Honduras habr&#237;a ordenado 
procesos disciplinarios, traslados forzosos, y otras acciones que se considera de 
intimidaci&#243;n y hostigamiento contra varios jueces y funcionarios que se habr&#237;an 
manifestado, de distintas formas legales, contra la destituci&#243;n del ex presidente Manuel 
Zelaya.  
</p>
<p>353. En la misma comunicaci&#243;n se solicitaban algunas clarificaciones con respecto a los 
mecanismos para garantizar los principios de estabilidad e inamovilidad de los jueces y la 
manera en la cual se asegura en Honduras que en el curso de los procesos disciplinarios en 
contra de los jueces se respeten las garant&#237;as m&#237;nimas del derecho a un proceso justo.  
</p>
<p>354. A la fecha, no se hab&#237;a recibido respuesta alguna a la mencionada comunicaci&#243;n. Por 
ello, los Relatores Especiales reiteraron su preocupaci&#243;n respecto a nueva informaci&#243;n 
recibida. Seg&#250;n la misma, el pasado 5 de mayo, el pleno de la Corte Suprema de Justicia 
habr&#237;a conocido de los expedientes de remoci&#243;n de cinco funcionarios que fueron -entre 
otros- objeto del llamamiento urgente de fecha 16 de noviembre de 2009, a saber: <b>Luis 
Alfonso Chavez de la Roca</b>, Juez contra la violencia dom&#233;stica en San Pedro Sula; <b>Ram&#243;n 
Enrique Barrios</b>, Juez de Sentencia en San Pedro Sula; <b>Guillermo L&#243;pez Lone</b>, Juez de 
Sentencia de San Pedro Sula; <b>Osman Fajardo Morel</b>, Defensor P&#250;blico de San Pedro </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>76</b>  
</p>
<p>Sula; y <b>Tirza Flores Lanza,</b> Magistrada de la Corte de Apelaciones Penal de San Pedro 
Sula. De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recibida, la Corte Suprema habr&#237;a acordado durante 
dicha sesi&#243;n la remoci&#243;n de estos funcionarios. Esta decisi&#243;n habr&#237;a sido ratificada en el 
Pleno de la Corte Suprema el 13 de mayo.  
</p>
<p>355. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, a los jueces Guillermo L&#243;pez y Luis Alfonso 
Ch&#233;vez, as&#237; como al Defensor P&#250;blico Osman Fajardo, se les habr&#237;a atribuido haber 
participado en manifestaciones contra el golpe de Estado; al juez Ram&#243;n Enrique Barrios lo 
habr&#237;an cuestionado por haber publicado un art&#237;culo en un peri&#243;dico en el que objetaba, con 
argumentos jur&#237;dicos, la posici&#243;n de la Corte Suprema de denominar como sucesi&#243;n 
constitucional a la destituci&#243;n del ex-Presidente Manuel Zelaya. Finalmente, a la 
magistrada Flores se le habr&#237;a sancionado por haber presentado un recurso de amparo 
constitucional a favor del ex-Presidente Zelaya y otros funcionarios. 
</p>
<p>356. Se inform&#243; tambi&#233;n que todos los funcionarios objeto de remoci&#243;n ser&#237;an miembros 
de la Asociaci&#243;n de Jueces para la Democracia, organizaci&#243;n que habr&#237;a expresado 
p&#250;blicamente su posici&#243;n con respecto a la crisis pol&#237;tica del a&#241;o pasado y cuyos miembros 
habr&#237;an participado activamente en la interposici&#243;n de diversos recursos judiciales al

<p>357. Se expres&#243; temor porque la sanci&#243;n que se impuso a los jueces no s&#243;lo les afecta 
personalmente sino que puede tener un efecto intimidatorio respecto a los otros miembros 
del gremio en el sentido de que se abstengan de manifestar opiniones diferentes de aquellas 
expresadas por las autoridades actuales. Esto representar&#237;a un ataque inadmisible contra la 
independencia de la judicatura. Finalmente, se subray&#243; que la creaci&#243;n de un clima de 
temor en el Poder Judicial y en los abogados puede debilitar el estado de derecho y obstruir 
la justicia.

magistrados y abogados, la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los 
derechos humanos y el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de 
opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n y, enviaron un llamamiento urgente con relaci&#243;n a la situaci&#243;n de 
<b>varios abogados y trabajadores de la organizaci&#243;n Asociaci&#243;n para una Sociedad mas 
Justa (ASJ)</b>, los cuales trabajan defendiendo los derechos y libertades fundamentales de 
sectores desfavorecidos de la poblaci&#243;n hondure&#241;a, incluyendo casos de derechos laborales.  
</p>
<p>360. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 21 de septiembre de 2010, una abogada de 
ASJ habr&#237;a sido amenazada por empleados de la Secretar&#237;a del Trabajo mientras se 
encontraba realizando labores de investigaci&#243;n en la misma Secretar&#237;a. Dichos empleados 
habr&#237;an advertido a la abogada de que el Sub-Secretario de la Secretaria de Trabajo y 
Seguridad Social, antiguo gerente de la compa&#241;&#237;a &#8220;Seguridad T&#233;cnica de Honduras&#8221; 
(SETECH), estar&#237;a muy interesado en su investigaci&#243;n y que deber&#237;a tener cuidado con lo 
que estaba haciendo.  
</p>
<p>361. Posteriormente, el d&#237;a 19 de octubre de 2010, la misma abogada amenazada en 
septiembre, habr&#237;a sido v&#237;ctima de un secuestro en la ciudad de Tegucigalpa por parte de 
dos hombres armados los cuales la habr&#237;an obligado a introducirse en un taxi. Una vez en el 
veh&#237;culo, los individuos habr&#237;an intercambiado armas de fuego y habr&#237;an comentado entre 
ellos: &#8220;Sabes que nos pagaron para ejecutarla, tenemos que hacerlo&#8221;. Despu&#233;s, se habr&#237;an 
dirigido a la abogada y le habr&#237;an preguntado: &#8220;&#191;Trabajas para ASJ? &#191;Qui&#233;n te paga? </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>&#191;Cu&#225;nto te paga? &#191;Est&#225;s investigando a SETECH?&#8221; Sin embargo, 40 minutos despu&#233;s de 
haberla retenido, los dos hombres la habr&#237;an dejado bajar del veh&#237;culo cerca de unos 
grandes almacenes.  
</p>
<p>362. SETECH es una empresa de seguridad, la cual fue demandada en 2006 por sus 
trabajadores por incumplimiento de la normativa laboral. ASJ y el abogado Dionisio D&#237;az 
Garc&#237;a estaban trabajando en uno de los casos cuando el Sr. D&#237;az Garc&#237;a fue asesinado el 4 
de diciembre de 2006 despu&#233;s de recibir amenazas de muerte. El resultado de las 
investigaciones y del juicio por el asesinato del abogado D&#237;az Garc&#237;a result&#243; en una 
condena a un antiguo guardia de seguridad de SETECH as&#237; como a un agente de la Oficina 
Nacional de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal. Tras la muerte del Sr. D&#237;az Garc&#237;a, el 20 de diciembre 
de 2006, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos otorg&#243; medidas cautelares a 
cuatro trabajadores de ASJ. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, despu&#233;s del asesinato del Sr. 
D&#237;az Garc&#237;a, ASJ habr&#237;a suspendido el acompa&#241;amiento legal de los trabajadores de 
SETECH. 
</p>
<p>363. Seg&#250;n informes recibidos, el d&#237;a 3 de noviembre, otra abogada de ASJ habr&#237;a 
recibido amenazas por parte de dos hombres desconocidos en motocicleta mientras 
circulaba en su veh&#237;culo particular en un transitado boulevard de la ciudad de Tegucigalpa. 
Estos dos hombres se habr&#237;an acercado a la ventanilla del conductor del veh&#237;culo de la 
abogada y le habr&#237;an dicho: &#8220;Ten cuidado con Transformemos Honduras y ASJ&#8221; al tiempo 
que mostraban un arma de fuego. Transformemos Honduras es una asociaci&#243;n de la cual 
forma parte ASJ y que trabaja investigando y denunciando irregularidades y corrupci&#243;n en 
los sistemas educativo y sanitario de Honduras.  
</p>
<p>364. Los sucesos relatados habr&#237;an sido puestos en conocimiento de la Fiscal&#237;a Especial 
de Derechos Humanos, as&#237; como de la Secretaria de Estado de Seguridad, con el fin de 
solicitar las medidas necesarias para garantizar la seguridad de los abogados de ASJ. Seg&#250;n 
la informaci&#243;n recibida, hasta el momento no habr&#237;an sido adoptadas medidas de protecci&#243;n 
para los trabajadores de ASJ amenazados recientemente. En este sentido, tampoco se habr&#237;a 
visto reforzada la protecci&#243;n otorgada a varias personas de la citada asociaci&#243;n en virtud de 
la medida cautelar de la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos de 20 de 
diciembre de 2006. 
</p>
<p>365. Se expres&#243; grave preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de los abogados 
y trabajadores de la Asociaci&#243;n para una Sociedad mas Justa (ASJ) as&#237; como por las 
alegaciones de que los sucesos arriba mencionados pudieran estar relacionadas con sus 
actividades de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, en particular con sus 
labores de investigaci&#243;n en casos relacionados con las actividades de la empresa de 
seguridad SETECH. Las alegaciones, de ser confirmadas, se enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto de 
creciente violencia e inseguridad para los defensores de los derechos humanos en 
Honduras.

abogado en la ASJ y fuera asesinado a disparos el 4 de diciembre de 2006; se record&#243; que 
al momento de su muerte, representaba a un grupo de ex-empleados de la empresa de 
seguridad privada SETECH. Con posterioridad, sus asesinos fueron detenidos y 
condenados. Uno de ellos era un ex-guardia de seguridad que hab&#237;a trabajado para 
SETECH. Desde entonces, otros miembros de la ASJ habr&#237;an recibido amenazas y desde 
octubre de 2010, abogados de la ASJ habr&#237;an sido v&#237;ctimas de nuevas amenazas.

febrero de 2007.  
</p>
<p>370. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 31 de enero de 2011 a las 17:50 horas, una 
abogada de la ASJ habr&#237;a recibido un mensaje de texto en su tel&#233;fono m&#243;vil, enviado 
an&#243;nimamente desde Internet, el cual dec&#237;a: &#8220;Deja de meter la nariz donde no debes&#8221;. 
Supuestamente tambi&#233;n dec&#237;a que otros dos abogados de la ASJ habr&#237;an sido advertidos 
previamente. Como se mencion&#243; en el llamamiento urgente de fecha 19 noviembre de 
2010, los dos abogados habr&#237;an sido amenazados por hombres desconocidos con armas de 
fuego el a&#241;o pasado. Uno de ellos habr&#237;a sido secuestrado el 19 de octubre de 2010 y habr&#237;a 
escuchado mencionar el nombre de SETECH (ahora llamado &#8220;Gecko Holdings&#8221;) durante 
los 40 minutos de cautiverio. 
</p>
<p>371. Antes del secuestro, la misma abogada habr&#237;a recibido en septiembre 2010 varias 
advertencias por parte de empleados del Ministerio del Trabajo seg&#250;n las cuales el 
vicepresidente del Ministerio de Trabajo (un ex-director del SETECH) habr&#237;a mostrado

<p>374. La Relatora Especial lamenta que, en el momento de finalizar este informe, no se 
hab&#237;a recibido respuesta a las cuatro comunicaciones enviadas durante el periodo del 
presente informe ni tampoco a sus comunicaciones enviadas en el periodo anterior. La 
Relatora Especial considera que el responder a las comunicaciones representa un elemento 
fundamental para la cooperaci&#243;n de los Estados con el mandato es por ello que insta al 
Gobierno de Honduras a que le proporcione una respuesta acerca de los casos mencionados.  
</p>
<p>375. Ahora bien, previo reconocimiento de la situaci&#243;n excepcional que atraviesa el 
estado de Honduras. Para la Relatora Especial es importante manifestar su preocupaci&#243;n 
frente a varias situaciones; en primer lugar, por la impunidad normativa y estructural que 
pudiera fomentarse con el Decreto No. 02-2010, que otorga una amnist&#237;a general para los 
delitos pol&#237;ticos y delitos comunes conexos ocurridos durante el  per&#237;odo del 1 de enero de 
2008 al 27 de enero de 2010, la Relatora desea recordar que bajo ninguna circunstancia 
debe impedirse la investigaci&#243;n y sanci&#243;n de quienes sean responsables de la comisi&#243;n de 
violaciones a los derechos humanos. En segundo lugar, la Relatora Especial considera 
importante se&#241;alar que, la independencia del poder judicial es un elemento fundamental 
para garantizar el Estado de Derecho, por ello manifiesta su preocupaci&#243;n frente a la 
inobservancia que pueda llegar a existir a los principios b&#225;sicos que aseguran la 
independencia de la judicatura, recuerda que a la luz de los mismos puede ser garantizado 
que los procedimientos judiciales sean desarrollados conforme a derecho. Adem&#225;s, desea 
subrayar que los jueces, y todos los funcionarios encargados de la administraci&#243;n de 
justicia, deben gozar de las libertades de expresi&#243;n, creencia, asociaci&#243;n y reuni&#243;n; que la 
inamovilidad de los jueces debe ser garantizada; y que para el caso de acusaciones o quejas 
contra aqu&#233;llos, as&#237; como para proceder a la suspensi&#243;n o separaci&#243;n del cargo como 
medida disciplinaria por los actos desplegados en el ejercicio de sus funciones, se deber&#225; 
substanciar un proceso con las debidas garant&#237;as. Finalmente, para la Relatora Especial, es 
importante recordar, la obligaci&#243;n estatal de garantizar a los abogados el ejercicio de sus 
funciones profesionales, sin actos de intimidaci&#243;n, hostigamiento, injerencias o amenazas y, 
por ende, en caso de que alguna de esas situaciones tenga lugar, como resultado de su 
ejercicio profesional, es necesario garantizarles su seguridad personal.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>376. On 29 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation of <b>Mr. Mian Abdul 
Qayoom</b>, President of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association, Srinagar, and 
<b>Mr. Ghulam Nabi Shaheen</b>, General Secretary of the Bar Association. 
</p>
<p>377. According to the information received, on 7 July 2010, the house of Mr. Mian Abdul 
Qayoom was allegedly raided by the police. He was reportedly arrested under the Jammu 
and Kashmir Public Safety Act of 1978 (PSA), which allows for detention of suspects for 
up to two years without charge or trial, and taken to Hiranagar Jail in Jammu.  On 20 July 
2010, a first hearing took place and there was a request to transfer Mr. Mian Abdul Qayoom 
to Srinagar Central Jail, which was reportedly denied. Mr. Mian Abdul Qayoom is accused </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>80</b>  
</p>
<p>of political activities in support of secession within his role in the Bar Association and of 
instigating mass protests. A next hearing is scheduled for 29 July 2010.  
</p>
<p>378. On 18 July 2010, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Shaheen was allegedly arrested and taken to the 
District Jail in Rajouri. He is reportedly being accused under the PSA of having organized 
public demonstrations calling for the release of Mr. Mian Abdul Qayoom. 
</p>
<p>379. It is alleged that these detentions follow the legal assistance provided by Mr. Mian 
Abdul Qayoom and Mr. Ghulam Nabi Shaheen to individuals arbitrarily detained under the 
PSA as well as their work on alleged human rights violations including enforced 
disappearances in Kashmir. 
</p>
<p>380. Concern was expressed that these arrests and detention might have been related to 
the activities of Mr. Mian Abdul Qayoom and Mr. Ghulam Nabi Shaheen in defence of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>381. In a letter dated 6 December 2010, the Government informed that the subjects of the 
appeal, who are involved in secessionist activities as also other acts highly prejudicial to the 
security of the state, were arrested following due procedure as laid down by the law and 
produced before the court. The matter is <i>sub judice</i>. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>382. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response was sent to the 
urgent appeal dated 29 July 2010. However, she regrets the lack of detailed information on 
a number of issues raised in the communication, notably about the legal basis for the arrest, 
detention and prosecution of the persons named above and how they comply with 
international norms and standards, as set forth <i>inter alia</i> in the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. She would appreciate a substantive response to the outstanding 
questions.  
</p>
<p>383. With regard to the concern that the detention of the two subjects of the appeal may 
be linked with the legal assistance they have provided to individuals arbitrarily detained, 
she wishes to underline the importance to guarantee the rights of lawyers to freely assist 
their clients and exercise their professional functions. To this end, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates the importanceof taking into account the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers 
adopted in Havana, Cuba, by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, from 27 August to 7 September 1990, aimed at 
assisting States to protect and ensure the proper role of lawyers.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>384. On 5 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding <b>Mr. Devi Singh Rawat</b>, a lawyer and human rights defender based 
in Rajasthan, India, working particularly on the issue of torture. From 2006-2008 he 
worked with the National Project on Prevention of Torture (NPPT) in India, including 
participation in training sessions.  
</p>
<p>385. According to the information received:  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>81 
</b></p>
<p>386. On 5 January 2010, Mr. Singh Rawat filed a complaint against officers from Adarsh 
Nagar Police Station in the Ajmer District of Rajasthan, alleging that two individuals, Mr. 
Gopal Swaroop and a Mr. Rajkumar, had been subjected to acts of torture. He filed his 
complaint before Judicial Magistrate No. 4, naming police officers Mr. Ramjan Khan, Mr. 
Sajjan Singh and Mr. Karan Singh as the alleged offenders. The court recorded statements 
by the complainants and witnesses under sections 200 and 202 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, and adjourned the case until 11 February 2010 to allow for further investigation. 
The complaint was filed by Mr. Singh Rawat on behalf of a request by the State Law 
Officer of NPPT.  
</p>
<p>387. On 30 January 2010, Mr. Singh Rawat was allegedly summoned by SHO Rajendra 
Singh Rawat of Adarsh Nagar Police Station, where he was asked to withdraw the 
complaint, or face consequences as a result. However, Mr. Singh Rawat refused to do so.  
</p>
<p>388. On 31 January 2010 at approximately 11:00 am, a fight broke out between police 
officers and members of the public during elections for Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) (a 
local governance body) in Palra Village, which falls within the jurisdiction of Adarsh Nagar 
Police Station. It is reported that several voters who had travelled to Palra from Khajpura 
village were arrested by Adarsh Nagar police and prevented from casting their votes. The 
police allegedly attempted to seize their vehicle, leading to a scuffle which developed into a 
fight between the police and voters. A police vehicle was damaged and several individuals 
received minor injuries. Approximately 20 people were arrested at the scene and several 
had charges filed against them.  
</p>
<p>389. Mr. Singh Rawat was not present at the scene at the time of the incident, and is 
resident in another area. He was therefore not reportedly connected in any way to the 
election under way in Palra village. However, he was arrested later that day, in relation to 
the violence, at his residence and taken to Adarsh Nagar Police Station. His relatives were 
not informed of his arrest. It has been reported that the police physically assaulted and 
abused Mr. Singh Rawat and up to 15 other detainees upon arrival at the police station. 
Whilst in detention they were forced to remove their clothes and were then photographed. 
These photographs were later provided to the press.  
</p>
<p>390. Mr. Singh Rawat was charged with &#8220;Voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public 
servant from his duty&#8221; and &#8220;Assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from the 
discharge of his duty&#8221; under Sections 332 and 353 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 
under Section 3 of the Protection Against Property Damage Act for &#8220;mischief causing 
damage to public property&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>391. During a hearing to remand the detainees into custody on 1 February 2010, a bail 
application was filed on behalf of Mr. Singh Rawat. The hearing was held before Judicial 
Magistrate No. 5, Mr. Mhendra Dabi, as the presiding officer of the original Jurisdictional 
Court No 4, Mrs Neelam Sharma, was on leave. Mr. Mhendra Dabi refused Mr. Singh 
Rawat's bail application and remanded the detainees into custody until 11 February 2010.  
</p>
<p>392. A second bail application was filed later the same day before a District and Sessions 
Judge under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code. At a hearing at 2:00p.m on 2 
February 2010, Additional District and Sessions Judge No. 2, Mr. Kamal Bagadi granted 
bail to Mr. Singh Rawat and the other detainees. Mr. Singh Rawat and the others were 
released from the Central Prison in Ajmer at 6:30p.m that evening. Charges remain pending 
against all of the detainees.  
</p>
<p>393. Concern is expressed that the arrest of and charges against Mr. Devi Singh Rawat, in 
addition to his reported ill-treatment while in detention, are related to his work in defence 
of human rights, particularly his work against torture and for speaking out against 
violations of human rights by the authorities.  </p>

<p>396. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response. She notes that the 
matter is under judicial consideration. However, she regrets the absence of detailed 
information on any investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to the 
arrest and detention of the lawyer Devi Singh Rawat. In light of the allegations and concern 
raised in the communication that Mr. Singh Rawat was arrested in relation to the violence 
in Palra village, in which he was not present at the time of the incident and with which he 
reportedly was not connected in any way, she calls on the Government to provide 
substantive information on the accurary of these allegations, as requested in the 
communication. 
</p>
<p>397. The Special Rapporteur further expresses concern that the arrest and detention of 
Mr. Singh Rawat may be linked with his work against torture and for speaking out against 
violations of human rights by the authorities. Moreover, she regrets the absence of 
information on any investigations carried out in relation to the allegations of ill-treatment 
by police officers. She calls on the Government to provide substantive information in this

pro-independence symbol of South Maluku. The political activists had not been registered 
as part of the ceremony, and were immediately arrested by approximately 20 police and 
presidential guards.  
</p>
<p>400. During the arrest and in the police vehicle, some of the activists were punched and 
beaten with rifle butts. They were transferred between police stations, including the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>83 
</b></p>
<p>regional police station (Polda, Polisi Daerah), the district police station (Polres, Polisi 
Resort) and the police mobile brigade (Brimob, Brigade Mobil Tantui base). Most of the 
detainees were subjected to torture and ill-treatment in police custody. They were forced to 
crawl on their stomachs over hot asphalt, billiard balls were forced into their mouths, they 
were whipped with electric cables, beaten on the head with rifle butts until their ears bled, 
and shots were fired close to their ears. Afterwards, while they were still bleeding, they 
were thrown into the sea and dragged out. It has been reported that Special Detachment 88 
officers were responsible for the most severe assaults.  
</p>
<p>401. On the same day, nine other people were arrested for having helped organize the 
event or for having watched it. Eight of them are serving sentences of between six and 12 
years imprisonment. Flip Malawau, Barce Manuputty, Petrus Rahayaan, Arens Arnol Saiya, 
Elia Sinay, Alexander Tanate and Johan Teterissa were all subjected to beatings with hard 
objects, including rifle butts, during their pre-trial detention. 
</p>
<p>402. All of the detainees were denied contact with the outside world for 11 days. Once 
the trials began, the detainees were transferred to the Waiheru detention centre, where some 
were coerced into signing statements waiving their right to a lawyer. Those who had 
lawyers assigned by the State were advised to plead guilty and waive their right to appeal. 
Additionally, some of the detainees did not appear before a judge and were nonetheless 
convicted in absentia. They were all sentenced to between seven and 20 years of 
imprisonment. No investigation has yet been launched into the allegations of torture and ill-
treatment.  
</p>
<p>403. On 10 March 2009, 11 of the detainees were transferred to correctional facilities in 
Java, more than 1,000 kilometres away from their families. It is believed that neither the 
detainees nor their families were informed of their transfer. Lawyers from the Malang 
branch of the Legal Aid Institute (Lembaga Bantuan Hukum, LBH) Surabaya have been 
seeking permission to visit three of them, Leonard Hendricks, Johan Teterissa and Abraham 
Saiya, while in detention in Lowokaru Prison in Malang, East Java. On 12 February 2010, 
LBH received a copy of a letter from the East Java regional office of the Ministry of Justice 
and Human Rights to the Director General of Prisons in Jakarta, informing them of LBH&#8217;s 
application and asking the Director General to coordinate with the Foreign Affairs Ministry. 
They have not heard either from the East Java office of the Ministry of Justice and Human 
Rights or the Director General of Prisons since then.  
</p>
<p>404. Particular concern is expressed over Mr. Teterissa, who has not received medical 
treatment since the arrest and ill-treatment. He has a high fever, is in constant pain and 
cannot see properly. The prison authorities have denied his request for external medical 
treatment, and a doctor who went to see him on 15 July was also turned away. It is also 
believed that Mr. Teterissa may be denied access to sufficient food and clean water in 
prison.

<p>406. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to the

at the earliest possible date a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations. She 
remains particularly concerned at the allegations that many of the individuals mentioned

<p>407. On 22 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, an urgent appeal concerning <b>Heshmatollah Tabarzadi</b> 
(&#8220;Heshmat&#8221;), a journalist and leader of the Democratic Front of Iran, a banned political 
party. 
</p>
<p>408. Mr. Heshmatollah Tabarzadi was arrested on 27 December 2009 in Tehran, by 
intelligence officers from the Revolutionary Guard. Upon arrest, his computer, phone book, 
photo albums, video tapes, fax and mobiles phone were confiscated. It is believed that Mr. 
Tabarzadi&#8217;s arrest may be as a result of an article which was published on 17 December in a 
United States-based newspaper, and which stated that &#8220;if the Government continues to opt 
for violence, there very well may be another revolution in Iran&#8230;&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>409. Mr. Tabarzadi has been accused of &#8220;insulting the Supreme Leader&#8221;, &#8220;insulting the 
Islamic Republic&#8221; and &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;. He has not had access to a lawyer, 
but has been able to receive visits from his family and to talk to them on the phone, albeit 
while being monitored by the police administration. During his interrogation by intelligence 
officers, Mr. Tabarzadi was blindfolded, beaten and threatened with the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>410. Concern is expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Tabarzadi may form part of 
an attempt to stifle his rights to freedom of opinion expression, peaceful assembly, and 
participation in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen 
representatives, in the country. In light of the above allegations of threats and ill-treatment, 
further concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Tabarzadi.

<p>412. On 27 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning the 
alleged recent <b>alleged recent establishment of a &#8220;special court&#8221; at Evin prison</b>. 
</p>
<p>413. According to the information received, on 7 March 2010, Tehran&#8217;s General 
Prosecutor, Mr. Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, informed on the creation of a special court inside 
Evin prison in order - inter alia - to expedite investigations and reduce costs. This court 
deals with the case files of many political activists and other prisoners whose cases are in 
an indeterminate status.  
</p>
<p>414. Lawyers have been permitted virtually no contact with their clients arrested in the 
aftermath of the Iranian elections who are facing trial in Evin court prison. Access to their 
files was reportedly also blocked. Lawyers have no access to the Evin prison court and, as a 
result, cannot duly perform their professional duty. 
</p>
<p>415. It is also reported that judges are now housed in an environment that is under the 
oversight of the Ministry of Intelligence. During preliminary investigations, case judges 
would only receive information from intelligence officers. Suspects&#8217; lawyers are not </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>85 
</b></p>
<p>entitled to meet with their clients, thus rendering their effective defense virtually 
impossible. According to the source, the creation of a special court for political prisoners 
within the confines of Evin prison would be in violation of Iranian Constitution, as this 
court would not be a competent court within the meaning of article 34 of the Constitution.

of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent an urgent appeal to the government 
concerning the situation of <b>Mr. Mohammad Mostafaei</b>, a human rights lawyer, and his 
family. 
</p>
<p>418. According to the information received, on 21 July 2010, Mohammad Mostafaei was 
issued with a summons requiring him to go to a branch of the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Evin 
Prison. He reportedly went there on 24 July, was questioned for about one hour and then 
was released. Later, however, he received a further summons by telephone. The same 
evening, his wife, <b>Ms. Fereshteh Halimi</b>, and her brother, <b>Mr. Farhad Halimi</b>, were 
arrested and have been detained since then. At the time this communication was sent, it was 
reported that Mohammad Mostafaei's current whereabouts are unknown. On the evening of 
24 July he reportedly wrote on his <i>Facebook</i> account: &#8220;'it is possible they will arrest me&quot;.  
</p>
<p>419. Mohammad Mostafaei is a human rights lawyer who has taken up cases of juvenile 
offenders, those convicted of a capital offence committed while under the age of 18; men 
and women facing stoning and other cases, including of political prisoners.  
</p>
<p>420. Serious concern was expressed about the fact that his questioning by the authorities 
and the arrest of his wife and brother in law may be linked to his activity in defence of 
human rights and in particular to his work as defence counsel in many human rights cases, 
including the case of Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a woman who was sentenced to 
death by stoning for alleged adultery (and whose sentence is currently on stay).

</p>
<p>423. Ms. Sarah Emily Shourd was arrested on 31 July 2009, together with two 
companions, by Iranian border guards near the Ahmed Awa waterfall resort area, Iraq. 
They were forced to cross the border to Iran, and Ms. Shourd was taken to Evin Prison, 
where she is still being held. Since her arrest, Ms. Shourd has been held in solitary 
confinement and without any charges brought against her. She has only received one family 
visit and she has had no access to her lawyer. In addition, she suffers from a precancerous </p>

<p>424. Due to the extended detention in solitary confinement and lack of adequate medical 
attention, concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Shourd. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received

<p>425. By letter dated 7 October 2010, the Government indicated that they were detained 
by the border guards on charges of illegal entry and espionage. Their case and charges 
against them have been reviewed by the investigating judge and in view of the evidence 
obtained; a court order for remand detention was issued. The accused persons and their 
defense lawyers - Mr. Masood Shafie -protested the court order. The order by the court was 
upheld. All three accused persons have had access to defense lawyer and were able to meet 
their family. Moreover, Ms. Sara Shourd's remand detention was changed into a bail on 
Islamic compassionate grounds and after posting the bail, she was freed and returned to the 
United States.

<p>427. On 23 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning <b>Mr. Abdollah Momeni,</b> member and 
spokesperson of the Central Council of the Alumni Organization of University Students of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran (Sazeman-e Danesh Amookhtegan-e Iran-e Islami&#8212;Advar-e 
Tahkim-e Vahdat), an organization working toward the advancement of democracy and 
human rights. Mr. Momeni was the subject of communications sent on 12 July 2007, 31 
July 2008 and 10 July 2009.  
</p>
<p>428. Mr. Abdollah Momeni has been detained at Evin Prison since his arrest in 2009. 
Upon arrest, he was beaten, punched and kicked by security officials. The officials then 
shackled his hands and feet and took him to Evin prison. Upon arrival and throughout the 
first interrogations, he was threatened with execution. He spent 86 days in solitary 
confinement, and 50 in incommunicado detention. Afterwards, he was transferred to wards 
209 and 240, respectively where he was only allowed to go to the courtyard on six 
occasions during seven months. He was allowed a very short phone call to his family every 
two weeks, with the presence of his interrogator.  
</p>
<p>429. After spending two days in a cell in Section 109, where the carpet was covered with 
faeces, he was transferred to Section 240, under the authority of the Ministry of 
Intelligence. The cell measured 1.6 by 2.2 meters, forcing him to lie in one position the 
whole time.  
</p>
<p>430. During the lengthy interrogation sessions, he was forced to stand on one foot for 
long periods of time. Pressure was applied to his throat several times, leading to him losing 
consciousness. Afterward, he suffered from severe pain in the neck and throat, which made 
eating or drinking intolerable. The aim of the interrogations was to force him to confess to 
having had sexual relations with other men. When he did not reply what was expected from </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>87 
</b></p>
<p>him, he was forced to eat the interrogation forms. During the interrogations, Mr. Momeni 
was beaten, slapped, punched and kicked throughout the face and body on numerous 
occasions. He was also verbally insulted and threatened with rape. On one occasion, the 
interrogators forced his head down the toilet, forcing him to swallow feces.  
</p>
<p>431. Mr. Momeni was told by one of the interrogators that he should not request the 
services of a lawyer, and he was not allowed to appoint a private one. He refused the 
services of the public defender, who would have needed the approval of the interrogators. 
When he was presented before the court, he read the statement provided by the 
interrogators, as they had agreed to release him if he did so. At the meeting with the 
prosecutor, the interrogator was present, and Mr. Momeni did not mention the ill-treatment 
due to fear. In March 2010, he was released on bail, but was re-arrested soon after for 
failing to confess to further crimes demanded by the interrogators. He remains in detention 
in Evin prison. 
</p>
<p>432. In light of the serious allegations of torture and ill-treatment, concern is expressed 
for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdollah Momeni.

<p>434. On 29 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding the situation of <b>Ms. Zeynab Jalalian</b>, who was sentenced to death for the offence 
of &#8220;enmity against God&#8221;. Information now made available to us indicates that during her 
trial two lawyers who sought to represent her were prevented from taking up her defence.  
</p>
<p>435. The case of Ms. Jalalian has previously been brought to the attention of the 
Government in a communication dated 23 April 2010. In the communication concern was 
raised with regard to the compatibility of the imposition of the death penalty on the charge 
of moharebeh with international law obligations accepted by the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>436. Concerns raised in previous communications were reiterated. The Special 
Rapporteurs recalled that carrying out the execution of Ms. Zeynab Jalalian would be 
incompatible with the international obligations that the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
undertaken under various instruments which they have been mandated to bring to the 
attention of Governments. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>437. At the time this report was finalized, no response to this communication dated 29 
September 2010 has been received. However, a response has been received on 18 March 
2011 to the previous communication sent on 23 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>438. With regard to Ms. Zeinab Jalalian&#8217;s case, the Human Rights High Council of the 
Judiciary has approached all pertinent judicial authorities and courts. According to reports, 
Ms. Jalalian was charged with the following crimes: (1) violent armed rebellion against the 
system of the Islamic Republic of Iran; (2) membership in Pejak terrorist group; (3) 
possession and transportation of illegal firearms and military equipment; (4) propaganda 
against the state, and in favor of hostile groups. 
</p>
<p>439. Ms. Jalalian&#8217;s case was brought before Branch 1 of Kermansha&#8217;s Court of Islamic 
Revolution. Upon completion of all judicial processes, the court &#8211; by issuing verdict 
number 1403 dated 3 December 2008 &#8211; sentenced Ms. Jalalian to death. The verdict was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>88</b>  
</p>
<p>appealed by Ms. Jalalian and her counsel Mr. Faroborz Ensanumehr. As a result, the case 
received by Kermanshah appellate court; however by issuing verdict number 
8809978324400157 dated 6 May 2009, the verdict of the previous court was upheld. 
</p>
<p>440. On behalf of Ms. Jalalian and in the context of Islamic mercy, a request for amnesty, 
or commutation of sentence was lodged with the judiciary&#8217;s amnesty committee. The 
request is still under consideration. Also despite the gravity of the crime committed &#8211; which 
requires the culprit to be kept in prison &#8211; in difference to Ms. Jalalian&#8217;s situation, she was 
incarcerated in Kermanshah&#8217;s rehabilitation center. Statements otherwise are falsehoods 
and untrue. 
</p>
<p>441. Background information on Pejak terrorist group was also included by the Human 
Rights High Council of the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>442. In 1978, the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) was established under the leadership of 
Abdolla Ojalan. The stated goal of the PKK was to establish an independent Marxist-
Leninist Kurdistan. To promote itself, the group initially organized cultural programs 
geared towards Kurdish youth. However, it soon took up arms to forcefully work towards 
the establishment of an independent Kurdistan. Several governments reacted to this turn of 
events and tried to counter PKK&#8217;s sabotage and terrorist campaign. Sometime later, the 
leader of the group, Abdollah Ojalan was arrested by Turkey. Ojelan&#8217;s supporters 
responded to the news by protest rallies and plunging a number of Kurdish areas into a 
crisis. When PKK arrived in Iran, it initially engaged in a recruitment drive. Later, it 
expanded its activities and started to train members and establish a network of cells. Later 
still, PKK&#8217;s local version, the &#8216;Pejak&#8217; announced its inception and stated its goal as an 
armed campaign to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pejak went to engage in a 
bloody campaign of bombings and terrorist attacks. 
</p>
<p>443. With regard to Pejak&#8217;s ties with the PKK, most intelligence and military experts 
agree that PKK and Pejak differ in name only. This tactic is an effort to deflect international 
pressure and allow regional powers to be in contact with the group. This also allows the 
group to maintain offices in different countries of the region. The group&#8217;s leaders and 
representatives have been trying to establish a distinction between Pejak and the PKK, and 
by doing so ward off protests by the Islamic Republic of Iran against PKK encroachment 
into Iran and the expansion of its terrorist campaign into Iranian territory. 
</p>
<p>444. There are scores of assassinations, bombings, grenade attacks, armed robberies, and 
extortion attempts in Pejak&#8217;s record. To obtain its goals, the terrorist group does not hesitate 
to damae and destroy public and private property or injure and kill innocent bystanders. 
</p>
<p>445. After pressure by Turkey, the US State Department labeled PKK a terrorist 
organization; however, the same designation was given to Pejak, which is its offshoot. As a 
result, Pejak continues to receive supports from the US and other countries. Needless to 
say, international law prohibits states and others from supporting terrorist organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>446. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Governemnt for the response to the urgent appeal 
dated 29 September 2010. As noted in the communication, she wishes to stress that 
although the death penalty is not prohibited under international, it may only be imposed for 
the most serious crimes. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no information was provided 
on the compatibility of the imposition of the death penalty with international standards. 
Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur appreciates the information provided by the 
Government according to which a request for amnesty or commutation of the sentence is 
under consideration. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would greatly appreciate

</p>
<p>448. According to information received, Mr. Seifzadeh has been charged under the 
Islamic penal code with founding the Defenders of Human Rights Centre. The centre was 
shut down by judicial authorities and its activities declared to be unlawful.  
</p>
<p>449. The case is being heard before the 15th Branch of the Revolutionary Court. The first

</p>
<p>450. Grave concerns were expressed that Mr. Mohammad Seifzadeh was being 
prosecuted under criminal law because of the exercise of his profession as a lawyer and

we would like to seek clarification from the Government of the circumstances regarding the

Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

Saharkhiz</b>, a pro-reform movement journalist and member of the Association of Iranian 
Journalists and of the Central Council of the Committee to Protect Press Freedom, and <b>Mr. 
Hossein Derakhshan</b>, a blogger with dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship who posted 
instructions on his blog in Persian on how to set up a blogging site and begin writing online 
comments.  
</p>
<p>453. Concerns regarding the case of Mr. Isa Saharkhiz have been communicated to the 
Government on numerous occasions, including through urgent appeals dated 11 February 
2010 and 1 April 2010 by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. We regret 
that we have not yet received a reply from the Government to these communications. Mr. 
Isa Saharkhiz&#8217;s case has also been considered by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and has been deemed arbitrary in its opinion adopted on 6 May 2010 (Opinion 
No.8/2010). 
</p>
<p>454. According to new information received, on 27 September 2010, the authorities of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran reportedly informed the lawyer of Mr. Isa Saharkhiz that he 
had been sentenced to three years in prison, a five-year ban on political and journalistic 
activities, and a one-year travel ban. Mr. Saharkhiz was detained in July 2009 shortly after 
the disputed presidential elections and was charged with &#8220;insulting the Supreme Leader&#8221; 
and &#8220;propagating against the regime&#8221;. Mr. Saharkhiz&#8217;s arrest came two days after he 
printed articles criticizing the Iranian Government. He has on multiple occasions given 
speeches on the importance of the freedom of the press and of human rights, often </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>90</b>  
</p>
<p>criticizing the Government. According to the information received, he was arrested on 
account of participating in Karroubi&#8217;s political campaign for the recent presidential 
elections and for speaking out against the Government.  
</p>
<p>455. On 29 September 2010, Mr. Hossein Derakhshan was convicted by Branch 15 of the 
Revolutionary Court of cooperating with hostile States, propaganda against the system, 
propaganda in favour of counter-revolutionary groups, insults to the holy sanctities, and set-
up and management of vulgar and obscene websites. He was sentenced to 19-and-a-half 
years in prison, a five year ban on political and journalistic activities and repayment of 
receive funds of 30,750 Euros, US$ 2,900, and UK&#163; 200 British Pounds. It is unclear what 
the funds were allegedly for. Additionally, it has been reported that his lawyer has not been 
given a copy of the verdict and his family was not informed of his conviction until it was 
published in the news.  
</p>
<p>456. Mr. Derakhshan was detained at his family home in Tehran on 1 November 2008 in 
connection with comments he allegedly made about a cleric, spent over a year without 
charge and in solitary confinement for nine months, and has been prevented from receiving 
visits from his family and lawyers. He has 20 days in which to lodge an appeal and is 
believed to be held in Evin Prison in Tehran.  
</p>
<p>457. Serious concern is expressed regarding the harsh sentences against Mr. Isa 
Saharkhiz and Mr. Hossein Derakhshan for non-violent expression of their opinions and 
views, as well as their continued detention. Further concern is reiterated that their 
prosecution may be part of a broader pattern to intimidate other journalists and bloggers.

response provided by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, regarding the 
circumstances and reasons for the arrest and detention of Mr. Saharhkiz. Nevertheless, the 
Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of information on any investigations which may 
have been carried out in relation to the allegation of ill-treatment of Mr. Saharhkiz. Nor was 
information provided on the sentencing and its compatibility with international standards. 
</p>
<p>464. In respect of the case of Mr. Derakhshan, the Special Rapporteur notes with

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>465. On 12 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
regarding the criminal conviction and disbarment of <b>Mr. Mohammad Seifzadeh</b>, a lawyer 
and co-founder of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC). 
</p>
<p>466. The Special Rapporteurs have previously brought to the attention of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government the case of Mr. Mohammad Seifzadeh in a communication dated 
30 September 2010, in which concern was raised that Mr. Seifzadeh is being prosecuted 
under criminal law because of the exercise of his profession as a lawyer and human rights 
defender.  
</p>
<p>467. According to information received, on 30 October 2010, Branch 15 of Tehran's 
Revolutionary Court sentenced Mr. Seifzadeh to nine years in prison and a ten year ban 
from practicing law. He was found guilty of &quot;creating and acting within an organization 
which aims at threatening national security&quot;. The Special Rapporteurs are informed that<b> 
Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani</b> and <b>Mr. Mohammad Ali Dadkhah</b>, two other co-founders of 
DHRC, are also being prosecuted under similar charges. 
</p>
<p>468. Mr. Seifzadeh's trial was held without a jury panel and behind closed doors. Further 
the Court refused Mr. Seifzadeh's request to summon and to declare as witnesses ten 
individuals who had issued the DHRC license at the time, including former members from </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>92</b>  
</p>
<p>the cabinet of the then Interior Minister. The refusal was allegedly in violation of article 
193 of the Iranian Criminal Procedure Code. 
</p>
<p>469. The Special Rapporteurs are informed that the disbarment of Mr. Seifzadeh by the 
judiciary violates Iranian legislation, which provides that &#8220;a lawyers&#8217; license can only be 
suspended by the disciplinary bodies of the bar associations.&quot; 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>470. In a letter dated 8 February 2011, the Government responses to the communication 
summarized above. In connection with the conviction of a number of attorneys, including 
Mr. Mohammad Seifzadeh, the High Council of Human Rights of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran has approached all pertinent judicial authorities and courts. On the basis of information 
received from Tehran&#8217;s court of Islamic Revolution, Mr. Mohammad Seifzadeh, son of 
Abdollah, has been charged with the following: (1) establishment of an illegal group, 
namely &#8216;center for human rights defenders&#8217;; (2) propaganda against the system of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>471. After the completion of investigations and examination of the case and hearing of 
Mr. Seifzadeh and his defence attorney &#8211; Ms. Marzieh Nikara &#8211; branch 15 of Tehran&#8217;s 
court of Islamic Revoblution, through its verdict No. 309 dated 10 June 2010 as based on 
articles 47, 498, 500 of the Islamic Penal Code (IPC), sentenced Mr. Seifzadeh to eight 
years of imprisonment &#8211; including earlier detention. Also on the basis of article 19 of the 
IPC and as an additional <i>Ta&#8217;ziri</i> sentence (in Islamic jurisprudence/ <i>Figh&#8217;h</i> this term refers 
to sentences which carry variable levels of punishment, as determined by the law and the 
judge respectively) Mr. Seifzadeh has been prohibited from practicing law for ten years. 
</p>
<p>472. The sentence has been appealed and the case is being reexamined by branch 54 of 
Tehran&#8217;s court of appeals. Subsequently, Mr. Seifzadeh has been released on bail. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur

<p>473. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response to the 
communication dated 12 November 2010. She welcomes the information that the case of 
Mr. Seifzadeh is being reexamined and that he has been released on bail. However, she 
regrets the absence of information on the nature of the criminal cases against Mr. 
Abdolfattah Soltani and Mr. Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, as requested in the communications 
and calls upon the Government to transmit substantive information on the criminal 
proceedings initiated against them. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>474. On 19 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers sent an urgent appeal concerning the pattern of interference in the professional 
discharge of functions for lawyers. 
</p>
<p>475. The Special Rapporteur has received information on the four following trends (a to 
d): 
</p>
<p>476. There is a pattern of arresting defence lawyers which is allegedly aimed at 
preventing lawyers from discharging their functions.  
</p>
<p>477. On 13 November 2010, <b>Ms. Maryam Kiyan Ersi, Ms. Maryam Karbasi, Ms. 
Sara Sabaghian, Ms. Rosa Gharachurlo and Mr. Mohammad Hossein Nayyeri</b> were 
detained upon their return from Turkey. They were charged on grounds relating to national 
security and &#8216;violating moral standards outside Iran.&#8217;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>93 
</b></p>
<p>478. The Special Rapporteur is informed that previously on 8 July 2010, Ms. Sara 
Sabaghian was arrested and released a few days later. She is a member of the Iranian Bar 
Association's Committee for the Defence of Women and Children's Rights and her clients 
include Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani.  
</p>
<p>479. <b>Mr. Mohammad Oliyaeifard</b>, a lawyer and board member of the Committee for 
the Defence of Political Prisoners in Iran, is currently serving a one-year prison sentence for 
allegedly speaking against the execution of one of his clients Mr. Behnoud Shojaee during 
interviews with international media. Mr. Olyaeifard has defended many prisoners of 
conscience, including independent trade unionists, as well as juvenile offenders.  
</p>
<p>480. <b>Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani </b>and<b> Mr. Mohammad Ali Dadkhah</b> were arrested after 
the Presidential elections of June 2009. They were later released on bail, the case against 
them is pending in court and if found guilty they may be imprisonment and eventually 
disbarred.  
</p>
<p>481. There is a pattern of intimidation and harassment, I have received information that 
some defence lawyers are under tax investigations and that the authorities freeze the 
lawyers&#8217; bank accounts and other financial assets. Such investigations I am informed can 
lead to a lawyer being disbarred.  
</p>
<p>482. The Special Rapporteur is informed that <b>Ms. Shirin Ebadi</b> has been subjected to a 
tax investigation and the authorities froze a bank account containing her Nobel Prize 
winnings allegedly in violation of Iranian law. Further <b>Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh</b> is allegedly 
also being investigated.  
</p>
<p>483. Some lawyers have been barred from contesting for posts in the Iranian Bar 
Association on the basis of imputed political opinions and human rights activities.  In 2008,<b> 
Mr. Mohammad Dadkhah, Mr. Hadi Esmailzadeh, Fatemeh Gheyrat and Abdolfattah 
Soltani</b>, all members of the Center for Human Right Defenders, were disqualified from 
standing for the Central Board of the Bar Association because of their activities as human 
rights defenders. This case was the subject of a communication dated 3 November 2008, to 
which your Excellency&#8217;s Government is yet to reply.  
</p>
<p>484. Some defense lawyers have gone into exile. Information made available to me 
indicates that in July 2009, <b>Ms. Shadi Sadr </b>left the country after she was detained for 11 
days. In July 2010,<b> Mr. Mohammad Mostafaei </b>was also forced to flee, after his 
involvement in the case of Ms. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. The Special Rapporteur is 
informed that the authorities arrested his wife and her brother in his place.

Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
regarding the situation of <b>Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh</b>, a lawyer and a prominent human rights 
activist. Ms. Nasrin has represented clients ranging from juvenile offenders facing the death 
penalty to Nobel Peace Laureate Ms. Shirin Ebadi. She has also spoken openly about 
alleged shortcomings in the rule of law and administration of justice in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran.  </p>

</p>
<p>487. According to information received, on 28 August 2010, Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh&#8217;s 
house and office were searched by law enforcement authorities. On 4 September, Ms. 
Sotoudeh was arrested, and subsequently summoned to appear in court. Her trial reportedly 
started on 15 November 2010, during which she reportedly faces charges of acting against 
national security; gathering and colluding to disturb national security; and co-operation 
with a human rights body, the Centre for Human Rights Defenders, co-founded by Ms. 
Shirin Ebadi. Mr. Reza Khandan, Sotoudeh&#8217;s husband, was reportedly not allowed to attend 
the court session but was able to talk to his wife for a few minutes afterwards. Ms. 
Sotoudeh&#8217;s next court session is reportedly scheduled to be held on 24 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>488. Since her arrest, Ms. Sotoudeh has reportedly remained in solitary confinement in 
Evin Prison in Tehran, with only occasional contact with family members. On 3 November 
she met her two children and sister who reportedly found her in poor condition, having lost 
weight as a consequence of a hunger strike she had undertaken to protest against her arrest 
and the conditions of detention inside Evin prison. Ms. Sotoudeh has reportedly ended her 
hunger strike with the commencement of her trial on 15 November. 
</p>
<p>489. According to the information received, prior to her arrest, Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh had 
been threatened with reprisals if she did not stop her human rights work. Her husband, Mr. 
Reza Khandan, also received threats urging him to stop his wife from defending her clients, 
including Ms. Ebadi. 
</p>
<p>490. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Sotoudeh, and the threats 
against her husband, Mr. Reza Khandan, may be related to her legitimate activities in 
defence of human rights. Further concern was expressed for Ms. Sotoudeh&#8217;s physical and 
psychological integrity while in detention.

of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding the 
imminent execution and solitary confinement of <b>Mr. Habibollah Latifi</b>. 
</p>
<p>493. This case has been previously addressed by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions in an urgent appeal to your Excellency&#8217;s Government 
dated 13 October 2009. In this communication, the Special Rapporteur has raised concern 
as to the compatibility of the imposition of the death penalty on the charge of <i>moharebeh 
</i>(enmity against God) with international standards and obligations endorsed by the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. The charge was believed to relate to Mr. Latifi&#8217;s membership of the PJAK 
(Free Life Party of Kurdistan), a forbidden armed group.The Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has also reiterated this concern in previous 
communications.  
</p>
<p>494. According to further information received, on 23 October 2007, Mr. Habibollah 
Latifi, a law student at Azad University, was reportedly arrested by security forces. 
Following his arrest, he was allegedly detained and interrogated by intelligence agents for 
more than four months prior to his transfer to Sanandaj prison. During the investigation 
process, he is also alleged of having been subjected to acts of torture.  </p>

<p>495. On 3 July 2008, the First Branch of the Sanandaj Revolutionary Court convicted and 
sentenced Mr. Habibollah Latifi to the death penalty on the charge of <i>moharebeh</i> and on 
other security-related crimes in connection with his membership of and activities on behalf 
of the Kurdish Independent Life Party (PJAK). It is also reported that the trial was held 
behind closed doors and that neither the accused&#8217;s lawyer nor his family were allowed to 
attend the trial. The Appeals Court in Sanandaj has subsequently confirmed this ruling but 
has allegedly upheld the death sentence on 18 February 2009.  
</p>
<p>496. On 16 January 2010, Mr. Habibollah Latifi was allegedly transferred to solitary 
confinement, prompting fears that the execution would be carried out.  
</p>
<p>497. It is now reported that the execution of Mr. Habibollah Latifi was scheduled on 26 
December 2010, at Sanandaj Prison, Kordestan, in western Iran, and that it has been since 
then halted. 
</p>
<p>498. On 26 December 2010, it is further alleged that members of Mr. Latifi&#8217;s family have 
been arrested, including his father, two sisters and his older brother, after their house was 
searched. It is reported that they have not been informed of the charge(s) on the basis of 
which they have been arrested. Concerns have been raised that their arrest may be linked 
with protests and calls to suspend the execution of Mr. Latifi. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>499. In a letter dated 15 February 2011, a response was received to the communication 
dated 30 December 2010. In connection with the conviction of Mr. Habibollah Latifi, the 
High Council of Human Rights of the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran has

destruction of the exhibition and injury to exhibition staff; (e) distribution of Pejak 
pamphlets, with the intent to foment public unrest in the coty of Sanandaj. 
</p>
<p>500. Mr. Latifi&#8217;s case was brought before Branch 1 of Sanandaj Court of Revolution. On

<p>503. On 31 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding the detention, solitary 
confinement, systematic ill-treatment and the imminent execution of <b>Mr. Saeed 
Malekpour</b>. 
</p>
<p>504. It has been brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteurs that from the day of 
his arrest, Mr. Saeed Malekpour, a Canadian permanent resident and web programmer and 
developer, was reportedly placed into solitary confinement for more than one year and was 
subjected to severe acts of torture which have seriously impacted his physical and mental 
health. He has allegedly been sentenced to death on the charges of &#8220;agitation against the 
regime&#8221; and &#8220;insulting the sanctity of Islam&#8221; and is at imminent risk of execution. 
</p>
<p>505. According to the information received, in October 2008, Mr. Saeed Malekpour was 
allegedly arrested by Iranian plain-clothes forces, without an arrest warrant, on the charges 
of internet-related offences. It is alleged that he was taken to an undisclosed location 
referred to as the &#8220;technical office&#8221;, that he was blindfolded and his head held down during 
the transport. 
</p>
<p>506. On the same night, he was reportedly transferred to Evin prison (Ward 2A, 2 Alef) 
and placed into solitary confinement in a cell measuring 2m x 1,7m where he remained 
from 4 October 2008 to 16 August 2009 (320 days). It is further reported that Mr. 
Malekpour was only allowed to leave the cell twice a day at specific times during which he 
was kept blindfolded. While detained in solitary confinement, Mr. Malekpour was 
reportedly not allowed to have contact with the outside world. 
</p>
<p>507. In the months following his arrest, Mr. Malekpour was allegedly interrogated day 
and night during long hours and was subjected to severe and harmful acts of torture. We 
have received information that he was interrogated and ill-treated in both, outside prison in 
the &#8220;technical office&#8221; as well as in the interrogation office of Ward 2A.  
</p>
<p>508. During the interrogation sessions, Mr. Malekpour has allegedly been severely beaten 
most of the time by a group, while blindfolded and handcuffed, including in the presence of 
the magistrate in charge of the case. In particular, we have received information on the 
following incidents: 
</p>
<p>509. In October 2008, it is alleged that the interrogators stripped Mr. Malekpour while 
blindfolded and that they threatened to rape him with a water bottle.  
</p>
<p>510. As a consequence of being severely beaten, lashed on his head and face with cables 
and administered a painful electric shock, his face was reportedly extremely swollen and 
Mr. Malekpour lost consciousness several times. That same night, after having been 
brought back to the cell, his ear was also bleeding. Mr. Malekpour banged on the door for 
help but no one came. The following day, as he allegedly could not move due to paralysis </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>97 
</b></p>
<p>of half of his body, he was brought to Evin Prison&#8217;s clinic. Upon examination of Mr. 
Malekpour&#8217;s injuries, the clinic&#8217;s doctor strongly recommended that he be taken to the 
hospital. However, he was reportedly transferred back to his cell and left alone until 9 p.m. 
</p>
<p>511. Eventually he was transferred to Baghiatollah Hospital, where he was reportedly 
forced to use the alias of Mohammad Saeedi or suffer further threats of torture, if the orders 
were not complied with. Prior to the examination of Mr. Malekpour, one of the guards met 
with the doctor on duty in the emergency room. In his diagnosis, the doctor alleged that the 
condition of Mr. Malekpour was stress-related without undertaking any further medical 
examination. It is reported that Mr. Malekpour was returned to the detention centre and that 
the left side of his body has been paralysed for 20 days. 
</p>
<p>512. On 24 January 2009, after being kicked in the face by one of the interrogators, Mr. 
Malekpour reportedly had one of his teeth broken and his jaw displaced. 
</p>
<p>513. Furthermore, Mr. Malekpour was reportedly forced to confess charges he did not 
commit under pressure, psychological acts of torture, threats to himself and his family and 
promises of his immediate release or a more lenient sentence of two years imprisonment 
upon confession. The confessions were allegedly recorded and have been continuously 
broadcasted on television by state media channels, despite the promise that they would not 
be made public. 
</p>
<p>514. Mr. Malekpour was reportedly compelled to confess that he was purchasing 
software from the United Kingdom, which he posted on his website for sale. He was further 
allegedly forced to confess that each time someone visited his website, a software was 
installed onto the person&#8217;s computer allowing control over the webcam, even when the 
computer was switched off. The interrogators have allegedly ignored Mr. Malekpour&#8217;s 
explanation that this was impossible from a technological standpoint. 
</p>
<p>515. The aforementioned acts of torture have been reportedly described in a detailed 
letter written by Mr. Malekpour. He allegedly stated that they were aimed at having him 
confess the charges in a written document and in front of the camera. He has also stated that 
the physical beatings against him were nothing compared to the psychological torture 
endured during more than one year spent in solitary confinement. Subsequently, he has 
been allegedly additionally charged with &#8220;propagating against the regime&#8221; for writing this 
letter. 
</p>
<p>516. On 16 August 2009, Mr. Malekpour was reportedly transferred to the general ward 
2A, but was denied visits from his family. From 21 December 2009 to 8 February 2010, he 
was placed again into solitary confinement with no contact with the outside world. 
</p>
<p>517. It is further reported that during the trial, Mr. Malekpour did not have regular access 
to legal representation. Nor was he provided with the technical tools or the intervention of 
IT technicians for his defence. 
</p>
<p>518. Between October 2008 and October 2010, sixteen complaints have allegedly been 
filed by Mr. Malekpour&#8217;s wife, Ms. Fatemeh Eftekhari and his family which have not been 
addressed by the authorities, except from the Head of Teheran&#8217;s Justice Department. In 
January 2009, the Head of the Justice Department reportedly sent his representatives to 2 
Alef section of Evin prison. However, in the absence of an authorization, they were not 
granted access to Mr. Malekpour. In October 2010, the Head of Teheran&#8217;s Justice 
Department allegedly sent an official letter to the judge in charge of the case. In this letter, 
he expressed the necessity to conduct investigation into Mr. Malekpour&#8217;s case by court-
trusted IT technicians and enjoined the judge not to issue a sentence during the 
investigation process. 
</p>
<p>519. On 4 December 2010, Mr. Saeed Malekpour was sentenced to death on the charges 
of &#8220;agitation against the regime&#8221; and &#8220;insulting the sanctity of Islam&#8221;. According to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>98</b>  
</p>
<p>presiding judge, the sentence was ordered by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. On the same 
day, Mr. Malekpour was reportedly placed in solitary confinement for refusing to sign off 
his death sentence. According to the latest information received, Mr. Malekpour still 
remains in solitary confinement and no official document confirming the death sentence has 
been transmitted to his lawyer. In this regard, concerns have been raised as to the possibility 
for the lawyer to appeal against the sentence within the delay of twenty days imposed by 
law.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>520. At the time this report was finalized, no response to this communication has been 
received.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>521. On 11 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>the pattern of 
executions, arrests and detentions carried out and which may be carried out.</b> This 
matter has been the subject of previous communications between the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and the mandates joining this appeal. Reports on recent executions 
prompt the Special Rapporteurs to again raise their concerns in this respect, which have not 
been alleviated by the replies received from the Government in response to previous 
communications. 
</p>
<p>522. The information received on particular cases of executions, arrests and detentions 
which have been brought to our attention is summarized in three parts: first, those relating 
to the persons&#8217; alleged membership of the People&#8217;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran; 
second, those relating to the December 2009 Ashura protests; and third, further cases of 
executions, arrests and detentions which have been reported to us. 
</p>
<p>523. The Special Rapporteur have received information on the following cases 
concerning the persons&#8217; alleged membership of the People&#8217;s Mojahedin Organization of 
Iran (PMOI): 
</p>
<p>524. On 28 December 2010, Mr. <b>Ali Saremi</b>, aged 63, was allegedly executed by hanging 
for enmity against God (<i>moharebeh</i>) and propagating against the regime in relation to his 
alleged membership of the PMOI. The trial reportedly took place in October 2008 before 
Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court and was upheld by the Appeals Court. It is also 
reported that Mr. Saremi had not received confirmation of the death sentence by the 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>525. According to the information received, the execution has been carried out without 
the presence of Mr. Saremi&#8217;s family or friends and the authorities had failed to inform his 
family of his execution. His body has reportedly been buried, over the weekend, at the 
Amir-Abad village in Boroujerd, nearly 400 km southwest of Tehran. It has been further 
alleged that Mr. Saremi&#8217;s body had not been handed over to his family who has been 
threatened and prevented from holding memorial services in his honour. 
</p>
<p>526. Since 1982, Mr. Saremi had reportedly been arrested five times and had spent 
23 years in detention. His latest arrest allegedly dates back to 2007 after visiting his son at 
Camp Ashraf, a refugee community in Iraq which is home to an estimated 3,500 exiled 
members of the PMOI. Mr. Saremi was arrested for his alleged presence at anti-
revolutionary gatherings organized by PMOI and for sending information to this group. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>99 
</b></p>
<p>527. It has been further reported that some members of Mr. Saremi&#8217;s family were arrested 
by the authorities for protesting against his pending execution. On the day of the execution, 
Mr. Saremi&#8217;s wife, Ms.<b> Mihan Saremi</b>, their daughter, <b>Pouya Saremi</b>, as well as family 
members of other detainees have allegedly been released following their arrest. According 
to the latest information received, Mr. Saremi&#8217;s nephew, Mr.<b> Mohammad Ali Saremi</b>, and 
Mr. Saremi&#8217;s brother, <b>Mohammad Reza Saremi</b>, are still being detained for having 
displayed a picture of Mr. Ali Saremi as a sign of mourning. 
</p>
<p>528. Concern was also raised on reported arrests and threats against Camp Ashraf 
residents&#8217; family members. We have been informed that Mr.<b> Jaafar Kazemi</b>, Mr.<b> Javad 
Lari</b> and Mr.<b> Mohammad Ali Haj-Aghaei</b> have allegedly been arrested, sentenced to 
death after they were all found guilty of enmity against God in relation to their alleged 
membership of PMOI, and that they are at imminent risk of execution. On 15 May 2010, 
Tehran&#8217;s prosecutor has reportedly announced that the death sentences of Mr. Jaafar 
Kazemi, Mr. Mohammad Ali Haj-Aghaei and that of Mr. Mohammad Ali Saremi were 
upheld by the Appeals Court. 
</p>
<p>529. On 18 September 2009, Mr. <b>Jaafar Kazemi</b>, aged 47, has reportedly been arrested 
for his alleged membership of PMOI in the 1980s and 1990s, and for his participation in 
protests which followed the June 2009 presidential election. Concern was expressed that he 
may have been subjected to torture during his interrogation and detention in Evin prison of 
Tehran in order to have him confess the charges on camera. He was sentenced to death for 
<i>moharebeh</i> and propagating against the regime. On 26 April 2010, he was allegedly 
informed that his death sentence had been confirmed by an appeals court. A further appeal 
has reportedly been rejected in July 2010. 
</p>
<p>530. Mr. <b>Mohammad Ali-Haj-Aghaei</b>, aged 62, was reportedly arrested and tried 
alongside Mr. Kazemi. It is alleged that he had also visited relatives in Camp Ashraf. In 
April 2010, he was allegedly sentenced to death. This sentence has been upheld by the 
Supreme Court in September 2010. 
</p>
<p>531. In August 2010, Mr. <b>Javad Lari</b>, a Tehran bazaar merchant aged 55, has been 
sentenced to &#8220;death without pardon&#8221; for enmity against God and corruption. According to 
the information received, he is detained at Evin Prison where he has allegedly been 
subjected to torture and forced confession. 
</p>
<p>532. In December 2009, a series of protests, commonly referred to as the Ashura protests, 
were held in order to commemorate the deaths which allegedly occurred following the 
outcome of the June 2009 presidential election. In this context, we have received 
information on the following cases: 
</p>
<p>533. Two days following the Ashura protests, Ms.<b> Farah (also known as Elmira) 
Vazehan,</b> aged 48, was reportedly arrested and sentenced to death for enmity against God. 
In August 2010, she had allegedly been convicted for her participation in the protests &#8211; 
including for taking photographs and sending them abroad and for supporting the PMOI &#8211; 
and has been sentenced to death. 
</p>
<p>534. Mr. <b>Abdolreza Ghanbari</b>, a teacher aged 42, and father and son Mr.<b> Ahmad 
Daneshpour Moqhaddam</b> and<b> Mohsen Daneshpour Moqhaddam</b>, have allegedly also 
been arrested following the December 2009 protests and sentenced to death in January and 
February 2010, respectively. Due process concerns were raised with regard to the conduct 
of the trials. 
</p>
<p>535. On 15 May 2010, Tehran&#8217;s prosecutor has reportedly announced that the death 
sentences of these three aforementioned persons were upheld by the Appeal Court after 
they were all found guilty of enmity against God in relation to participation in the Arusha 
protests and in relation to their alleged membership of PMOI. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>100</b>  
</p>
<p>536. On 27 December 2009, Ms. <b>Zahra Bahrami</b>, an Iranian-Dutch citizen, had also 
been arrested in the context of the aforementioned events. According to her lawyer, her 
case was investigated on the basis of two types of charges: first, on the charges of 
<i>moharebeh</i>, propaganda against the regime and membership in a proscribed organization; 
and second, on the charge of drug possession. She has been sentenced to death on the latter 
charge. It has been further alleged that the Dutch authorities have been informed of her 
arrest, only six months thereafter. 
</p>
<p>537. On 17 December 2010, it is reported that Ms. <b>Hakimeh Shokri</b>, Ms. <b>Neda 
Mostaghimi</b> and Mr. <b>Mehdi Ramezani</b> have been arrested and detained for having 
gathered to commemorate the killing of Mr. Amir Arshad Tajmir. Mr. Tajmir was allegedly 
run over by a security forces vehicle on 29 December 2009 during the Ashura 
commemorative event. 
</p>
<p>538. On 29 December 2010, the authorities prevented assemblies marking the deaths that 
occurred a year earlier, in 2009. In this context, it is alleged that family members of 
detainees have been held in detention. Among these persons are Mr. <b>Mohammad 
Nourizad</b>, a journalist and filmmaker, now on hunger strike, Ms. <b>Fakhrosadat 
Mohtashamipour</b>, the wife of another detainee, and Mr. <b>Mostafa Tajzadeh</b>, whose case 
was previously addressed in a communication dated 10 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>539. Furthermore, we have received information on the following cases of arrests, 
detentions and executions: 
</p>
<p>540. On 28 December 2010, Mr. <b>Ali Akbar Siadat</b> was reportedly executed by hanging 
on the charges of undertaking espionage for Israel and corruption in Tehran&#8217;s Evin Prison. 
He was allegedly sentenced to death by the 10th branch of the Revolutionary Court. His 
death sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court following a trial during which he 
reportedly did not have access to legal representation. 
</p>
<p>541. He was allegedly arrested in 2008, when attempting to leave the country with his 
wife. In the first months following his arrest, he reportedly was unaware of his place of 
detention and did not have contact with his family. He was also allegedly forced to accept 
the charges against him and confess them on camera under physical and mental pressure. 
</p>
<p>542. On 31 July 2008, Mr. <b>Hossein Khezri</b>, aged 28, was reportedly arrested in 
Kermanshah. On 11 July 2009, he was allegedly convicted for <i>moharebeh</i> and endangering 
state security, and sentenced to death.  
</p>
<p>543. His death sentence was reportedly upheld by the 10th branch of the Court of 
Appeals on 8 August 2009 and confirmed by the 31st branch of the Supreme Court 
following a trial during which he was not given adequate time to prepare his defence. 
According to the latest information received, he faces imminent risk of execution. 
</p>
<p>544. This case was addressed in two previous communications dated 25 November 2010 
and 23 April 2010. Mr. Khezri was allegedly arrested by the Nabi Akram Sepah branch on 
31 July 2008. During his detention, Mr. Khezri was reportedly subjected to torture, leading 
to the partial loss of his eyesight. It is further reported that he had been beaten several hours 
a day under psychological pressure and intimidation in Kermanshah detention center. The 
beatings have reportedly lead to severe bleeding and swelling of his genitalia for 14 days, to 
an 8 cm open wound to his right leg as well as to bruises and inflammation of several parts 
of his body due to 49 days of beating with night sticks. His request for an investigation of 
the allegations of torture was denied in March 2010. 
</p>
<p>545. Since then, he has reportedly been transferred several times to other detention 
facilities, where he was allegedly subjected to further acts of torture. Since the 
18 September 2008, Mr. Khezri has been transferred to Sepah Al Mehdi prison in 
Orumiyeh, to the Western Azerbaijan&#8217;s Information Ministry headquarter on 15 February </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>101 
</b></p>
<p>2009, to Qazvin prison, 200 miles from Orumiyeh, and back to Orumiyeh prison on 11 May 
2009. 
</p>
<p>546. In total, Mr. Khezri has allegedly spent 8 months in solitary confinement. It is 
further reported that Mr. Khezri has filed a complaint against his ill-treatment and was 
subsequently threatened for having submitted it. Concerns have also been raised as to the 
impact of his treatment and detention on his mental health. It is alleged that he has tried on 
two occasions to kill himself. 
</p>
<p>547. c) On 27 December 2010, Mr. <b>Reza Sharifi Bukani</b> was allegedly transferred from 
Cellblock 4 at Rajayi Shahr (Gohardasht) Prison in Karaj to an undisclosed location at 
around 10:00 h. Since then, there is no news on his condition and whereabouts. He has 
reportedly been sentenced to death for endangering state security and for his alleged 
cooperation with Kurd political parties. In addition, he was charged on 26 December 2010, 
for the bombing of the Amir Mosque before the Shahriar Revolutionary Court without the 
presence of his lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>548. A response to the communication dated 11 January 2011 was received on 4 February 
2011. In connection with the conviction of Ms. Zahra Bahrami, the High Council of Human 
Rights of the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran has approached all pertinent judicial 
authorities and courts. According to reports, Ms. Bahrami was charged with membership in 
the illegal &#8220;Monarchial Society&#8221;, participation in last year&#8217;s riots and incidents which 
followed Iran&#8217;s presidential elections, possession of 450 grams of cocaine, 420 grams of 
opium and the selling of 155 grams of cocaine. Ms. Bahrami was arrested on a temporary 
warrant and sent to prison on 31 December 2009. Considering the many charges laid 
against Ms. Bahrami, by Branches 15 and 26 of Tehran Court of Revolution, her dossier 
was thoroughly investigated. On charges of possession and selling of drugs and the charge 
of <i>Moharebeh</i> (enmity with God); Branch 15 of the Islamic Court of Revolution, on the 
basis of para. 6 of article 8 and para. 2 of article 5 of the law on illicit drugs and the explicit 
confessions of the accused &#8211; defense was provided by her lawyer, Ms. Zhinous Sharif Razi 
&#8211; sentenced Ms. Bahrami to be executed, her property to be confiscated and the payment of 
14 million Rials in fines.  
</p>
<p>549. In connection with the conviction of Mr. Hussein Khezri Khanik, the High Council 
of Human Rights of the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran has approached all 
pertinent judicial authorities and courts. According to information received from the Justice 
Department of Western Azerbaijan Province, Mr. Hussein Khezri Khanik, son of Ali, born 
in 1982 was arrested on charges of membership in the military wing og Pejaj, a terror 
group, and involvement in the slaying of two police officers and the injury of an additional 
four officers. After the completion of the trial and the relevant legal procedures and 
presentations of his defense lawyers &#8211; Mr. Ehsan Mottavi &#8211; the accused was found guilty 
by Branch 1of Uromieh Court of Islamic Revolution through verdict No. 167 dated 21 June 
2003 on the basis of articles 186, 189 and 190 of the Islamic Code and was sentenced to 
death for membership in Pejack terror group and <i>Moharebe</i> (enmity with God). 
</p>
<p>550. The sentence was contested and appealed by Mr. Khezri&#8217;s attorney. Subsequently 
Western Azerbaijan Appellate Court reconsidered the case, however, on the basis of para. 
A of article 257 of the Penal Code, the court upheld the previous court&#8217;s decision (verdict 
No. 8809974414400839 dated 8 August 2009). Additionally, the case as brought before 
Western Azerbaijan&#8217;s Amnesty Commission as well as referral to the judiciary&#8217;s Central 
Amnesty Commission. 
</p>
<p>551. The verdict was carried out on 15 January 2011. All allegations otherwise including 
lack of access to legal counsel or the maltreatment of the convict are false and baseless. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>102</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>552. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran of 
the response to the communication which provides information on the individual cases of 
Ms. Zahra Bahraimi and Mr. Hussein Khezri. However, the Special Rapporteur deplores 
the information indicating that the death sentence of Mr. Khezri has been carried out 
despite several Special Rapporteurs, including the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers had urged the Government to suspend the death sentence of the 
persons mentioned in the urgent appeal above, until the question whether the acts they have 
been found guilty of satisfy international critera for what constitutes the &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221; has been clarified and that the allegations of torture have been throroughly 
investigated and all doubts in this respect dispelled.  
</p>
<p>553. Concerning the information provided on the case of Ms. Zahra Bahraimi, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that carrying out the death sentence on the basis of charges which do 
not constitute &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; according to international law would be unlawful and 
therefore calls for a commutation of the sentence. 
</p>
<p>554. In addition, the Special Rapporteur regrets that no information was provided on the 
cases of Mr. Ali Saremi, his wife Ms. Mihan Saremi, and their daughter, Pouya Saremi, Mr. 
Mohammad Ali Saremi, Mohammad Reza Saremi, Mr. Javad Lari, Mr. Mohammad Ali 
Haj-Aghaei, Mr. Jaafar Kazemi, Mr. Mohammad Ali-Haj-Aghaei, Mr. Javad Lari, Ms. 
Farah (also known as Elmira) Vazehan, Mr. Abdolreza Ghanbari, father and son Mr. 
Ahmad Daneshpour Moqhaddam and Mohsen Daneshpour Moqhaddam, Ms. Hakimeh 
Shokri, Ms. Neda Mostaghimi, Mr. Mehdi Ramezani, Mr. Mohammad Nourizad, Ms. 
Fakhrosadat Mohtashamipour, Mr. Mostafa Tajzadeh, Mr. Ali Akbar Siadat, and Mr. Reza 
Sharifi Bukani, as requested in the communication. Given the seriousness of their situation, 
she urges the Government to provide information in relation to these cases at the earliest 
possible date. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>555. On 11 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; and Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning the imposition of the death penalty upon <b>Ms. Fatemeh Salbehi</b> and <b>Mr. Ehsan</b> 
<b>Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8217;ie</b>, who were reportedly both juveniles at the time the alleged 
criminal offences were committed. 
</p>
<p>556. According to the information received, Ms. Fatemeh Salbehi, currently aged 19, is at 
imminent risk of execution for having allegedly murdered her husband three years ago, 
when she was 16 years old. In May 2008, her husband, Mr. Hamed Sadeghi, an employee 
of the Public Relations Office at the local judiciary, was reportedly found dead in their 
home in Shiraz when she was at school.  
</p>
<p>557. Fatemeh Salbehi was allegedly arrested and interrogated without the presence of a 
lawyer. It is further alleged that she first confessed to the murder, but then stated that two 
persons broke into her home and killed her husband. Fatemeh Salbehi was allegedly 
convicted of murder by Branch Five of the Fars Criminal Court and sentenced to death. 
This sentence has reportedly been upheld by the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>558. In 2007, Mr. Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8217;ie, now aged 19, and two other men were arrested 
on suspicion of having committed sodomy rape when Mr. Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8217;ie was 17 
years old. After interrogation the two other accused persons denied the accusations and 
were subsequently released. However, it is alleged that Mr. Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8217;ie was 
beaten, blackmailed and forced to confess. He was later charged with the offence of &#8220;<i>lavat 
be onf</i>&#8221;, <i>i.e</i> consummated sexual activity between males, whether penetrative or non-</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>penetrative, under article 108 of the Iranian penal code. We are informed that under Iranian 
law <i>lavat</i> includes both consensual and forcible sodomy between men.  
</p>
<p>559. Prior to the trial, the complainant allegedly withdrew his allegation of rape. 
Nonetheless, officials decided to proceed with the trial on the basis of &#8220;<i>hudud</i>&#8221; <i>i.e.</i> public 
nature of the crime. 
</p>
<p>560. The Special Rapporteurs are informed that during the trial, Mr. Rangraz 
Tabaatabaa&#8217;ie pleaded not guilty, did not have access to a lawyer and informed the court 
that his confession had been obtained under torture. However, the court proceeded to use 
his confession as a basis for the ruling. We are informed that this is contrary to article 38 of 
the constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran, which stipulates that &#8220;All forms of torture for 
the purpose of extracting confession or acquiring information are forbidden. Compulsion of 
individuals to testify, confess, or take an oath is not permissible; and any testimony, 
confession, or oath obtained under duress is devoid of value and credence.&#8221; Additionally, 
article 116 of the Islamic Penal Code states that &#8220;The confession of [sodomy] is only 
admissible if the person who confesses is &#8230; under no pressure, and is willing to testify.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>561. Furthermore, according to articles 114 and 115 of the Islamic Penal Code, in order 
to prove the act of <i>lavat</i> based on the confession, &#8220;the confession should be made four times 
in front of the judge&#8221; If the confession is made less than four times, the confession is not 
admissible. In the case of Mr. Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8217;ie, this was allegedly not complied with 
and there was no evidence offered to substantiate the allegation. 
</p>
<p>562. Following the trial, Mr. Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8217;ie was convicted of sodomy rape and 
sentenced to death by a five-member panel of judges at the Fourth Branch of the Criminal 
Court in Fars Province, Shiraz. On appeal, the case was heard by the Thirteenth Branch of 
the Iranian Supreme Court in Tehran, which upheld the decision of the lower court. 
Currently, Mr. Rangraz Tabaatabaa&#8217;ie is reportedly being held at the Adel Abaad Prison in 
Shiraz while awaiting execution. The source has also indicated that it is not clear whether 
the Head of the Judiciary has approved the execution.

<p>564. On 18 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment concerning the situation of <b>Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani</b>, a prominent human 
rights lawyer and founding member of the non-governmental organization Defenders of 
Human Rights Centre. Mr Soltani was the subject of several urgent appeals and letters of 
allegations sent on 4 August 2005, 14 December 2005, 31 March 2006, 8 August 2006, 11 
August 2006, 15 November 2007 and 12 November 2008. 
</p>
<p>565. According to the information received, on 16 June 2009, a group of plainclothes 
agents reportedly arrested Mr. Soltani in front of his home, and took him to an undisclosed 
location. The whereabouts of Mr Soltani are currently unknown. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>104</b>  
</p>
<p>566. Serious concern is expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr Soltani may be 
linked to his peaceful human rights activities in defence of human rights, and may form part 
of a current pattern of harassment against human rights defenders. In view of his 
incommunicado detention, further concern is expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity. 
</p>
<p>567. On 16 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  
regarding <b>Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani</b>, a lawyer at the Bar Association of Tehran, a founding 
member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC) and a long-standing Iranian 
human rights defender.  
</p>
<p>568. Following our joint urgent appeal of 18 June 2009, we have now received new 
information concerning the detention of Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani. Mr. Soltani was 
reportedly arrested on 16 June 2009 in front of his home in Tehran by four security service 
agents in plainclothes, who handcuffed him and brought him with them. His whereabouts 
were not communicated to his relatives until 9 July 2009, when they were informed that 
Mr. Soltani was being held in Section 209 of Evin prison in Tehran. Section 209 is 
reportedly a part of the prison run by the Ministry of Intelligence, where political prisoners 
are detained. 
</p>
<p>569. No charges have been brought against Mr. Soltani so far. He has not been presented 
before a judge.  
</p>
<p>570. It was further alleged that Mr. Soltani, who has already been detained and repressed 
on several occasions in the past, is being kept in detention merely in order to prevent him 
from carrying out his human rights activities, which he is fully entitled to develop 
according to the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, adopted on 9 December 1998 by 
the United Nations General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>571. Fears have been expressed for Mr. Soltani's physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>572. In a letter dated 6 May 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
dated 18 June 2009 as follows. Mr. Abdolfatah Soltani has had several police/court records 
with respect to arrestable offences including acting against the national security, revealing 
of classified information relating to his clients to foreign elements and propaganda against 
the Islamic Republic. He has been tried in the court under some of those charges. He was 
found guilty on a number of charges and was exonerated on some. He was arrested again on 
16 June 2009 after the unrest following the presidential election on the basis of 
corroborative eveidence. He served his sentence similar to other prisoners, benefiting from 
health services and he was able to contact his relatives and defense attorney. His case was 
tried in the court on the aforementioned charges. He was released on 26 August 2009 on 
bail. His case is no the court docket for trail. The allegations in the letter of the Special 
Rapporteurs are incorrect and baseless. 
</p>
<p>573. By letter dated 7 October 2010, the Government provided the following information 
in relation to the same case in response to both communications sent respectively on 18 
June and 16 July 2009. Mr. Abdolfatah Soltani has numerous criminal records for offences 
such as acting against national security, disclosing classified information of his clients to 
foreign elements, waging propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran. He was 
convicted to prison sentence on some charges and acquitted on others. He was arrested on 
26/3/1388 again after the unrest following the election. There was corroborative evidence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

<p> <b>105 
</b></p>
<p>proving his involvement in provoking unrest and sabotage. During his incarceration, he 
enjoyed proper health care like other prisoners, and was able to contact his lawyer and 
members of his family. His case was tried by court and he was freed on bail on 4/6/1388. 
His case is pending for trial and the claims stated in the letter of the rapporteurs are untrue 
and hereby rejected. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and abservations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>574. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the responses provided to the 
urgent appeals dated 18 June and 16 July 2009. While bearing in mind that Mr. Soltani has 
been in total the subject of nine communications by special procedures, she notes that the 
allegations have been denied by the Government. Nonetheless, she welcomes the 
information indicating that he was able to contact his lawyers and members of his family 
and most importantly, that she was freed on bail on 4 June 2009 (1388). 
</p>
<p>575. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the need to guarantee the right of lawyers 
to freely represent their clients and perform their professional activity without fear, 
intimidation and interference. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur would like to stress 
once again the importance for Governments to respect and take into account the Basic 
Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted in Havana, Cuba, by the Eighth United Nations 
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, from 27 August to 7 
September 1990, aimed at assisting Member States to protect and ensure the proper role of 
lawyers.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>576. On 16 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment regarding Mr Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, Ms Sara Sabaghian, Ms Bahareh 
Davallou, Mr Amir Raisian and Ms Maliheh Dadkhah. Mr Dadkhah is a lawyer and 
founding member of the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC). Ms Sabaghian, Ms 
Davallou and Mr Raisian are also lawyers.  
</p>
<p>577. According to the information received, on 8 July 2009, at approximately 4.00 p.m., 
three individuals in civilian clothing, entered the law firm of Mr Dadkhah, without 
presenting an arrest warrant, and arrested Mr Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, along with other 
lawyers, Ms Sara Sabaghian, Ms Bahareh Davallou and Mr Amir Raisian. The daughter of 
Mr Dadkhah, Ms Malileh Dadkhah was also arrested. The law firm was subsequently 
closed. 
</p>
<p>578. The whereabouts of Mr Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, Ms Sara Sabaghian, Ms Bahareh 
Davallou, Mr Amir Raisian and Ms Maliheh Dadkhah are currently unknown.  
</p>
<p>579. Concern is expressed that the arrest and incommunicado detention of Mr 
Mohammad Ali Dadkhah, Ms Sara Sabaghian, Ms Bahareh Davallou, Mr Amir Raisian and 
Ms Maliheh Dadkhah may be related to their work in the defence of human rights, in 
particular Mr Dadkhah&#8217;s criticism of the use of the death penalty and the execution of 
several persons on 3 July 2009 on drug trafficking charges. Serious concern is expressed 
regarding their physical and psychological integrity in light of their incommunicado 
detention. Further concern is expressed given that Mr Mohammad Ali Dadkhah is the third 
member of the DHRC currently in detention, along with Mr Abdolfattah Soltani and Ms 
Mohammad Reza Tajik. </p>

<p>580. In a letter dated 7 October 2010, the Government responded to the urgent appeal 
sent on 16 July 2009 as follows. Mr. Mohammad Ali Dadkhah was arrested on the charges 
of possession of a quantity of narcotics and one unauthorized gun at his law office. He was 
freed later on bail and his case is currently being reviewed by the court. Moreover, Ms Sara 
Sabaghian and Ms Bahareh Davaloo were taken to the nearest police station because of 
their presence in his office and were freed after a few hours. The claim concerning the 
arrest of Malileh Dadkhah and Mr. Reesain [Raisian] is not true. They were never arrested. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and abservations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>581. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for providing information on the 
fate and whereabouts of the five persons subjects of the urgent appeal dated 16 July 2009. 
She welcomes the information stating that the above mentioned persons have been released 
from custody or have not been arrested, noting that the allegations that Ms. Dadkhah and 
Mr. Raisian were arrested have been denied. Nevertheless, she regrets the lack of 
substantive information on the accuracy of the allegations and concerns raised in the 
communication, on any complaints they may have lodged and the way they have been 
addressed; and on any investigations or inquiries carried out in relation to these cases.  
</p>

<p>582. On 29 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
regarding the reportedly imminent execution of seven men belonging to the Ahwazi Arab 
community in Iran. Their names are Messrs. Ali Saedi, aged 25, Walid Naisi, aged 23, 
Majid Fardipour (name in Arabic: Majid Mahawi), aged 26, Doayr Mahawi, aged 50, 
Maher Mahawi, aged 21, Ahmad Saedi, aged 28, and Yousuf Leftehpour, aged 25.  
</p>
<p>583. According to information received, the seven men were arrested on or around 12 
August 2007. They were held in incommunicado detention at an unknown location by 
intelligence services between three to fifteen months. It is feared that during this period 
they may have been tortured in order to extract confessions from them. The accused were 
later transferred to Karoun Prison in Ahvaz city, where it is reported they are currently 
being held.  
</p>
<p>584. On or around 30 September 2009, they were tried, convicted and sentenced to death 
by a branch of the Revolutionary Court in Ahvaz for the offences of &#8220;acting against 
national security&#8221; and the killing of a Shi&#8217;a cleric, Sheikh Hesam al-Sameyri in June 2007. 
The seven men did not have access to counsel either before or during the trial.

<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur

<p>593. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its replies to the urgent appeal 
dated 29 October 2009. The Special Rapporteur notes that Messrs. Yousef Laftehpour, 
Damir Mahavi, Ahmad Savaedi, Maher Mahavi, Valid Nisi, Majed Fowadi were sentenced 
to five years&#8217; imprisonment, and not to death, while Mr. Ali Savaed was sentenced to death, 
as stated in the communication and had his sentence upheld by the appellate court [the 
spelling of the names as contained in the response differs from the one provided by the 
source]. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur would appreciate receiving updated 
information on any appeal trials or trials before the Supreme court. 
</p>
<p>594. She regrets, however, the absence of detailed information on a number of issues 
raised in the urgent appeal, notably on any investigations carried out in relation to the 
allegation according to which the persons named above were subjected to torture while in 
incommunicado detention.  </p>

<p>595. While she notes that all the defendants had a lawyer to represent them, she regrets 
that no details were provided on the question of whether and at what stage of the 
proceedings, the defendants had access to counsel and whether they were given the option 
of choosing their own counsel. She calls on the State to provide a response to the 
outstanding issues. In this regard, she wishes to stress the importance of allowing all 
defendants to have access to legal representation as stated in the article 14(3)(d) of the 
International Covenant in Civil and Political Rights and at all stages of judicial proceedings 
in accordance with para. 1 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted in 
Havana, Cuba, by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the 
Treatment of Offenders, from 27 August to 7 September 1990. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>596. On 27 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences regarding a 
woman and a man who have been sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, Ms. Sareimeh 
Ebadi, aged 30, mother of two children, and Mr. Bu-Ali Janfeshani, aged 32, father of one.  
</p>
<p>597. According to the information received, a criminal court in Oroomiyeh, West 
Azerbeijan Province, sentenced Sareimeh Ebadi and Bu-Ali Janfeshani to death on charges 
of adultery. The death sentence followed a trial in which they were allegedly denied the 
right to select their own defense attorneys.  
</p>
<p>598. On 6 January 2010 (or 8 January, according to other reports received), Branch 12 of 
the West Azerbeijan Court of Appeals upheld the death sentence. Both defendants are held 
in Oroomiyeh central prison. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>599. By letter dated 7 October 2010, the Government responded to the aforementioned 
urgent appeal as follows. Islamic law aims to ensure the stability of society from its very 
base &#8211; the family &#8211; which is the &#8216;nucleus&#8217; of society that breeds society&#8217;s values and holds 
together the various institutions in the society. The heavy penalty of stoning is stipulated in 
Islam in order to serve as a strong deterrent and is used to achieve this noble goal. 
However, Islam has set very difficult conditions in proving these types of serious offenses. 
The purpose behind the difficulty in proving the guilt in such offenses is to reduce to 
minimum the probability of error in judgements. The penalty is applied only after it is 
proved that the public conscience has been harmed and upon the testimony of many 
witnesses. Therefore, although the punishment is very harsh and severe, the evidence 
required to proof is also extremely complicated. The purpose of Islam for such harsh rules 
is to have a mechanism for deterrence and to prevent the recurrence of such crimes in the 
society. There are practically a lot less family betrayals in Islamic societies than in secular 
Western societies. 
</p>
<p>600. Islamic religious scholars believe that the punishment of stoning is totally different 
from execution and the two are not comparable. However, with respect to the accusation of 
adultery against Ms. Sarimeh Ebadi, she was tried in a court in the city of Orumieh, but 
because of the importance of the case, it should be heard by a provincial court in 
accordance with article 4 of the law relating to the reform of general courts adopted in 
2002. The case is presently under review by the provincial criminal court of West 
Azerbaijan in Branch 5. No ruling has yet been issued on this case. </p>

<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p>601. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response to the urgent appeal 
dated 27 January 2010. However, she remains deeply concerned about the harsh sentence 
imposed upon Ms. Sareimeh Ebadi and Mr. Bu-Ali Janfeshani. In countries which have not 
abolished the death penalty, such sentence may only be imposed for the most serious crimes 
according to article 6(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which Iran is a party. Already in 1993, the Human Rights Committee noted in its 
concluding observations on the period report submitted by the Islamic Republic of Iran that 
the imposition of the death penalty for adultery is incompatible with the Covenant and thus 
with Iran&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law. This has also been 
acknowledged in the General Assembly resolution 65/226 adopted on 21 December 2010, 
which calls upon the State to abolish the use of stoning (para. 4(d)). 
</p>
<p>602. In respect of the questions raised in the communication, the Special Rapporteur 
further regrets the lack of information provided on disaggregated statistics concerning the 
number of persons, men and women, sentenced to death in the past three years for the 
offence of adultery, as she remains concerned at the reported imbalance between the 
number of women and men sentenced to death on charges of adultery (<i>c.f. </i>previous 
communication sent on 30 July 2008). To address such discrimination in the administration 
of justice, the Special Rapporteur wishes to refer to the recommendations formulated in the 
Annual Report to the Human Rights Committee, in particular to those relating to the 
development of a gender-sensitive judiciary (A/HRC/17/30, paras. 91-93). 
</p>
<p>603. She finally urges the Government to provide updated information on the trials and 
sentencing of Ms. Sareimeh Ebadi and Mr. Bu-Ali Janfeshani. In the event they have been 
sentenced to the death penalty, she calls upon the Government to commute their sentence. 
</p>
<p><b>  Concluding comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p>604. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the responses of the Government to four 
communications sent during the reporting period and encourages the Government to 
provide information on the outstanding issues raised in these communications as mentioned 
in the comments above. However, she regrets that ten of the fifteen communications 
remained unanswered at the time the present report was finalized. She considers response to 
her communications as an important part of the cooperation of Governments with her 
mandate, and calls upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to transmit 
responses to the outstanding communications at the earliest possible date. Considering the 
irreversible nature of the death penalty, she urges the Government to provide updated 
information on the situation of those sentenced to death as requested in the communications 
summarized above.  
</p>
<p>605. While she welcomes the responses provided by the Government to five 
communications (out of the ten unanswered communications) sent during the reporting 
period covered in last year&#8217;s report by letter dated 7 October 2010, she regrets the absence 
of substantive information in relation to these cases. She calls on the Government to 
address the outstanding concerns raised therein and wishes to underline the importance of 
replying within a reasonable deadline, in particular when the communications concerns 
time sensitive cases which may have irreversible consequences for the persons subjects of 
the appeals. 
</p>
<p>606. She remains extremely concerned at the high number of alleged human rights 
violations, many of which fall within the scope of her mandate. This has for instance been 
recently noted in the resolution of the General Assembly 65/226, adopted on 21 December 
2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>110</b>  
</p>
<p>607. The Special Rapporteur is in particular concerned at the number of executions 
allegedly carried out and the high number of people sentenced to death following trials 
which often fall short of fair trial guarantees and due process of law. In addition, according 
to numerous reports, a large number of people seem to be sentenced to death on charges 
which do not qualify as &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; under international human rights law. These 
worrying issues prompted the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to issue a press release on 2 February 2011, 
in which the two experts called for a moratorium on the death penalty. The press release is 
summarized under section IV. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that in all 
cases, and notably in capital punishment cases, there is an obligation to provide criminal 
defendants with &#8220;a fair and public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal&#8221; 
according to article 14(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a State party. In this regard, the aforementioned 
General Assembly resolution 65/226, which enjoys the support of the Special Rapporteur, 
calls upon the Government to abolish, in law and practice, public executions and other 
excutions carried out in the absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards 
(para. 4(b)). 
</p>
<p>608. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur notes a number of consistent allegations which 
indicate a pattern of acts of threats to lawyers, intimidation, interference in the discharge of 
their professional duties and lawsuits against lawyers. In this regard, she wishes to reiterate 
the importance to guarantee the right of lawyers to freely represent their clients and perform 
their professional activity without fear, intimidation and interference. In this respect, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to stress once again the importance for Governments to 
respect and take into account the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted in 
Havana, Cuba, by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the 
Treatment of Offenders, from 27 August to 7 September 1990, aimed at assisting Member 
States to protect and ensure the proper role of lawyers. 
</p>
<p>609. In view of the number of allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and despite the 
Islamic Republic of Iran has not ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Special Rapporteur wishes to refer to 
Human Rights Council resolution 8/8, adopted in June 2008, which urges States &#8220;to take 
persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially examined 
by the competent national authority, to hold persons who encourage, order, tolerate or 
perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely 
punished&#8221; (para. 6(b)) and also para. 2 of General Comment No. 20 of the Human Rights 
Committee, which provides that complaints must be investigated promptly and impartially 
by competent authorities.  
</p>
<p>610. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that human rights violations should not 
remain unpunished. In a report to the General Assembly dated 10 August 2010, she has 
formulated a number of recommentations to address impunity and wishes to refer to these 
(A/65/274, paras. 80-95) as well as to the Updated set of principles for the protection and 
promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1). 
According to the Human Rights Committee, failure by a State party to investigate 
allegations of human rights violations or to bring the perpetrators to justice could in and of 
itself give rise to a separate breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, paras. 15 and 18). 
</p>
<p>611. In this context, she welcomes the adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 16/9 
in which it decided to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Nevertheless, she also wishes to remind the Government of her </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>111 
</b></p>
<p>request to visit the country. She hopes that the Government will consider this request 
favourably in the near future.

<p>612. On 26 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 and Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent 
an urgent appeal concerning  the detention and interrogation of 13 Palestinian minors at Al 
Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre, notably A.S., male, 16 years old, from a village 
near Qalqiliya, West Bank; M.A., male, 16 years old, from Bethlehem, West Bank; S.K, 
male, 16 years old, from a village near Tulkarm, West Bank; A.A, male, 16 years old, from 
Nablus, West Bank; A. &#8216;A, male, 16 years old, from Nablus, West Bank; M.S., male, 17 
years old, from Nablus, West Bank; A.S., male, 17 years old, from a village near Qalqiliya, 
West Bank; M.Z., male, 17 years old, from a village near Qalqiliya, West Bank; M.S, male, 
16 years old, from a village near Salfit, West Bank; T.K, male, 17 years old, from Nablus, 
West Bank; M.R&#8217;, male, 17 years old, from Hajja village, near Qalqiliya, West Bank; U.M., 
male, 17 years old, from a  village near Qalqiliya, West Bank and M. A, male, 16 years old, 
from Tulkarm Refugee Camp, West Bank. 
</p>
<p>613. The above-mentioned 13 individuals were removed from their homes in the 
occupied Palestinian territory and taken to Al Jalame, which is an interrogation and 
detention centre located in northern Israel, near the city of Haifa. Reports indicate that cell 
no. 36 of Al Jalame is used to hold minors in solitary confinement in order to extract 
confessions. Minors held at Al Jalame for interrogation are denied access to a lawyer and 
do not receive family visits. 
</p>
<p>614. On 10 February 2008, A.S. was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his family home 
around 7:00 a.m. He was blindfolded and his hands were tied behind his back with plastic 
ties. A.S. was transferred to an Israeli military base at Soufin, near Qalqiliya where he was 
examined by a doctor. Reports indicate that A.S. was beaten by soldiers at the military base. 
Later on the same day, A.S was transferred to Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre 
and then to Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. There, he was allegedly put in a 
very small cell for the following 15 days. Information received suggests that A.S. had been 
interrogated for three days. For an entire day, his hands and feet were tied to the wall in the 
shape of a cross which caused severe pain and the swelling of his hands. He had to urinate 
in the cell. Subsequently, A.S. was transferred to Damoun prison. Abed Saleem was 
released from detention on 10 December 2009. 
</p>
<p>615. On 25 February 2008, M.A. was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his family home 
around 2:00 a.m.  He was blindfolded and his hands were tied behind his back with plastic 
ties before he was placed on the floor of a jeep for transfer. M.A. was first taken to a 
military checkpoint at Etzion Junction, in the West Bank. M.A. was reportedly slapped and 
kicked by a soldier for around five minutes at the checkpoint. M.A. was later transferred to 
Etzion Interrogation and Detention Centre and Ofer prison, in the West Bank, where he had 
been interrogated for eight days. Subsequently, he was transferred to Al Jalame 
Interrogation and Detention Centre, where he was detained for 25 days in total. During the 
first five days, he was put in a cell by himself. Afterwards, he was interrogated and was 
made to sit on a metal chair which was tied to the floor and his hands were tied behind his 
back. The interrogator, who introduced himself as &#8220;Chris&#8221;, told him that there were people 
who had confessed against him. During the interrogation, which lasted about one hour, the 
interrogator was shouting in M.A.&#8217;s face to make him confess, but he refused to. On the 
18th day of his detention, he was again interrogated.  After the interrogator threatened M.A. </p>

<p>that his mother and siblings would be arrested, he confessed of throwing stones and 
Molotov cocktails. After he had confessed, they took him out of the cell and put him in a 
normal cell. After his confession, M.A. was transferred to Telmond Prison, near Tel Aviv.

<p>616. On 10 March 2008, S. K. was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his family home 
around 3:00 a.m. He was blindfolded and his hands were tied behind his back with plastic 
ties. He was then placed in a jeep for transfer to Salem Interrogation and Detention Centre 
and subsequently to Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. S. K was put in a cell 
with another child, in which he stayed for 14 days. The cell was very small for two persons 
and had dim yellow lights and two holes in the ceiling for ventilation. The walls were grey 
and rough so that one could not lean back against them.  It was very hot inside the cell. The 
food, which was insufficient for two persons, was slipped through a small hole in the door. 
After two weeks, two additional persons were brought into the cell, which enhanced the 
overcrowding in the cell. The inmates only left the cell for interrogation or proceedings to 
extend the periods of imprisonment. On 13 March 2008, S.K. was taken out of the cell for 
interrogation. S.K. was made to sit on a very small chair from midday to 6 p.m. His hands 
were tied behind his back which caused pain. He was allowed to go to the bathroom once. 
The interrogation was conducted by an interrogator whose name was reportedly Ran. He 
was then taken back to the cell and not being interrogated for another week. After that 
period, he was again brought for interrogation where he was confronted with a confession 
of one of his friends against him. Then, the interrogator wrote S.K.&#8217;s statement in Hebrew 
and asked him to sign it but he refused. Instead, S.K. asked to write his own statement in 
Arabic. This interrogation lasted for one and a half hours. After the interrogation, S.K. was 
transferred to Telmond Prison, near Tel Aviv. S.K. was accused of firing at soldiers and 
was sentenced by a military court to 30 months imprisonment. He is currently being 
detained and is scheduled to be released on 10 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>617. On 23 April 2008, A.A.was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his family home at 2:00 
a.m. Abed Akrout&#8217;s hands and legs were tied. A soldier grabbed A.A.by the hair and 
pushed him towards a jeep, banging his head against the bonnet, before putting him inside 
on the floor of the vehicle. A.A.was first taken to Huwwara Interrogation and Detention 
Centre and then Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. Upon arrival, he was taken 
to a room where his hands were tied from the back to a small chair, which was fixed to the 
floor. The interrogator, who introduced himself as &#8220;Franco&#8221;, spoke Arabic and stated that 
he ordered Abed Akrout&#8217;s arrest. A.A.was then put in solitary confinement and when he 
was interrogated again, he was once slapped hard in the face. Consequently, A.A.confessed 
to firing at a military jeep with a handgun.  Eight days after being arrested, the Al Jalame 
military court extended Abed Akrout&#8217;s detention period for another eight days. After his 
court appearance to extend his detention, A.A.was put in a very small cell where it was very 
difficult to sleep. The walls were painted grey and had some protrusions. The light was very 
dim. A.A.spent 65 days by himself in this cell. At the end of the 65 day period, A.A.was 
taken to the interrogator who asked him to write another statement about the shooting 
incident with more details this time. He promised that if A.A.wrote it, he would allow him 
to call his family. A.A.did what the interrogator told him and was allowed to talk to his 
family. Shortly after writing the statement, A.A.was transferred to Telmond Prison. 
A.A.was charged with shooting at a military vehicle and sentenced by an Israeli military 
court. He is still being detained and is scheduled be released on 23 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>618. On 12 August 2008, A.&#8217;A., was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his family home 
around 2:00 a.m. He was taken out of the house and began calling to his mother to say 
goodbye, whereupon he was slapped violently on the neck by a soldier. A.&#8217;A. was 
blindfolded but not tied and was pushed into a jeep and made to sit on the floor. He was 
first taken to Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre and then to Al Jalame </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>113 
</b></p>
<p>Interrogation and Detention Centre. Several weeks before being arrested, A.&#8217;A. reportedly 
found an unexploded device on the ground which he picked up causing it to explode. He 
lost two fingers from his right hand which was still bandaged at the time of his arrest. He 
was first taken before an interrogator upon arrival at Al Jalame and was told that he should 
confess to all charges to be brought against him as otherwise he would not have the 
bandages around his hand changed and therefore his hand would rot. Afterwards he was 
taken to a small cell, which had no ventilation. The cell, which was reportedly called cell 
no. 36, had holes for ventilation only; it had no windows. A.&#8217;A. slept on a mattress on the 
ground. The cell had one dimmed yellow light that was kept on for 24 hours a day. The 
walls were grey, and had rough surfaces, so it was difficult to lean against them. A.&#8217;A. was 
kept in the cell for two days before being taken back for interrogation. For the interrogation, 
he was seated on a small chair. His feet and his left hand were tied to the chair. His right 
hand was kept free due to the injury. A.&#8217;A. was kept tied in this manner for a long time in 
the room without being interrogated or asked anything. &#8220;I will keep you alone until you 
rot,&#8221; the interrogator said. During interrogation, the interrogator shouted at A.&#8217;A. and 
threatened him again that he would not change the bandages and would let his hand rot. 
Subsequently, A.&#8217;A. confessed different offences as he wanted to end the interrogation. On 
4 September 2008, A.&#8217;A. was transferred to Telmond and then Megiddo Prison. A.&#8217;A. was 
charged with being a member of a banned organisation and sentenced by a military court. 
A.&#8217;A. was released on 12 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>619. On 30 October 2008, M.S. was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his family home 
around 1:30 a.m. Soldiers ordered everybody out of the house and one soldier threatened 
M.S. that anybody found inside the house would be shot at. M.S.&#8217;s hands were tied behind 
his back with plastic ties and a sack was placed over his head before he was placed on the 
floor of a jeep for transfer. During this transfer, M.S. was kicked and beaten by soldiers 
inside the vehicle. M.S. was first transferred to Huwwara Interrogation and Detention 
Centre and then to Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. M.S. was taken to cell 36, 
which was small and measured about 3x2 metres. There was a toilet inside the cell, but no 
shower. A mattress was on the floor. The walls were grey and rough. A yellow dim light 
was lit 24 hours a day, which hurt the eyes. He was kept for four days in the cell. He was 
given food through a hole in the door. Four days later, he was taken to the interrogation 
room, which had a desk and computer. There was a metal chair tied to the floor and placed 
in front of the desk. Shackles were also attached to the back of the chair. M.S. was forced to 
sit on the chair and his hands were tied behind his back with the shackles. M.S. was kept in 
this room sitting on the chair for about an hour, during which time no one was in the room 
except for him. One hour later, an interrogator who introduced himself as &#8220;Victor&#8221; entered 
the room and asked M.S. about his cell. When M.S. informed him about the cell, the 
interrogator told him that if he wants to get out of the cell, he would have to cooperate with 
the interrogator. He was then asked about his activities and when M.S. stated that he had 
not done anything endangering security he was taken back to the cell. The next day, M.S. 
was taken again for interrogation. He was accused of conspiracy to carry out a suicide 
bombing, possession of weapons, and throwing home-made grenades, which M.S. denied. 
The interrogator said that M.S.&#8217;s friends have already confessed. For ten days, M.S. was 
taken every day for interrogation, which followed the same scheme. On the 10th day of 
interrogation, M. S. confessed to all accusations made against him so as to get out of the 
cell. These include conspiracy to carry out a suicide bombing, possession of weapons, 
manufacturing of explosives, throwing home-made grenades, stones and Molotov cocktails. 
M.S. spent four more days in cell no. 36 before being transferred to Telmond, Megiddo and 
Damoun prisons. M.S. was sentenced by a military court to 45 months imprisonment and 
fined NIS 1,000. (US$250). M.S. is still being held inside Israel and is scheduled to be 
released on 3 July 2012. </p>

<p>620. On 13 January 2009, A.S. and two friends went to throw stones at settler cars 
travelling on the by-pass road between Qalqiliya and Nablus, to protest the Israeli offensive 
in Gaza. One of the boys was killed when the stone he threw bounced back off a car and 
struck him in the head. The remaining boys flagged down a passing car for help. The car 
they flagged down belonged to a guard from a local Israeli settlement who called the army 
to arrest the boys. The arriving soldiers tied A.S.&#8217;s hands so tight they began to swell and 
turn blue. A.S. asked the soldiers to loosen the ties but they refused. A.S. was first taken to 
Ariel Police Station, then to Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre and then to Al 
Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. A.S. was taken to a small cell at Al Jalame. It 
had one yellow light that was on for 24 hours a day. It did not have any windows; only 
ventilation holes. The walls were grey, and had a rough surface. A.S. stayed inside this cell 
for 20 days. A.S. was interrogated three times, during which he confessed to having thrown 
stones three times. During interrogation, the interrogator shouted at him. A.S. had to sit 
with his head down and his hands were tied behind his back. The Al Jalame military court 
extended A.S.&#8217;s detention twice. After 20 days, A.S. was transferred to Megiddo Prison. 
A.S. was charged with throwing stones. He was convicted by a military court on 27 
December 2009. His release is scheduled for 13 December 2011.

Interrogation and Detention Centre. He was kept in a small cell at Al Jalame, which had 
some gaps for ventilation and a bathroom. The light was yellow and dim and on around the 
clock. The walls were grey and had a rough surface so that a person could not lean against 
them. He was kept in the cell until 18 January 2009. On that day, he was taken out of the 
cell for the first time. He was taken to an interrogation room and made to sit on a small 
chair tied to the floor. They tied his hands to the chair and behind his back. He was kept in 
this position for about four hours, during which time he confessed to throwing stones twice 
and a Molotov cocktail once. M.Z. signed a statement that was written in Hebrew. During 
interrogation, the interrogator kept shouting at him and threatened him to break his head. 
After the interrogation, he was taken to another cell, which was in the basement. He had to 
sleep on the floor in this cell, which was very cold. The next day, he was again taken to the 
interrogation room to meet with the same interrogator. He told the interrogator the same as 
he told him before. After 20 days in Al Jalame, M.Z. was transferred to Megiddo Prison.

stones. M.S. was then taken back to the cell, and kept there for 24 hours. Then he was taken 
back to the interrogation room and the same interrogator. The interrogator said that he 
would help him because he turned himself in. M.S. confessed to throwing Molotov 
cocktails and stones. M.S. was held for 20 days in Al Jalame before being transferred to

being transferred to Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. From 22 to 25 January 
2009, T.K.was kept in a small cell of approximately 3x2 meters. Its walls had a rough 
surface and they were grey; so one could not lean against them. It had no windows; only 
gaps for ventilation. The cell had only one dim yellow light that was lit the whole time and 
hurt the eyes. The cell had a toilet but no shower. He was provided with food through a 
hole in the door. On 25 January 2009, T.K.was taken to an interrogation room. There was a 
small metal chair in this room which was difficult to sit on. He was ordered to sit on this 
chair that was tied to the ground, and he was tied to the chair. He sat in this room for about 
an hour without being asked anything. Afterwards, an interrogator speaking fluent Arabic 
entered the room and told T.K.to confess. If he confessed he would be treated well. The 
interrogator made several accusations against him but T.K.did not confess to anything. This 
interrogation lasted about an hour. Afterwards, he was taken back to the cell and kept there 
for two weeks. He was not allowed to leave the cell. After two weeks, he was told that the 
interrogation was over and that he would be moved to a regular cell with the other 
detainees. T.K.was placed in a room with eight detainees, in addition to two detainees of his

<p>624. On 30 January 2009, M.R. was arrested by Israeli soldiers from the family home 
around 1:30 a.m. M.R. had his hands tied behind his back and was made to sit on the 
ground for about half-an-hour, before being blindfolded and placed in the back of a truck. 
The truck arrived at a military base and M.R. was taken to a clinic. At the entrance to the 
clinic a soldier grabbed the back of his head and slammed it against the clinic door, causing 
bruising to his forehead and resulting in a headache. Inside the clinic the doctor asked him a 
few general questions and filled in a questionnaire. M.R. hands were then retied and he was 
blindfolded again and taken outside where he was made to sit on his knees on the ground 
until around 10:00 a.m., a period of at least five hours. Afterwards, M.R. was transferred to 
Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre and then to Al Jalame Interrogation and 
Detention Centre. On arrival at Al Jalame, he was taken to cell 36 which measured about 2 
x 2.5 metres. However, another detainee was already inside the cell. As the cell was very 
narrow, the two detainees had difficulty to sleep.  The walls of the cell were grey and had 
rough surfaces so that one could not lean against them. There were no windows, just one 
gap for ventilation. A yellow dim light was lit 24 hours. M.R. remained in cell 36 for over 
two days before being taken for interrogation on 1 February 2009. M.R. was not tied and 
was seated in an ordinary chair. The interrogator asked him why he endangered State 
security. M.R. replied that he had not done anything to endanger State security. The 
interrogation lasted 15 minutes and he was then taken back to cell 36 for another day. On 2 
February 2009, M.R. was taken by a prison guard to another part of the detention centre 
where three other children were located and conditions were good. While in this section, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>116</b>  
</p>
<p>M.R. informed two men, who introduced themselves as a detainee working with the Red 
Cross (Abu Taha) and the Fateh representative in the prison (Abu al-Abed), that he had 
thrown stones at Israeli cars and military vehicles. On 5 February 2009, M.R. was taken 
back to cell 36. Half-an-hour later he was taken back to the interrogation room and forced 
to sit on a small plastic chair that was tied to the floor. This time his hands were tied behind 
his back to the chair. The interrogator then accused M.R. that he had thrown stones at 
Israeli cars. When M.R. denied, the interrogator began shouting and said &#8220;I&#8217;ll beat the hell 
out of you if you don&#8217;t confess.&#8221; The interrogator then showed the confession that M.R. had 
given to the two men.  M.R. then confessed to throwing stones but denied a further 
accusation of throwing Molotov cocktails. The interrogation lasted around three hours 
during which time M.R. was tied to the chair. At no time during the interrogation was 
Mohammad informed that he had any rights. After his interrogation, M.R. was moved to a 
larger cell where he remained until 23 February 2009, when he was transferred to Megiddo 
Prison. M.R. has not yet been sentenced. 
</p>
<p>625. On 24 February 2009, U.M. was arrested by Israeli soldiers from his family home 
around 12:30 a.m. U.M.&#8217;s hands were tied tightly behind his back and he was blindfolded 
before being placed inside a military vehicle. U.M. was first taken to Huwwara 
Interrogation and Detention Centre and then to Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention 
Centre. Upon arrival at Al Jalame, he was taken to a doctor who examined him and was 
then taken to a cell that measured about 2x 2,5 meters.  The cell was closed from all sides 
and had only two gaps for ventilation. Its walls were grey and they had a rough surface so 
that it was difficult to lean against them. There was a toilet inside the cell. There were no 
mattresses and one had to sleep on the floor. U.M. was provided with food through a hole 
in the door. The light in the cell was yellow and dim. On 25 February 2009, he was taken to 
an interrogation room. An interrogator, who introduced himself as &#8220;Franco&#8221; was waiting 
for him in the room. U.M. was made to sit on a small low metal chair, which was tied to the 
floor in the middle of the room. U.M.&#8217;s hands were tied to the chair with shackles that were 
already tied to the chair. The interrogator asked U.M. general questions about his cousin, 
who had been arrested 25 days before. U.M. denied having done anything. In the course of 
the interrogation, the interrogator threatened U.M. to break his head if he did not confess. 
After the interrogation, U.M. was taken back to the cell where he remained for eight days 
without seeing anyone. Afterwards, he was taken to another section of the detention centre 
into a big room. While in this room, two persons approached U.M. and introduced 
themselves as Abu Taha (50) and Abu al-Abed (40). They WGEIDlayed a great interest in 
U.M.&#8217;s situation. Everything that U.M. told them was written down by Abu al-Abed. 
Afterwards, the prison guard took U.M. to the interrogation room where &#8220;Franco&#8221; was 
waiting with the papers Abu al-Abed had written earlier.  U.M. first denied everything, but 
when the interrogator put pressure on him, U.M. confessed to all charges against him. On 
the same day, the police took his statement and U.M. was then taken back to the cell. After 
40 days at Al Jalame, U.M. was transferred to Megiddo Prison. U.M. was accused of 
affiliation with a banned organisation and preparing a Molotov cocktail. U.M. has not yet 
been sentenced. 
</p>
<p>626. On 10 March 2009, M.A.was arrested by Israeli soldiers from the family home 
around 3:30 a.m. While getting dressed, a soldier hit M.A.in the neck causing him to fall to 
the floor. His hands were then tied with plastic cords behind his back and he was 
blindfolded. M.A.was then taken outside and placed on the floor of a waiting jeep. Once 
inside the jeep, M.A.was repeatedly kicked and slapped in the face for around five minutes. 
He was first transferred to Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre where he remained 
for six days before being transferred to Al Jalame Interrogation and Detention Centre. Upon 
arrival at Al Jalame, he was taken to cell 36, which was very small and measured about 3 x 
2 meters. The walls were grey and had rough surfaces. There was a dim yellow light which

</b></p>
<p>windows, only some gaps allowing the air to enter. The next morning, M.A.was taken for 
interrogation. An interrogator, who introduced himself as Roee, accused him of having 
contacts with an external informant. M.A.was tied to a low metal chair he was sitting on. 
When M.A.refused to confess, the interrogator said that he will be locked up in the cell. 
M.A.was then taken back to the small cell where he remained for five days. Afterwards, he 
was taken again for further interrogation. During the interrogation, the interrogator said that 
he knew everything about Monther Amarnah. When he denied the accusations, the 
interrogator started shouting and insulting him. Afterwards, M.A.was taken back to the cell. 
Three days later, M.A.was again taken for interrogation. This time, he confessed to having 
been in contact with an external informant due to the big pressure he felt from the 
interrogator. Later on, M.A.was moved to a larger cell and then to Megiddo Prison. 
M.A.was finally released from detention on 10 September 2009.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>628. On 21 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers; Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories 
occupied since 1967; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an allegation letter concerning the <b>violent arrest, 
denied access to a lawyer as well as the use, or threatened use, of sexual assault during 
interrogations by Israeli security and law enforcement personnel against nine 
Palestinian children in order to extract confessions</b>.  
</p>
<p>629. Between January 2009 and April 2010, Israeli soldiers, policemen, Israeli Security 
Agency (ISA) interrogators and prison officers, have violently arrested, often from their 
homes, nine children aged between 13 and 16 years. These arrests have allegedly been 
accompanied by violence and property damage.  During these arrests, children were 
reportedly blindfolded and their hands tied tightly behind their backs with plastic ties that 
have reportedly caused injuries in their flesh. 
</p>
<p>630. On arrival at interrogation and detention centres, children were allegedly denied 
access to a lawyer, for days or weeks, until the end of the interrogation process and once 
confessions were obtained.  According to the information received, abusive and threatening 
techniques are being employed against Palestinian children during interrogation, including 
sexual assault and threats of sexual assault, in order to obtain confessions.   
</p>
<p>631. Furthermore, children were reportedly made to sign confessions in Hebrew, a 
language few of them understand.  According to the allegations received, these confessions 
constitute primary evidence against the children in military courts.   
</p>
<p>632. According to reports received, the following children have been victims of the 
alleged incidences.  The list below includes information about name, sex, age, occupation, 
nationality as well as date and place of arrest and place of sexual assault or threat of sexual 
assault:

Palestinian children and denied access to a lawyer during the detention period.  Further 
serious concern is expressed about allegations of the use of abusive and threatening 
interrogation techniques, including sexual assault and threats of sexual assault, in order to 
obtain confession from children, which could then be used as primary evidence in military

<p>635. On 3 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the 
conviction of Mr. Ameer Makhoul. Mr. Makhoul is the General Director of Ittijah &#8211; a union 
of Arab community-based associations, a network of Arab NGOs in Israel which holds 
consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council &#8211; and is also 
Chairperson of the Public Committee for the Defence of Political Freedom where he 
monitors restrictions on the political freedoms of Arab citizens in Israel. Mr. Makhoul was 
the subject of a previous Urgent Appeal by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression; and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders sent on 21 May 2010. The response of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
the above appeal was received on 2 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>636. On 27 October 2010, Mr. Ameer Makhoul was convicted by Haifa district court of 
involvement in espionage operations with the Lebanese organization Hezbollah. It is 
reported that Mr. Makhoul was found guilty, subsequent to confession which formed part of 
a plea bargain reached between the prosecution and defence, on charges of contact with a 
foreign agent, espionage and aggravated espionage. Mr. Makhoul also pleaded guilty to 
charges of conspiracy to aid the enemy in a time of war, a charge which was later dropped. 
</p>
<p>637. Concern has been expressed that Mr. Makhoul may have confessed to these crimes 
as a result of torture or the use of other forms of violence against him while in detention. It 
is reported that Mr. Makhoul previously stated in the Magistrate's Court in Petah Tikva that 
he had admitted to false accusations under duress, due to the harsh methods of interrogation 
to which he was subjected. Said methods of interrogation reportedly included sleep 
deprivation and constant interrogation while being tightly bound to an undersized chair in 
such a way as to cause him extreme pain. 
</p>
<p>638. Mr. Makhoul is due to be sentenced in December. 
</p>
<p>639. Concern is expressed that the conviction of Mr. Ameer Makhoul may be related to 
his legitimate and peaceful human rights activities. Furthermore, in light of the allegations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>120</b>  
</p>
<p>of ill-treatment and torture in detention, grave concern is expressed for Mr. Makhoul's 
physical and psychological well-being.

<p>641. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no response to the three communications

and calls upon the Government of Israel to transmit responses to the outstanding 
communications at the earliest possible date.

<p>642. On 19 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>the 
situation of a group of refugees and asylum-seekers</b>, currently held in a pre-trial 
detention center of the Ministry of Justice and in the remand center of the Department of 
the National Security Committee (DNSC) in Almaty, Kazakhstan, awaiting their 
deportation to Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>643. According to the information received, a group of 28 individuals face extradition to 
Uzbekistan on charges of membership in illegal religious or extremist organizations and 
charges of attempting to overthrow the Constitutional Order of Uzbekistan. Reportedly, 
some of them had previously been detained and sentenced to different terms of 
imprisonment on charges brought against them under Article 159 (Attempts to 
Constitutional Order), Article 223 (Illegal Exit from or Entry in Uzbekistan), Article 248-1 
(Illegal Possession of Arms, Ammunition, Explosive Substances, or Explosive 
Assemblies), Article 244-2 (Establishment, Direction of or Participation in Religious 
Extremist, Separatist, Fundamentalist or Other Banned Organizations) of the Criminal Code 
of Uzbekistan. Some claimed to have been subjected to torture and ill-treatment while in 
detention in Uzbekistan. It is also reported that the above mentioned articles of the Criminal 
Code of Uzbekistan are the most commonly used articles to indiscriminately target pious 
Muslims and dissidents of the regime in Uzbekistan.

</p>
<p>644. All the above mentioned individuals, except Mr. Tursunboy Sulaimanov, are citizens 
of Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>645. Between 2006 and 2010, fearing prosecution in Uzbekistan, the above mentioned 
individuals fled to Kazakhstan, and upon arrival applied for refugee status with the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Reportedly, some of them were 
granted UNHCR refugee status, others have had their application pending consideration. 
</p>
<p>646. In January 2010, following the entry into force of the Law &#8220;On Refugees&#8221; in 
Kazakhstan, the Government appealed to the UNHCR office to delegate to the State Central 
Commission the procedure of determining and granting refugee status to the citizens of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and China (People&#8217;s Republic). 
Reportedly, as of March 2010, the Government does not recognize the UNHCR certificates, 
and granting the asylum seeking status has been performed anew. 
</p>
<p>647. It is further reported that on 9 June 2010, following the early morning raids by the 
migration police officers, at least 45 men and one woman, all refugees and asylum-seekers, 
including the above-mentioned individuals, were arrested by security forces and members 
of the migration police at their homes in the south of Almaty, and have been since put in 
custody in a remand centre of the National Security Committee and in the Department of 
Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan. It is reported that the security members and the migration 
police did not present any judicial warrant, nor did they explain the reasons for their arrest. 
Those who were later released following lengthy interrogations by migration police have 
reported to have been subjected to beating and ill-treatment by police officers. It is further 
reported that later on the same day, following the extradition request reportedly issued by 
Uzbekistan, the Almaty district court issued an arrest authorization for the above mentioned 
individuals. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

</p>
<p>648. Reportedly, families and lawyers have been unable to gain access to the detained 
persons since their arrest on 9 June 2010, and the authorities failed to confirm their 
whereabouts. It is further reported that the above mentioned persons did not have access to 
legal counsel, and had their applications for refugee status rejected by the State Central 
Commission on 27 August 2010, about which they were informed on 17 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>649. Concern is expressed that the arrest and extradition request of the above mentioned 
persons may be related to their religious or political convictions, or affiliation with certain 
religious and political groups in Uzbekistan. Further concern is expressed about the 
physical and mental integrity of the above mentioned individuals. Finally, serious concern 
is expressed about the reported forthcoming extradition of the above mentioned individuals 
to Uzbekistan where there are substantial grounds to believe that they would be in danger of 
being subjected to torture and that harsh sentences, including life-term imprisonment would 
be imposed on them.  
</p>

<p><b>  Kuwait 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>652. On 11 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the 
detention of and charges against <b>Mr. Mohammad Abdul Qadar Al-Jasim</b>, journalist and 
lawyer.  
</p>
<p>653. According to information received, on 1 April 2010, a Kuwaiti trial court convicted 
Mr. Al-Jasim on criminal slander charges based on remarks he made at a private gathering 
in a house of a member of parliament at which he allegedly questioned the Prime Minister&#8217;s 
fitness for office and called for his removal. He was sentenced to six months in prison, but 
Mr. Al-Jasim has reportedly appealed his sentence. His sentence was thus suspended 
pending the appeal.  
</p>
<p>654. On 11 May 2010, Mr. Al-Jasim was summoned to the department of National 
Security for interrogation, and was allegedly questioned for more than fifteen hours over a 
period of two days by state security officers. From 11 to 18 May, Mr. Al-Jasim allegedly 
went on hunger strike to protest his detention. He has been held in detention since then. 
</p>
<p>655. On 24 May 2010, Mr. Al-Jasim was presented before the court in Kuwait City for 
the first session of his trial on charges of &#8220;instigating to dismantle the foundations of 
Kuwaiti society&#8221;, &#8220;slight to the personage of the Emir&#8221;, and &#8220;instigating to overthrow the 
regime&#8221;. The lawsuit was reportedly filed by Shaikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, 
Minister of Amiri Diwan Affairs and the son of the Emir. These charges are linked to 32 
articles published on his personal blog &#8220;Al Meezan&#8221; over the last five years, which 
allegedly criticised public officials in connection with the exercise of their offices. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>656. On the same day, public prosecutor&#8217;s office reportedly banned coverage of the case 
in all media, without providing any legal justification or compelling reasons for such a ban.  
</p>
<p>657. On 7 June 2010, Mr. Al-Jasim was presented before the court for the second session 
of his trial. During the session, Mr. Al-Jasim and his lawyers allegedly complained that 
according to Article 44 of the Law on Penal Procedures, the 21-day maximum period of 
precautionary detention of Mr. Al-Jasim ended on 31 May 2010 and, since there had been 
no court order to renew his detention, his continued detention is thus illegal. The defence 
team also reportedly complained that prior to both trials, Mr. Al-Jasim had not been given 
due notification of the session, in breach of the Law on Penal Procedures. It was also 
allegedly claimed that Mr. Al-Jasim&#8217;s detention, alongside convicted prisoners in cases 
related to State security, is a violation of articles 25 and 26 of the Law on Prisons. The case 
has been adjourned until 21 June 2010 to hear the testimony of the investigation officer. 
</p>
<p>658. Over his career, Mr. Al-Jasim has reportedly been the object of more than 20 formal 
complaints filed because of his writings and statements.  
</p>
<p>659. Concern was expressed that the detention of and charges against Mr. Al-Jasim 
constitute an attempt to stifle the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in particular 
expression that is critical of Government officials. Moreover, concern was expressed that 
the ban of any media coverage of the case violates the public&#8217;s right to receive information. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>661. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to the communication dated 11 June 2010. The

its earliest convenience. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kyrgyz Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>662. On 20 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
Contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an 
urgent appeal concerning the large number of detentions and alleged torture and ill-
treatment of ethnic Uzbeks in Osh and Djalal-Abad Provinces in the Kyrgyz Republic. 
</p>
<p>663. Since the violence that erupted in June in the south of the Kyrgyz Republic, more 
than 1,000 young ethnic Uzbeks have been detained. Additionally, more than 600 men aged 
between 17 and 30 have been detained in several locations, including Kyzyl-Kystak Village 
and other locations in Narima region and in two Mahallas in Osh. In Shait-Tepe district, 
470 men were detained. There are reports of women and a minor aged 14 also being 
detained. These detentions have taken place in the context of daily raids in Uzbek 
neighborhoods, without arrest warrants, and usually carried out by military and police 
officers. In some instances, the security forces have held the detainees&#8217; families at gunpoint 
and threatened to shoot them if they protested the detention. Most families are not informed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>124</b>  
</p>
<p>of where their relatives are taken upon arrest, leaving them without news of their 
whereabouts for hours or even days. 
</p>
<p>664. Once detained, the victims are taken either to police stations or to detention centres, 
including the Osh City Police Department, Osh Province Police Department, local police 
precincts and the National Security Service, where they are reportedly subjected to torture 
and ill-treatment. This includes removing fingernails, inserting sharpened sticks between 
the nails and the flesh, asphyxiation, burning with cigarette stubs, continuous beatings with 
rubber batons or rifle butts until the detainees sing the Kyrgyz hymn and speak Kyrgyz with 
no accent, punching and kicking. The purpose of the torture and ill-treatment has been to 
obtain confessions and names of persons who may be in possession of arms. On 11 July, 
one man died following his release, reportedly as a result of the ill-treatment received 
during his detention. The families of the detainees are often asked to pay substantial 
amounts of money for their relatives&#8217; release. 
</p>
<p>665. Information was also received concerning men in military uniforms who are 
increasingly present in public health institutions, including hospitals, hampering access to 
medical attention for the victims due to fear of reprisals. In addition, some doctors are 
reportedly refusing to issue medical certificates for those people who have been subjected 
to torture or ill-treatment, or death certificates for those who died during or after the 
violence. Medical examinations of detainees who allege they have been tortured or ill-
treated are also routinely refused. 
</p>
<p>666. Very few complaints of torture and ill-treatment have been received by the 
authorities, as the victims and their families are afraid of reprisals. The response by the 
authorities has been that they cannot take action unless a complaint is filed. 
</p>
<p>667. For those in detention, access to a lawyer of their choice and the right to consult with 
a lawyer in private are always denied. Many lawyers have also been threatened, insulted 
and prevented from meeting with their clients. There are also reports of lawyers and family 
members being beaten by ethnic Kyrgyz upon arrival at police stations or other detention 
facilities, while the authorities simply watched. On 11 July, the head of police promised to 
provide armed escorts to one family visiting the pre-trial detention facility. 
</p>
<p>668. Concern is expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of the 
hundreds of ethnic Uzbeks allegedly detained following the violence that erupted in June 
2010. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>669. By letter dated 2 November 2010, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic indicated 
that the facts set out concerning the detention of possibly more than 1,000 ethnic Uzbeks do 
not reflect reality. As at 11 October 2010, law enforcement agencies in the city of Osh and 
in Osh and Jalal-Abad provinces had arrested and brought criminal charges against 287 
people for murder, rape and participation in mass disturbances. The courts ordered 258 
people to be detained on remand; non-custodial preventive measures were ordered in 
respect of 29 people. 
</p>
<p>670. Following investigations, 111 criminal cases against 239 people were sent for trial. 
Investigations in the remaining cases are still ongoing. 
</p>
<p>671. Nor is there any foundation to the Rapporteurs&#8217; conclusions that the law 
enforcement agencies have been intimidating lawyers defending the interests of detainees, 
as evidenced by the fact that no complaints from lawyers have been registered with the law 
enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>672. Furthermore, the competent national authorities have been taking all necessary 
measures to guarantee respect for and observance of detainees&#8217; rights and freedoms. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>125 
</b></p>
<p>Kyrgyz Republic is unfailingly committed to the provisions of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel Forms of Treatment. 
</p>
<p>673. From the very beginning of the disturbances that occurred in June in southern 
provinces of the country, appropriate coordination between the prosecution services, 
internal affairs agencies, national security services and local authorities was ensured. The 
public was kept informed about the steps being taken by the authorities to stabilize the 
situation across the country. 
</p>
<p>674. In order to ensure due collaboration among the teams set up to investigate the results 
of the mass disturbances, which led to deaths, destruction of property and other particularly 
serious offences in the city of Osh and in Osh, Jalal-Abad and Batken provinces, an 
interdepartmental command was established on 16 June 2010 in accordance with a joint 
instruction by the heads of the law enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>675. With the aim of preventing violations of civil rights during special operations, 
investigations and inquiries, the heads of the law enforcement agencies and security forces 
issued a second joint interdepartmental instruction on 7 July 2010, intended to strengthen 
the authorities&#8217; role in ensuring lawful behaviour, professional and military discipline, and 
moral and ethical standards, among individual members of the law enforcement agencies 
and security services on the ground. 
</p>
<p>676. Instructions were given concerning the need to ensure strict respect for the law and 
prevent unlawful actions by officials of the law enforcement agencies of Kyrgyzstan. On 
the ground, checks are constantly being carried out to ensure that individuals held on 
suspicion of having committed criminal offences are detained lawfully. Anyone detained, 
arrested or remanded in custody has access to qualified legal defence, in accordance with 
current criminal procedure legislation. 
</p>
<p>677. If unlawful acts that infringe civil rights and freedoms come to light, the liability of 
officials is investigated as a matter of course, regardless of their position, and criminal 
prosecutions are brought where necessary. 
</p>
<p>678. Human rights organizations and international organizations, together with the Office 
of the Ombudsman, have met and talked to individuals affected. Concerning the existence 
of torture and ill-treatment of defendants held in places of detention in the south of the 
country, the Office of the Ombudsman has been working closely with national human 
rights bodies to deal with all matters raised. A working group was formed from among 
Office officials and immediately visited the south of the country to hold meetings with 
defendants. Analysis of their meetings revealed that not all defendants wished to cooperate 
with the group&#8217;s inquiries and that not all defendants were guilty as charged. Officials of 
the Office carried out their own investigations and follow-up, the results of which indicated 
that law enforcement agencies had acted lawfully in restoring order and pursuing their 
investigations. In respect of these events, various press conferences, meetings with national 
leaders and discussions with national human rights organizations have been held to address 
the issues raised. 
</p>
<p>679. Public consultation is ongoing, while work with national investigative bodies is 
continuing to identify violations of individuals&#8217; rights and freedoms. Officials of the Office

<p>the events that occurred in the south of the country are the subject of constant discussion by 
various human rights bodies, with a range of opinions and suggestions being voiced. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>681. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response by the Government received on 
2 November 2010. She welcomes a number of measures taken to investigate the violence, 
in particular the establishment of an interdepartmental command in the aftermath of the 
mass disturbances in accordance with the joint instruction ordered by the heads of the law 
enforcement agencies. She notes that 111 criminal cases against 239 people were sent for 
trial.  
</p>
<p>682. With regard to the issue of torture and ill-treatment of defendants in places of 
detention in the south of the country, the Special Rapporteur welcomes that the Office of 
the Ombudsman has been working closely with national human rights bodies to address the 
cases raised. 
</p>
<p>683. The Special Rapporteur would greatly appreciate receiving information on the 
outstanding criminal cases. She remains concerned at the alleged intimidation of lawyers 
and would appreciate receiving information on measures taken to prevent this happening 
and the measures taken to address this issue and ensure that lawyers are able to exercise 
their functions freely and without fear of intimidation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>684. On 12 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders sent an allegation letter concerning the situation of 
Mr. <b>Nurbek Toktakunov</b>. Mr. Toktakunov is a lawyer and the defence attorney of human 
rights defender Mr. Azimjan Askarov, whose situation was subject to an urgent appeal 
dated 22 June 2010 by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; and Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>685. According to the information received, on 23 June 2010, Mr. Toktakunov was 
allegedly threatened near the Jalalabad police station by a crowd in relation to his legal 
assistance provided to Mr. Askarov. 
</p>
<p>686. On 2 August 2010, Mr. Toktakunov was meeting Mr. Askarov, the director of the 
human rights organization Vozdukh (Air) in the Jalalabad police station when policemen 
reportedly ended the meeting. Mr. Toktakunov was told that this measure had been taken 
for security reasons since the family of a man killed during riots between ethnic Uzbeks and 
Kyrgyzs was on his way to the police station. 
</p>
<p>687. An unknown man, seeing Mr. Toktakunov through the police station window, 
threatened to go inside and to punish him for defending Mr. Askarov.  A few minutes later, 
the man, together with another man and women allegedly entered the police station, 
surrounded Mr. Toktakunov, tore his shirt, took his briefcase and threatened him with 
reprisal if he did not withdraw from Mr. Askarov's case. It is alleged that the policemen 
present did not try to stop the attack until representatives of the Regional Prosecutor's 
Office in Jalalabad intervened. 
</p>
<p>688. Concern was expressed that the attack against Mr. Toktakunov might be directly 
related to his peaceful activities in the defense of human rights and in particular the legal 
assistance provided to Mr. Askarov. </p>

<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>689. In a letter dated 16 December 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 12 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>690. The internal security service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has carried out an 
official review of this information. 
</p>
<p>691. The review ascertained that, at approximately 3 p.m. on 2 August 2010, in the 
course of inquiries into criminal case No. 166-10-159, remand prisoner A. Askarov, who 
was being held in the Bazar-Korgon district temporary holding facility for offences under 
article 97, paragraphs 2 (4), 2 (6), 2 (9), 2 (10), 2 (15) and 2 (16), article 299, paragraphs 2 
(1) and 2 (3), article 233, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, and article 240 of the Criminal Code, was 
escorted to the district procurator&#8217;s office, where investigators of the Jalal-Abad provincial 
procurator&#8217;s office were present. 
</p>
<p>692. On completion of the inquiries, Mr. Askarov, accompanied by his lawyer, N. 
Toktakunov, was escorted back to the holding facility at the internal affairs office (militia 
station). There, Mr. Toktakunov requested a private interview with his client and was 
provided with a room on the premises. 
</p>
<p>693. At that moment, relatives of the slain Bazar-Korgon district militia officer, Captain 
M. Sulaimanov, came to the station asking to see the district militia chief. To avoid a 
conflict between the relatives of Mr. Sulaimanov and Mr. Askarov, the militia chief gave 
orders for Mr. Askarov to be placed in the cells. Captain Sulaimanov&#8217;s relatives were then 
allowed onto the premises. Mr. Toktakunov was escorted from the station by militia 
officers and officials working for the provincial procurator&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>694. In addition, the review found that Mr. Toktakunov&#8217;s claims &#8212; that he had been 
surrounded near the militia station on 23 June 2010 by a hostile crowd of local inhabitants 
threatening reprisals against him for defending an ethnic Uzbek and that Mr. Askarov&#8217;s 
wife, Turdihon Askarova, had been assaulted by Mr. Sulaimanov&#8217;s relatives on the 
premises of the militia station on 21 July 2010 &#8212; were not corroborated. 
</p>
<p>695. This is also borne out by the fact that Ms. Askarova herself did not file a report on 
her assault with the militia station and that the matter of her having sustained bodily injuries 
was not recorded in the Bazar-Korgon district militia log. 
</p>
<p>696. The findings of the review have been transmitted to the Jalal-Abad provincial 
procurator&#8217;s office to be included as evidence in the above-mentioned criminal case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>697. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response to the 
communication dated 12 August 2010. She would appreciate receiving detailed information 
on any investigations conducted in relation to the allegations of ill-treatment and 
intimidation of the lawyer Mr. Toktakunov. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the 
need to guarantee the right of lawyers to freely represent their clients and perform their 
professional activity without fear, intimidation and interference. In this respect, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to stress once again the importance for Governments to respect and 
take into account the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted in Havana, Cuba, by 
the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders, from 27 August to 7 September 1990, aimed at assisting Member States to 
protect and ensure the proper role of lawyers. </p>

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>698. On 18 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, together wih the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding <b>Mr.</b> 
<b>Azimzhan Askarov</b>, director of Vozdukh, a human rights organization which documents 
police ill-treatment in detention. Mr. Askarov was the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent 
by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment on 22 June 2010. 
</p>
<p>699. According to the information received, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek, 
was detained by the police on 15 June, suspected of being involved in the death of a police 
officer during the recent violence in the country. 
</p>
<p>700. On 26 July, the Jalal-Abad city court upheld the decision of the prosecutor&#8217;s office 
not to investigate allegations that Mr. Askarov had been tortured following his detention. 
The authorities have argued that the large bruises on Mr. Askarov&#8217;s body were produced by 
his cellmate. In addition, the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office indicated that Mr. Askarov had 
confirmed that he had not been ill-treated. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyer has not been allowed to 
meet with his client in private, and believes he is afraid of further ill-treatment if he files a 
complaint. 
</p>
<p>701. During the time Mr. Askarov has been in detention, his sister-in-law and his lawyer 
were both attacked when they went to visit him at the police detention centre. The police 
reportedly failed to intervene to stop the aggression. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>702. In a letter dated 21 August 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 18 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>703. After mass disorders in the village of Bazar-Korgon, Dzhalal-Abad province, on 13 
June 2010, the organizers of the disorders resorted to particular brutality in killing local 
police inspector M. Sulaimanov; seven other officers were wounded to varying degrees. 
</p>
<p>704. The same day, the procurator&#8217;s office in Bazar-Korgon district, Dzhalal-Abad 
province, initiated criminal proceedings for incitement to ethnic, racial, religious or 
interregional hatred, mass disorders and murder of a member of the law enforcement 
agencies and the military. 
</p>
<p>705. On 16 June 2010, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov and another individual were arrested on 
suspicion of having committed the above-mentioned crime, and taken into custody at the 
Bazar-Korgon district internal affairs office. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s house was searched with the 
authorization of the Bazar-Korgon district procurator, and the following were found in a 
bookcase and removed: 10 cartridges for a 9-mm calibre PM pistol; various books and 
disks calling for the incitement of inter-ethnic discord. 
</p>
<p>706. Mr. Askarov and another individual were charged under articles 233 (mass disorder) 
and 299 (inciting ethnic, racial, religious or interregional hatred) of the Criminal Code. The 
following day, the Bazar-Korgon district court ordered their pre-trial detention as a 
preventive measure. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>129 
</b></p>
<p>707. The charges against Mr. Askarov and another individual are supported by the 
evidence of six of the police officers who were victims, the official reports of the 
confrontations between the police and Mr. Askarov, evidence from a witness, and the 
official reports of his confrontation with Mr. Askarov.  
</p>
<p>708. According to evidence from the above-mentioned police officers, on 13 July 2010, 
Mr. Askarov and another individual were in the crowd, encouraging people to refuse to 
obey the law enforcement agencies, to take hostage the head of the district internal affairs 
office, and to kill the other police officers. 
</p>
<p>709. On 24 June 2010, Mr. N. Toktakunov, lawyer for Mr. Askarov, came to the Dzhalal-
Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s office to submit a complaint concerning the alleged torture of 
his client. According to a forensic medical report dated 17 June, Mr. Askarov had bruising 
around his arm and lower back, serious enough to be considered impairment to health but 
not causing any short-term health disorder.  
</p>
<p>710. The inquiry conducted as a result of the complaint found that Mr. Askarov was 
arrested on 16 June 2010 and held in the cell where two other individuals were being 
detained on suspicion of having participated in the mass disorders. The same day, on the 
grounds that Mr. Askarov&#8217;s illegal actions had led to his house being set on fire and many 
people being killed, one of the individuals hit Mr. Askarov around the head, causing Mr. 
Askarov to fall on his back on the concrete floor. 
</p>
<p>711. On 25 June 2010, Mr. Askarov requested the Dzhalal-Abad procurator&#8217;s office not 
to charge said individual as he had no claims against him. Moreover, it was noted in the 
complaint that none of the police officers had beaten him, and he refused to undergo a 
forensic medical examination. 
</p>
<p>712. On 29 June 2010, the provincial procurator&#8217;s office refused to initiate criminal 
proceedings against said individual because there had been no complaint from the victim; 
and in respect of the alleged use of torture, because no crime had been committed.  
</p>
<p>713. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s participation in the mass disorders has been proved by materials in 
the case file. Investigations are now taking place in respect of the criminal case. 
</p>
<p>714. A second response was received from the Government on 6 October 2010 on the 
case of Mr. Askarov. However, at the time of finalizing the present report, no translation 
was available. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>715. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the replies to the communication 
summarized above. She notes the information which specifies the charges brought against 
Mr. Azimzhan Askarov. She welcomes that a forensic investigation has been conducted 
following the allegations of ill-treatment of Mr. Askarov. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure accountability for those responsible for the 
bruises around Mr. Askarov&#8217;s arm and lower back which were deemed serious enough to be 
considered impairment to his health. 
</p>
<p>716. While noting the information that the provincial procurator&#8217;s office refused to 
initiate criminal proceedings against the individual who reportedly beat Mr. Askarov in 
detention, she however recalls that an investigation should be carried out into all allegations 
of ill-treatment, even in the absence of an official complaint.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>717. On 15 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent a letter of allegations to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>130</b>  
</p>
<p>Government of the Kyrgyz Republic concerning the assault on <b>Mr. Abdumannap 
Khalilov</b>, human rights defender from Osh and a human rights lawyer who has represented 
individuals in both penal and civil cases.  
</p>
<p>718. According to the information received, on 16 August 2010, at the city tribunal in 
Osh, Mr. Khalilov was beaten by a crowd of women while a group of policemen who were 
present at the scene reportedly did not intervene.  
</p>
<p>719. Mr. Khalilov went to the city tribunal to attend a court ruling for a civil case on 
which he had been working. In the courtyard of the tribunal, a group of women of Kyrgyz 
ethnic origin were protesting against the appointment of a new judge.  
</p>
<p>720. According to reports received, one of the women recognized Mr. Khalilov and 
shouted &#8220;He is the defender of Uzbeks&#8221;. The group of women reportedly attacked him and 
started to beat him. Mr. Khalilov could escape and ran to a group of policemen who were 
present at the scene. However, instead of protecting him, the group of policeman reportedly 
pushed him towards the women, who continued to assault him.  
</p>
<p>721. Mr. Khalilov managed to reach the court building and hid in the room of the 
President of the Tribunal, where the President and two police colonels allegedly were 
present at the time. The women ran after him, entered the room and continued their assault 
of Mr. Khalilov. One woman reportedly took a bottle of water and smashed it on Mr. 
Khalilov's face, after which he lost consciousness. 
</p>
<p>722. According to the information received, two staff members from the Office of the 
Prosecutor who knew Mr. Khalilov helped him to leave through a back door and get into a 
taxi. As a consequence of the assault, Mr. Khalilov reportedly suffered from concussion 
and is body showed numerous bruises/ hematoma.  
</p>
<p>723. According to information received, various incidents of violence against human 
rights defenders and their supporters would have been documented in this region, some of 
which are reportedly closely related to the Uzbek ethnicity of the victims. 
</p>
<p>724. Concern is expressed about the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Khalilov 
and at the allegations that members of the police were present at the scene and did not 
protect him effectively.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>726. On 25 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
regarding the situation of staff members of the human rights non-governmental 
organization <b>Spravedlivost</b>, which provides free legal and judicial assistance to both ethnic 
Kyrgyz and Uzbek people in the aftermath of the violence which erupted in the south of the 
country in June 2010, and the situation of lawyers working on cases related to these violent 
incidents. 
</p>
<p>727. According to the information received, on 12 October 2010, two unidentified men, 
claiming to be relatives of ethnic Kyrgyz who were allegedly killed during the events in 
June by ethnic Uzbek, visited the premises of Spravedlivost in Jalal Abad. They harassed 
the staff members then present by asking for their full names and contact details, and why 
they were &#8220;employing lawyers for killers&#8221;. They stated that these lawyers, i.e. the lawyers 
hired for a number of ethnic Uzbek defendants, should remain quiet throughout the trial and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>131 
</b></p>
<p>refrain from submitting petitions to the judge. The two men further enquired about the 
organisation&#8217;s sources of funding. Finally, they stated that all human rights organizations 
should be closed in the Kyrgyz Republic, and threatened to return the following day. 
</p>
<p>728. Serious concern is expressed that the threats against the staff members of 
Spravedlivost may be related to their legitimate human rights activities, i.e. the legal and 
judicial assistance they provide to both Kyrgyz and Uzbek people. Further concern is 
expressed for lawyers working on cases related to the violent incidents of June 2010.

<p>730. On 29 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government regarding <b>Mr. Azimzhan Askarov</b>, director of Vozdukh, a 
human rights organization which documents police ill-treatment in detention, and <b>Mr.</b> 
<b>Nurbek Toktakunov</b>, Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyer. Mr. Askarov was the subject of joint urgent 
appeals sent by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment on 22 June 2010 and by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, on 18 August 2010. Mr. Toktakunov was the subject of a joint 
allegation letter sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, on 12 August 2010.  
</p>
<p>731. According to the new information received, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov is currently 
appealing a sentence of life imprisonment imposed by the regional court at Nooken, in the 
Jalal-Abad region of the Kyrgyz Republic, after a trial allegedly characterised by severe 
procedural irregularities and allegations of torture and ill-treatment of the accused while in 
detention. Mr. Askarov and the other defendants, all ethnic Uzbeks, were found guilty of 
murdering a Kyrgyz policeman during ethnic clashes in Bazar-Korgon in June 2010. 
</p>
<p>732. The trial was allegedly characterized by worrying irregularities with regard to fair 
trial procedure. At the opening of the trial hearing on 2 September 2010, family members of 
the deceased policemen reportedly verbally abused Mr. Askarov and threatened &#8220;to kill all 
the defendants and their children wherever they are&#8221;. During the hearing, relatives of the 
victim reportedly prevented Mr. Askarov&#8217;s relatives from entering the court room. It is also 
reported that they repeatedly interrupted the proceedings with threats and insults against the 
defendants, often making reference to the defendants&#8217; ethnicity. The judge allegedly did not 
intervene to maintain order in the court room. The defendants&#8217; lawyers were also attacked 
by relatives of the deceased police officer and injured police officers, who reportedly hit 
them with sticks, and threw a glass at them, which smashed against the bars of the cage 
holding the defendants, resulting in splinters of glass hitting one of the lawyers. It is 
reported that court officials, including the judge, intervened only sporadically to stop the 
violence and to restore order. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyers were allegedly denied the opportunity 
to question witnesses or submit petitions during the hearing. When the lawyers expressed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>132</b>  
</p>
<p>concern that they would not be able to defend their clients under these conditions, the judge 
threatened to have their licenses to practice revoked. 
</p>
<p>733. Before the trial hearing on 6 September 2010 began, family members of the 
deceased policeman and injured police officers posted flyers on the walls of the court 
building containing offensive language against Mr. Askarov and co-defendants and calls for 
the application of death penalty. The hearing itself was characterized by yet further 
allegations of procedural irregularities. A request by Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyer, Mr. Nurbek 
Toktakunov, that the hearing be deferred to allow him time to prepare an adequate defence 
was also denied; Mr. Toktakunov was also reportedly denied permission to meet with his 
client, and informed that he could only meet Mr. Askarov at the end of the trial process. 
Members of the audience, including family members of the deceased policeman, attempted 
to violently attack the defendants, and frequently subjected both the defendants and Mr. 
Toktakunov to verbal abuse; racist remarks; and threats.  It is reported that no witnesses for 
the defence were heard during the trial, and that when Mr. Toktakunov stated his intention 
to call a witness, he was told by the victim&#8217;s relatives that the witness would &#8220;not leave this 
place alive&#8221;. Further, members of the audience also reportedly directed questions to the 
defendants without authorisation from the judge, and the accused did not receive a full 
explanation of their rights and responsibilities. It is also alleged that Mr. Askarov&#8217;s relatives 
were subjected to intimidation and threatened not to attend the hearing. 
</p>
<p>734. Serious concerns have been raised regarding the treatment of Mr. Askarov and the 
other defendants while in detention. At the trial hearing of 6 September 2010, four of the 
defendants, including Mr. Askarov, allegedly bore visible marks indicating that they had 
been subjected to beatings. A petition by Mr. Toktakunov that his client be given a 
thorough medical exam was denied. When questioned by the judge, Mr. Askarov denied 
that he was subjected to any harm, although concern is expressed that this may have been 
out of fear of retribution.  
</p>
<p>735. On 15 September 2010, Mr. Askarov and all seven defendants were found guilty and 
sentenced to life imprisonment. The verdict in the trial was subsequently denounced by 
Kyrgyz Ombudsman, Mr. Tursunbek Akun, as being politically motivated. Mr. Akun also 
claimed that an alternative investigation into the policeman&#8217;s killing held by his office had 
found Mr. Askarov not guilty.  
</p>
<p>736. On 25 October 2010, Mr. Askarov appeared before Tashkumyr city court in order to 
appeal against the sentence. It is reported that upon arriving at the court, witnesses for the 
defence were prevented from entering the court room by a group of individuals. Upon 
raising the issue with the judge, the defence lawyer was questioned as to why the defence 
team had not previously applied for protection for their witnesses. During the session, 
several defendants reportedly claimed that they had been subjected to torture during 
interrogation; however, the court reportedly failed to respond to the allegations. The next 
hearing in the appeal is scheduled for 3 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>737. Concern was expressed that the conviction and sentencing of Mr. Azimzhan 
Askarov may be related to his legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human rights in 
Kyrgyzstan. Grave concern was also expressed for the physical and psychological integrity 
of Mr. Askarov and his family, Mr. Toktakunov, and witnesses for the defence in this case, 
in light of the repeated allegations of torture and ill-treatment, attacks, harassment, and 
intimidation outlined above. Further concern was expressed regarding the aforementioned 
allegations of irregularities relating to due process during Mr. Askarov&#8217;s trial and appeal.

</p>
<p>740. At approximately 10 p.m. on 12 June 2010, about 400 to 500 ethnic Uzbeks 
assembled at the intersection of Saidullaev and Jalal-Abad streets in the village of Bazar-
Korgon in the Bazar-Korgon district of Jalal-Abad province and 400 to 500 ethnic Kyrgyz 
at the intersection of Jalal-Abad and Abduraimov streets in the same village. 
</p>
<p>741. Subsequently, at approximately 8 a.m. on 13 June 2010, about 400 to 500 ethnic 
Uzbeks armed with firearms, steel rods, wooden sticks and knives assembled at the Bazar-
Korgon bridge on the Osh-Bishkek highway, blocked the highway and organized mass 
disturbances in connection with the inter-ethnic clashes in Osh.

</p>
<p>771. The criminal and administrative chamber of the Jalal-Abad provincial court, by a 
judgement of 10 November 2010, upheld the 15 September 2010 judgement of the Bazar-
Korgon district court against Mr. Askarov, Mr. Mirzalimov, Ms. Mamadalieva, Mr. 
Mulavhunov, Mr. Kochkarov, Mr. Rasulov, Mr. Abduraimov and Mr. Rozubaev, and the 
defence lawyers&#8217; appeals were denied. 
</p>
<p>772. Relatives of the defendants Mr. Askarov, Mr. Rasulov, Mr. Kochkarov, Mr. 
Mulavhunov, Mr. Mirzalimov, Mr. Abduraimov and Mr. Rozubaev on 5 November 2010 
applied to the Jalal-Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s office for measures to be taken against 
Jalal-Abad province special militia officers for causing the defendants bodily harm 
following legal proceedings at the Nooken district court on 4 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>773. A review of the matter established that, on 4 November 2010, in the Nooken district 
court, the Jalal-Abad provincial court heard the appeal in the case of the murder of the 
Bazar-Korgon district militia officer M. Sulaimanov. 
</p>
<p>774. The Jalal-Abad province internal affairs department chief mobilized 10 rapid 
response unit officers and 30 Jalal-Abad province patrol guard officers to keep the peace 
during the proceedings and ensure the safety of the parties. 
</p>
<p>775. Deputy militia chief T. Torokanov and the head of the public security section of the 
Jalal-Abad province internal affairs department, I. Shatmanaliev, conducted an official 
inquiry into the alleged assault on the defendants by special militia officers following the 
proceedings and found no evidence to corroborate the allegation. In addition, forensic 
medical examinations found no sign of bodily harm of any kind caused to the defendants. 
</p>
<p>776. Under these circumstances, the review concluded that there was no evidence of any 
wrongdoing in the actions of the rapid response unit officers. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>136</b>  
</p>
<p>777. In this connection, on 18 November 2010 the Jalal-Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s 
office decided against instituting criminal proceedings on the basis of the application by the 
relatives of Mr. Askarov, Mr. Rasulov, Mr. Kochkarov, Mr. Mulavhunov, Mr. Mirzalimov, 
Mr. Abduraimov and Mr. Rozubaev and explained to them the procedures for appealing 
that decision. 
</p>
<p>778. N. Toktakunov, Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyer, filed a complaint with the Jalal-Abad 
provincial procurator&#8217;s office on 24 June 2010 alleging that Mr. Askarov had been tortured. 
A forensic medical examination scheduled on 17 June 2010 established that Mr. Askarov 
had bruises around his arms and lower back, which were categorized according to their 
severity as having no short-term health effects. 
</p>
<p>779. As a result of the review carried out of this complaint, it was established that on 16 
June 2010 Mr. Askarov had been detained and placed in an administrative detention cell, 
where Mr. Mahmujanov and Mr. Mirzalimov were being held on suspicion of involvement 
in mass disturbances. On the same day, Mr. Mahmujanov, on the pretext that his house had 
been set on fire and many persons killed because of Mr. Askarov&#8217;s unlawful acts, struck 
Mr. Askarov&#8217;s head with his hand, causing him to fall on his back against the concrete 
floor.  
</p>
<p>780. On 25 June 2010, Mr. Askarov appealed to the Jalal-Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s 
office not to press criminal charges against Mr. Mahmujanov, as he had no claims against 
him. Furthermore, his statement indicated that no militia officer had beaten him, and he 
refused to undergo a forensic medical examination. 
</p>
<p>781. On 29 June 2010, the provincial procurator&#8217;s office declined to initiate criminal 
proceedings against Mr. Mahmujanov because no complaint had been filed by the victim. 
Nor were any criminal proceedings instituted in respect of the alleged torture, owing to lack 
of evidence of an offence. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>782. As the first part of the response contains the same information as the one provided 
by the Government to the previous communication sent on 12 August 2010, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to refer to her comments and observations formulated above.  
</p>
<p>783. With regard to the case of Mr. Askarov, the Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for its response. The Special Rapporteur would appreciate receiving updated 
and detailed information on any further complaints and appeals procedures in relation to the 
case of Mr. Askarov. She continues to be concerned at the serious nature of the allegations, 
in particular when taking into account the fact that Mr. Askarov has been the subject of two 
previous urgent appeals. 
</p>
<p><b>  Translations of responses to communications sent during the reporting period covered 
in last year&#8217;s report</b> (for ease of reference the communications sent are also reproduced 
below) 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>694. On 11 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment concerning the ill-treatment of detainees following the events which took place 
in Nookat on 1 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>695. According to the information received, on 1 October 2008, the population of Nookat 
planned to hold an event dedicated to the Orozo Ait religious feast (Yid al Fitr) in the 
Central Park, which is an official holiday in Kyrgyzstan. On 27 September, the celebration </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>137 
</b></p>
<p>was banned, but the akim of Nookat Rayon (head of administration) gave permission to 
celebrate the holiday at the local stadium. When people started to arrive at the stadium, they 
realized that the police had cordoned it, and no explanation was given by the authorities. 
The people went to the headquarters of the Nookat Rayon administration, where the akim 
came out and urged those gathered to disperse, threatening them to resort to legal measures 
if they did not leave within 30 minutes. During this time, several people came out of the 
administration building covered with blood, allegedly as a result of having been beaten by 
the authorities. The people outside became increasingly upset and launched an open 
confrontation as the police started to disperse them with batons. The police then used tear 
gas (cheremukha) and light-and-sound grenades (plamya). On 8 October, 32 people were 
detained and taken to the Nookat Police Department for their involvement in the events. 
</p>
<p>696. During the initial detention period, the detainees&#8217; families were asked by law-
enforcement officials to pay for the release of their relatives. According to the allegations, 
the property of some of the detainees was expropriated for such purposes. However, the 
families of the detainees were not able to see them during the investigative phase, and only 
saw them at the trial.  
</p>
<p>697. The detainees were reportedly subjected to torture at the moment of detention, 
during their transfers, at the pre-trial facilities of the State Committee of National Security 
and at the pre-trial facility No. 5 of the Ministry of Justice. 
</p>
<p>698. Ms. Zaripa Karataevna Adbikarimova, who was pregnant at the time, was arrested at 
her home on 8 October. The police officers informed that she had to sign some papers and 
promised to take her back. She took her two-year-old son with her. Upon arrival at the 
Nookat Police Department, a police officer named Zhanysh pushed her and started to beat 
her in front of her child. He began to cry and was pushed out into the street. The police later 
called his grandmother so that she could pick him up. Ms. Abdikarimova was also beaten 
on her legs with clubs. On the same day, she was taken to the Office of the Prosecutor of 
Osh and to the Department of the State Committee of State Security of Osh and Osh oblast. 
She was later transferred to the pre-trial prison of the State Committee of State Security, 
where she remained for more than six weeks. There, she met her lawyer, whom she only 
saw on one further occasion during the investigation. 
</p>
<p>699. In the investigation room at the State Committee of State Security,  
Ms. Abdikarimova was forced to hold a coat rack in her hands. When her hands grew numb 
and she dropped it, she was heavily beaten. She was then forced to dance with Mr. 
Holmohammat Ergashev, one of the detainees, whose face was covered with blood. The 
authorities poured boiling water on his forehead, but he did not react, as he was almost 
unconscious. After she refused to dance with Mr. Ergashev, she was beaten. She was then 
asked to remove her clothes and have sex with him. In order to avoid this, she signed all the 
documents the authorities asked her to sign.  
</p>
<p>700. That same evening, an investigator named Talant called her to the investigation 
room. He asked her to kiss him, and when she refused, he started to harass her. During the 
trial, Ms. Abdikarimova stated to the court that she had been subjected to sexual violence, 
but her statements were ignored. The next day, the authorities put a gas mask on her head 
and let cigarette smoke into the hose. They then threatened to put her on an electric chair 
and beat her on her feet. The following day, her head was shaven and she was forced to 
stand for many hours. After that, she was placed in a cell with chlorinated water.  
</p>
<p>701. Ms. Abdikarimova suffered a miscarriage as a result of the beatings. She received 
medical assistance, but after the doctor recommended that she stay in bed, she was taken to 
a cell where she was forced to stay naked in ankle-deep in chlorinated water. She was also 
offered to drink urine and was forced to remove her head scarf and sing the Kyrgyz anthem. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>138</b>  
</p>
<p>702. Two minors, who had also been detained, were tortured for the purpose of obtaining 
confessions from them. They were beaten and kicked on the genitals. One of the minors 
was forced to sit naked in a metal tub with cold water, while one end of an electric wire was 
placed in the water and the other was put in his hand and turned on. They also poured 
boiling water on his neck and beat him with a rifle butt. When the minors shouted or cried, 
they were gagged by the investigators. In addition, they were kept in incommunicado 
detention for several days, without access to their families or to a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>703. Other detainees were also subjected to the following: beatings with batons on their 
feet and hands on their ears; suspension with their hands behind their back while they were 
beaten across their bodies; dousing with cold and boiling water; having plastic bags on their 
head; having their beards torn or burnt with a lighter; placed naked in a cold concrete room, 
where the floor was covered with chlorinated water for three days; prohibited from using 
the toilet; having their fingernails torn; having vodka poured down their throat; and having 
to wear a gas mask before or after doing exercises, where cigarette smoke was sometimes 
filtered in. In addition, some of the detainees were forced to stand in the &#8220;Afghani 
position&#8221;, whereby they had to stand with half-bent legs on tiptoes, with their hands behind 
their backs, for long period of time. If the detainees tried to stand straight, they were 
severely beaten. Other detainees were taken to the &#8220;special room&#8221; in the Osh Department of 
the State Committee of National Security, where they were placed facedown in a metallic 
trestle bed. They were then handcuffed and beaten across their bodies. Another form of 
torture that was allegedly used was the electric chair. Detainees would be forced to sit in a 
metal chair, their hands tied to the armrest, a metallic wire on their heads, while they were 
threatened with its imminent application. 
</p>
<p>704. The trial was conducted by Nookat district court in Osh and not in Nookat City, 
which is 10 hours away by car. The trial started on 21 November. In addition, the process 
was postponed for several days and later resumed with very short notice. This limited the 
defense in terms of financial and logistical arrangements, as well as in trying to ensure the 
presence of witnesses and the collection of evidence. International organizations, human 
rights representatives and journalists were not allowed to sit in the court&#8217;s sessions. The 
verdict was issued on 27 November and they were all convicted. The appeal process began 
on 17 January, and the verdict was only modified in the case of a minor. It is alleged that 
there was not a thorough consideration of the complaints and circumstances of the case 
during the process.

<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>812. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the reponse to the 
communication dated 11 December 2009. However, she remains concerned at the serious 
and multiple allegations of torture, including of minors and women, brought to her attention 
and regrets the absence of information regarding any investigations and/or prosecutions 
which have been carried out in relation to these cases. She urges the Government to provide 
substantive information in this respect at the earliest possible date, as requested in the 
communication, and on the measures taken to ensure that no confession is obtained under 
torture and used in criminal proceedings.  
</p>
<p><b>  Concluding comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p>813. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its replies to the communications 
dated 20 July, 12 August, 18 August and 29 October 2010. However, she regrets the 
absence of a response to the communications dated 15 September and 25 October 2010. 
She calls on the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to provide a response to the 
outstanding communications and to all the issues raised therein. 
</p>
<p>814. She expresses concern about the allegations concerning acts of intimidation of 
lawyers, including lawsuits initiated against them which prevent them from performing 
their duties freely and without fear. She wishes to underscore the importance of ensuring 
that lawyers are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, 
hindrance, harassment or improper interference and that they shall not be threatened with 
prosecution. In this respect, she calls upon the Government to take into account the Basic 
Principles of the Role of Lawyers adopted in Havana, Cuba, by the Eighth United Nations </p>

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>816. On 30 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent action regarding the <b>criteria 
that has been developed by the Judicial Services Commission for the re-appointment 
of sitting judges in accordance with Article 285(b) of the Constitution</b>.  
</p>
<p>817. The Special Rapporteur is informed that under Article 285(b) of  the Constitution the 
Judicial Services Commission (JSC) is mandated to determine whether all sitting judges 
appointed prior to the adoption of the  2008 Constitution on 7 August 2008,  (with the 
exception of the Chief Justice), possess the necessary qualifications/characteristics 
specified in Article 149 of the Constitution. The relevant section stipulates that:  
(a) All Judges in office at the commencement of this Constitution except for the Chief 
Justice shall continue in office until such time as a determination pursuant to this Article. 
(b) The Judicial Service Commission established pursuant to Article 157 of this 
Constitution, shall within two years of the commencement of this Constitution determine 
whether or not the Judges in office at the said time, possess the qualification of Judges 
specified in Article 149. (c) Where it is determined as provided in article (b) that a Judge 
does not possess a qualification or the qualifications specified in Article 149, such Judge 
shall cease to hold office. (d) Where it is determined as provided in article (b) that a Judge 
possesses the qualifications specified in Article 149, such Judge shall be appointed as a 
Judge under this Constitution. (e) Except as provided in article (c), Judges may only be 
removed from office as specified in Article 154 of this Constitution. 
</p>
<p>818. Article 149 which provides for the qualifications of judges stipulates that: (a) A 
person appointed as a Judge in accordance with law, must possess the educational 
qualifications, experience and recognized competence necessary to discharge the duties and 
responsibilities of a Judge, and must be of high moral character.(b) In addition to the 
qualifications specified in article (a), a Judge shall possess the following qualifications: (i) 
be a Muslim and a follower of a Sunni school of Islam (ii) be twenty-five years of age (iii) 
has not been convicted of an offence for which a haad is prescribed in Islam, criminal 
breach of trust, or bribery (iv) be of sound mind. 
</p>
<p>819. The Special Rapporteur is informed that pursuant to Article 285(b) the JSC has 
developed the criteria to evaluate the competence of sitting judges for re-appointment based 
on the provisions of article 149; notably they have indicated (a) on educational qualification 
- that any certificate a sitting judge possess, even if not accredited by the Maldives 
Accreditation Board, is sufficient, (b) on experience and competence- that the fact that one 
is a sitting judge automatically means that s/he has gained the necessary experience and 
competence, and (c) on removal from office-  &#8220;high moral character&#8221; shall be interpreted to 
mean not having  been found guilty in a Court of Law of any of the crimes specified in 
Article 149(b) (iii). Where a sitting judge has been found guilty in a Court of Law of a 
crime other than those specified in Article 149(b) (iii), these cases would be decided 
individually case by case by the JSC. The JSC has now begun reappointing judges under 
these criteria. </p>

Le 27 avril 2010, un appel urgent a &#233;t&#233; envoy&#233; par les m&#234;mes d&#233;tenteurs de mandat sur la 
situation de M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid.  
</p>
<p>824. Selon les nouvelles informations re&#231;ues, M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid aurait signal&#233; au 
pr&#233;fet de la commune d&#8217;Arafat, dans la proche banlieue de Nouakchott, le cas de deux filles 
mineures pr&#233;tendument contraintes &#224; travailler dans une famille comme domestiques. Il 
aurait, en date du 13 d&#233;cembre 2010, demand&#233; &#224; la police d'aller chercher en sa compagnie 
les deux filles et leur &#171; ma&#238;tresse &#187; pour les conduire au commissariat d'Arafat 1. Une fois 
arriv&#233;s au commissariat, le commissaire aurait fait entrer les deux filles et leur &#171; ma&#238;tresse &#187; 
dans son bureau tout en interdisant l'acc&#232;s &#224; M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid. Ce dernier aurait 
protest&#233; en argumentant que les filles &#233;taient mineures et qu'il souhaitait donc assister &#224; 
l'audition. Une vive altercation entre M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid et le commissaire s&#8217;en serait 
suivie. M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid aurait alors &#233;t&#233; mis &#224; la porte du commissariat et frapp&#233; &#224; 
coups de matraques par plusieurs policiers. Bless&#233; &#224; la t&#234;te et &#224; la jambe, M. Ould Dah Ould 
Abeid aurait ensuite &#233;t&#233; conduit &#224; l'h&#244;pital. Une trentaine de sympathisants de l'IRA 
Mauritanie, qui s'&#233;tait rassembl&#233;e devant le commissariat de police en soutien &#224; l'action de 
d&#233;nonciation de M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid, aurait &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; dispers&#233;e &#224; coups de 
grenades lacrymog&#232;nes.  
</p>
<p>825. A sa sortie d&#8217;h&#244;pital, M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid aurait &#233;t&#233; plac&#233; en garde &#224; vue au 
commissariat d'Arafat 1, avec une dizaine d'autres sympathisants de l'IRA Mauritanie. Ni la

Sheikh ould Abidin ould Salem et M. Bala Tour&#233;, tous coll&#232;gues de M. Ould Dah Ould 
Abeid appartenant &#224; l&#8217;IRA Mauritanie, auraient &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s. Trois chefs 
d'inculpation seraient retenus &#224; leur encontre, &#224; savoir appartenance &#224; une organisation non-
autoris&#233;e, coups et blessures et attroupement illicite. 
</p>

<p><b>  Communication re&#231;ue 
</b></p>
<p>829. Dans une lettre dat&#233;e du 10 f&#233;vrier 2011, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu aux questions 
soulev&#233;es dans la communication qui lui a &#233;t&#233; address&#233;e le 29 d&#233;cembre 2010. 
</p>
<p>830. Question 1 : Les faits tels que relat&#233;s dans le r&#233;sum&#233; de la correspondance adress&#233;e 
au gouvernement sont-ils exacts ?  
</p>
<p>831. R&#233;ponse 1 : Les fait exacts qui ont d&#233;clench&#233; l&#8217;affaire sont les suivants : a) Mr. Ould 
Dah Ould Abeid et ses compagnons ont signal&#233; au Pr&#233;fet de l&#8217;arrondissement d&#8217;Arafat le 
cas de deux filles mineures pr&#233;tendument contraintes &#224; travailler comme domestiques, ce 
que la loi de 2007 conf&#232;re d&#8217;ailleurs aux organisations de d&#233;fense des Droits de l&#8217;Homme 
c&#8217;est-&#224;-dire la possibilit&#233; d&#8217;informer les autorit&#233;s des cas d&#8217;esclavage. Le pr&#233;fet ordonna &#224; 
la Police comme le veut aussi cette m&#234;me loi, d&#8217;accompagner Ould Dah et ses compagnons 
au domicile o&#249; se trouvents les deux filles. Celles-ci ont &#233;t&#233; ramen&#233;es au Commissariat, de 
m&#234;me que la femme, Oumelminine Mint Bakar Vall chez qui r&#233;sidaients les jeunes filles. 
</p>
<p>832. b) Au moment de l&#8217;audition des int&#233;ress&#233;es par la Police, Birame Ould Dah a fustig&#233; 
l&#8217;action de la Police et a voulu participer &#224; cette audition, chose que la loi ne conf&#232;re pas. 
Suite &#224; cela. M. Birame et ses compagnons ont agress&#233; les Policiers pr&#233;sents au 
Commissariat et il s&#8217;en est suivi une vive altercation qui a abouti &#224; &#233;a blessure de plusieurs 
&#233;l&#233;ments de la Police et de M. Birame lui-m&#234;me.  
</p>
<p>833. c) M. Birame a &#233;t&#233; soign&#233; de sa blessure et plac&#233; en garde &#224; vue ainsi que certains de 
ses compagnons comme le veut la loi. Une fois l&#8217;affaire devant le Parquet, le Procureur de

une force publique est partie prenante. 
</p>
<p>834. d) L&#8217;enqu&#234;te conclut au fait qze M. Birame et ses compagnons sont coupables 
d&#8217;agression, de coups et blessures sur des &#233;l&#233;ments de la Police, de tentative de trouble &#224;

l&#8217;arrestation et le placement en d&#233;tention de M. Dah ould Boushab, M. Mouloud ould 
Boubi, M. Ali ould Boubarak Fall, M. Cheikh Ould Abidin Ould Salem et M. Balla Tour&#233;. 
</p>
<p>836. R&#233;ponse 2 : Il n&#8217;y a pas eu usage de la force contre M. Ould Dah Ould Abeid et ses 
compagnons car ce sont eux qui ont utilis&#233; la violence contre les &#233;l&#233;ments de la Police et les

poursuites et proc&#233;dures engag&#233;es contre les auteurs de la violence. 
</p>
<p>838. R&#233;ponse 3 : Puisque les all&#233;gations sont fausses, aucune poursuite ne peut alors &#234;tre 
engag&#233;e contre quiconque pour violence. C&#8217;est le Commissaire de Police de Arafat qui a 
port&#233; plainte contre M. Birame et ses Compagnons pour agression de policiers en exercice 
dans un Commissariat de Police. 
</p>
<p>839. Question 4 : Veuillez fournir la base l&#233;gale de la d&#233;tention de M. Ould Dah et de ses 
compagnons.

Mohamed Mahmoud, Niang Amadou, Ahmed Ould Sidi et Samory Alassane (200 000 
Ouguiyas pour chacun) en raison de l&#8217;atteinte &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et morale des 
int&#233;ress&#233;s. 
</p>
<p>844. Question 5 : Veuillez fournir des informations sur le sort des personnes auxquelles il 
est fait r&#233;f&#233;rence pr&#233;c&#233;demment. Veuillez &#233;galement indiquer tous les d&#233;tails des enqu&#234;tes 
ou autres demandes de renseignements qui auraient &#233;t&#233; men&#233;es. Si aucune enqu&#234;te n&#8217;a eu 
lieu, ou si les enqu&#234;tes ont &#233;t&#233; peu concluantes, veuillez en expliquer les raisons. 
</p>
<p>845. R&#233;ponse 5 : Ces personnes sont toute en vie, celles en d&#233;tention sont dans des 
conditions satisfaisantes et re&#231;oivent les visites qu&#8217;elles souhaitent. Dans ce cadre, toutes 
les demandes de visite &#224; M. Birame et ses compagnons ont re&#231;u des r&#233;ponses favorables. 
Cela fut notamment le cas pour les demandes formul&#233;es par les d&#233;put&#233;s italiens venus &#224; 
Nouackchott, de m&#234;me que celle de M. Andr&#233; Barth&#233;l&#233;my, Pr&#233;sident de l&#8217;ONG &#171; Agir

condamn&#233;es &#224; des peines avec sursis sont aujoud&#8217;hui libres et m&#232;nent une vie normale. 
</p>
<p>846. S&#8217;agissant des enqu&#234;tes men&#233;es concernant ce cas pr&#233;cis, ce sont essentiellement 
celles men&#233;es par la Police et surtout celle de la Brigade mixte de la Gendarmerie Nationale 
qui a &#233;t&#233; prise en compte par la justice puisque la Police s&#8217;est constitu&#233;e partie civile dans 
cette affaire. Les conclusions de cette derni&#232;re sont &#233;voqu&#233;es plus haut. Le Gouvernement 
mauritanien, saisit, enfin, cette opportunit&#233; pour r&#233;it&#233;rer aux diff&#233;rents titulaires de mandats </p>

<p>848. El 28 de junio de 2010, la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados y 
abogados junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos 
humanos y el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de

la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con los <b>actos de hostigamiento y las amenazas</b>, 
incluidas amenazas de muerte, recibidas por las Sras. Blanca Mesina Nevarez y Silvia 
V&#225;zquez Camacho.   
</p>
<p>849. La Sra. Blanca Mesina es hija de Miguel &#193;ngel Mesina L&#243;pez, agente de la 
Secretar&#237;a de Seguridad P&#250;blica de Tijuana, quien fue arrestado y presuntamente torturado 
en marzo de 2009 en las instalaciones del Octavo Batall&#243;n Militar por agentes del grupo 
GOPE de Inteligencia Militar de Tijuana, Baja California.  Sobre este caso, se envi&#243; una 
comunicaci&#243;n al Gobierno el 28 de mayo de 2009. 
</p>
<p>850. La Sra. Silvia V&#225;zquez es abogada defensora de los derechos humanos y colabora 
con la Comisi&#243;n Ciudadana de Derechos Humanos del Noroeste y con la Comisi&#243;n 
Mexicana de Defensa y Promoci&#243;n de los Derechos Humanos.  Tanto Blanca Mesina como 
Silvia V&#225;zquez trabajan en la denuncia y documentaci&#243;n de casos de tortura en la regi&#243;n.   
</p>
<p>851. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, durante los &#250;ltimos meses, las Sras. Blanca 
Mesina Nevarez y Silvia V&#225;zquez Camacho habr&#237;an sido v&#237;ctimas de actos de 
hostigamiento y amenazas, incluidas amenazas de muerte, presuntamente por su labor de 
defensa y acompa&#241;amiento de familiares y v&#237;ctimas de tortura bajo arraigo en instalaciones 
militares de Tijuana, Baja California.   
</p>
<p>852. Tanto Blanca Mesina como Silvia V&#225;zquez habr&#237;an recibido llamadas telef&#243;nicas 
amenazantes, han sido objeto de seguimiento y vigilancia y habr&#237;an recibido amenazas de 
muerte contra ellas y contra sus familias.  El &#250;ltimo incidente habr&#237;a tenido lugar el 18 de 
mayo de 2010 cuando Blanca Mesina habr&#237;a sido seguida y posteriormente recibido 
amenazas de muerte por parte de un hombre encapuchado.   </p>

</p>
<p>853. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, como consecuencia de las amenazas recibidas, 
tanto Blanca Mesina como Silvia V&#225;zquez habr&#237;an recibido medidas de protecci&#243;n por 
parte de las autoridades federales mexicanas las cuales, sin embargo, habr&#237;an sido 
suspendidas recientemente sin ninguna explicaci&#243;n. Posteriormente, el 25 de mayo de 2010, 
las autoridades les habr&#237;an proporcionado un n&#250;mero de tel&#233;fono de seguridad al que 
podr&#237;an llamar durante las 24 horas en caso de emergencia.  Sin embargo, dicho n&#250;mero 
corresponder&#237;a a un servicio de coordinaci&#243;n que estar&#237;a disponible &#250;nicamente en horario 
de oficina y sin conexi&#243;n con la polic&#237;a regional.   
</p>
<p>854. Seg&#250;n las &#250;ltimas informaciones recibidas, el 4 de junio de 2010, ante las reiteradas 
amenazas, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos habr&#237;a otorgado medidas 
cautelares. En este sentido, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana habr&#237;a solicitado al Gobierno 
adoptar las medidas necesarias para garantizar la vida y la integridad f&#237;sica de Blanca 
Mesina y Silvia V&#225;zquez y sus familias.   
</p>
<p>855. Se expres&#243; grave preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de las Sras. 
Blanca Mesina Nevarez y Silvia V&#225;zquez Camacho y por el hecho de que las amenazas 
recibidas pudieran estar relacionadas con sus actividades de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los 
derechos humanos, en particular por su labor de defensa y acompa&#241;amiento de familiares y 
v&#237;ctimas de tortura bajo arraigo en instalaciones militares de Tijuana.  Se expres&#243; asimismo 
preocupaci&#243;n por la presunta suspensi&#243;n de las medidas de protecci&#243;n otorgadas por las 
autoridades mexicanas as&#237; como por la eficacia de las mismas. Las alegaciones, de ser 
confirmadas, se enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto de creciente violencia e inseguridad para los 
defensores de los derechos humanos en M&#233;xico.  
</p>
<p><b>  Comunicaciones recibidas

<p>856. La Relatora Especial no recibi&#243;, hasta la fecha, ninguna respuesta con respecto a esta 
comunicaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observaciones de la Relatora Especial 
</b></p>
<p>857. La Relatora Especial lamenta que, en el momento de finalizar este informe, no se 
haya contado con una respuesta por parte del Gobierno Mexicano. La Relatora Especial 
considera que el responder a las comunicaciones representa un elemento fundamental para 
la cooperaci&#243;n de los Estados con el mandato es por ello que insta al Gobierno de M&#233;xico a 
que le proporcione una respuesta acerca del presente caso. 
</p>
<p>858. La Relatora Especial reitera su especial preocupaci&#243;n por el contexto de creciente 
violencia e inseguridad que se vive en ese pa&#237;s. A la luz de ello, es inquietante la 
vulnerabilidad que diariamente afecta a los abogados que se han especializado en la 
denuncia de situaciones que afectan los derechos humanos. La Relatora considera que no es 
ocioso recordar los Principios B&#225;sicos sobre la Funci&#243;n de los Abogados, con especial 
&#233;nfasis en los numerales 16 y 17, que delinean las condiciones que todo estado debe 
garantizar a los abogados en el ejercicio de su profesi&#243;n, para asegurar que la misma sea 
llevada a cabo sin intimidaciones, obst&#225;culos, acosos o interferencias; haciendo hincapi&#233; en 
que, cuando la seguridad de los abogados sea amenazada como consecuencia del ejercicio 
de su funci&#243;n, recibir&#225;n de las autoridades la protecci&#243;n adecuada.

Doha Aboutabit</b> dans le cadre de sa garde &#224; vue dans les installations de la police 
judiciaire de Casablanca suite &#224; son arrestation le 3 d&#233;cembre 2009. Mme Aboutabit est, 
depuis juillet 2009, Chef de service &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital A&#239;t-Qamra dans la r&#233;gion d&#8217;Al-Hoceima. 
</p>
<p>860. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 3 d&#233;cembre 2009, Mme Aboutabit aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;e 
au domicile de ses parents &#224; Rabat et aurait &#233;t&#233; emmen&#233;e au poste de police d&#8217;Al-Maarif &#224; 
Casablanca. Mme Aboutabit serait rest&#233;e d&#233;tenue douze jours dans les locaux des services 
de s&#233;curit&#233;, soit la dur&#233;e l&#233;gale maximum de garde &#224; vue pr&#233;vue dans le cadre d&#8217;une

d&#233;tenue.  
</p>
<p>861. Mme Aboutabit serait accus&#233;e d&#8217;avoir &#171; financ&#233; le terrorisme&#187; pour avoir, il y a 
quelques ann&#233;es, pr&#234;t&#233; une somme d&#8217;argent &#224; son fr&#232;re. Celui-ci se serait par la suite rendu 
en Irak o&#249;, selon les autorit&#233;s, il aurait trouv&#233; la mort en 2008. 
</p>
<p>862. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, durant sa garde &#224; vue, Mme Aboutabit aurait subi de 
graves tortures psychologiques commises par des policiers. En l&#8217;occurrence, ceux-ci 
l&#8217;auraient menac&#233; de br&#251;ler son visage avec un briquet, ainsi que de ne plus revoir son 
enfant si elle ne reconnaissait pas les actes dont on l&#8217;accusait. Suite &#224; ces menaces, elle 
aurait confirm&#233; les aveux sugg&#233;r&#233;s par la police.   
</p>
<p>863. Tout au long de sa garde &#224; vue, Mme Aboutabit n&#8217;aurait pas eu la possibilit&#233; de 
communiquer avec un avocat, pas m&#234;me quarante-huit heures apr&#232;s la premi&#232;re 
prolongation de la garde &#224; vue tel qu&#8217;il est pr&#233;vu dans le Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale (art. 66) 
et par la loi en mati&#232;re d&#8217;infraction terroriste au Maroc. 
</p>
<p>864. De s&#233;rieuses craintes sont exprim&#233;es au sujet de l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et mentale de 
Mme Aboutabit. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication re&#231;ue

a r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; que la d&#233;nomm&#233;e Doha Aboutabit a &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;e le 3 d&#233;cembre 2009, par les 
services de la brigade nationale de la police judicaire dans le respect total des lois en 
vigueur et sous contr&#244;le effectif du parquet. 
</p>
<p>866. Mme Doha Aboutabit a &#233;t&#233; auditionn&#233;e le 15 d&#233;cembre 2009 par le juge 
d&#8217;instruction pr&#232;s l&#8217;annexe de la cour d&#8217;appel &#224; Sal&#233; et a &#233;t&#233; plac&#233;e sous mandat de d&#233;p&#244;t &#224; 
la prison civile de ladite ville. 
</p>
<p>867. Les faits qui lui sont reproch&#233;s sont pr&#233;vus et r&#233;prim&#233;s par l&#8217;article 218-4 du code 
p&#233;nal qui &#233;nonce : &#171; Constituent des actes de terrorisme les infractions ci-apr&#232;s : le fait de 
fournir, de r&#233;unir ou de g&#233;rer par quelque moyen que ce soit, directement ou indirectement, 
des fonds, des valeurs ou des biens dans l&#8217;intention de les voir utiliser ou en sachant qu&#8217;ils 
seront utilis&#233;s, en tout ou en partie, en vue de commettre un acte de terrorisme, 
ind&#233;pendamment de la survenance d&#8217;un tel acte et le fait d&#8217;apporter un concours ou de 
donner des conseils &#224; cette fin. &#187;  
</p>
<p>868. Concernant son placement en garde &#224; vue : il y a lieu de signaler que le contact des 
personnes gard&#233;es &#224; vue avec leurs avocats, est r&#233;gi par les articles 66 et 80 du code de 
proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale qui &#233;dicte que : &#171; toute personne gard&#233;e &#224; vue peut en cas de prolongation 
de cette mesure demander &#224; l&#8217;officier de police judiciaire de communiquer avec son avocat, 
l&#8217;exercice de ce droit est subordonn&#233; &#224; l&#8217;autorisation du minist&#232;re public, qui peut dans le 
cadre des affaires li&#233;es au terrorisme, retarder la communication entre l&#8217;avocat et son client 
mais sans d&#233;passer le d&#233;lai de 48h &#224; compter de la 1&#232;re prolongation. &#187;. L&#8217;exercice de ce </p>

Mme Doha Aboutabit n&#8217;a formul&#233; aucune demande en ce sens. 
</p>
<p>869. Concernant l&#8217;all&#233;gation de torture et de mauvais traitement : l&#8217;all&#233;gation selon 
laquelle Doha Aboutabit aurait subi de graves tortures psychologiques et des menaces par 
des policiers durant sa garde &#224; vue est sans fondement car, aucune plainte pour torture ou 
menace n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e par l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;e ou son repr&#233;sentant, ni durant ni suivant sa garde &#224;

aurait subis durant sa garde &#224; vue, la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale tient &#224; pr&#233;ciser que m&#234;me en 
l&#8217;absence d&#8217;une plainte formelle, les Etats parties &#224; la Convention contre la torture et autres 
peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants sont tenus de proc&#233;der 
imm&#233;diatement &#224; une enqu&#234;te impartiale, chaque fois qu&#8217;il y a des motifs raisonnables de

<p><b>  Communication sent

<p>873. On 28 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning the statement made by the Governor of south-eastern state of Abia that death 
row inmates should be executed to ease prison congestion. We are informed that the 
statement was uttered at a meeting of thirty-six State governors held on 20 April 2010. 
According to information received, there are currently about 870 inmates on death row, 
including women and juveniles.  
</p>
<p>874. In this connection, we would like to draw your Government attention to two main 
substantive areas of concern relating to the above mentioned statement, which in our view, 
needs to be addressed urgently.  
</p>
<p>875. First, there have been concerns raised that the Nigerian criminal justice system does 
not guarantee fair trial, as reflected by the national study group on the death penalty in 2004 
and by the presidential commission on the reform of the administration of justice in 2007. 
Furthermore, we were informed that most people have been sentenced to death following 
trials which did not conform to international fair trial standards.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>151 
</b></p>
<p>876. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions raised 
concern in his mission report to Nigeria with regard to widespread procedural irregularities 
in death penalty cases and conditions on death row. He indicated that torture is consistently 
used by the Nigeria police to extract confessions and that these confessions have often been 
critical to the conviction of persons charged with capital offences. Moreover many 
defendants in capital trials have effectively had no legal representation and legal aid is not 
available for appeals. (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.4, Para. 28).  
</p>
<p>877. Following his visit to the country in 2007, the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment echoed these concerns pointing 
to his finding that torture and ill-treatment are widespread in police custody, and 
particularly systemic at criminal investigation departments, and that torture is frequently 
used for the purpose of obtaining confessions (A/HRC/7/3/Add.4, paras. 37 and 40). 
</p>
<p>878. These concerns, the Special Rapporteurs are informed, continue to prevail in the 
criminal justice system. The majority of those on death row have been sentenced to death 
on the basis of confessional statements allegedly obtained under torture and some had no 
legal representation during trial or the preparation of the defense was often inadequate as 
counsel are not given timely access to the prosecution dossier.

<p>880. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to her communication dated 28 April 2010. She 
remains deeply concerned at the situation of death row inmates, including women and 
children. Considering the irreversible nature of the death penalty, she urges the Government 
of Nigeria to provide substantive information about the issues raised in the aforementioned 
communication.

Saleem al-Nabahin, (A/HRC/13/39/Add.1, para 305) who was sentenced to death by a 
military court in Gaza, to which we are yet to receive a response. In that communication we 
expressed concern regarding imposition of the death penalty on grounds of treason and the 
provisions of Article 131 of the Revolutionary Penal Code which permits the imposition of 
the death sentence for conduct which does not involve intentional killing, as required by 
international law which restricts imposition of the death penalty to the most serious crimes.

</b></p>
<p>897. On 23 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding the detention and sentence to 
death of <b>Mr. Sarabjit Singh</b>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>154</b>  
</p>
<p>898. According to the information received, on 30 August 1990, Mr. Sarabjit Singh, a 
national of India, usually residing in the Bhikiwind District, Tarn Taran Punjab, India, was 
arrested on the border between India and Pakistan by the Pakistani security forces on 
charges of espionage for the Government of India and involvement in the bomb blasts in 
Faisalabad and Lahore. Mr. Sarabjit Singh was presented with no warrant for his arrest. Mr. 
Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s fate and whereabouts were unknown until after 9 months following his 
arrest when the Indian Government and later Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s family were notified that 
Mr. Sarabjit Singh was in the custody of Pakistan.  
</p>
<p>899. It is reported that this is a case of mistaken identity. Mr. Sarabjit Singh was arrested 
in Pakistan as Manjit (Manjeet) Singh, allegedly accused of involvement in terrorist attacks 
and espionage. According to the source, Mr. Sarabjit Singh was forced to sign a confession 
statement prepared by the officers interrogating him.  
</p>
<p>900. Furthermore, it is reported that from 1991 until 2003 Mr. Sarabjit Singh was held in 
solitary confinement in a small cell without sufficient space for him to stand upright and 
denied exposure to natural sunlight. According to the source, Mr. Sarabjit Singh was 
subjected to ill-treatment and beaten up upon his arrest. The source further alleges that from 
1991, Mr. Sarabjit Singh was shackled to the wall of his prison cell until the intervention of 
a human rights organization from Canada in 2003.  
</p>
<p>901. It is further reported that on 3 October 1991, Mr. Sarabjit Singh was charged by a 
Special Judge in Lahore under sections 302 and 307 of the Pakistani Penal Code and 
section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act and was sentenced to death. According to the 
information received, the trial was conducted in English, which Mr. Sarabjit Singh does not 
speak nor understand. Subsequently, Mr. Sarabjit Singh appealed to Lahore High Court. 
During the proceedings in High Court, Mr. Sarabjit Singh denied having given a 
confessional statement voluntarily. In its judgment dated 10 December 2001, Lahore High 
Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the judgment issued by the Special Judge in 
Lahore on 3 October 1991. Similarly, Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s appeal to the Supreme Court 
was denied by order dated 18 August 2005. The Review Petition was also dismissed in 
default on 24 June 2009 on the grounds of non-appearance of Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s previous 
lawyer. Subsequent application for reconsideration was returned by the registrar of the 
Supreme Court on the basis that it was inadmissible.  
</p>
<p>902. It is further reported that Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s current lawyer had deposited criminal 
petitions No. 529-531 of 2003 and No. 229-531 of 2005 requesting the President of 
Pakistan to release Mr. Sarabjit Singh. In 2008, the President confirmed Mr. Sarabjit 
Singh&#8217;s death sentence and rejected the mercy petition. According to the information 
received, Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s execution was set for 30 April 2008, but was indefinitely 
deferred following intervention by the Prime Minister of Pakistan.  
</p>
<p>903. Reportedly, the petitions filed by Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s lawyer contain evidence that 
Mr. Sarabjit Singh was not involved in the bomb blasts and acts of espionage, on the basis 
of which he had been convicted and sentenced to death. Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s name does not 
appear on the First Information Report (FIR), a written document usually prepared by the 
police in India and Pakistan. The name mentioned in FIR is that of Mr. Manjit Singh. 
According to the information received, Mr. Manjit Singh was arrested by the Indian Police 
on 16 December 2010.  
</p>
<p>904. Mr. Sarabjit Singh is currently detained in Central Jail Kot Lakhpat, Lahore, 
Pakistan. According to the information received, Mr. Sarabjit Singh suffers from various 
infections and diseases, namely infection on his feet, high blood pressure and poor 
circulation, curvature of spine and ulcers on his body. Mr. Sarabjit Singh has allegedly been 
denied access to medication and medical treatment. </p>

<p><b>  Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>905. In a letter dated 30 December 2010, the Government acknowledged receipt of the 
communication and indicated that it has been transmitted to the capital for serious 
consideration and early response.  
</p>
<p>906. In a letter dated 8 April 2011, the Government indicated that the matter had been 
referred to the authorities concerned for clarification. Investigations have revealed that the 
case of Mr. Sarabjit Singh is not a case of mistaken identity as allegedly portrayed in the 
communication. The concerned authorities have provided the following particulars of Mr. 
Sarabjit Singh: 
</p>
<p>Name:  Mr. Manjeet Singh 
Alias:  Sarabajit Singh 
Son of:  Saiakhan Singh 
</p>
<p>907. The authorities have also conveyed that Mr. Sarabjit Singh, after following the due 
judicial process, was sentenced to death on charges of causing the death of 18 and injuries 
to 118 persons through bomb explosions at four different places in Pakistan. The judicial 
process, involving the Local Court, the Provincial Court as well as the Apex Court, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan, provided him an ample opportunity to prove his innocence. 
Since April 2008, the implementation of the death sentence to Mr. Sarabajit Singh has been 
stayed by the President of Pakistan for an indefinite period. 
</p>
<p>908. The Governmet is of the view that the reference made in the communication to an 
individual named Manjot Singh arrested by the Indian Police on 16 December 2010, has no 
connection with the case of Mr. Sarabajit Singh. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p>909. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Pakistan for its response to the 
urgent appeal dated 23 December 2010. However, due to the irreversible nature of the death 
penalty and the serious nature of this case, she urges the Government to clarify all the 
issues raised in the communication, in particular on the allegations that the petitions filed 
by Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s lawyer contain evidence that Mr. Sarabjit Singh&#8217;s name does not 
appear on the First Information Report (FIR), a written document usually prepared by the 
police in India and Pakistan; the name mentioned in FIR is that of Mr. Manjit Singh. 
According to the information received, Mr. Manjit Singh was arrested by the Indian Police 
on 16 December 2010.

cuerpos y fuerzas de seguridad del Estado paname&#241;o y trabajadores de las plantaciones 
bananeras, en su mayor parte miembros de la comunidad ind&#237;gena Ng&#228;be-Bugle. Desde el 2 
de julio, estos trabajadores se encontraban realizando una huelga en contra de ciertos 
art&#237;culos de la reci&#233;n aprobada Ley 30 de 12 de junio de 2010. Tras varios d&#237;as de huelga,

<p>928. On 8 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal concerning the arrest and detention of 
<b>Mr. Fawaz Al-Attiyah</b>, a former Qatari national and who holds British nationality.  Mr. 
Al-Attiyah is the former spokesperson of the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p>929. On 29 October 2009, Mr. Al-Attiyah was extradited from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by 
men in civilian clothes and flown to Qatar in a private plane. He has been reportedly held in 
detention in Qatar since then.   
</p>
<p>930. The arrest, extradition and detention of Mr. Al-Attiyah would be reportedly 
connected to the fact that he had started legal proceedings against the Prime Minister for 
allegedly dispossessing him of land and property and attacking his dignity.   
</p>
<p>931. According to reports received, Mr. Al-Attiyah is being held in solitary confinement 
since his transfer to Qatar. In April 2010, Mr. Al-Attiyah was reportedly relocated to the 
main centre of the State security services. His detention is allegedly renewed every month 
based on charges under articles 111 (public employee who discloses secrets of the State), 
112 (anyone who illegally obtains and/ or discloses secrets of the State), and 327 
(defamation) of the Qatari Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>932. Since his detention in Qatar, Mr. Al-Attiyah has reportedly not had proper access to 
legal counsel, as his lawyer can only see him during the hearings whereby his detention is 
prolonged, which take place approximately once a month. Serious restrictions have 
reportedly been applied to family visits as well.  
</p>
<p>933. Concern is expressed about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Al-Attiyah, 
which appears to be deteriorating over the past few months, allegedly due to the conditions 
of detention. In this connection, further concern is expressed about the allegations that Mr. 
Al-Attiyah is being held in solitary confinement for more than six months. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur:  
</b></p>
<p>935. While welcoming the transmission of the communication to the competent 
authorities, the Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official response to the 
communication dated 8 June 2010. She considers response to her communications as an 
important part of the cooperation with her mandate, and calls upon the Government of 
Qatar to transmit responses to the above-mentioned communication.

<p>936. On 23 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an ugent appeal regarding <b>Ms. 
Sapiyat Magomedova</b>, human rights lawyer in the Republic of Dagestan. Ms. 
Magomedova works at the Omarov and Partners law firm, which is well-known for its 
commitment to human rights and frequently takes on cases related to abductions, torture 
and extrajudicial executions in the Republic of Dagestan. Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova has 
also filed four applications with the European Court of Human Rights, claiming violations 
of the rights of her clients by the police and the prosecutor&#8217;s office in Khasavyurt. Ms. 
Magomedova had reportedly been previously threatened by the prosecutor and by members 
of the investigative committee under the prosecutor&#8217;s office in Khasavyurt.  
</p>
<p>937. According to the information received, on 17 June 2010, at around 4:00 p.m, Ms. 
Sapiyat Magomedova went to the Khasavyurt police station (GOVD &#8211; City Interior 
Division), to visit a client, Ms. Malika Evtomirova, who had been arrested earlier that day. 
Ms. Magomedova was denied access to her client by a detective, Mr. Zakir Stamulov. 
Subsequently, Mr. Stamulov ordered four police officers from a special riot unit (OMON) 
of the Khasavyurt police station to remove her from the premises. The four policemen 
reportedly severely beat Ms. Magovedova, before dragging her out of the police station 
upon orders of Mr. Shamil Kerimovich Temigereev, the chief of police. Ms. Magomedva&#8217;s 
mobile phone was smashed and her chain stolen, as she was left laying unconscious outside 
the security checkpoint of the police station.  
</p>
<p>938. Ms. Magomedova was taken by ambulance to the Khasavyurt City Hospital, where 
she remained unconscious until the evening. A staff forensic doctor allegedly refused to 
record Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s injuries.  
</p>
<p>939. Concern was expressed that the assault and beating of Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova by 
officers of the Khasavyurt police station may have been related to her activities in defence 
of human rights, in particular regarding the court proceedings she had initiated alleging ill-
treatment and violations of clients&#8217; rights by the Khasavyurt police station and prosecutor&#8217;s 
office. Further serious concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological 
integrity of Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>940. In a letter dated 13 August 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 23 June 2010 as follows. The allegations made by Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova&#8217;s </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>160</b>  
</p>
<p>lawyer concerning the use of force against her on 17 June 2010 by officers of the Internal 
Affairs Department in Khasavyurt, Republic of Dagestan, have been verified by the 
investigation department of the Bureau of Investigation reporting to the Federal 
Procurator&#8217;s Office in Dagestan. As a result of the verification, criminal proceedings were 
instituted on 1 July 2010, under article 286, paragraph 3 (a), of the Criminal Code 
(improper exercise of authority). 
</p>
<p>941. The necessary investigative work is being conducted. The accounts of injury to, and 
misappropriation of the property of, Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova, and the link between those 
crimes and her activities in defence of human rights will be verified during the 
investigation. The Dagestan Procurator&#8217;s Office is monitoring the investigation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>942. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response provided by the Russian Federation 
and welcomes that the necessary investigation into the assault of Ms. Magomedova is 
carried out. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>943. On 29 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent an allegation letter 
concerning ill-treatment by police officers of <b>Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova</b>, a criminal lawyer 
in Khasavyurt, Dagestan, Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>944. Ms. Magomedova is a member of the &#8220;Omarov and Partners&#8221; lawyers&#8217; association 
based in Khasavyurt, which is known for its work on cases of serious human rights 
violations committed by members of law enforcement agencies in Dagestan, including 
alleged enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial executions. 
</p>
<p>945. On 17 June 2010, Ms. Magomedova was allegedly severely beaten by the police and 
forcibly removed from Khasavyurt town police station (GOVD) where she was reportedly 
visiting a detained client. 
</p>
<p>946. Twice an ambulance was called by Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s colleague but was not 
allowed to enter the GOVD premises. It had to be called a third time and then collected her 
outside the police checkpoint. On 17 June 2010, Ms. Magomedova was admitted to the 
local hospital in Khasavyurt. Local doctors reportedly refused to document Ms. 
Magomedova&#8217;s injuries for fear of reprisals by law enforcement officials, and discharged 
her from hospital with only a brief medical referral note. On 18 June 2010, Ms. 
Magomedova was transferred to the central hospital in Makhachkala.  
</p>
<p>947. The medical records obtained from the central hospital in Makhachkala are available 
and confirm Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s injuries are consistent with her allegations. 
</p>
<p>948. It is reported that since the conditions in the central hospital in Makhachkala were 
inadequate, on 21 June, Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s family transferred her to a private medical 
center in Makhachkala where she received adequate treatment. On 30 June, Ms. 
Magomedova left the medical centre. It is reported that while in the medical center, Ms. 
Magomedova became aware of a visit by a police inspector who reportedly questioned the 
medical personnel about the need for Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s continued hospitalisation at the 
medical centre. 
</p>
<p>949. It is reported that since Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s health conditions continued to remain 
unsatisfactory, she travelled to Moscow to get adequate treatment. On 8 July 2010, with the 
help of a local NGO called &#8220;Grazhdanskoe Sodeistvie&#8221; (&#8220;Civil Partnership&#8221;), Ms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>161 
</b></p>
<p>Magomedova was admitted to Moscow City Clinical Hospital no. 31. On 31 July 2010, Ms. 
Magomedova completed her treatment.  
</p>
<p>950. It is reported that in August 2010, Ms. Magomedova was diagnosed with a tumor in 
her chest and underwent surgery in another hospital in Moscow. She remained in Moscow 
to undergo further health examination and regular check-up. 
</p>
<p>951. On 17 August 2010, Ms.Magomedova had to fly back to Dagestan to visit her 
mother who was unwell. Ms. Magomedova was scheduled to visit her doctor in Moscow in 
October. 
</p>
<p>952. It is reported that following Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s allegations of being severely beaten 
by police, a criminal case was launched against her on charges of &#8220;public insult of state 
officials while on duty&#8221;. It is claimed that if convicted, Ms. Magomedova would also be 
stripped of her license to practice law as a lawyer.  
</p>
<p>953. On 30 September 2010, travel restrictions were issued preventing Ms. Magomedova 
from travelling to Moscow where she was reportedly getting medical care and legal support 
regarding the criminal allegations brought against her.  
</p>
<p>954. Concern is expressed that Ms. Magomedova may be targeted for her legitimate 
activities as a lawyer. Furthermore, it is reported that although a criminal case on police ill-
treatment has been launched following the attack on Ms. Magomedova, there have 
reportedly been a number of serious procedural violations, fabrication of false evidence, 
and political pressure on the investigator.  
</p>
<p>955. Further concerns are expressed regarding the physical integrity and safety of Ms. 
Magomedova as the police officers have not been suspended from their official duties while 
a criminal investigation of alleged ill-treatment has been launched against them.

<p>960. On 3 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning the ongoing judicial harassment of <b>Mr. Oleg Orlov</b>, Chairman of human rights 
organisation Memorial. Mr. Orlov was the subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>162</b>  
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders; the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, and Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 29 November 2007. Mr. 
Orlov was awarded the European Parliament&#8217;s Sakharov Prize on 16 December 2009.  
</p>
<p>961. According to the information received, Mr. Oleg Orlov has been subjected to 
ongoing criminal proceedings and judicial harassment following remarks he made 
concerning the President of the Chechen Republic, Mr. Ramzan Kadyrov, in July of 2009.  
</p>
<p>962. On 6 October 2009, the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow found Mr. Orlov guilty 
of libel, following the publication of a statement in which Mr. Orlov indicated his belief 
that Mr. Kadyrov or his administration was responsible for the murder of Ms. Natalia 
Estemirova, the head of Memorial&#8217;s office in Grozny, on 15 July 2009. Mr. Kadyrov 
subsequently lodged an administrative complaint against Mr. Orlov, claiming that the 
statement had damaged the &#8220;honour and dignity&#8221; of the President of the Chechen Republic, 
and demanding ten million rubles in damages. Having been found guilty, it is reported that 
Mr. Orlov was ordered to retract the statement and pay a personal fine of 20,000 rubles. 
Memorial was also ordered to pay a fine of 50,000 rubles. The sentence was upheld on 
appeal by Moscow City Court on 21 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>963. Furthermore, a criminal investigation concerning the same comments was opened on 
20 October 2010. Despite reports that Mr. Kadyrov had publicly stated on 9 February 2010 
that he would dismiss the criminal proceedings, on 18 June 2010, Mr. Orlov was informed 
that the charges against him remained pending, and summoned to appear before the 
Investigatory Department of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Central 
Administrative District of the City of Moscow on 6 July 2010 for further investigation. Mr. 
Orlov was subsequently charged with the criminal offence of libel under Article 29 parts 2 
and 3 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, and subjected to questioning. 
</p>
<p>964. In the subsequent trial hearing of 13 September 2010, serious concerns were 
reportedly expressed regarding criminal procedure, specifically with respect to Article 72 of 
the Russian Federation&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure, as it was alleged that Mr. Kadyrov&#8217;s 
lawyer had been interrogated as a witness during pre-trial investigation. Citing these 
concerns and others, on 22 October 2010, the European Parliament called upon the 
authorities of the Russian Federation to reconsider the decision to open the criminal trial. 
</p>
<p>965. In the trial hearing of 25 November 2010, which took place before District Court 
No. 363 of Khamovniki district, Moscow, the first defence witnesses were examined. The 
next hearing is reported to be scheduled for 16 December 2010. 
</p>
<p>966. Concern was expressed that the ongoing criminal proceedings against Mr. Oleg 
Orlov may be related to legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human rights, in 
particular his remarks made about the President, as well as that of the human rights 
organisation Memorial. These acts, if confirmed, would take place in a context of 
increasing harassment of and violence against human rights defenders in the Russian 
Federation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>967. In a letter dated 21 February 2011, the Government provided a response to the 
above-mentioned communication. On 13 August 2009, the Tverskoy District Court of the 
City of Moscow began its examination of a complaint by Mr. Ramzan Akhmatovich 
Kadyrov, President of the Chechen Republic, against the interregional non-governmental 
organization and human rights centre Memorial and the chair of its board, Mr. Oleg 
Petrovich Orlov, in which Mr. Kadyrov claimed that his honour, dignity and reputation had 
been damaged, demanding 5 million roubles from each of the respondents in compensation </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>163 
</b></p>
<p>for moral harm and the retraction of the libellous statements made against him in the mass 
media.  
</p>
<p>968. The Court&#8217;s decision of 6 October 2009 gave partial satisfaction to those demands. 
Thus, Mr. Kadyrov&#8217;s claim was partially satisfied. The Court decided:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; To accept that the statements made on the website www.memo.ru were false and 
damaging to the honour, dignity and reputation of Mr. R.A. Kadyrov; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To order Memorial to publish a retraction of the statements made on the 
aforementioned website within 10 days of entry of the Court&#8217;s decision into force; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To order Memorial to pay Mr. R.A. Kadyrov 50,000 roubles in compensation for 
moral harm; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To order Mr. O.P. Orlov, Chair of the board of Memorial, to pay Mr. R.A. Kadyrov 
20,000 roubles in compensation for moral harm. 
</p>
<p>969. The dispute was settled by the court in accordance with civil procedure. On 21 
January 2010, the civil chamber of Moscow City Court upheld the decision. As the result of 
a pretrial investigation, criminal proceedings were initiated against Mr. Orlov for the 
offence of libel on 20 October 2009. Mr. Orlov was charged with that offence under article 
129, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (the case consequently being subject to a public 
hearing). 
</p>
<p>970. The charges against Mr. Orlov are that, as Chair of Memorial, he accused Mr. 
Kadyrov, President of the Chechen Republic, of the murder of Ms. N. K. Estemirova, Mr. 
Orlov&#8217;s colleague at Memorial, and in so doing disseminated information that he knew to 
be false and that was damaging to the honour, dignity and reputation of Mr. Kadyrov.  
</p>
<p>971. On 28 July 2010, the deputy prosecutor for the Central Administrative District of the 
City of Moscow confirmed the indictment and the case was referred to the court. The 
injured party, Mr. Kadyrov, maintained the charges against Mr. Orlov. 
</p>
<p>972. On 12 August 2010, the criminal case against Mr. Orlov came before a justice of the 
peace of District Court No. 363 of the Khamovniki District of the city of Moscow for trial 
on the merits. 
</p>
<p>973. On 17 August 2010, the justice of the peace issued a decision to schedule the trial 
hearing for 30 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>974. On 30 August 2010, the trial hearing was adjourned until 13 September 2010 as a 
result of the failure of Mr. Orlov to appear. 
</p>
<p>975. On 13 September 2010 (not 13 October 2010, as indicated in the appeal of the 
Special Rapporteurs), in accordance with article 72 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
lawyer Mr. G.M. Reznik filed an objection against the injured party&#8217;s representative, Mr. 
A.A. Krasnenkov, in connection with the latter&#8217;s having been questioned as a witness 
during the pretrial inquiry, purportedly &#8220;in accordance with the procedure for questioning a 
witness&#8221;. The justice of the peace dismissed the objection on the grounds that during the 
pretrial investigation, Mr. Krasnenkov had been questioned not as a witness but as a 
representative of the injured party. 
</p>
<p>976. In accordance with article 42 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the injured party 
and his or her representative may be questioned both during the pretrial investigation and 
during the trial. 
</p>
<p>977. During the trial hearing, witnesses Ms. A.A. Malsagova, Mr. U.S. Dzhumaliev and 
Mr. O.D. Dzubairaev were questioned. The trial was adjourned until 27 September 2010 so </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>981. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for the 
response provided to the communication dated 3 December 2010. She appreciates the 
detailed information provided on the criminal proceedings initiated against Mr. Oleg Orlov 
and would appreciate receiving updated information on the conduct and outcome of the 
trial. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>982. On 20 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding the 
<b>patterns of intimidation, acts of violence against lawyers and acts of interference in 
the professional discharge of their functions.</b> 
</p>
<p>983. Over the past six months, there have been reports of acts of interference and 
violence against lawyers allegedly being perpetrated by law enforcement forces and 
security officials in the North Caucasus region. Lawyers who are known for defending 
human rights cases are said to be targeted. 
</p>
<p>984. On 29 October 2010, lawyers issued a statement alleging that members of the 
Kyzylyurt district police department (OVD) have been interfering in the discharge of their 
professional functions through acts of violence and for refusing to prosecute those 
responsible. On 1 November 2010, lawyers from the city of Kyzylyurt and the surrounding 
district of Dagestan began a strike in protest against the conduct of law enforcement and 
security officials. It is alleged that the lawyers are refusing to participate in investigations 
and court cases the authorities address inter alia the provision of safe working conditions, 
the implementation of preventative measures against interference by security service 
members in the lawyers&#8217; work, and the opening of investigations into five separate 
instances of illegal conduct towards lawyers by OVD members in 2010. The Special 
Rapporteur informed that the lawyers from Kyzylyurt district have submitted a complaint to 
the Republic&#8217;s Lawyers Council proposing a general strike.  
</p>
<p>985. The Special Rapporteur is informed that these acts of violence and intimidation have 
also been reported in other parts of the North Caucasus region and allegedly about five 
lawyers have been assaulted in recent months.  
</p>
<p>986. The Special Rapporteur has received information on the following incidents:  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>165 
</b></p>
<p>987. In April 2010, <b>Mr. Sergei Kvasov</b>, a lawyer in Dagestan, was assaulted and beaten 
by four persons wearing a mask in the centre of the city of Makhachkala. It is reported that 
the perpetrators of the acts continued to beat him, even after he had lost consciousness. He 
was brought to the hospital and suffered from severe injuries and contusions. He remained 
unconscious during several hours. 
</p>
<p>988. On 7 October 2010, <b>Ms. Zinfira Mirzaeva</b>, a lawyer in the Kumtorkalinsky district 
of Dagestan, was forcibly and illegally detained by two local police officers while taking 
pictures to collect evidence on the scene of an alleged case of theft involving her client, the 
person accused. The security personnel reportedly attempted to produce evidence that she 
was conspiring with militants. Some colleagues of Ms. Mirzaeva demanded her release 
from custody at the police station, which they eventually obtained. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>989. In a letter 21 February 2011, the Government has responded to the above-mentioned 
communication. 
</p>
<p>990. On 9 April 2010, an investigator working for the investigating agency of the police 
department for the Sovetsky District of the city of Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan, 
initiated criminal proceedings under article 111 (intentional infliction of serious injury), 
paragraph 3 (a), and article 213 (criminal mischief), paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code of 
the Russian Federation on the basis of evidence that bodily injury had been inflicted on the 
lawyer Mr. S.V. Kvasov.  
</p>
<p>991. As a result of the investigative activities carried out, it was established that on the 
evening of 9 April 2010, unidentified persons forcibly entered the Mario cosmetic salon, 
where Mr. Kvasov was located at the time, and attacked him with baseball bats and metal 
bars, inflicting serious bodily injury. That same day, the victim was taken to the local 
hospital, where he was found to have a fractured skull and a broken left kneecap. 
</p>
<p>992. The main line of inquiry being pursued is that the attack was linked to Mr. Kvasov&#8217;s 
professional activities. A series of investigative activities are being carried out to establish 
the identities of the perpetrators of the offence. 
</p>
<p>993. During an inquiry carried out by the investigating agency of the investigation 
department for the Republic of Dagestan, a unit of the Investigative Committee attached to 
the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation, in response to a complaint 
by lawyers Ms. P.A. Abdulsalamova and Ms. I.M. Gadzhieva that their colleague Ms. Z.M. 
Mirzaeva had been attacked and beaten, the following was established. 
</p>
<p>994. On 7 October 2010, in the village of Uchkekent, Kumtorkalinsky District, Republic 
of Dagestan, Ms. Mirzaeva, a lawyer of the interdistrict Bar Association, took video footage 
of investigative activities carried out by law enforcement officers in connection with the 
theft by her client, Mr. R.S. G., of livestock belonging to the mother of Mr. A.M. Z., head 
of the department of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Dagestan responsible for 
combating offences relating to the trade in water bioresources. She also attempted to record 
images of Mr. Z.&#8217;s home on her video camera, despite being requested by Mr. Ziyavutdinov 
not to take photographs of his private property. Following Ms. Mirzaeva&#8217;s refusal to refrain 
from doing so, Mr. Z. took Ms. Mirzaeva to the Kumtorkalinsky district police department 
by force. 
</p>
<p>995. Consequently, criminal proceedings were initiated against Mr. Z. on 4 November 
2011 on the basis of evidence of an offence under article 330 (Vigilantism), paragraph 2, of 
the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>996. On 23 November 2010, the Kumtorkalinsky district court ruled that the decision to 
prosecute was unlawful. However, on 17 January 2011, the Criminal Chamber of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>166</b>  
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the Republic of Dagestan, having considered an appeal by the prosecutor 
for the Kumtorkalinsky District, overturned that ruling and ordered the retrial of the case. 
</p>
<p>997. An inquiry conducted by the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian 
Federation found no evidence in support of the information set out in the enquiry of the 
Special Rapporteur regarding the strike supposedly planned by lawyers of the town of 
Kizilyurt and the Kizilyurt District, nor regarding the refusal by those lawyers to participate 
as defence lawyers in the investigation of criminal cases. Moreover, the Kizilyurt 
interdistrict procurator held a meeting with the participation of lawyers and heads of district 
law enforcement agencies as a result of which the head of the Kizilyurt police department 
was tasked with organizing measures to ensure the safety of lawyers in exercising their 
professional duties and to prevent attempts to obstruct them in their work. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>998. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response to the 
communication dated 20 December 2010. In respect of the assault of Mr. Kvasov, the 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the information that investigations are being carried out to 
establish the identities of the perpetrators of the offence. She would appreciate receiving 
updated information on the result of the investigations. 
</p>
<p>999. Concerning the case of Ms. Zinfira Mirzaeva, the Special Rapporteur thanks the 
Government for the information provided. She would appreciate receiving information on 
the retrial of Mr. Z&#8217;s case as well as information. 
</p>
<p>1000. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the information provided by the 
Government according to which an inquiry was carried out regarding the pattern of 
intimidation of lawyers, a meeting was held with the participation of lawyers and law 
enforcement officials, and welcomes that the head of the Kizilyurt police deprtment was 
requested to take measures to guarantee the safety of lawyers and prevent interference in 
the discharge of their professional duties.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1001. On 23 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent an 
urgent appeal concerning the case of ill-treatment by officers of the Khasavyurt Police 
Station of <b>Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova</b>, human rights lawyer in the Republic of Dagestan 
and the interference in the discharge of her professional functions. 
</p>
<p>1002. This case has previously been addressed in an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on 23 June 2010, as well as in a second 
urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment on 29 October 2010.  
</p>
<p>1003. In response to the first communication dated 13 August 2010, your Excellency&#8217;s 
Government has informed us that the allegations made by Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s lawyer have 
been verified by the Bureau of Investigation reporting to the Federal Procurator&#8217;s Office in 
Dagestan. As a result, criminal proceedings were instituted on 1 July 2010, under article 
286, paragraph 3 (a), of the Criminal Code (improper exercise of authority) and that the 
investigative work was being conducted. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>167 
</b></p>
<p>1004. In the previous communication dated 29 October 2010, the Special Rapporteurs 
drew the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to our concerns regarding inter alia the 
conduct of the criminal investigations. It had been brought to our attention that a number of 
fundamental procedural rules and safeguards had been violated including the fabrication of 
false evidence. It had also been reported that a criminal case was launched against Ms. 
Magomedova on charges of &#8220;public insult of state official while on duty&#8221;. It was further 
claimed that if convicted, she would be stripped of her licence to practice law. We are yet to 
receive information on the current status of prosecution and on the measures taken to 
safeguard Ms. Magomedova&#8217;s rights and security as well as that of her family. 
</p>
<p>1005. According to the new information received, there is lack of progress in the criminal 
investigations regarding the alleged assault of Ms. Sapiyat Magomedova at Khasavyurt 
Police Station (SOG PPSM OVD) on 17 June 2010, whereas the criminal investigation 
against Ms. Magomedova for alleged &#8220;public insult of a State official while on duty&#8221; 
continues.  
</p>
<p>1006. Ms. Magomedova has allegedly been informed that the term of the preliminary 
investigation into the criminal case against her has been extended until 2 January 2011. Ms. 
Magomedova appealed against the initiation of the criminal case pursuant to article 125 of 
the Criminal Procedure Code  
</p>
<p>1007. It is reported that the criminal charges against Ms. Magomedova is based on 
allegations of her having insulted the chief of the Khasavyurt Police Station (SOG PPSM 
OVD) when visiting one of her clients on the 17 June 2010, on the basis of article 319 of 
the Criminal Code, as referred to in the aforementioned communications. On that day, she 
was allegedly severely beaten by the officers of the Khasavyurt Police Station. It is further 
reported that the questioning of two witnesses, both police officers from the same police 
station, constitutes the main element of evidence to support the criminal case against her.  
</p>
<p>1008. With regard to the alleged assault against her, Ms. Magomedova has filed a 
complaint against the investigative body on 29 November 2010. She alleged that 
fundamental procedural rules and safeguards had not been observed including, inter alia, 
that the criminal case had been initiated with an undue delay of 13 days, that her requests 
for information on the proceedings had not been considered and that the questioning of 
suspects had been delayed. She further alleged that for almost five months &#8211; 1 July to 29 
November 2010 &#8211; the investigator had failed to identify the perpetrators of the acts of 
violence against her. 
</p>
<p>1009. Concern is raised that the criminal investigations has been deliberately delayed in 
relation to the alleged assault of Ms. Magomedova and that she may be targeted for her 
legitimate activities as a human rights lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received 
</b></p>

communication.  
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p>1011. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reponse. She regrets that at

will only be reflected in the next year&#8217;s report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1012. On 14 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Special Rapporteur on the situation of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>168</b>  
</p>
<p>human rights defenders; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an allegation letter regarding the <b>pattern of 
impunity regarding the deaths of lawyers and human rights activists including 
impunity concerning the death of Mr. Sergei Magnitsky</b>, a lawyer who died in custody 
on 16 November 2009.  
</p>
<p>1013. According to information received, Mr. Magnitsky was counsel for a foreign 
investment firm known as Hermitage Capital Management. In 2008, Mr. Magnitsky 
voluntarily provided testimony accusing the Russian Interior Ministry and other state 
officials of stealing about 230 million US dollars from the State budget. It was alleged that 
this was part of a complex fraud involving the transfer of title of several Hermitage 
companies and successfully applying for a tax reimbursement of 230 million US dollars, a 
figure which represented the amount of taxes previously paid by the Hermitage companies 
to the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>1014. On 24 November 2008, Mr. Magnitsky was arrested and charged with tax evasion. 
He was never brought before a court of law but was kept in pre-trial detention for 11 
months. His lawyers repeatedly filed complaints on the arbitrariness of his detention, 
however these were rejected. It is alleged that while in custody he developed pancreatitis 
and he was denied medical treatment despite repeated requests. On 16 November 2009, he 
died in custody.  
</p>
<p>1015. On 17 November 2009, an autopsy was conducted and it indicated that he had died 
from heart failure. It is alleged that a medical examination conducted on 11 November 
2009, indicated that he had gallstones and cholecystitis pancreatitis at an acute stage, but 
that and after carrying out an electrocardiogram, his health was satisfactory. Mr. 
Magnitsky&#8217;s family requested that an independent autopsy be conducted. However this was 
denied and his body was released to the family on condition that he would be buried 
immediately. 
</p>
<p>1016. In December 2009, about 20 members of Russia&#8217;s penitentiary services were 
dismissed by the federal Government although it is not clear whether this was in connection 
with the death of Mr. Magnitsky. The Russian State Investigative Committee announced 
that there would be a formal criminal investigation into his death. To date no person has 
been prosecuted for the death in custody of Mr. Magnitsky.

<p><b>  Concluding comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur

<p>1018. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Russian Federation for 
providing a response to the communications dated 23 June 2010 and 3, 29 and 23 
December 2010. She regrets the absence of a response to the communication dated 14 
January 2011. 
</p>
<p>1019. She wishes to express concern about the number of allegations received indicating a 
pattern of intimidation, harassment and interference in the discharge of professional 
functions of lawyers. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the need to guarantee the 
right of lawyers to freely represent their clients and perform their professional activity 
without fear, intimidation and interference. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to stress once again the importance for Governments to respect and take into account 
the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted in Havana, Cuba, by the Eighth United 
Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, from 27 </p>

<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>1020. On 30 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning regarding the 
detention and health deterioration of <b>Mr. Nacer Na&#239;f Al Hajiri</b>, Kuwaiti national who 
normally resides with his wife and 3 children at Manteqat Al Qusur (Kuwait) and who was 
working as a civil servant in the Kuwaiti Administration. 
</p>
<p>1021. Mr. Al Hajiri was arrested on 16 December 2007, by the General Saudi Intelligence 
Services (Al Mabahit Al Aama) at the Khafdji border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
He was allegedly arrested without a warrant and taken to an unknown location.   
</p>
<p>1022. Five months after his arrest, in May 2008, the wife of Mr. Al Hajiri was authorized 
to see him at the Intelligence Services&#8217; detention centre in Damman (Eastern Saudi Arabia). 
Mr. Al Hajiri reportedly informed his wife that during this time he was not charged, nor 
given a reason for his arrest, he had not been presented before a judge, nor had he been 
allowed to access a lawyer.  To date, no charges have been reportedly brought against Mr. 
Al Hajiri, nor has he had access to legal counsel.   
</p>
<p>1023. According to the reports received, Mr. Al Hajiri&#8217;s health started deteriorating after 
his arrest as he suffers from diabetes and arterial hypertension. In March 2009, Mr. Al 
Hajiri undertook a hunger strike in protest against his detention.   
</p>
<p>1024. In addition, Mr. Al Hajiri is currently suffering from a brain tumour which, 
according to a medical exam held in August 2009, requires an urgent operation to extract 
the tumour. On 28 February 2010, Mr. Al Hajiri was reportedly taken to a hospital and 
examined by a doctor who advised immediate medical intervention, including specialized 
exams. However, despite the worsening of his physical condition, the prison authorities 
refused the medical advice and he was returned to his cell. Mr. Al Hajiri remains in 
detention. 
</p>
<p>1025. Serious concern is expressed about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Al 
Hajiri. Concern is expressed about allegations that, despite the degradation of Mr. Al 
Hajiri&#8217;s health, the prison authorities have reportedly refused that he obtains the necessary 
medical care as repeatedly advised by doctors. Further concern is expressed about reports 
that Mr. Al Hajiri was held incommunicado in an unknown location for a period of five 
months without access to a lawyer or contact with his family. Concern is also expressed 
about allegations that no charges have been brought against Mr. Al Hajiri and that he has 
not had access to legal counsel since the time of his arrest.

<p>1028. Le 28 janvier 2011, la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale, conjointement avec le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial sur la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants, a 
envoy&#233; un appel urgent concernant le cas de <b>M. Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;,</b> ancien Chef d&#8217;Etat de la

torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants dans son rapport de 
2007 (voir A/HRC/4/33, paras. 43-47) ainsi que par le Comit&#233; des Nations Unies contre la

Guengueng et autres c/ S&#233;n&#233;gal</i>, du 17 mai 2006. Dans ladite communication, le Comit&#233; 
contre la torture a consid&#233;r&#233; que le S&#233;n&#233;gal n&#8217;avait pas rempli ses obligations en vertu de 
l&#8217;article 5 paragraphe 2, et de l&#8217;article 7 de la Convention contre la Torture et autres peines 
ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants. M. Habr&#233; est accus&#233; d&#8217;avoir 
syst&#233;matiquement pratiqu&#233; la torture durant ses huit ann&#233;es pass&#233;es &#224; la t&#234;te de l&#8217;Etat de la 
R&#233;publique du Tchad.  
</p>
<p>1029. En f&#233;vrier 2000, M. Habr&#233; a &#233;t&#233; inculp&#233; sur la base des charges de torture au 
S&#233;n&#233;gal, mais les tribunaux s&#233;n&#233;galais ont estim&#233; qu&#8217;ils ne pouvaient pas juger M. Habr&#233; au

d&#8217;indiquer la juridiction comp&#233;tente afin de juger M. Habr&#233;.  
</p>
<p>1030. En juillet 2006, l&#8217;Union Africaine a demand&#233; au Gouvernement du S&#233;n&#233;gal de 
poursuivre M. Habr&#233; et d&#8217;assurer son jugement par un tribunal s&#233;n&#233;galais comp&#233;tent. Le 
Gouvernement du S&#233;n&#233;gal aurait modifi&#233; la Constitution en vue de permettre les poursuites 
contre M. Habr&#233;. 
</p>
<p>1031. M. Habr&#233; fait &#233;galement l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un acte d&#8217;accusation et d&#8217;une demande 
d&#8217;extradition datant de 2005 &#233;mise par la justice juge belge &#224; la suite de plaintes d&#233;pos&#233;es 
par des victimes qui auraient &#233;t&#233; tortur&#233;es par l&#8217;ex-pr&#233;sident du Tchad.

<p>1032. Le 18 novembre 2010, la Cour de Justice da la Communaut&#233; Economique des Etats

Habr&#233; en cr&#233;ant une juridiction sp&#233;ciale. La Cour a conclu que l&#8217;obligation de mettre fin &#224; 
l&#8217;impunit&#233; de M. Habr&#233; devait &#234;tre remplie &#171; selon la coutume internationale qui a pris

<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>1038. On 23 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding the 
<b>non-election of about 837 judges after involcation of the Law on Judges</b>. 
</p>
<p>1039. The predecessor of the Special Rapporteur had previously written to the Government 
of Serbia in a communication dated 5 November 2008, in which concern was raised on the 
requirement of re-election for sitting judges and on the procedures governing the 
membership of the High Judicial Council. The Government replied in a communication 
dated 22 January 2009. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response from the 
Government in which the justification for the process of judicial renewal was provided and 
it was indicated that the ansence of lustration has led towards accumulation of systematic 
problems and an outstanding lack of functionality which has charactereised the judicial 
system. Further, the Special Rapporteur appreciates information from the Government 
concerning the process of judicial and legislative reform being undertaken. 
</p>
<p>1040. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the process of judicial reform being undertaken 
by the Government. However, the Special Rapporteur would like to stress that renewing the 
judicial system has to comply with international standards safeguarding the independence 
of the judiciary. In this regard, the Special Rapporteuer would like to bring to the attention 
of the Government information that she has recently received which raise concern on the 
process of re-election of the judges. 
</p>
<p>1041. According to information received, the Law on Judges which was published in the 
Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 116/08 of 27 December 2008, provides 
under article 100 that &#8220;The Hihj Judicial Council shall make a decision on the number of 
judges and lay judges in accordance with this Law, within 30 days after the date of the 
election of the first constitution of the High Judicial Council, having obtained the consent 
of the Minister in charge of the judiciary. The election of judges, in accordance with this 
Law, shall be conducted no later than December 1, 2009, with the exception of judges of 
the Supreme Court of Cassation who shall be elected within 90 daysafter the date of the 
first constitution of the High Judicial Council. The judges elected in accordance with this 
Law shall take up office on January 1, 2010.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1042. The criteria for the re-election was said to be in accordance with article 45 on the 
Law od Judges which stipulates that &#8220;Other requirements for the election of a judge are 
qualification, competence and worthiness, Qualification means possessing theoretical and 
practical knowledge necessary for performing the judicial function. Competence means 
possessing skills that enable efficient use of specific legal knowledge in dealing with cases. 
Worthiness means ethical characteristics that a judge should possess and conduct in 
accordance with such characteristics. The moral characteristics of a judge shall include 
honesty, theroughness, diligence, fairness, dignity, perseverance, and esteem, and conduct </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>172</b>  
</p>
<p>in compliance with these characteristics involves upholding of signity of a judge on an off 
suty; the awareness of social responsibility; preserving of independence and impartiality; 
reliability and dignity on duty and off, as well as taking the responsibility for the internal 
organization and a positive public image of the judiciary. The criteria and standards for the 
assessment of qualification, competence and moral character are set by the High Judicial 
Council, in accordance with the law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1043. The process of deciding which judges qualify for election was not transparent as the 
High Judicial Council worked in closed sessions. The Special Rapporteur is informed that 
the Council on 5 June 2009, adopted the &#8220;Internal Rules on the Work of the High Judicial 
Council&#8221; which stipulates inter alia that the sessions of the Council are closed to the public, 
that the members of the Council are obliged to keep the secrecy of the data which the 
Council marked as secret and not to disclose information regarding decision making of the 
Council. In line with these rules the application of the criteria as stipulated under Article 45 
on the Law on Judges was not made public and no individualized reasons were given to the 
judges on why they were not re-elected into office. 
</p>
<p>1044. On 17 December 2009, the High Judicial Council published in a list of re-elected 
judges with the names of 1,531 judges that would perform judicial functions in the higher 
courts, the Supreme Cassation and Appellate Courts and 876 that would be elected by the 
Assembly of Serbia. 46 seats remained vacant. 
</p>
<p>1045. In January 2010, about 820 judges who were not re-elected submitted appeals to the 
Constitutional Court against the decision of the High Judicial Council to terminate their 
tenure of office as of 31 December 2010. The appeals contend that the Constitutional Court 
should approve a provisional measure and postpone the execution of the decision of the 
High Judicial Council in the part which terminated the permanent judging function of non-
elected judges. Further, they called that the Constitutional Court should postpone the new 
election of judges and direct the High Judicial Council not to issue new announcements for 
the election of judges.  
</p>
<p>1046. On 27 May 2010, the Constitutional Court delivered a decision in the appeal vy Mr. 
Zoran Saveljic in which it held that the High Judicial Council had to give individualized 
reasons for the non re-election of the judge. On 5 July 2010, the High Judicial Council 
invited Mr. Zoran Sabeljic to a meeting where they indicated the reasons why he had not 
been re-appointed. Mr. Zoran Saveljic did not have an opportunity to reply to the 
allegations raised against him. On the same day, he received a decision from the High 
Judicial Council informing him why he had not been re-appointed. Mr. Zoran Saveljic has 
appealed against the decision to the Constitutional Court. To date, the Constitutional Court 
is yet to deliver its rulings on the appeals by the other non-elected judges. 
</p>
<p>1047. The Special Rapporteur is informed that since June 2010, the High Judicial Council 
has started to deliver individual decisions on the termination of services for the non-elected 
judges to replace the circular decision of 17 December 2009. So far 30indicidualized 
decisions have been issued. 
</p>
<p>1048. The non-elected judges had up to 30 June 2010, within which to effectuate the 
compensation of salary in accordance with article 101 of the Law on Judges which provides 
that &#8220;Duties of judges from article 99, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Law, who were not elected 
under this Law, shall be terminated on the day when judges elected in accordance with this 
Law take up office. The judges from paragraph 1 of this article are entitled to compensation 
of salary for six months in the amount of salary they had at the moment of termination of 
their duties. The right to compensation of salary from paragraph 2 hereof shall be 
terminated prior to the expiration of the six month period of the judge whose duty was 
terminated obtains an employment status or right to a pension, and can be extended for 
another six months of he/she will obtain the right to a pension during those six months&#8221;. </p>

<p>1050. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official response to the

as an important part of the cooperation with her mandate, and calls upon the Government of 
Serbia to transmit responses to the concerns raised in the above-mentioned communication.

<p>1051. On 13 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the independence on judges and 
lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment sent an allegation letter concerning the <b>deaths in custody of Mr. Dhammala 
Arachchige Lakshman, Mr. Amarasinghe Arachchige David, Mr. Appuhandhi 
Kotahewage Nayanajith Prasanna, Mr. Jayakody Arachchilage Oman Perera </b>and <b>Mr. 
Jayasekara Arachchige Roshan Jayasekara</b>. 
</p>
<p>1052. The Special Rapporteurs are informed that there is a pattern of police officers killing 
detained suspects as a means of eliminating organized crime. Such cases are not being 
investigated or prosecuted before the courts.  
</p>
<p>1053. On 13 August 2010, Mr. Amarasinghe Arachchige David was arrested by officers 
from the Kirindiwela Police Station. He was placed into a police vehicle and on their way 
to the police station, the vehicle stopped along the main road at Papiliyawala to conduct a 
search on two people. Mr. David got out of the vehicle and watched the police officers 
conduct the search. The police officers, after noting that Mr. David had stepped out of the 
vehicle, approached him and beat him on his back and hip areas. He was then dragged 
towards the vehicle where the officers beat him against the rear door shouting &#8220;Are you 
trying to escape from us&#8221;. Mr. David was taken to Kirindiwela Police Station and later 
admitted at the Government hospital of Radawana. He was transferred to the National 
Hospital of Colombo; however he later died from the injuries sustained. On 15 August 
2010, a post-mortem examination indicated that he had died as a result of head injuries. It is 
alleged that the police are reluctant to conduct an investigation into the death.  
</p>
<p>1054. On 25 August 2010, Mr. Jayasekara, of Ranaviru Niwasa, Morakatiara, Beliattha 
was arrested by the Ragama Police Station and taken to Kiribathgoda police station. He was 
arrested on suspicion of having stolen a mobile phone at Ragama Railway Station. On 26 
August 2010, a police officer brought the body of Mr. Jayasekara to Ragama Teaching 
hospital; however he did not wish to be registered as the person who brought in the body. 
On 27 August 2010, the police constable of the Kiribathgoda Police Station registered as 
the person who delivered the body. A post mortem that was conducted by the judicial 
medical officer at the Ragama Teaching Hospital revealed marks of numerous blunt force 
trauma injuries.  
</p>
<p>1055. On 31 August 2010, Mr. Jayakody Arachchilage Oman Perera of No. 22, Palle 
Kalley Janapadaya in Kurunegala was arrested by officers from the Special Task Force. 
After his arrest Mr. Perera was placed in a police jeep and as he was being driven to 
Colombo, he was shot. It is alleged that as the vehicle was near the Japalawatta Industrial 
Zone junction in Minuwangoda, Mr. Perera attempted to escape. He was taken to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>174</b>  
</p>
<p>Minuwangoda Hospital and later transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of the General 
Hospital, Gampaha. He died the same day from the injuries sustained.  
</p>
<p>1056. On 20 September 2010, Mr. Dhammala Arachchige Lakshman was arrested by the 
police and held in custody at the Hanwella police station. On 22 September 2010, he was 
taken to a location in Diddeniya in Hanwella for an on-sight investigation to uncover 
weapons. It is alleged that he attempted to escape from police custody by throwing a bomb 
at the police officers and was shot. He sustained injuries and died at the Avissawella 
hospital the same day. During his detention the deceased was not brought before a court.  
</p>
<p>1057. On 22 September 2010, Mr. Prasanna of No. 1B, Balawinnagama, Balawinna, 
Balapatha was arrested by the police officers from the Moratuwa Police Station. On 25 
September 2010, he was found in his cell with severe cuts to his abdomen and was admitted 
at the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital. On 26 September 2010, he died from the injuries 
sustained. The police indicated that he had attempted to commit suicide with a shard of 
glass found inside his cell. During his detention he was not brought before a Magistrate as 
required by the Code of Criminal Procedure No.15 of 1979. 
</p>
<p>1058. The Special Rapporteurs are informed that in the recent past, the police have 
increasingly been arresting people without producing them before a court of law in 
contravention of the Code of Criminal Procedure No.15 of 1979 which stipulates that police 
officers should produce a suspect arrested on suspicion of committing a crime before a 
Magistrate within 24 hours. &#8220;Any police officer shall not detain in custody or otherwise 
confine a person arrested without a warrant for a longer period than under all the 
circumstances of the case is reasonable, and such period shall not exceed twenty-four hours 
exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate.&#8221;

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1060. On 19 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers and the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention sent an 
urgent appeal regarding the <b>administrative detention of about 8,000 persons alleged to 
be associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suspects</b>. 
</p>
<p>1061. According to information received, after hostilities ceased between the Sri Lanka 
Army and the LTTE in mid May 2009, it is alleged that about 12,000 individuals were 
detained. Since October 2010, some detainees were released under Emergency Regulation 
1580/5 of 15 December 2008, including at least 565 children.  By March 2010, other 
detainees were released including detainees with disabilities or injured. About 1,158 people 
were released in April 2010 prior to parliamentary elections and about 140 university 
students were released to pursue their studies under the supervision of the Commissioner 
General for Rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p>1062. By July 2010, is alleged that that about 8000 individuals were still being held in 
&#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; centres for alleged links with the LTTE. Some of those detained have been 
designated to face criminal prosecution. Nevertheless we are informed that the detainees 
have not been informed of the reasons for their detention nor the length of the detention.  
</p>
<p>1063. The experts are informed that there are two basis for administrative detention under 
Sri Lankan regulations (i) preventive detention on the basis of security threats and (ii) 
compulsory participation in &#8216;rehabilitation&#8217;. These powers are found in temporary 
Emergency Regulations (ER 2005 and 2006) - that lapse with the end of a state of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>175 
</b></p>
<p>emergency - and in the more permanent counter-terrorism statute, the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act (PTA) (1979). 
</p>
<p>1064. The ER 2005, Regulation 19 provides that &#8220;(1) Where the Secretary to the Ministry 
of Defense is of the opinion with respect to any person that, with a view to preventing such 
person &#8212; (a) from acting in any manner prejudicial to the national security or to the 
maintenance of public order, or to the maintenance of essential services; or (b) from acting 
in any manner contrary to any of the provisions of regulation 25 of these regulations, it is 
necessary so to do, the Secretary may order that such person be taken into custody and 
detained in custody. Provided however that no person shall be detained upon an order under 
this paragraph for a period exceeding one year.&#8221; Regulation 19 was amended in May 2010, 
and reduced the maximum period of detention to three months. However its application is 
not retroactive meaning that the 8000 detainees, who are the subject of this communication, 
are excluded from this provision.  
</p>
<p>1065. The experts are informed that the detainees are held under administrative detention 
for the purposes of preventive detention and rehabilitation purposes. Some of those under 
detention are designated as &#8220;surrendee&#8217;s&#8221; which is defined under ER 2005 (regulation 22, 
as amended by Regulation No. 1462/8, 12 September 2006) as any person who surrenders 
to the authorities in connection with a wide range of offences, including firearms and 
explosives offences, offences under the PTA, certain offences under the Penal Code, or 
&#8220;under any emergency regulation&#8221;. &#8216;Surrender&#8217; is not specifically defined with reference to 
members of an armed group who surrender following hostilities.  
</p>
<p>1066. Under the law the designation of an individual as a &#8216;surrendee&#8217; leads automatically 
to one year of detention, purportedly for &#8216;rehabilitation&#8217; (regulation 22(6). The period of 
administrative detention for rehabilitation can be extended for up to a total of two years, 
after which release is mandatory unless criminal charges are brought (regulation 22(10)). 
Administrative detention of a &#8216;rehabilitee&#8217; may continue without judicial review or access 
to legal representation for up to two years. Before the expiry of two years of administrative 
detention, an individual can be criminally charged (regulation 22(12)). If convicted, 
sentencing by a judge can include a further period of rehabilitation or imprisonment 
(regulation 22(13)). 
</p>
<p>1067. In December 2009, the Attorney General&#8217;s office produced a document outlining a 
legal framework for the surrender, rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants based 
on regulation 22 of ER 2005. However we are informed that this document is not legally 
binding.  
</p>
<p>1068. The experts are further informed of the proposal in October 2010, of an &#8220;Action Plan 
for the Reintegration of Ex-Combatants&#8221;, according to which a first stage would consist of 
three to 24 months of rehabilitation in a Protective Accommodation and Rehabilitation 
Centre (PARC). The period of rehabilitation would depend on the ex-combatants&#8217; level of 
involvement with the LTTE and progress in rehabilitation. The second stage would be a 
period of community-based socio-economic reintegration. The Action Plan is yet to be 
approved by the cabinet. The establishment of the legal framework for implementing the 
Action Plan and processing the detainees, which is the responsibility of the Attorney 
General, remained incomplete. 
</p>
<p>1069. On 30 May 2000, the Government of Sri Lanka notified the United Nations 
Secretary General that it had made derogations to articles 9(2), 9(3), 12, 14(3), 17(1), 19(2), 
21 and 22(1) of the ICCPR. On 9 June 2010, the Government informed the Secretary 
General that it had removed all derogations except to article 9(3). 
</p>
<p>1070. The experts note that in the notification to the United Nations Secretary General 
your Excellency&#8217;s Government indicated that &#8220;As a result of the successful security 
operations launched by the Government of Sri Lanka, this situation ended in mid-May </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>176</b>  
</p>
<p>2009, with the elimination of the menace of terrorism posed by the ruthless organization 
styling itself the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). However, there does remain a 
need for vigilance to ensure the complete recovery of arms caches secreted by the LTTE 
and the reintegration back into society of LTTE cadres, after successfully completing 
programmes of rehabilitation and of vocational training.&#8221; We would like to bring to the 
attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government that international human rights law continues to 
apply to ex-combatants and in the treatment of suspects detained on grounds of national 
security and for the purposes of rehabilitation and reintegration.

an important part of the cooperation with her mandate, and urges the Government of Sri 
Lanka to transmit responses to the concerns raised in the above-mentioned 
communications. Concerning the first communication, the Special Rapporteur would 
appreciate detained information on any investigations and criminal proceedings carried out 
in relation to the deaths of the individuals named therein. In respect of the second 
communications, she reiterates her serious concern about the detention of thousands of 
persons alleged to be associated with LTTE allegedly with no possibility to accessing a 
lawyer and to challenge their detention. She stresses that any person arrested shall be 
prompty brought before a court and have access to a lawyer. The Special Rapporteur would 
greatly appreciate a response clarifying the situation of these detainees.

<p>Excellency&#8217;s Government, with specific regard to the cases of defendants who allegedly 
were children at the time of the attack on Omdurman. In this context, we would also like to 
raise more general concerns regarding the continued imposition of the death penalty against 
children in Sudan. 
</p>
<p>1083. In our letter of 11 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur drew the attention of your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government to the case of Mahmood Adam Zariba. At the trial, his defence 
counsel reportedly informed the court that he was aged 16 years at the time of the JEM 
attack. The counter terrorism court, however, reportedly did not grant a medical 
examination to determine his age. Mahmood Adam Zariba was sentenced to death on 31 
July 2008 by Anti-Terrorism Court 4 in Omdurman, having been found guilty on a range of 
offences under the 1991 Criminal Act, the 1986 Arms, Ammunitions and Explosives Act 
and the 2001 Counter-Terrorism Act. 
</p>
<p>1084. On 31 July 2008, Anti-Terrorism Court 3 in Bahri (Khartoum North) sentenced to 
death two additional defendants charged in relation with the attacks on Omdurman who, 
according to statements they reportedly made to their defence counsel, were aged 17 at the 
time of the offence. Both Mohamed Hashim Ali Abdu and Ishag Yaseen Ali Adam (whose 
mother gave his age as 16) were found to be over the age of 18 according to the views of a 
police medical committee. Members of the committee testified that the determination of 
Mohamed Hashim Ali Abdu&#8217;s age was based on the colour and number of his teeth; the 
committee testified that this methodology was also used in the case of Ishag Yaseen Ali 
Adam, as was an assessment of the deepness of his voice and an examination of his armpits 
for underarm hair. The court reportedly did not take into account doubt cast on the 
methodology of the medical committee during cross examination, and defence counsel 
were reportedly denied access to the prosecution&#8217;s evidence submissions of the committee&#8217;s 
findings.  
</p>
<p>1085. On 20 May 2009, Anti-Terrorism Court 3 in Bahri (Khartoum North) sentenced to 
death four additional defendants charged in relation with the attacks on Omdurman who, 
according to statements they reportedly made to their defence counsel, were aged 17 at the 
time of the offence. They are Abdelsalam Yahya Abdallah Adam, Mohamed Al Duma 
Yahya Abaker, Mohamed Al Taib Mustafa Al Sanousi, and Mansour Ibrahim Abaker 
Hashim. All four were found to be over the age of 18 according to the views of a police 
medical committee. Members of the committee testified in court that the defendants were 
not minors, but allegedly gave no details of the medical examinations conducted to allow 
them to reach this conclusion. Defence counsel challenged the adequacy of the medical 
examinations, but the court did not conduct any further inquiry. While the authorities have 
denied that any minors were sentenced to death in these trials, they have never produced 
court records nor medical certificates to show that adequate medical examinations had been 
conducted to assess the age of the above four defendants. The information received 
indicates that under Sudanese law neither the defence lawyers nor the interested public can 
demand disclosure of the court records in this respect. 
</p>
<p>1086. The case of Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam, raised in the communication of 
24 September 2008, is different from those described above in that the Khartoum Anti-
Terrorism Court which sentenced him to death on 17 August 2008, reportedly accepted his 
birth certificate, showing him to have been aged 17 at the time of the offence, as valid 
documentation of his age. The court, however, found him guilty of hiraba, or brigandage 
(Article 167 of the Sudanese Criminal Act), a <i>hudud </i>offence, and concluded that he could 
be sentenced to death in spite of his age. Article 27(2) of the Sudanese Criminal Act allows 
the death penalty to be applied for <i>hudud</i> crimes regardless of age. 
</p>
<p>1087. As mentioned in our communications dated 11 August and 24 September 2008, 
reports (which have remained unchallenged by your Excellency&#8217;s Government) indicate 
that the defendants in the trials concerning the attacks against Omdurman were held without </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>179 
</b></p>
<p>access to the outside world after their apprehension and were not given access to lawyers 
until after the trial proceedings opened. 
</p>
<p>1088. Turning to the general question of the imposition and execution of the death penalty 
for offences committed by children, the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; attention has been drawn to 
the case of Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed. According to the information received with 
regard to this case: 
</p>
<p>1089. On 3 May 2007, Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed, aged 17 at the time of the trial, 
was found guilty of murder and robbery and sentenced to death by the Nyala General Court 
in South Darfur. The Court reasoned that the Interim National Constitution and the 1991 
Criminal Act excluded hudud offences from the general ban against the death penalty for 
offenders aged less than 18 years at the time of the crime. The court concluded that, as the 
provisions of the Sudanese Constitution prevail over the provisions of any other domestic 
law, the victim&#8217;s family&#8217;s right to retribution (qisas) prevails over the 2004 Child Act which 
prohibits the death penalty for offences committed by minors. 
</p>
<p>1090. On appeal, the Nyala Appellate Court quashed the judgment and returned the case 
for reconsideration to the Nyala General Court. The Appeals Court argued that, although 
the child had been found guilty of murder, the imposition of the death sentence was not 
permissible according to the Child Act 2004. It instructed the Nyala General Court to apply 
the appropriate alternative measures stipulated in the Child Act, and to decide on the 
compensation (blood money) for the family of the deceased. 
</p>
<p>1091. The victim&#8217;s family, however, refused to accept compensation (blood money) as an 
alternative punishment for the offence, and appealed the Nyala Appellate Court&#8217;s decision 
instead. 
</p>
<p>1092. The case thus reached the Supreme Court in Khartoum, which in December 2008 
confirmed the decision of the Nyala General Court and the death sentence against 
Abdulrahaman Zakaria Mohammed. The Supreme Court based its decision on two 
arguments. First, it found that under both the Constitution and the 1991 Criminal Act the 
prohibition of the death penalty for children and those above age seventy did not extend to 
hudud offences. Second, the Supreme Court found that the definition of a child should be 
drawn from the definition of &#8220;adult&#8221; provided in the Criminal Act. According to the 
Criminal Act, &#8220;adult means any person whose puberty has been established by definite 
natural features and who has completed fifteen years of age, and whoever attains eighteen 
years of age shall be deemed an adult even if the features of puberty do not appear&#8221;. 
Therefore, as long as the defendant had reached 15 years of age and the natural puberty 
features had been established, the Criminal Act provisions applicable to adults should be 
applied, rather than the Child Act. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Nyala 
General Court and confirmed the death sentence against Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed. 
</p>
<p>1093. Abdulrahman Zakaria Mohammed was executed in El Fasher, North Darfur, on 14 
May 2009.

<p>1094. In a letter dated 18 March 2010, the Government acknowledged receipt of the 
communication and replied as follows: Letter dated 9 March 2010 from Dr. Abd al-
Man`am Mohammed, Rapporteur for the Advisory Council for Human Rights of the Sudan, 
addressed to the Permanent Mission of the Republic of the Sudan to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva, concerning urgent appeal UA G/SO 214 (3-3-16) G/SO 214 (33-27). The 
letter states that the Council received the correspondence from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs on 25 February 2010 and that it will take time to review the court reports and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

<p>prosecution procedures before a detailed reply can be provided, especially as some of the 
cases involved were processed in the States of Niyala, Fasher and Darfur. The author of the 
letter therefore asks for more time to be able to reply in detail and assures the Mission of 
the Council&#8217;s commitment to providing the necessary information in a fully transparent 
manner. 
</p>
<p>1095. In a letter dated 18 may 2010, the Government provided the following response to 
the communication:  
</p>
<p><i>(Translated from Arabic) 
</i></p>
<p>1096. Letter dated 9 May 2010 from the Advisory Council for Human Rights of the 
Republic of the Sudan addressed to the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Sudan, 
with copies to the Director of the Department for Human Rights and Women and Children, 
transmitting information (in the annex) on the incidents in Omdurman in May 2008 and on 
the cases of defendants who were allegedly children at the time of the attack. The author 
states that the Council needs more time to gather information on the case of Abddulrahman

</p>
<p>1098. With reference to the urgent appeal, transmitted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
from the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, concerning the above-
mentioned citizens who were tried for taking part in the attack on Omdurman in October 
2008 and sentenced to death even though they were under 18 at the time of trial, we wrote 
to the competent authorities about the matter and should like to provide you with the 
following information. 
</p>
<p>1099. According to information provided by the defendants during the preliminary 
investigation, all the defendants were over 18, except for Mohamed Jabar Al Dar Adam, 
who said that he was 17 but provided no proof of age. He did show all signs of having 
reached his majority, however. For these reasons, the court sent him to medical experts for 
an age assessment. They reported back that he was over 18, and therefore he was sent for 
trial and convicted under article 168 of the Criminal Code of 1991. 
</p>
<p>1100. The courts established that over 104 persons under the age of 18 were involved in 
the attack on Omdurman. These persons were sent before the juvenile courts and 
subsequently pardoned by the President of the Republic and released and returned to their 
families. </p>

<p>1101. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response. She welcomes the 
information that the 104 persons under the age of 18 who were found to be involved in the 
attack on Omdurman were tried before juvenile courts and pardoned by the President. She 
welcomes their release and the information that they were returned to their families. The 
Special Rapporteur further notes that the eight persons named in the communication had 
reached the age of eighteen at the time of their trial.  
</p>
<p>1102. With reference to the request made in the communication dated 10 February 2010 to 
provide information on the questions raised in the communication dated 10 October 2008, 
the Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to provide such response. In particular, 
replies are awaited on the question on the Southern Sudan legal aid system and steps taken 
to ensure that all persons sentenced to death are provided with legal counsel and informed 
of their right thereof, and of the right to be assigned legal couseil at not cost of they canot 
afford it; on the concerns raised in the aforementioned communication in respect of article 
130 of the 1991 Criminal Code and article 244 of the 2003 Code of Criminal Procedure. 
The Special Rapporteur would appreciate receiving a response to these outstanding 
questions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1103. On 18 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur 
on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Haithem al Maleh</b>, 78 years old. Mr. al 
Maleh has been a lawyer since the 1950s and in 2001 established the Human Rights 
Association in Syria (HRAS). Mr. al Maleh was the subject of two urgent appeals by 
several special procedures on 21 October 2009 and 23 February 2004. 
</p>
<p>1104. According to the new information received, during Mr. al Maleh's incommunicado 
detention at the General Security building (see previous communication of 21 October 
2009), he was detained in a room without food or drink and in which a number of torture 
tools were displayed. There, he was reportedly subject to an inquiry by high ranking 
officers of the General Intelligence, who questioned him extensively on an interview he 
gave to Barada TV on 12 October 2009 and articles he had written regarding his client Mr. 
Muhannad Al-Hassani, as well as other human rights work he had undertaken.  
</p>
<p>1105. On 19 October 2009, Mr. Haithem al Maleh was transferred to a branch of the 
Military Police in Qaboun, Damascus. On 3 November 2009, the Military General 
Prosecutor charged him with Articles 374 and 377 of the Criminal Law (Contempt of the 
Head of State&#8221;), Article 285 of the Criminal Law (Contempt of Public Administration), and 
Article 286 of the Criminal Law (Crime of disseminating false information affecting the 
morale of the nation). The military prosecution subsequently retained the charge under 
Article 286 of the Criminal Law, for which Mr. al Maleh remains in detention. According 
to the information received, his trial before the Military Court of Damascus is ongoing.  
</p>
<p>1106. Since 21 October 2009, Mr. al Maleh has been detained in Adra prison, Damascus. 
Information received suggests that in the first few weeks of his detention and again since 11 
February 2010, Mr. al Maleh, who suffers from diabetes and an overactive thyroid gland, 
has been refused his medication as prescribed by his doctors, causing a serious deterioration 
of his state of health. Reports received suggest that during his hearing before the military </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>182</b>  
</p>
<p>judge on 22 February 2010, Mr. al Maleh was so weak that he could hardly speak. In 
addition, he had fainted during hearings earlier in February.  
</p>
<p>1107. Mr. al Maleh was detained in a cell with approximately 60 people. The cell does not 
contain any beds, simply mattresses on the floor, which are shared by several detainees. 
Water in the prison was often cut off, meaning the detainees cannot wash for long periods 
and have to use the toilet without any water &#8211; leading to serious health risks.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>1108. In a letter dated 1 April 2010, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 18 March 2010 as follows. With regard to the letter asking for clarification about Syrian 
citizen Haithem Al-Maleh, the Government should like to explain that Mr. Al-Maleh was 
arrested by the competent authorities for committing unlawful acts which are punishable 
under the Syrian General Criminal Code. His arrest had nothing to do with his defending 
Muhannad Al-Hassani.  
</p>
<p>1109. According to the Syrian Code of Criminal Procedures, the courts may not pursue 
criminal proceedings against any citizen unless he or she has engaged a defence lawyer. 
Otherwise, the judicial body conducting the trial must ask the Bar Association to designate 
one of its lawyers to act, free of charge, as defence counsel in the case. The facts and the 
logic of the case disprove the false information which you have received from your sources. 
Mr. Al-Hassani has a number of lawyers acting as his legal representatives and defence 
team. None of these persons has been arrested for defending Mr. Al-Hassani. The 
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic fully respects the legal practice of defending 
accused persons in court and regards the legal profession as one of the noblest of all the 
human professions. In this connection, the Government should like to reiterate its views 
about the sources on which Special Procedures rely for information on issues relating to it 
cooperation with them. Most of these sources have no other aim than to damage the good 
name of the Syrian Arab Republic by submitting false information and making unfounded 
allegations about the Government. 
</p>
<p>1110. Mr. Haithem Al-Maleh was arrested for committing offences which are punishable 
under the Syrian General Criminal Code, namely, incitement and terrorization of others by 
disseminating false information in the Syrian Arab Republic and abroad with the aim of 
damaging the reputation of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic vis-&#224;-vis Syrian 
citizens and international organizations, undermining national unity in Syrian society and 
stirring up citizens against one another and against their Government. He was arrested and 
brought before the competent judicial body, namely, the Office of the Military Prosecutor 
in Damascus, which investigated the case. The Office discovered that, while committing 
these offences, Mr. Al-Maleh had also defamed the Syrian judiciary. Therefore, it filed 
proceedings against him for the following offences: (a) Defaming the judiciary, which is 
punishable under article 376 of the General Criminal Code; (b) Disseminating false 
information likely to weaken national sentiment, which is an offence under article 286, 
referring to article 285 of the General Criminal Code; and (c) Disseminating abroad false 
information likely to damage the prestige of the State, which is an offence under article 287 
of the General Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>1111. The case file was then sent to the chief military investigating judge in Damascus, 
who interviewed Mr. Al-Maleh about the allegations and confronted him with the evidence 
submitted by the Office of the Prosecutor. After the interview was completed, the 
investigating judge issued a decision, on 1 November 2009, formally charging Haithem Al-
Maleh with disseminating false information likely to weaken national sentiment, which is 
an offence under article 286, referring to article 285 of the General Criminal Code, 
defaming the judiciary, which is an offence under article 376 of the General Criminal Code, 
and disseminating abroad false information likely to damage the prestige of the State, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>183 
</b></p>
<p>which is an offence under article 287 of the General Criminal Code. The investigating 
judge&#8217;s decision was open to appeal at cassation. Indeed, Mr. Al-Maleh did appeal the 
decision through his defence lawyers. The appeal was lodged with the criminal division of 
the Syrian Court of Cassation, which is the highest court in the Syrian Arab Republic and 
has the final say as to whether this person should be tried by a criminal court or proceedings 
should be discontinued and he should be released. 
</p>
<p>1112. As for Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s health and the information in the letter that he suffers from 
diabetes and an overactive thyroid gland and is therefore in need of appropriate medical 
treatment and medicine, the Goverment should like to provide Special Rapporteurs with a 
categorical assurance that Mr. Al-Maleh is receiving appropriate medical treatment and 
care in prison at the hands of the prison doctor. In addition, should he, or any other prisoner 
in a Syrian prison, require the assistance of a medical specialist, the competent prison 
administration responsible for protecting prisoners&#8217; welfare will make sure that he is given 
a physical examination and is taken care of by medical specialists in the Syrian Arab 
Republic. In this regard, the Government should like to assure you that, in keeping with our 
values and our cultural and human heritage, we are required to provide prisoners with full 
humanitarian and health care, irrespective of the obligations set out in the relevant 
international treaties which the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic applies and by 
which it is bound. The Government views any failing in this regard not only as an 
infringement of international law and human rights but also a breach of values and morals. 
The Government hopes that Special Rapporteurs will always inform us of any allegation 
that they receive about any failing in this regard so that it may hold those responsible to 
account, if proven guilty. 
</p>
<p>1113. As for the information in the letter about Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s right to freedom of 
expression under international instruments, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic 
assures Special Rapporteurs that, just like other citizens, Mr. Al-Maleh exercises his full 
rights as a member of Syrian society, including his right to freedom of expression and 
opinion. We in the Syrian Arab Republic are fully committed to protecting this right, which 
is explicitly safeguarded under the Syrian Constitution. However, any citizen who steps 
over the internationally recognized limits on the right to freedom of expression by inciting 
others, stirring up fear, undermining national unity and the prestige of the State and 
defaming the judiciary shall be deemed to have committed a criminal act which is 
punishable under Syrian law and must be prosecuted by the courts. 
</p>
<p>1114. With regard to guaranteeing a fair trial before an impartial court, the Government 
must draw the attention of Special Rapporteurs to the fact that the laws of the Syrian Arab 
Republic are in conformity with all international treaties and norms and are entirely in line 
with the laws in effect in most countries of the world. The Government can also assure the 
Special Rapporteurs that it has a firmly established judiciary and judges who are impartial, 
enjoy complete immunity and have full authority in the exercise of their functions. Any 
person who infringes the law is subject to the authority conferred on the courts by the 
Constitution and the law, which regulate all decisions, procedures and judgements of the 
courts with a view to protecting Syrian society and safeguarding human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur: 
</b></p>
<p>1115. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its response. She would 
appreciate receiving substantive information regarding the prosecution of Mr. al Maleh as a 
civilian under the military jurisdiction and how it complies with international standards, as 
laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Human Rights 
Committee General Comment No. 32 (para. 22) and its decision No. 1172/2003 (Madani <i>vs.</i> 
Algeria), as referred to in the communication sent to the Government. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>1116. On 6 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the sentencing of <b>Mr. 
Muhannad al-Hasani</b>, President of the Syrian Human Rights Organization and 
Commissioner of the International Commission of Jurists, to three years imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>1117. The case of Mr. Al-Hassani has previously been addressed by the Special 
Procedures Mechanisms in the communications dated 3 August 2009 and 10 December 
2009. In these communications, concern was raised that the disbarment and criminal 
charges against Mr. Al-Hasani were reportedly related to his peaceful and legitimate 
activities in defense of human rights, including as a lawyer. [Two responses have been 
received to the communication dated 10 December 2009. The second dated 29 July 2010 
which was sent during the reporting period is summarized below.] 
</p>
<p>1118. According to information the Special Rapporteurs have now received, the Second 
Criminal Court started hearing the case of Mr. Al-Hasani on 18 February 2010, on the 
charges of &#8220;weakening national sentiments and encouraging racist and sectarian feelings&#8221;, 
and &#8220;transferring false and exaggerated news that weaken national sentiments&#8221; under 
Articles 285, 286 and 287 of the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>1119. Five subsequent hearings were conducted on 10 March, 6 April, 4 May, 27 May and 
6 June. The final hearing and sentencing took place on 23 June 2010, and he was sentenced 
to three years imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>1120. According to information received, a number of procedural fair trial guarantees were 
not complied with during the trial. The defense lawyers called 11 (eleven) witnesses to 
testify during the trial and it is alleged that the President of the Second Criminal Court 
denied all defense witnesses from testifying and did not take into account the evidence 
submitted by the defense. The conviction of Mr. Al-Hasani was based on three secret 
reports of the General Intelligence Service, even though defence lawyers had presented 
credible evidence undermining the authenticity of the reports. Further Mr. Al-Hasani&#8217;s 
lawyers were not allowed to visit and meet with him in jail without authorization from the 
Bar Association. On several occasions, the Bar Association refused to his lawyers to visit 
him in jail. During consultations with his lawyer there was a prison guard present.  
</p>
<p><b>  Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>1121. In a letter dated 29 July 2010, in response to the previous communication sent on 10 
December 2009 concerning the same case, the Government provided information as 
follows. With regard to the information that you have received in respect of Mr. Muhannad 
al-Hasani, a lawyer, we hereby inform you that at the Disciplinary Committee of the 
Damascus Branch of the Bar Association held a hearing on 10 November 2009, presided 
over by the Branch President and attended by six lawyers in addition to Mr. Al-Hasani&#8217;s 
legal representatives, namely, Mr. Haitham al-Malih, Mr. Hasan Abd al-Azim and Mr. 
Radif Mustafa. The hearing was held pursuant to the Chairman of the Bar&#8217;s decision to 
initiate disciplinary action against Mr. Al-Hasani and transfer him to the Disciplinary 
Committee of the Damascus Branch of the Bar Association. Annexed to that decision were 
17 statements published on the Internet and attributed to the &#8220;Syrian Organization for 
Human Rights&#8221;, an organization of which Mr. Al-Hasani presided without having obtained 
the necessary legal authorizations, in violation of Act No. 39 regulating the legal profession 
and its rules of procedure. The said Act prohibits any lawyer from founding an association 
or forum without having first notified his branch of the Bar Association and obtained 
formal authorization from the competent authorities. Mr. Al-Hasani was invited to appear 
before the lawyer assigned to investigate his case, but failed to attend. We wish to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>185 
</b></p>
<p>underscore that the Disciplinary Committee initiated purely disciplinary action against Mr. 
Al-Hasani, not criminal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>1122. The above confirms that the alleged information contained in the case file is 
inaccurate. A formal complaint was brought against Mr. Al-Hasani not because he was 
monitoring open trials and documenting trial proceedings without being mandated to do so 
or without being involved in those trials; that is a matter for the courts, not the Bar 
Association. It was decided, in the presence of his lawyers, to disbar Mr. Al-Hasani for 
professional misconduct in accordance with the Bar Association Regulatory Act, which is 
broadly consistent with international norms and standards having been drafted by leading 
Syrian lawyers in line with the legislation regulating the legal profession in most countries 
of the world. The decisions of the Committee, which is established in accordance with that 
Act, cannot therefore be subject to any political or personal considerations. In the course of 
its history, the Bar Association has taken numerous decisions to disbar lawyers for 
professional misconduct under the Bar Association Regulatory Act. 
</p>
<p>1123. It should be noted that if it is ascertained that Mr. Al-Hasani has been in any way 
wronged, he is fully entitled to appeal to the Committee, which serves as a supreme court 
and would certainly redress any injustice. 
</p>
<p>1124. In a letter dated 31 November 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 6 July 2010 as follows. In paragraph 4 of your letter of 6 July 2010, 
addressed to us with regard to the situation of Mr. Muhannad al-Hasani, you requested 
detailed information in relation to the concerns raised in your earlier communications, to 
which the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic has replied in detail describing Mr. Al-
Hasani&#8217;s legal situation and the charges against him in full.  
</p>
<p>1125. We hereby reaffirm that he was arrested for an offence punishable under the Syrian 
General Criminal Code, namely, spreading false and exaggerated information in order to 
discredit and damage the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, at the national and at 
the international level, with the aim of destabilizing the Syrian Arab Republic, inciting the 
international community against the Syrian Government and undermining national unity. 
Mr. Al-Hasani exploited his status as a lawyer and used the defence of human rights as a 
cover whilst perpetrating these acts. He distorted and falsely represented Supreme State 
Security Court and other court proceedings in news items stories that bore little relation to 
the facts of the trials that he attended. He did so in order to present himself as a human 
rights defender and draw attention to himself, at the expense of his country&#8217;s reputation; 
however, he was far from being truthful, fair and balanced as would befit a defender of 
human rights. In this connection, we wish to underscore that Supreme State Security Court 
trials in the Syrian Arab Republic are open and are attended by numerous European 
diplomats assigned by their embassies. Mr. Al-Hasani&#8217;s case, therefore, was transferred to 
the Office of the Public Prosecutor in Damascus, which assessed the initial investigation 
and the evidence before it. The Office of the Public Prosecutor decided to institute public 
proceedings against him for detracting from the reputation of the State, undermining 
national sentiment, spreading false and exaggerated information in the Syrian Arab 
Republic and abroad and establishing illegal ties; these are offences under articles 275, 285, 
286 and 287 of the Syrian General Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>1126. Mr. Al-Hasani&#8217;s case was reviewed by the first investigating judge in Damascus 
who had conducted the investigation and collected and examined the evidence. He decided 
on 12 October 2009, on the facts of the case and the evidence, that the case brought by the 
Public Prosecutor was correct with regard to the legal qualification of the allegations 
against Mr. Al-Hasani. He therefore decided to refer the case to the urgent applications 
judge, in accordance with the Syrian Code of Criminal Procedure, to consider issuing an 
indictment, whereupon the case would be referred to the Criminal Court in Damascus. The 
urgent applications judge in Damascus then considered the facts of the case and the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>186</b>  
</p>
<p>evidence and decided to issue an indictment against Mr. Al-Hasani and to bring him to trial 
before the Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>1127. An appeal against Mr. Al-Hasani&#8217;s indictment was submitted to the Syrian Court of 
Cassation, which is the highest judicial authority in the Syrian Arab Republic. Its decision 
as to whether or not Mr. Al-Hasani is tried by the Criminal Court as it deems compatible 
with Syrian law is final. 
</p>
<p>1128. With regard to the questions raised in your most recent letter, the course of Mr. Al-
Hasani&#8217;s trial is set out below, from the start. 
</p>
<p>1129. The urgent applications judge submitted the appeal to the Court of Cassation, which, 
having considered it, decided to endorse the indictment. The case was subsequently referred 
to the Second Criminal Court in Damascus for consideration of the allegations against Mr. 
Al-Hasani. Based on the outcome of the trial, the court decided to acquit him of the charge 
of establishing illegal ties, which is an offence under article 275 of the Criminal Code, for 
lack of evidence. It decided to convict him of spreading information in the Syrian Arab 
Republic that would harm the nation and weaken national sentiment, both of which are 
serious offences under articles 285 and 286 of the Criminal Code. Mr. Al-Hasani was duly 
sentenced to 3 years&#8217; imprisonment for these offences. In addition, the court decided to 
convict him of spreading exaggerated information abroad that would discredit the State, 
which is an offence under article 286 (1) of the Criminal Code, and sentenced him to 6 
months&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of 100 Syrian pounds. The court decided to merge and 
implement the most severe of these penalties, namely, 3 years&#8217; imprisonment. The Criminal 
Court issued its decision on 23 February 2010; in the body of the decision, it discussed the 
facts and defences brought by the public prosecution, represented by the Office of the 
Public Prosecutor, and by the accused, represented by his defence counsel.  
</p>
<p>1130. In your letter, you state that &#8220;the defence lawyers called 11 witnesses to testify 
during the trial and it is alleged that the President of the Second Criminal Court denied all 
defence witnesses from testifying and did not take into account the evidence submitted by 
the defence. The conviction of Mr. Al-Hasani was based on three secret reports of the 
General Intelligence Service&#8221; and &#8220;procedural fair trial guarantees were not complied 
with&#8221;. In this connection, we assure you that the information that you have received from 
your sources is incorrect and distorted. In fact, Mr. Al-Hasani&#8217;s defence requested that a 
number of people be heard as witnesses so that those persons could deny his criminal 
intent. The court turned down this request as the court alone is competent to interpret 
criminal intent. The available evidence against Mr. Al-Hasani was compelling written 
evidence of bad faith and criminal intent and did not need anyone to interpret or explain 
them. The remarks concerning the three secret General Intelligence reports are completely 
false; once the contents of the case file are available for judicial review, all involved in the 
prosecution and the defence have access to it. There are no secret reports; it was General 
Intelligence that conducted the initial investigation into Mr. Al-Hasani and General 
Intelligence that submitted its findings to the Office of the Public Prosecutor in Damascus, 
with numerous pieces of written evidence. Mr. Al-Hasani did not refute but recognized and 
confessed most of that evidence, at all stages of the investigation and the trial. He did, 
however, deny that he had illegal ties and that he had received funds from certain parties. 
The court reviewed his statement, as the initial investigation had not provided sufficient 
evidence of these crimes, and decided to acquit him of this charge. The court&#8217;s decision to 
convict Mr. Al-Hasani for the other charges was not based on any secret reports, but on the 
ample evidence and on his confessions. 
</p>
<p>1131. In addition, we assure you that the defence counsel did not put forward any credible 
evidence that would cast doubt on the validity of the evidence submitted by the public 
prosecution and we again express our strong reservations concerning your description of 
some of the evidence presented openly in the case as secret reports. Moreover, we assure </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>187 
</b></p>
<p>you that Mr. Al-Hasani was not prevented from meeting with his defence counsel; they 
remained in quiet, continuous communication with him in prison and during the trial 
hearings, without any interference or hindrance.  
</p>
<p>1132. An appeal against the decision of the Criminal Court in respect of Mr. Al-Hasani&#8217;s 
case has been lodged with the Syrian Court of Cassation and is currently under 
consideration. The Court of Cassation is the highest judicial authority in Syria and is 
competent to determine the extent to which the trial of Mr. Al-Hasani was, or was not, 
compatible with the law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>1133. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for the 
response to the previous communication, received on 29 July 2010 and for the response to 
the communication dated 6 July 2010. She would appreciate receiving information on the 
conduct and outcome of t Mr. Al-Hasani&#8217;s trial before the Court of Cassation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1134. On 13 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with The Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the 
arrest, and alleged disappearance of <b>Mr. Ismail Abdi</b>. Mr. Abdi is a lawyer and member of 
the board of trustees of the Committees for the Defence of Democracy Freedoms and 
Human Rights in Syria (CDDFHRS), and has written numerous articles concerning the 
situation of human rights in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>1135. According to the information received, on 23 August 2010, Mr. Abdi was arrested 
by members of the Amn al Dawla (State Security Forces) in Aleppo Airport, Syrian Arab 
Republic, as he attempted to return from the Syrian Arab Republic to his residence in 
Germany, along with his wife and three of his children. Since his arrest, Mr. Abdi's family 
and colleagues have received no information regarding neither his location nor his fate. 
</p>
<p>1136. It was reported that while in the airport, Mr. Abdi was taken aside by members of 
the Amn al Dawla for a security check, before being taken away by the security agents 
without being able to communicate further with his family.  
</p>
<p>1137. Upon inquiring at the time of arrest as to where Mr. Abdi would be taken, Mr. 
Abdi's family members were reportedly informed by a member of the Amn al Dawla that 
he would probably be taken to the State Security headquarters in Qamishli. However, when 
asked, officials at said headquarters denied holding anyone by the name of Ismail Abdi. 
</p>
<p>1138. Mr. Abdi's family had expressed concern that the arrest and alleged disappearance 
are related to his work on CDDFHRS' publication, in February 2010, of a list of some 600 
names of individuals who had allegedly been tortured and killed in Syrian prisons between 
2008 and 2010. 
</p>
<p>1139. Concern was expressed that the arrest and alleged disappearance of Mr. Abdi are 
related to his peaceful and legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular 
with respect to the aforementioned publication.  Furthermore, mindful of the fact that the 
location of Mr. Abdi's detention allegedly remains unknown and the lack of any formal 
charges brought against him, concern was expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity. </p>

<p>1140. In a letter dated 1 December 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 13 October 2010 as follows. With regard to the information that you have received 
in respect of Mr. Isma&#8217;il Abdi, a lawyer, we hereby inform you that Mr. Abdi was lawfully 
arrested on 23 August 2010 for publishing inflammatory articles that seek to undermine 
respect for the State, national sentiment and national unity, for bringing the country into 
disrepute abroad, for attacking the system of government in Syria and for communicating 
with Al-Mustaqillah and Al Jazeera satellite channels and making statements on the so-
called persecution of the Kurds in the Syrian Arab Republic that would encourage the 
spread of sectarianism. 
</p>
<p>1141. Mr. Abdi was duly transferred to the Syrian courts, where the required legal action 
will be taken against him by means of an impartial and fair trial. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>1142. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for the 
reply to her communication of 6 July 2010. She reiterates her concern at the situation of 
Mr. Abdi and urges the Government to provide information about his fate and whereabouts 
and whether his family has been informed thereof. She would also appreciate detailed 
information on any investigations and criminal proceedings initiated in relation to this case 
and indicate how they comply with international norms and standards as stated, <i>inter alia</i>, 
in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Basic Principles on the 
Role of Lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1143. On 9 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an 
urgent appeal regarding the situation of<b> Mr. Haytham Al-Maleh</b>. Mr. Al-Maleh, aged 79, 
has been a lawyer since the 1950s and in 2001 founded the Human Rights Association in 
Syria (HRAS).  
</p>
<p>1144. Mr. Al-Maleh was the subject of a Joint Urgent Appeal from the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
dated 23 February 2004; a Joint Urgent Appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
in human, or degrading treatment or punishment dated 21 October 2009; and a Joint Urgent 
Appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of Judges and Lawyers; the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, in human, or 
degrading treatment or punishment dated 18 March 2010. The response of your 
Excellency&#8217;s government to the Joint Urgent Appeals dated 21 October 2009 and 18 March 
2010 was received on 1 April 2010 and summarized above. 
</p>
<p>1145. According to information now received, on 4 July 2010, Mr. Haytham Al-Maleh 
was sentenced to three years imprisonment by a Syrian Military Court, on charges of 
disseminating false information which could harm the nation.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>189 
</b></p>
<p>1146. Concerns have been expressed regarding the fairness of Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s trial before 
a Military Court, given that Mr. Al-Maleh holds no military status, and the crime of which 
he was found guilty was not of a military nature. Furthermore, the Code of Military 
Procedures, in accordance with which Mr. Al-Maleh was sentenced, allegedly fails to offer 
many of the fair trial guarantees stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Syrian Code of Criminal Procedures. 
</p>
<p>1147. On 15 October 2010, the appeal lodged by Mr. Al Maleh&#8217;s lawyer was rejected by 
the Damascus Appeals Court, Military Room. It is reported that Mr. Al-Maleh has no 
further recourse to appeal within Syria. 
</p>
<p>1148. Serious concerns have also been expressed regarding Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s treatment 
while in detention and the conditions in which he is detained. Mr. Al-Maleh suffers from 
diabetes and an overactive thyroid gland, and it is alleged that, while he has been provided 
with some medication, he reportedly continues to be denied access to the medication 
specifically prescribed to him for his illnesses by his doctors. We hereby acknowledge 
receipt of the response provided by your Excellency&#8217;s Government on 1 April 2010 
concerning the medical assistance provided to Mr. Al-Maleh.  However, we regret that the 
response did not provide substantive information regarding allegations indicating that Mr. 
Al-Maleh is being denied the specific medical assistance as prescribed by his doctors.   
</p>
<p>1149. It was reported that Mr. Al-Maleh shares a cell with as many as 60 other prisoners, 
in which there are no beds and a limited number of mattresses, and that the water in the 
prison is often cut off, leading to health risks. It is also reported that Mr. Al-Maleh has 
developed a degenerative knee infection, back problems, and recurrent influenza.  
</p>
<p>1150. Given Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s age, state of health and the conditions in which it is alleged 
that he is detained, serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity. Concern was also expressed that the rejection of the appeal against Mr. Al-
Maleh&#8217;s sentence may be related to his legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human 
rights, including as a lawyer. In this connection, further concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned decision forms part of a pattern of ongoing judicial harassment against 
human rights defenders and lawyers in Syria.

<p>1152. On 11 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers , sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of <b>Mr. Muhannad Al-Hassani</b>, 
President of the Syrian Human Rights Organization &#8220;Sawasiya&#8221; and a Commissioner of the 
International Commission of Jurists, currently serving a three year prison sentence for 
&#8220;weakening national sentiments and encouraging racist and sectarian feelings&#8221;, and 
&#8220;transferring false and exaggerated news that weaken national sentiments&#8221;. In October 
2010, Mr. Al-Hassani received the 2010 Martin Ennals Award for human rights defenders 
and the Dean Award of the Amsterdam Bar Association.  
</p>
<p>1153. The case of Mr. Al-Hassani has previously been addressed by the Special 
Procedures Mechanisms in a Joint Urgent Appeal sent by the Vice-Chair Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the Special Rapporteur on the </p>

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment dated 3 August 2009; a Joint Urgent Appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders; the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers; and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, dated 10 December 2009; and 
a Joint Urgent Appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers dated 6 
July 2010. In these communications concern was raised that the disbarment, charges, trial 
and sentencing of Mr. Al-Hassani were related to his peaceful and legitimate activities in 
defence of human rights, including as a lawyer. The response of the Government to the 
communication dated 10 December 2009, was received on 29 July 2010. 
</p>
<p>1154. According to information now received, on 28 October 2010, Mr. Muhannad Al-
Hassani, who reportedly shares a cell with at least 30 convicted criminals, was attacked and 
severely beaten by a cell-mate, whose name is known to us. The attack reportedly caused a 
wound in his forehead which required ten stitches, as well as swelling of his left eye and 
cheek. The alleged attacker is reported to be serving a prison sentence for rape, armed 
robbery and forming a criminal gang. As he assaulted Mr. Al-Hassani, the perpetrator 
allegedly accused him of being an agent for a foreign entity and not being a Syrian 
nationalist.  
</p>
<p>1155. It is reported that the prison authorities subsequently launched an investigation into 
the assault. However, it is alleged that in the process of the said investigation, comments 
made by the alleged attacker before the investigation committee in which he threatened to 
kill Mr. Al-Hassani were not recorded in the charge sheet. It is further alleged that despite 
making a request to transfer the alleged perpetrator to another cell, Mr. Al-Hassani remains 
imprisoned in the same cell along with his attacker. 
</p>
<p>1156. On 29 October 2010, the day following the attack, the Penal Chamber at the Court of 
Cassation reportedly rejected Mr. Al-Hassani&#8217;s appeal, confirming the three-year sentence 
passed by the Second Damascus Criminal Court on 23 June 2010, and leaving Mr. Al-
Hassani with no further legal recourse within the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>1157. Given the serious risk that Mr. Al-Hassani may be subjected to further attacks, grave 
concern was expressed for his life, and physical and psychological integrity. Further 
concern was expressed that both the attack against Mr. Al-Hassani and subsequent rejection 
of his appeal before the Court of Cassation may have been related to his legitimate and 
peaceful activities in defence of human rights, particularly as a lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received

<p>1158. At the time this report was finalized, no response to this communication has been

</b></p>
<p>1159. On 12 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning the situation of <b>Ms. Eliaza al-Saleh</b>, a mother of three teenagers, who was 
sentenced to death on 29 September 2009, by the Military Criminal Court in Homs for 
acting as an accomplice in the murder of her husband, Fouad al-Naqari, on 26 July 2007. 
The sentence was confirmed by the Court of Cassation on 2 March 2010. Information now </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>191 
</b></p>
<p>made available to us indicates that she has been moved from her cell to prepare for her 
execution.  
</p>
<p>1160. According to the information received, Ms. Al Saleh is the victim of several years of 
spousal, physical and sexual abuse by her husband, Fouad al-Naqari. It is reported that, on 
at least one occasion, Mr. Al Naqari had forced Ms. Al Saleh to sleep with his debtor in 
order to defray a debt he owed them. It is also alleged that Mr. Al Naqari would humiliate 
her by stripping her naked and ordering her to get things for him by carrying them in her 
mouth. On another occasion Mr. Al Naqari brought another woman home and, when Ms. 
Al Saleh disapproved of this, he slapped her and ordered her to crawl around the house in 
front of the other woman. It is also reported that Mr. Al Naqari raped and frequently beat 
her, with various items including a knife, which resulted in a tear in her mouth, a broken rib 
and broken shoulder.  
</p>
<p>1161. During interrogation it is alleged that she confessed to the charge that she had acted 
as an accomplice to her husband&#8217;s killing even though she subsequently denied the charge 
during trial. In any case, the court did not examine the circumstances of the offense, 
including the possible mitigating circumstances.

the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Ziad 
Wasef Ramadan</b>, who has been detained for over five years without any charge, trial or 
even been presented before a judge, and who is to be presented before the State Security 
Supreme Court on Monday, 17 January 2011. 
</p>
<p>1164. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention recently considered, in its Opinion No. 
24/2010, that Mr. Ramadan's detention was arbitrary.  
</p>
<p>1165. According to the information received: it was reported that Mr. Ramadan would be 
under strong pressure from the authorities not to allow any lawyers to defend him and 
accept any eventual charges to be laid against him.  
</p>
<p>1166. In fact, the source reports that Mr. Ramadan's lawyers have not been authorized to 
see him. His family has had only very brief contact with him. 
</p>
<p>1167. Concerns have been expressed that international norms relating to the right to a fair 
trial not would be observed during this hearing and any subsequent trial. In this connection, 
we would like to refer Your Excellency's Government to the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary, adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 
September 1985 and endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 
1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985. In particular principle 6 which provides that &#8220;The

</b></p>
<p>1169. On 9 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; and Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the detention of and 
charges against <b>Mr. Ali Al-Abdullah</b>, member of the National Council of the Damascus 
Declaration for National Democratic Change, a legislative body composed of numerous 
opposition groups and activists who have been advocating for democratic reforms in the 
Syrian Arab Republic. Mr. Al-Abdullah has allegedly been imprisoned on three previous 
occasions: he spent six months in detention after returning from abroad to live in the Syrian 
Arab Republic in the 1990s; he served almost six months in prison in 2005 for his 
involvement with the Jamal al-Atassi Forum, where he read out a statement by the exiled 
Muslim Brotherhood leader who called for pluralism and human rights to be respected in 
the Syrian Arab Republic; and he served a six-month sentence in 2006 for having 
participated in a protest outside the Supreme Security Court (SSSC) against the trials that 
do not comply with international fair trial standards. 
</p>
<p>1170. According to recent information received, on 17 December 2007, Mr. Ali Al-
Abdullah was detained by State security officials after he and others associated with the 
Damascus Declaration met to elect a new executive committee. He was sentenced by a 
criminal court in Damascus, together with 11 other activists, to two and a half years of 
imprisonment on vaguely defined charges of &#8220;weakening the national sentiment&#8221; and 
&#8220;spreading false or exaggerated news that would affect the morale of the country&#8221; (article 
286 of the Penal Code).  
</p>
<p>1171. During his detention, Mr. Al-Abdullah wrote an article criticizing the Islamic 
Republic of Iran&#8217;s Wilayat-al-Faqih doctrine, which grants absolute political authority to a 
religious figure, as well as alleged human rights violations committed during the 
presidential election in the Islamic Republic of Iran. On 23 August 2009, the article 
reportedly appeared online, and on 19 April 2010, Mr. Al-Abdullah was allegedly 
interrogated by a prosecutor from the State Security Court. In June 2009, he also allegedly 
made a statement via telephone to the Italian AKI news agency in which he praised the 
elections that had taken place in Lebanon and then criticized the Iranian authorities&#8217; use of 
excessive force against peaceful protestors demonstrating that month against the disputed 
presidential election results. 
</p>
<p>1172. On 17 June 2010, at the end of their prison terms, all detainees were released, except 
for Mr. Al-Abdullah. He was informed by the officials of Political Security, one of Syrian 
Arab Republic&#8217;s security services, that his case will be referred to the military prosecutor 
for new charges relating to the article that he wrote on the Islamic Republic of Iran. On 19 
September 2010, he was charged by a military investigative judge with &#8220;spoiling Syria&#8217;s 
relations with another country&#8221; (article 278 of the Penal Code), for which, if found guilty, 
he could be sentenced to up to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment. On 1 December 2010, a military 
court confirmed the charge.  
</p>
<p>1173. On 7 February 2011, a hearing took place before the Second Criminal Military Court 
in Damascus, where the judge informed Mr. Al-Abdullah that the charge of &#8220;spoiling 
Syria&#8217;s relations with another country&#8221; relate to his statement regarding the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. His lawyers have allegedly been unable to meet him without an officer 
from the security forces monitoring their conversations. Additionally, his lawyers have not 
had access to the full case file. His next hearing is scheduled to take place on 23 February 
2011.  
</p>
<p>1174. Concern is expressed that Mr. Ali Al-Abdullah has been sentenced for peacefully 
expressing his opinions and in connection to his work in defence of human rights and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

on broad charges, as well as his physical and psychological integrity.

<p>1176. On 18 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; and Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding the sentencing of <b>Ms. Tal al-Mallohi</b>, a 19-year-old high school student and 
blogger. Her blog <i>(http://talmallohi.blogspot.com)</i> contains poems and commentary on 
social and political issues. Ms. al-Mallohi does not belong to any political group.  
</p>
<p>1177. According to information received, on 27 December 2009, Ms. al-Mallohi was 
summoned to Damascus for interrogation by Syrian Arab Republic&#8217;s State Security (Branch 
279) relating to an article she published on her blog. She was immediately detained without 
charge. Two days later, on 29 December 2009, members of State Security reportedly went 
to Ms. al-Mallohi&#8217;s house and confiscated her computer, CDs, books, and other personal 
effects. She was held in incommunicado detention at an undisclosed location without 
charge or access to her family for the first nine months of her detention. Her family was 
allowed to visit her once at Doma prison in Damascus on 30 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>1178. On 5 October 2010, it was reported that Ms. al-Mallohi had been charged with 
spying for a foreign country. On 14 February 2011, Ms. al-Mallohi appeared before 
Damascus State Security Court in a closed trial, and was sentenced to five years of 
imprisonment for &#8220;divulging information to a foreign State.&#8221; The court did not disclose any 
evidence nor details of the reason behind the verdict. The State Security Court&#8217;s verdict is 
final and there is no possibility of appeal. Since 30 September 2010, other than during her 
court appearance, Ms. al-Mallohi is being held in solitary confinement in Doma prison. 
</p>
<p>1179. Concern is expressed that Ms. al-Mallohi was held in incommunicado detention 
without charge for nine months, sentenced to five years of imprisonment on unclear 
charges, and now held in solitary confinement because of articles posted on her blog. While 
we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, we wish to draw your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government attention to the right to physical and mental integrity of Ms. Tal 
al-Mallohi.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1181. On 23 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel,

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>194</b>  
</p>
<p>Kurdish origin. Mr. Ismail writes frequently about the treatment of Kurds in the Syrian 
Arab Republic and Turkey for a number of foreign-based websites. 
</p>
<p>According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>1182. On 12 December 2009, Mr. Mustafa Ismail was arrested at the Air Force Security 
Branch in Aleppo, where he went following an order from the local security office in Ain 
Arab. 
</p>
<p>1183. On 17 December 2009, members of his family went to the same Air Force Security 
Branch in Aleppo to look for him. However, they were told that Mr. Ismail was not there 
and were instead ordered to leave. 
</p>
<p>1184. During the past few months, Mr. Ismail has been questioned several times by 
members of different security services such as by the Political Security Branch on 3 
October, the Military Security Branch on 5 October and the State Security Branch on 7 and 
8 November. During those sessions, questions had reportedly surrounded his work for the 
media, particularly phone interviews he had given to a European-based Kurdish satellite TV 
station, Roj TV. 
</p>
<p>1185. On 11 December 2009, Mr. Ismail had posted an article on the website of Levant 
News citing the order to report to the Air Force Security Branch in Aleppo and pointing to 
the numerous times that he has been summoned for questioning to security offices since 
2000. 
</p>
<p>1186. So far, the authorities have not acknowledged that Mr. Ismail is in detention or 
provided any other explanation. 
</p>
<p>1187. .In light of Mr. Ismail&#8217;s prolonged incommunicado detention, concern is expressed 
for his physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>1188. By letter dated 29 June 2010, the Government replied to the communication 
summarized above as follows. 
</p>
<p><i>(Translated from Arabic) 
</i></p>
<p>1189. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic thanks you for your concern and 
appreciates your efforts to monitor human rights violations throughout the world. It is 
pleased to cooperate with you in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and international norms 
and standards and in accordance with your mandate as set out in the various Human Rights 
Council resolutions. 
</p>
<p>1190. With regard to the information that you have received in respect of Mr. Mustafa 
Isma`il, we wish to clarify that Mr. Isma`il is a Syrian citizen who enjoys his full rights as 
guaranteed by the Syrian Constitution and under Syrian law. Under Syrian law, all Syrian 
citizens are granted their rights to freedom and to engage in lawful activities; in return, they 
are subject to Syrian laws, which impose penalties on any person who commits an unlawful 
act. 
</p>
<p>1191. In view of the above, and in view of the unlawful acts committed by Mr. Isma`il, 
which are punishable under the Syrian Criminal Code, he was arrested on 12 December 
2009 by the competent authorities for investigation. He was subsequently transferred to the 
Office of the Military Public Prosecutor in Aleppo, with the record of the investigation into 
his case, where it was decided to institute public proceedings against him on the basis of the 
documents available and the investigation into two offences, namely: (1) Engaging in acts 
that would harm Syrian relations with a foreign State, under article 278 of the General </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>195 
</b></p>
<p>Criminal Code; (2) Membership of a prohibited political party, under article 267 of the 
General Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>1192. The case for prosecution and the preliminary investigation file were presented to the 
military investigating officer in Aleppo, who conducted a judicial investigation into Mr. 
Isma`il&#8217;s case and, consequently, decided to remand him in custody for the two offences 
that he is alleged to have committed. The case remains under consideration. 
</p>
<p>1193. With regard to the assertion in your letter that Mr. Isma`il was held incommunicado 
and the concern that you expressed for his physical and psychological health, we wish to 
reiterate our hope that you take into consideration that most of the sources upon which you 
rely for information in respect of the Syrian Arab Republic provide you with false 
information and incorrect facts, and that you attend to those sources accordingly. Mr. 
Isma`il was not held incommunicado but was treated as other prisoners in the Syrian Arab 
Republic are treated in accordance with all of the international standards for the treatment 
of prisoners. We also wish to reassure you with regard to Mr. Isma`il&#8217;s physical and 
psychological health that he receives the same medical care in prison as he would if he 
were not in prison. In prisons, full-time physicians attend to the health of prisoners and 
provide them with health care and psychological care; any prisoner with a health condition 
is treated immediately. In this regard, we hope that you will not hesitate to notify us should 
you receive information that any harm has been done so that those responsible can be held 
to account, should it be proven. 
</p>
<p>1194. Lastly, we wish to emphasize that Mr. Isma`il is a Syrian citizen and is protected by 
the Syrian Constitution and Syrian laws. He is subject to the judicial procedures set out in 
Syrian criminal law, which is consistent with all international conventions, charters and 
standards and with the common practice of most countries of the world. We wish to 
underscore that should an investigating judge find during the investigation that there is 
sufficient evidence to charge him and bring him to trial before the criminal court, then Mr. 
Isma`il will be subject to a fair trial before a fair and impartial court. In addition, we wish to 
reaffirm that we are committed to continued cooperation with you and to replying to all 
your questions so that we can achieve our common goals of promoting and protecting 
human rights and fundamental freedoms.

<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>1195. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response provided by the Government to the 
communication dated 23 December 2009. She would appreciate receicing updated 
information on judicial proceedings in relation to this case, in particular on the question 
whether Mr. Ismail has had access to court to determine the legality of his detention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Concluding comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>1196. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for the 
responses to the communications dated 18 March, 16 July and 13 October 2010. However, 
she regrets the absence of response to six of the nine communications sent during the 
reporting period, notably on 9, 11 and 12 November 2010, on 18 January 2011 and on 9 
and 18 February 2011. The Special Rapporteur considers response to her communications 
as an important part of the cooperation with her mandate, and calls upon the Government of 
the Syrian Arab Republic to transmit responses to the outstanding communications at the 
earliest possible date. 
</p>
<p>1197. She expresses concern at the numerous and increasing reports of human rights 
violations in Syria drawn to her attention and falling within the scope of her mandate in 
comparison with the previous reporting period. To illustrate this point, she wishes to 
underline that nine communications were sent during the reporting period, while two </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>196</b>  
</p>
<p>communications had been sent during the reporting period covered in last year&#8217;s report. 
These issues concern <i>inter alia</i> allegations of trials of civilians before a military court, 
violation of due process and fair trial guarantees, threats to lawyers and the freedom of 
lawyers to carry out legal work.  
</p>
<p>1198. She wishes to remind the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic that it has the 
obligation to ensure compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, to which it is a party. Any person arrested and detained should be guaranteed the 
safeguards provided for in articles 9 and 14 of the aforementioned Covenant, including the 
right to be promptly brought before a judge, to be informed of the charges, and the right to 
a fair and public hearing before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established 
by law. Finally, she reiterates the importance in ensuring an independent judiciary and the 
protection and proper role of lawyers, to take into account the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary, adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 
September 1985 and endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 
1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985, as well as the the Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers adopted in Havana, Cuba, by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the 
Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, from 27 August to 7 September 1990, 
in particular principles 16 to 20.

<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1199. On 18 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. 
Nematillo Botakuziev</b>, a human rights defender and representative of the Nookat branch of 
the Kyrgyz NGO &#8220;Justice-Truth&#8221; since 2004. &#8220;Justice-Truth&#8221; provides legal assistance and 
representation in criminal trials that have human rights concerns.  
</p>
<p>1200. According to the information received, on 26 February 2010, Mr. Nematillo 
Botakuziev, a Kyrgyz citizen, reportedly disappeared in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, following a 
meeting with the local office of UNHCR the same day. Mr. Botakuziev had been hiding in 
Kyrgyzstan since October 2008, after he had been accused by the authorities of organizing 
the protest in Nookat, Kyrgyzstan, on 1 October 2008, and wanted him on criminal charges. 
Mr. Botakuziev arrived in Tajikistan in mid-February 2010 and sought asylum. He was 
registered with the local office of the UNHCR as an asylum seeker and was last seen in the 
UNHCR offices in the afternoon of 26 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>1201. On 4 March 2010, the Regional Office of OHCHR for Central Asia in Bishkek, 
Kyrgyzstan was informed by several sources that Mr. Bokatuziev is allegedly detained by 
the State Committee on National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan and is under threat 
of being extradited to the Kyrgyz Republic. On 13 March 2010, Mr. Rashan Gapirov, the 
Director of the NGO &#8220;Justice-Truth&#8221; was informed that Mr. Bokatuziev was being held in a 
detention facility on Molodaya Gvardia street in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  
</p>
<p>1202. Mr. Botakuziev had allegedly suffered repeated beatings while in detention and his 
state of health is further weakened due to a recent heart attack.   
</p>
<p>1203. On 17 March, Mr. Bukatuziev&#8217;s lawyer attempted to get access to him but was 
refused to see his client. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>197 
</b></p>
<p>1204. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Nematillo Botakuziev 
may be related to his legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular his 
denunciation of the repression of the Nookat demonstration by Kyrgyz security forces. 
Further serious concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Botakuziev in light of his fragile state of health and allegations of torture and ill-
treatment while in detention.

<p>1205. At the time this report was finalized, no response to this communication had been 
received.

<p>1206. On 29 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. 
Nematillo Botakuziev</b>, a human rights defender and since 2004 the representative of the 
Nookat branch of the Kyrgyz NGO &#8220;Justice-Truth&#8221;. &#8220;Justice-Truth&#8221; provides legal 
assistance and representation in criminal trials that have human rights concerns. A first 
communication on the case was sent to your Government by several special procedures 
mandate holders on 18 March 2010. 
</p>
<p>1207. According to the new information received, Mr. Botakuziev&#8217;s lawyer was still not 
permitted to meet with his client in detention. The lawyer was told to request permission 
from the Prosecutor-General of the Kyrgyz Republic to obtain access to Mr. Botakuziev. 
Information received further suggests that the extradition papers are being prepared by the 
authorities so that Mr. Botakuziev be returned to the Kyrgyz Republic prior to 1 April 2010. 
In addition, Mr. Botakuziev was already questioned with the participation of Kyrgyz 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>1208. If returned to the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Botakuziev faced a serious risk of being ill-
treated and not to be afforded a fair trial. He has been accused by the Kyrgyz authorities of 
organizing the protest in Nookat, Kyrgyz Republic, on 1 October 2008, and was therefore 
wanted on criminal charges. At the trial of 32 persons allegedly involved in the events at 
Nookat, several testified that they had been tortured and ill-treated (reference is made to the 
urgent appeal of 11 December 2009 by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment). However, the court neither ordered an investigation of 
the allegations nor dismissed the evidence defendants said had been obtained under torture. 
In May 2009, the Kyrgyz Republic&#8217;s Supreme Court reviewed the case and upheld the 
verdicts. It did not investigate the defendants&#8217; torture allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>1209. In a letter dated 29 March 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 29 March 2010 indicating that the absence of the Russian version of the mentioned 
communication was an obstacle to prepare a timely response from the Government of 
Tajikistan.

<p>1210. On 19 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal concerning the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>198</b>  
</p>
<p>situation of<b> Mr. Ilkhom Ismanov</b>, a citizen of the Russian Federation, who was arrested 
and allegedly tortured in the northern Soghd region of the Republic of Tajikistan. 
</p>
<p>1211. On 3 November 2010, Mr. Ismanov disappeared and his family had no information 
about his whereabouts. On 4 November 2010, two men reportedly searched Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s 
family house without presenting any official document. They reportedly told Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s 
wife that he was being held at the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city of Khudzhand in the Soghd region of the Republic of 
Tajikistan.  
</p>
<p>1212. On 4 November and subsequently on the following days, despite several attempts to 
visit Mr. Ismanov, his lawyer and a representative of the Centre for Human Rights of Soghd 
region were reportedly denied access to Mr. Ismanov. Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s relatives had 
reportedly been denied access to him but eventually were able to see him twice. It is 
reported that on 12 November, Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s lawyer saw him at the court hearing when 
the judge authorized the extension of his detention.  
</p>
<p>1213. It is further reported that on 5 November, when Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s wife and brother 
went to visit him at the detention facility in Khudjand, a police officer reportedly asked 
them to bring some ointment for injuries and pain killers. Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s relatives claimed 
that he was unable to walk, had several injuries on his neck, his hands were bruised, and his 
body was wet. It is reported that when Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s wife asked him to show his feet, the 
police stopped the visit and escorted the relatives out.  
</p>
<p>1214. On 11 November, Mr. Ismanov was reportedly transferred to the temporary 
detention facility of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the town of Chkalovsk. Mr. 
Ismanov&#8217;s relatives and his lawyer have reportedly sent several complaints to the 
authorities including the Regional Department for the Fight against Organized Crime and 
the Procurator&#8217;s Office of Soghd. Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s relatives did not receive any response to 
their request for medical examination of Mr. Ismanov which have been addressed to the 
regional prosecutor's office. 
</p>
<p>1215. It is reported that on 12 November, during the court hearing, Mr. Ismanov told the 
judge that he was subjected to electric shocks and boiling water was poured on him while in 
detention. It is claimed that when Mr. Ismanov offered to show the evidence of torture on 
his body, the judge ignored the allegations of torture by saying that the lawyer should take 
up the allegations of torture with the police investigator. It is reported that Mr. Ismanov was 
charged with &#8220;organizing a criminal group.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1216. On 13 November, the court reportedly ordered an investigation into the allegation 
that Mr. Ismanov had been detained since 3 November and not since 9 November as stated 
by the police.  
</p>
<p>1217. In view of the allegations of torture and lack of medical attention to Mr. Ismanov, 
concern is expressed about his physical and psychological integrity. Further concern is

of <b>Mr. Ilhom Ismanov</b>. 
</p>
<p>1220. Mr. Ismanov was the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers; the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment on 19 November 2010. In view of the allegations of 
torture and lack of medical attention, concern was expressed about the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Ismanov. Further concern was expressed about the lack of 
investigation into the allegations of torture. To date, no response was received from your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government regarding the circumstances of the case of Mr. Ismanov. 
</p>
<p>1221. According to the new information received, in mid-November 2010, Mr. Ismanov 
was transferred to a pre-trial detention facility in Khujand, Tajikistan. It is further reported 
that Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s lawyer was able to see him on 20 November 2010 for the first time 
since the court hearing of 12 November 2010. However, she had reportedly not been able to 
meet him in private. Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s wife was reportedly allowed to see him briefly in the 
presence of officers from the State Committee of National Security. It is reported that Mr. 
Ismanov had difficulty walking and look frightened. Reportedly, neither the lawyer nor Mr. 
Ismanov&#8217;s wife have been able to obtain any information as to whether an investigation has 
been launched into the torture allegations and the allegation that Mr. Ismanov had been 
detained since 3 November 2010 and not since 9 November 2010 as stated by the police.  
</p>
<p>1222. It is alleged that Mr. Ismanov has a serious respiratory disease and urgently needs 
medical examinations, in particular an x-ray of his chest, in order to administer the 
appropriate treatment. It is reported that SIZO no.2 is not equipped with adequate medical 
facility to establish Mr. Ismanov&#8217;s diagnosis and devise a plan for his treatment. It is also 
alleged that the prison administration of SIZO no.2, where Mr. Ismanov is detained, 
requested his family to provide medicine for him on several occasions. 
</p>
<p>1223. In view of the allegations according to which Mr. Ismanov continues to remain with 
no access to medical care despite his deteriorating state of health, concern is expressed 
about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Ismanov. Further concern is expressed about 
the lack of investigation into the allegations of torture.

Boukaddous</b>, journaliste de la cha&#238;ne de t&#233;l&#233;vision <i>Al Hiwar Al Tounisi</i> et du <b>site 
d&#8217;information en ligne <i>Al Badil</i></b> . 
</p>
<p>1227. M. Boukaddous a fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un appel urgent envoy&#233; le 12 janvier 2009 par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la 
promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression, le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial sur la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants et la 
Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme. Le 
Gouvernement de son Excellence a &#233;t&#233; remerci&#233; pour sa r&#233;ponse en date du 31 mars 2009. 
</p>
<p>1228. Selon les nouvelles informations re&#231;ues, le 6 juillet 2010, la Cour d&#8217;appel de Gafsa 
aurait confirm&#233; la peine d&#8217;emprisonnement de quatre ans prononc&#233;e en premi&#232;re instance 
par la Chambre criminelle du Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Gafsa &#224; l&#8217;encontre de M. 
Boukaddous, pour &#171; participation &#224; une entente visant &#224; pr&#233;parer et &#224; commettre des 
agressions contre des personnes et des biens &#187;. M. Boukaddous n&#8217;aurait pu assister au 
prononc&#233; du verdict en raison de son hospitalisation dans la ville de Sousse pour des 
probl&#232;mes respiratoires. Un nombre d&#8217;avocats, journalistes et activistes des droits de 
l&#8217;homme auraient &#233;t&#233; emp&#234;ch&#233;s, de mani&#232;re semble-t-il injustifi&#233;e, d&#8217;acc&#233;der au Palais de 
Justice de Gafsa. 
</p>
<p>1229. Il est all&#233;gu&#233; que les garanties du droit &#224; un proc&#232;s &#233;quitable n&#8217;auraient pas &#233;t&#233; 
respect&#233;es, des atteintes r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;es aux droits de la d&#233;fense ayant notamment &#233;t&#233; commises 
selon plusieurs sources. En l&#8217;occurrence, les avocats de M. Boukaddous auraient rencontr&#233; 
des difficult&#233;s pour s&#8217;entretenir avec leur client avant l&#8217;audience. Par ailleurs, les 
justifications m&#233;dicales apport&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;absence de M. Boukaddous n&#8217;auraient pas &#233;t&#233; prises 
en compte, sous le pr&#233;texte all&#233;gu&#233; d&#8217;une vacance du Tribunal au-del&#224; du 15 juillet 2010 ; 
cette absence justifi&#233;e aurait emp&#234;ch&#233; M. Boukaddous de pouvoir s&#8217;expliquer directement 
sur les termes de l&#8217;accusation.  
</p>
<p>1230. Le 14 juillet, M. Boukaddous aurait quitt&#233; l&#8217;h&#244;pital et aurait &#233;t&#233; incarc&#233;r&#233; le 
lendemain.  
</p>
<p>1231. Il est rapport&#233; qu&#8217;au d&#233;but du mois de septembre 2010, la sant&#233; de M. Boukaddous 
se serait d&#233;grad&#233;e en raison du manque de soins m&#233;dicaux appropri&#233;s. M. Boukaddous 
souffrirait d&#8217;exsudation pulmonaire, d&#8217;asthme, d&#8217;une inflammation de la gorge et de 
d&#233;composition de ses dents. Les autorit&#233;s p&#233;nitentiaires auraient refus&#233; de transf&#233;rer M. 
Boukaddous dans un h&#244;pital. 
</p>
<p>1232. De s&#233;rieuses craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et mentale de M. 
Boukaddous en raison du refus des autorit&#233;s tunisiennes d'apporter des soins m&#233;dicaux 
appropri&#233;s &#224; celui-ci. Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; renouvel&#233;es quant au fait que la condamnation en 
appel de M. Boukaddous soit li&#233;e &#224; ses activit&#233;s non-violentes de promotion et protection 
des droits de l&#8217;homme. Enfin, des craintes ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es que les 
dysfonctionnements pr&#233;cit&#233;s lors du proc&#232;s en appel aient compromis le principe du droit &#224; 
un proc&#232;s &#233;quitable.

<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>1236. On 23 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rughts defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, sent an 
urgent appeal regarding the arrest and current situation of <b>Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi</b>, of 
Kenyan nationality and Executive Coordinator of Muslims Human Rights Forum (MHRF), 
and <b>Mr. Mbugua Mureithi</b>, of Kenyan nationality and a human rights lawyer. Mr. Al-
Amin Kimathi has worked to expose and document human rights violations, arbitrary 
detention and unlawful renditions in the context of counter-terrorism operations in the East 
and Horn of Africa. Mr. Mbugua Mureithi represents the families of Kenyan suspects 
transferred to Uganda on allegations of involvement in the 11 July 2010 bombings in 
Kampala. 
</p>
<p>1237. According to the information received, on 16 September 2010, the Ugandan police 
arrested the two Kenyan human rights defenders at the Entebbe International Airport. Both 
men were travelling to Kampala for the court hearing of Kenyan suspects arrested in 
connection with the bombings that killed 70 people in Kampala on 11 July 2010.  
</p>
<p>1238. According to reports received, the two human rights defenders were transferred to 
the Rapid Response Unit headquarters in Kireka, a suburb of Kampala, where they were 
reportedly held incommunicado and had no access to a lawyer.  
</p>
<p>1239. It had been reported that on 18 September 2010 Mr. Mbugua Mureithi was released 
from police custody in Kampala and immediately expelled to Kenya. Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi 
was reportedly held incommunicado at the Ugandan police&#8217;s Rapid Response Unit 
Headquarters in Kireka, Kampala, without charges or access to legal representation, until 
21 September.  On this date, it had been reported that Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi was brought 
before a judge and remanded to the Luzira Maximum Security Prison on charges of murder 
and attempted murder as well as terrorism-related charges in connection with the bombings 
that took place in Kampala in July 2010. 
</p>
<p>1240. Due to their arrest, detention and, in the case of Mr. Mureithi, expulsion, the two 
men had not had a chance to meet with their clients, who are charged with offences 
including murder and terrorism, punishable by death under Ugandan law. The court case 
involving their clients had continued in their absence. </p>

</p>
<p>1241. Concern was expressed at the arrest of Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi and Mr. Mbugua 
Mureithi and at allegations received that their arrest could be linked to their work, 
respectively as human rights lawyer and in denouncing and documenting unlawful practices 
by the authorities in counter-terrorism operations. Further concern was expressed about 
allegations indicating that Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi had no access to a lawyer since the time of 
his arrest and until he was remanded to the Luzira Maximum Security Prison.

<p>1244. On 21 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding the 
<b>disciplinary and criminal charges against Judge Juan Jos&#233; Delgado, of the superior 
court for criminal matters of the Bayamon judicial region in Puerto Rico</b>.  
</p>
<p>1245. According to the information received, Judge Juan Jos&#233; Delgado, acquitted six 
defendants accused of the killing of an adult and two minors in the so-called &#8220;Barrio 
P&#225;jaros massacre&#8221; in Toa Baja. After he acquitted the six defendants, the Judge was 
immediately subjected to a disciplinary procedure and to a criminal investigation. The 
criminal and disciplinary procedures against Judge Delgado were ordered by the Justice 
Secretary, who announced to the press that Judge Delgado had reportedly appeared in a 
video celebrating his verdict with the defense lawyers in one of Bayam&#243;n's restaurant. 
</p>
<p>1246. During the investigations, the prosecutor indicated that Judge Delgado did not 
appear in the video and that he had no evidence that the Judge had joined the defense 
lawyers in their celebrations. 
</p>
<p>1247. Concern is expressed that the claims against Judge Delgado are unsubstantiated and 
aimed at damaging his integrity.

</p>
<p>1251. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, durante los tres meses que la Jueza

atentados contra su vida por parte de las reclusas del Instituto Nacional de Orientaci&#243;n 
Femenina; se inform&#243; que una proporci&#243;n importante de las mujeres ah&#237; detenidas habr&#237;an 
sido condenadas a penas de prisi&#243;n por la Jueza Afiuni Mora. En consecuencia, se 
expresaron serios temores por su vida e integridad f&#237;sica. 
</p>
<p>1252. Se inform&#243; que las reclusas del Instituto Nacional de Orientaci&#243;n Femenina, en dos 
ocasiones habr&#237;an tratado de quemar viva a la Jueza Afiuni Mora, y en otra ocasi&#243;n, la

habr&#237;a intentado en repetidas ocasiones, agredir a la Jueza Afiuni Mora con hojillas y 
cuchillos. 
</p>
<p>1253. Se inform&#243; que el 22 de marzo de 2010, d&#237;a en el cual la primera audiencia para 
presentar los cargos en contra de la Jueza Afiuni Mora estaba prevista, se cancel&#243; dicha 
audiencia mediante un cartel pegado en la puerta del tribunal, indicando que hab&#237;a

Jueza Afiuni Mora pidi&#243; el expediente de su clienta en el tribunal, el cual le fue negado. En

Humanos a favor d ela Exjueza Afiuni.  
</p>
<p>1256. En su respuesta, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que eran totalmente falsas las informaciones 
donde se aseguraba que durante los meses que la Sra. Afiuni llevaba privada de libertad, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>204</b>  
</p>
<p>&#233;sta habr&#237;a sido objeto de varias agresiones y atentados contra su vida por parte de las 
reclusas del Instituto Nacional de Orientaci&#243;n Femenina (INOF).  Al respecto, se informa 
que las gestiones para velar por la integridad personal de la Sra. Afiuni comenzaron desde 
el inicio del proceso penal en su contra, el d&#237;a 12 de diciembre de 2009, cuando el Juzgado 
50&#176; de Primera Instancia en Funciones de Control del Circuito Judicial Penal de la 
Circunscripci&#243;n Judicial del &#193;rea Metropolitana de Caracas instruy&#243; al Ministerio Publico a 
fin de que ordenara la practica de un nuevo reconocimiento medico legal a los imputados a 
fin de establecer las condiciones de salud en las que se encontraban.  
</p>
<p>1257. Igualmente, se informa que el 18 de diciembre de 2009 los abogados de Afiuni 
Mora, ejercieron Recurso de Apelaci&#243;n, en contra la decisi&#243;n de fecha 12 de diciembre de 
2009, con resoluci&#243;n judicial del mismo d&#237;a, emanada del Juzgado 50&#176; de Primera Instancia 
en Funciones de Control del Circuito Judicial Penal del &#193;rea Metropolitana de Caracas, 
mediante la cual se le decret&#243; Medida Judicial Privativa de libertad por la presunta 
comisi&#243;n de los delitos de corrupci&#243;n propia y abuso de autoridad, favorecimiento para la 
evasi&#243;n, asociaci&#243;n para delinquir. Se inform&#243; tambi&#233;n que la Sala 2 de la Corte de 
Apelaciones, en su sentencia de 28 de enero de 2010, declar&#243; sin lugar el Recurso de 
Apelaci&#243;n y neg&#243; el otorgamiento de la medida cautelar sustitutiva de la privaci&#243;n de 
libertad solicitada a favor de Afiuni Mora.  
</p>
<p>1258. Adem&#225;s, el estado se&#241;al&#243; que el 17 de mayo de 2010, tuvo lugar la audiencia 
preliminar del caso, en la que tras ratificarse la acusaci&#243;n en contra de la Ex-Jueza, se 
admitir&#237;a la acusaci&#243;n y las pruebas presentadas por los fiscales, orden&#225;ndose el 
enjuiciamiento de Afiuni y ratific&#225;ndose la medida de privaci&#243;n de libertad. Se confirm&#243; 
que, actualmente el proceso penal sigue su curso normal por ante el Juzgado 26&#176; de Juicio. 
</p>
<p>1259.  Concluye el estado indicando que, por cuanto al se&#241;alamiento de que la Ex-Jueza 
fuera objeto de presuntas menciones injuriosas por parte del Jefe del Ejecutivo, en todo 
caso, las consideraciones y reacciones del mandatario nacional son muestra de su claro 
compromiso por la erradicaci&#243;n de la corrupci&#243;n en todos los niveles y &#225;mbitos del poder 
p&#250;blico, que adem&#225;s fueron posteriores a la detenci&#243;n decretada, y obedecieron sin duda a 
la bochornosa actuaci&#243;n de Afiuni Mora en el caso del banquero Eligio Cede&#241;o. As&#237;, el 
Estado ratific&#243; que la privaci&#243;n de libertad de Mar&#237;a Lourdes Afiuni Mora, fue dictada en 
completa y absoluta observancia de las normas jur&#237;dicas nacionales e internacionales 
aplicables al estado; en raz&#243;n de los compromisos jur&#237;dicos formalmente adquiridos, y en 
particular, de los que garantizan el derecho a la defensa en todo estado y grado de la 
investigaci&#243;n del proceso, y que involucra el derecho a la asistencia jur&#237;dica, el derecho a 
ser escuchado, el derecho a un juicio imparcial a cargo de su juez natural y el derecho al 
debido proceso.  
</p>
<p>1260. Por cuanto a la integridad f&#237;sica de la Jueza,  se informa sobre una comunicaci&#243;n de 
la Directora Nacional de Servicios Penitenciarios con fecha de 28 de diciembre de 2009 
donde se se&#241;ala que la Sra. Afiuni est&#225; recluida en el &#225;rea de admisi&#243;n con otras internas, 
lugar que se utiliza para casos especiales el cual est&#225; totalmente separado de las otras &#225;reas 
de reclusi&#243;n de manera que all&#237; no existe riesgo de ser agredida por otras internas.  Se 
informa tambi&#233;n de otra comunicaci&#243;n de la misma Directora Nacional de Servicios 
Penitenciarios con fecha de 25 de enero de 2010 donde se se&#241;ala que no se presentaron 
amenazas inminentes a la integridad f&#237;sica y a la vida de la Sra. Afiuni y que los rumores de 
rociar de gasolina en el pasillo que conduce al &#225;rea de reclusi&#243;n de la Sra. Afiuni no eran 
ciertos, por cuanto no utilizan combustible dentro del penal y la sustancia es de prohibida 
tenencia en el recinto.   
</p>
<p>1261. Tambi&#233;n se informa sobre la situaci&#243;n suscitada respecto a la primera petici&#243;n de la 
Sra. Afiuni sobre el cambio de celda y se refiere a las actas relevantes que muestran la 
reubicaci&#243;n de la Sra. Afiuni a la habitaci&#243;n de m&#225;xima seguridad; se acuerda el traslado a 
otros recintos carcelarios de las internas del INOF que tengan informes negativos de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>205 
</b></p>
<p>conducta o que hayan podido proferir insultos a las Sra. Afiuni a fin de prevenir alg&#250;n acto 
de violencia contra ella; se acuerda la realizaci&#243;n de una evaluaci&#243;n por parte de un equipo 
medico multidisciplinario a los efectos de que preste atenci&#243;n permanente a la mencionada 
interna.  
</p>
<p>1262. Asimismo, la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo ha evidenciado las actuaciones realizadas en 
protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos de la Sra. Afiuni habiendo practicado inspecciones 
para velar que, como persona privada de libertad, sea tratada con el debido respeto a la 
dignidad humana.   
</p>
<p>1263. Por todo lo anterior, el estado se&#241;ala dar cuenta de la seriedad demostrada por las 
instituciones p&#250;blicas venezolanas en el cumplimiento de su obligaci&#243;n de proteger la 
integridad f&#237;sica de la Sra. Afiuni, quien no ha sufrido ning&#250;n atentado contra su integridad 
f&#237;sica desde que se encuentra detenida, gozando de las mejores condiciones posibles que 
pueden brindarse a una persona que se encuentra privada de su libertad. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comentarios y observaciones de la Relatora Especial 
</b></p>
<p>1264. La Relatora Especial agradece la vasta respuesta del Gobierno de Venezuela a la 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 11 de abril de 2010. Sin embargo, la misma no es &#243;bice para que 
la Relatora Especial reitere su especial preocupaci&#243;n por el contexto de crecientes cr&#237;ticas y 
denuncias por ataques a la independencia del Poder Judicial en Venezuela. Tanto as&#237;, que 
no escapa de su atenci&#243;n lo que algunos sectores judiciales de Latinoam&#233;rica han 
denominado como &#8220;efecto Afiuni&#8221;, aludiendo a las presiones, miedo e inclusive terror que 
existe en algunos de los jueces de Venezuela, por cuanto a que, si no deciden sus causas 
conforme a los designios del poder pol&#237;tico, pueden correr con la misma suerte de la Jueza 
Afiuni. 
</p>
<p>1265. La Relatora considera que no es ocioso recordar los Principios B&#225;sicos relativos a la 
independencia de la judicatura, enfatizando los numerales 1 al 6,  por cuanto a que la 
Independencia de la Judicatura debe ser garantizada por el Estado, proclamada en la 
Constituci&#243;n y en la legislaci&#243;n de todo el pa&#237;s, y que todas las instituciones, sin excepci&#243;n 
alguna, deber&#225;n respetar y acatar dicha independencia. Por tanto, los jueces podr&#225;n resolver 
los asuntos sometidos a su consentimiento con plena imparcialidad, bas&#225;ndose en los 
hechos y consonancia del derecho, sin influencias, presiones, amenazas y ning&#250;n tipo de 
intromisi&#243;n &#8211;directa o indirecta&#8212;. Finalmente, recuerda que no deben efectuarse 
intromisiones indebidas o injustificada en le proceso judicial.  
</p>
<p>1266. En tal sentido, contin&#250;a preocupando a la Relatora Especial la efectiva imparcialidad 
que el juicio seguido en contra de Afiuni Mora pueda tener, as&#237; como el disfrute de todas 
las garant&#237;as judiciales, y dem&#225;s elementos que puedan asegurar que su causa sea 
efectivamente seguida conforme a Derecho, totalmente desapegado de cuestiones o 
intereses pol&#237;ticos.  
</p>
<p>1267. Ahora bien, la Relatora valora dos cuestiones que se desprenden la respuesta estatal. 
En primer lugar, el reconocimiento t&#225;cito sobre el riesgo que la integridad f&#237;sica de Afiuni 
Mora puede sufrir, esto con la precisi&#243;n de los esfuerzos del gobierno de Venezuela en 
relaci&#243;n con la protecci&#243;n a la integridad f&#237;sica de la Jueza Afiuni y reitera la importancia 
de otorgarle un tratamiento de conformidad con su condici&#243;n de jueza.  En segundo lugar, 
no solo preocupan las declaraciones que respecto a la Ex-jueza haya vertido el  Jefe del 
Ejecutivo, alarma el hecho de que se encuentre justificaci&#243;n a las mismas, denomin&#225;ndolas 
como &#8220;consideraciones y reacciones como muestra del compromiso por la erradicaci&#243;n de 
la corrupci&#243;n&#8221;. En primer lugar, a&#250;n cuando fuera cierta alguna de las imputaciones hechas 
en perjuicio de la Sra. Afiuni, tal veracidad tendr&#237;a que quedar acreditada en la instancia 
judicial, despu&#233;s de una procedimiento con sus debidas garant&#237;as y agotando todos las 
instancias y recursos legales a tal efecto. Hecho que, hasta el d&#237;a de hoy no ha ocurrido, por </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>206</b>  
</p>
<p>lo cual, la declaratoria presidencial representa una intromisi&#243;n a la funci&#243;n jurisdiccional, y 
una sentencia condenatoria anticipada, en la que asume que la Sra. Afiuni es parte de la 
corrupci&#243;n. Aunado a ello, a dicha grave situaci&#243;n ha de sum&#225;rsele un elemento 
magnificador, el hecho de que dicha declaratoria fuera formulada p&#250;blicamente por el 
mandatario una vez que la Jueza fuera privada administrativamente de su libertad. Y, 
finalmente ha de hacerse notar, la p&#250;blica intromisi&#243;n presidencial, al juzgar, calificar y 
determinar tajantemente de &#8220;bochornosos&#8221; los actos desplegados por Afiuini en el ejercicio 
de su funci&#243;n jurisdiccional. 
</p>
<p>1268. La Relatora Especial considera importante recordar al gobierno de Venezuela, que 
una caracter&#237;stica <i>sine qua non</i> del estado de Derecho es, precisamente, la independencia de 
los poderes estatales.

<p><b>  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>1269. On 1 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of 
<b>Mr. Ahmed Mohamed Salem Bamuallim</b>, a citizen of Yemen born in 1954. He is a 
resident of Al-Moukalla, neighbourhood of Baaboud and a retired military officer. Mr. 
Bamuallim was elected to Yemen's National Parliament in 1997, and served as a deputy for 
the Yemen Congregation for Reform until 2003. During this period he was also a member 
of the Parliamentary Defense and Security Commission. He is a well-known political 
opponent and a member of the &quot;Southern Movement&quot; (Al-Harak Al-Janouby). 
</p>
<p>1270. According to the information received, on 15 April 2009, Mr Bamuallim, in the 
company of his son, delivered himself to the regional military headquarters following a 
formal summons by telephone regarding his retirement. He was arrested and detained for 
24 hours before being transferred to the Military Intelligence prison in Sana'a where he was 
secretly held incommunicado in a subterranean prison cell for over a month. He was then 
transferred to the regular Military prison where he was detained between June 2009 and 19 
July 2009, when he was finally transferred to Sana's central prison, where he remains unto 
this day. 
</p>
<p>1271. According to the source, Mr. Ahmed Mohamed Salem Bamuallim remains in 
detention without having been formally charged with an offence; without having received 
any information on the proceedings initiated against him or on the legal basis of his 
detention; without access to a lawyer, and without having had the possibility to challenge 
the legality of his detention before a judicial or other authority.  
</p>
<p>1272. On 17 October 2009, Mr. Ahmed Mohamed Salem Bamuallim appeared in front of 
the State Security Court during which he refused to speak unless a lawyer was present. 
During the initial hearing he was mainly criticized for his involvement in the &quot;Southern 
Movement&quot; and accused of having violated national integrity and promoting dissension.  
</p>
<p>1273. Various hearings were to follow, and on 23 March 2010, a Yemeni court sentenced 
Mr. Ahmed Mohamed Salem Bamuallim to 10 years in prison. The judge said Mr. 
Bamuallim had been calling for an armed insurrection.  
</p>
<p>1274. The Constitution of Yemen stipulates that any person accused of a penal offence 
must be brought before a judge within 24 hours of his arrest. Article 73 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code of Yemen (Law no. 31 of 1994) establishes that everyone who is arrested 
must be immediately informed of the reasons for his arrest, must be shown the arrest 
warrant, must be allowed to contact any person he wishes to inform of the arrest and must 
be allowed to contact a lawyer. According to the source, none of these guarantees has been </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>207 
</b></p>
<p>respected in Mr. Bamuallim&#8217;s case, his detention thus being devoid of any justification in 
Yemeni law.   
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>1275. In a letter dated 7 October 2010, the Government provided some information on the 
case of Mr. Mohamed Salem Bamullim. The latter was detained for being involved in 
lawful2 acts. His imprisonment was according to a court decision following a normal trial 
with the presence of his lawyer Ms. Nadia Al-Khlaifi. However, despite the court order, 
Mr. Bamullim was released on 17 July 2010 after a pardon issued by the President of the 
Republic. Therefore, the Government would be grateful if the case of Mr. Bamullim could 
be clarified by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>1276. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Republic of Yemen for its 
response and welcomes the information indicating that a pardon was issued by the President 
and the subsequent release of Mr. Bamullim.

<p><b>  Communication sent  
</b></p>
<p>1277. On 17 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the case of <b>Mr. Farai 
Maguwu</b>, director of the Zimbabwean non-Governmental organization Centre for Research 
and Development (CRD). The CRD has documented human rights abuses in the Marange 
diamond fields, and is involved in the Kimberly Process, an international coalition of 
Governments, industry and civil society organizations which aims at breaking the links 
between the diamond trade and the funding of violence. 
</p>
<p>1278. On 26 May 2010, Mr. Farai Maguwu shared information with an independent 
monitor for the Kimberley Process in Zimbabwe on alleged human rights abuses in the 
diamond fields.  
</p>
<p>1279. On 27 May, armed security agents reportedly raided both the office and home of Mr. 
Farai Maguwu, and confiscated his passport, computer and other personal belongings. Mr. 
Farai Maguwu escaped and went into hiding.  
</p>
<p>1280. On 3 June, Mr. Farai Maguwu handed himself to the Harare Central Police Station, 
and was immediately arrested. 
</p>
<p>1281. On 7 June, Mr. Farai Maguwu was charged with communicating information 
prejudicial to the State. Mr. Farai Maguwu has been denied bail, and remains detained at 
the Harare Central Police Station. He has further been denied access to his medication to 
treat a chest and throat infection. A court has reportedly ordered that he be allowed to 
receive his medication. 
</p>
<p>  
  2 The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw to the attention of the Government that there may have been 
</p>
<p>a mistake in the use of &#8220;lawful&#8221;. Most probably, &#8220;unlawful&#8221; acts were meant. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>208</b>  
</p>
<p>1282. During the aforementioned raid, the nephew of Mr. Farai Maguwu, Mr. Lisbern 
Maguwu, was arrested and was subsequently beaten in custody. Lawyers attempting to 
meet him received threats from police officers. Mr. Lisbern Maguwu was released on bail 
after being charged with violence against security agents. He is currently awaiting trial. 
Since the raid, other members of Farai Maguwu&#8217;s family have reportedly been interrogated 
and beaten by police officers. Other CRD staff members went into hiding in fear for their 
safety.  
</p>
<p>1283. Serious concern is expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Farai Maguwu may 
be related to his legitimate human rights activities, in the exercise of the right of Mr. Farai 
Maguwu to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concern is expressed that the arrest 
and detention of and charges against Mr. Lisbern Maguwu, as well as the acts of ill 
treatment against him, may be linked to the human rights activities of his uncle, Mr. Farai 
Maguwu. Finally, serious concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity 
of Mr. Farai Maguwu, members of his family, including Mr. Lisbern Maguwu, and CRD 
staff members. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication received

<p>1284. At the time this report was finalized, no response to this communication had been 
received.  
</p>
<p><b>  Comments and observations of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>1285. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of an official reply to the 
communications sent and calls upon the Government of Zimbabwe to provide at the earliest 
possible date a substantive answer to the above allegations. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>1286. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers has issued six press statements.3 A summary of these statements is provided 
below according to a chronological order. 
</p>
<p><b>  30 July 2010 - Honduras: Recent dismissal of judges sends message of intimidation, 
warn UN Special Rapporteurs 
</b></p>
<p>1287. El 30 de julio de 2010, la Relatora Especial sobre la independencia de magistrados y 
abogados; el Relator Especial sobre la libertad de opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n; y la Relatora 
Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, advirtieron que la 
reciente destituci&#243;n de tres jueces y una magistrada en Honduras &#8220;puede tener el efecto de 
un mensaje intimidatorio a otros jueces y magistrados para que se abstengan de manifestar 
opiniones diferentes a aqu&#233;llas expresadas por las autoridades actuales&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1288. &#8220;Esto representar&#237;a un ataque inadmisible contra la independencia de los jueces y 
magistrados hondure&#241;os as&#237; como contra las libertades de opini&#243;n, expresi&#243;n, reuni&#243;n y 
asociaci&#243;n de los individuos, grupos o instituciones que promueven y protegen los derechos 
humanos y las libertades fundamentales en Honduras&#8221;, se&#241;alaron los expertos, que siguen 
con atenci&#243;n el desarrollo de la situaci&#243;n judicial en Honduras.  
</p>
<p>1289. El 18 de junio de 2010, los jueces Guillermo L&#243;pez Lone, Luis Ch&#225;vez y Ram&#243;n 
Enrique Barrios y la magistrada Tirza Flores fueron notificados de la decisi&#243;n de

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>destituci&#243;n de la carrera judicial emitida por la Suprema Corte de Justicia por 
&#8216;incumplimiento o violaciones graves de sus deberes&#8217;. La decisi&#243;n fue emitida por la Sala 
Plena de la Corte el 5 de mayo de 2010 y ratificada en las sesiones de Sala Plena de 12 de 
mayo y 1 de junio de 2010.  
</p>
<p>1290. &#8220;Ninguna de las resoluciones que motivaron la destituci&#243;n de estos jueces y de la 
magistrada contiene los fundamentos jur&#237;dicos que justifiquen por qu&#233; las conductas objeto 
del procedimiento disciplinario fueron consideradas como graves&#8221;, destacaron los expertos 
de la ONU. &#8220;Las destituciones parecen estar relacionadas a la expresi&#243;n p&#250;blica del rechazo 
de estos profesionales de la judicatura a los acontecimientos ocurridos durante la crisis 
pol&#237;tica de junio de 2009, as&#237; como a su participaci&#243;n en algunos actos de protesta contra 
los mismos&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1291. &#8220;Los jueces s&#243;lo pueden ser destituidos por razones graves de mala conducta o 
incompetencia, de conformidad con procedimientos equitativos que garanticen la 
objetividad y la imparcialidad&#8221;, indicaron los expertos en derechos humanos. &#8220;Aceptar una 
invitaci&#243;n a dictar una conferencia, escribir un art&#237;culo, presentar un recurso de h&#225;beas 
corpus en favor del Presidente destituido o participar en manifestaciones p&#250;blicas no parece 
responder a estos criterios&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1292. Se habr&#237;a tambi&#233;n violado el derecho de los jueces destituidos al debido proceso, al 
hab&#233;rseles sancionado sin haber sido escuchados y al hab&#233;rseles impedido participar en las 
sesiones plenarias en las cuales se acord&#243; o ratific&#243; su destituci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>1293. Los tres jueces y la magistrada impugnaron la decisi&#243;n de la Corte Suprema ante el 
Consejo de la Carrera Judicial de Honduras, que se espera se pronuncie en breve sobre las 
apelaciones. 
</p>
<p>1294. &#8220;Esperamos que el Consejo otorgue a los funcionarios despedidos la posibilidad de 
ser escuchados y presentar pruebas en una nueva audiencia. Confiamos que este conflicto 
se pueda resolver de manera positiva y conforme a los est&#225;ndares internacional en la 
materia&#8221;. &#8220;Resulta necesario avanzar en la consolidaci&#243;n de la independencia judicial en 
Honduras, garant&#237;a de la democracia y del Estado de Derecho&#8221;, concluyeron los expertos.  
</p>
<p><b>  11 October 2010 - UN experts urge China to respect human rights and release all 
persons detained for peacefully exercising their rights 
</b></p>
<p>1295. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression; Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers added their voices to those welcoming the 
decision of the Nobel Committee, on Friday, to award the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Liu 
Xiaobo, and urged for his immediate release.  
</p>
<p>1296. Liu Xiaobo participated in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in Beijing in 1989, 
worked as a professor at Beijing Normal University, and co-authored the Charter 08 
document which called for multiparty democracy and greater respect for human rights in 
the country.  
</p>
<p>1297. &#8220;Liu Xiaobo is a courageous human rights defender who has continuously and 
peacefully advocated for greater respect for human rights in the People&#8217;s Republic of 
China. We welcome the recognition of his work,&#8221; stated the experts.  
</p>
<p>1298. &#8220;For many years, we have expressed to the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of 
China concerns regarding violations of Liu Xiaobo&#8217;s fundamental human rights,&#8221; noted the 
experts. &#8220;This includes his detention in October 1997 and the sentence of re-education 
through labour for speaking out about the country&#8217;s one-party political system, found to be 
arbitrary in a decision adopted by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.&#8221;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>210</b>  
</p>
<p>1299. Most recently, Liu Xiaobo was convicted by the Beijing No.1 Municipal Court for 
&#8220;inciting subversion of State power&#8221; and, on 25 December 2009, was sentenced to 11 years 
in prison and two years&#8217; deprivation of political rights. &#8220;Such a harsh sentence for his 
peaceful activities in drafting and organizing the signing of Charter 08 is a clear violation of 
international human rights standards on the right to freedom of expression,&#8221; the experts 
stated. They also noted that there were many irregularities with the trial which did not 
conform to international standards regarding the right to a fair and public hearing. 
</p>
<p>1300. &#8220;On this occasion, we appeal to the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China 
to release all persons detained for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression 
and to respect the spirit of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
which the Government is a signatory,&#8221; said the experts. &#8220;We encourage the Government to 
take the final step and ratify this important international instrument.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b>  11 November 2010 - UN experts condemn &#8220;brutal summary execution&#8221; of teenage 
girls in Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>1301. The Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia; Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief; Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers; and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences condemned the recent public execution, by firing squad, of two teenage girls 
in central Somalia, saying the executions are the latest manifestation of the &#8220;appalling 
human rights crisis that is plaguing the country.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1302. &#8220;We were horrified to learn of the public execution, reportedly carried out by Al-
Shabaab insurgents on 27 October in front of hundreds of residents in Beledweyne,&#8221; the 
experts said. &#8220;We join the Somali people in condemning, in the strongest terms, these latest 
brutal summary executions of two young women convicted without any semblance of due 
process.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1303. The six experts called on the parties to the conflict &#8220;to immediately refrain from 
committing acts of extrajudicial executions, torture, stonings, decapitation, amputations and 
floggings as well as other human rights violations, including with regard to freedom of 
religion.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1304. The six UN experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, said they 
were deeply concerned that &#8220;groups such as Al-Shabaab are taking Somalia back into the 
stone age.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1305. &#8220;In Mogadishu and in southern and central regions, judicial institutions have ceased 
to function,&#8221; the experts said, noting that human rights organizations have received credible 
reports that &#8220;in areas controlled by insurgent groups, ad hoc tribunals are judging and 
sentencing civilians to cruel and inhuman punishments, without proper due process, in 
violation of both Somali and international human rights law.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1306. They called on all parties to respect their obligations and to protect civilians, noting 
that &#8220;all parties in the conflict are bound to comply with the terms of the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949 and of customary international humanitarian law, especially Common 
article 3 which prohibits violence to life and person -- in particular murder of all kinds, 
mutilation, cruel treatment and torture.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1307. In Mogadishu, regular indiscriminate attacks in which heavy artillery, mortars, 
rocket-propelled grenades, heavy machine guns and roadside bombs have been used, as 
well as targeted assassinations, have caused thousands of deaths and wounded, as well as 
destruction of property with whole neighborhoods razed to the ground. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>211 
</b></p>
<p>1308. The Independent Expert on Somalia, Shamsul Bari, also pointed to constant reports 
of sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and female genital mutilation, as well 
as forced child marriages and the lack of educational opportunities for young girls and 
boys. &#8220;Sexual violence continues to rise, not only among the approximately 1.4 million 
people displaced inside the country, but in other parts of Somali society,&#8221; Mr. Bari said.  
</p>
<p>1309. &#8220;It is also extremely sad, and deeply worrying for the country&#8217;s future, that only 10 
percent of Somali children currently attend school.&#8221; Mr. Bari also noted that frequent 
reports are also coming in of violations of the freedom of religion, including the destruction 
of places of worship and cemeteries of Sufi Muslim groups. 
</p>
<p>1310. &#8220;We offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all the victims, 
including the two girls publicly executed in Beledweyne, and call on the international 
community to never let up on efforts to investigate these unacceptable crimes and prosecute 
the perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law,&#8221; the six experts said.  
</p>
<p><b>  2 February 2011 &#8211; UN experts call for moratorium on the death penalty in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran 
</b></p>
<p>1311. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyer together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions warned that there has 
been a dramatic surge in death sentences in the Islamic Republic of Iran carried out in the 
absence of internationally recognized safeguards, despite numerous calls by the UN to 
immediately halt executions.  
</p>
<p>1312. &#8220;We call on the Iranian Government to immediately declare a moratorium on the 
death penalty in view of the gravity of the situation and the regular disregard of due process 
guarantees,&#8221; urged the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, Christof Heyns, and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, Gabriela Knaul.  
</p>
<p>1313. &#8220;Any death sentence undertaken in contravention of a Government&#8217;s international 
obligations is tantamount to an arbitrary execution,&#8221; Mr. Heyns stressed. The UN expert 
noted that in January alone, at least 66 people have reportedly been put to death, with some 
sources reporting up to 83 executions, the majority on charges of drug trafficking, 
<i>moharebeh</i> (enmity against God) and alleged membership in or contact with a banned 
opposition group. A large number of the executions of those charged with drug trafficking 
have reportedly taken place at Vakilabad prison.  
</p>
<p>1314. &#8220;Such a practice is unacceptable,&#8221; Mr. Heyns said. &#8220;Under international law, the 
death penalty is regarded as an extreme form of punishment which, if it is used at all, 
should only be imposed for the most serious crimes, after a fair trial.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1315. On her part, Ms. Knaul also deplored that &#8220;in many cases, people sentenced to death 
do not have access to legal representation and their families and lawyers are not even 
informed of the execution.&#8221; She pointed out that &#8220;the ongoing violations of fair trial 
guarantees and recurrent application of the death penalty by the judiciary, may be seen as a 
means to intimidate the population.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1316. Both UN experts urged the Iranian Government to comply with its international 
obligations, reiterating the General Assembly resolution 65/226 adopted on 21 December 
2010, which called on the Government to abolish executions carried out in the absence of 
respect for internationally recognized standards.  
</p>
<p>1317. The Special Rapporteurs reiterated the appeals made to the Iranian authorities by 
several UN independent experts to allow them to visit the country, and encouraged the 
Government to respond positively to their request.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>  3 February 2011 - Governments must pay more attention to people&#8217;s voices 
</b></p>
<p>1318. The Independent Expert on human rights and extreme poverty; Special Rapporteur 
on the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders; Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers; 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment; Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; and the 
Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that &#8220;Recent events 
in several countries are an expression of the frustration felt by many individuals whose 
voices have been neglected or ignored by their own Governments.  
</p>
<p>1319. Over the past several weeks, men and women in many countries, including Belarus, 
Egypt and Tunisia, have expressed grievances related to, among others, lack of employment 
opportunities and infringements on the right to an adequate standard of living, including the 
rights to food and housing, which have been exacerbated by the increasing cost of food and 
other basic commodities. They have also denounced the denial of their right to participate 
meaningfully in decision-making, underscoring the indivisibility of all human rights: civil, 
cultural, economic, political and social. 
</p>
<p>1320. We are alarmed at increasing limitations on the right to freedom of expression and 
information imposed by Governments actively seeking to suppress the rising number of 
voices who wish to be heard. We are particularly concerned by ill-treatment and arbitrary 
arrests of protesters, journalists, human rights defenders and lawyers. We are disturbed at 
the major disruptions in communication networks and transmissions of news so essential to 
the modern world. 
</p>
<p>1321. The freedoms of peaceful assembly and association are among the most fundamental 
rights underpinning a democratic society. We applaud the Human Rights Council for 
having confirmed this by creating a new human rights mechanism and look forward to the 
appointment of the expert who will be tasked to uphold these rights. 
</p>
<p>1322. Notwithstanding this, we deeply deplore the tragic loss of lives and injuries as a 
result, in some cases, of the excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators. We urge 
Governments to abide by international standards, including those on the use of force and 
firearms. Prompt and impartial investigations into any related deaths or injuries are of the 
utmost importance to bring the perpetrators to justice and protect human rights under the 
rule of law is paramount.  
</p>
<p>1323. As the recent turmoil has demonstrated, ignoring the root causes of such protests is 
unsustainable, and concerted, effective and prompt action must be taken domestically and 
internationally to provide an avenue for peaceful redress of human rights grievances, 
including the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. We stand ready to assist 
the respective countries in any appropriate manner.&#8221;

<p><b>  8 March 2011 -&#8220;Implement and enforce,&#8221; UN experts urge governments to ensure 
womens&#8217; right to equality 
</b></p>
<p>1324. On the International Women&#8217;s Day centenary, the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
housing; Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders; Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers; 
Special Rapporteur on migrants; Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons; Special 
Rapporteur on Palestinian territories; Working Group on people of African descent; and the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances urged States to respect, protect 
and fulfill women&#8217;s right to non-discrimination and equality. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/30/Add.1

<p>1325. &#8220;This must be amongst their highest priorities but is too often neglected or subject to 
inadequate or token efforts,&#8221; Ms. Manjoo said in a joint statement with other UN 
independent experts*. &#8220;The challenge is to move more decisively from an era of rhetorical 
engagement to one of implementation and enforcement.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1326. &#8220;The human rights of women and girls are an inalienable, integral and indivisible 
part of universal human rights,&#8221; the group of experts said, reminding Governments around 
the world of their obligations to ensure the realization of women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>1327. The experts urged States to ensure that laws, policies, programmes and institutional 
structures ultimately result in the equal enjoyment by women of their civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>1328. On International Women&#8217;s Day, they also called for the protection of women and 
girls against discrimination committed by private actors. &#8220;Discrimination that takes place 
within ostensibly private spaces is not beyond the control and regulation of State 
institutions.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1329. &#8220;While, in many cases, advances have been made in the adoption of standards and 
the recognition of women&#8217;s rights,&#8221; the experts said, &#8220;the reality of the lives of so many 
women shows that implementation of standards and commitment on the ground is still 
unacceptably weak.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1330. The UN independent experts emphasized that States&#8217; obligations remain applicable 
even during armed conflict or in states of emergency caused by mankind or natural 
disasters and without discrimination, to all those within their territory or under their 
jurisdiction, including refugees, asylum seekers, migrant workers, victims of trafficking and 
stateless persons.
