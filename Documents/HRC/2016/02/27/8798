</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report is the fourth submitted by the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights situation and the activities of her 
Office in Nepal to the Human Rights Council. The report reflects some positive 
developments since the previous report (A/HRC/10/53), including in relation to policies on 
violence against women and reducing discrimination. Though Nepal&#8217;s peace process &#8212; 
which began with a peace agreement that formally ended a ten-year internal armed conflict 
&#8212; has delivered improvements in the human rights situation since 2006, it has lost 
considerable momentum over the past year, giving rise to increasing concerns about longer-
term peace and stability. Political instability, the impasse in the implementation of several 
key provisions in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, de facto impunity for serious 
human rights violations and abuses, and deficiencies in the rule of law framework 
aggravate an already weakened public security situation and have a negative impact on the 
overall human rights situation. The widespread inequality and discrimination that gave rise 
to the conflict persist and expectations that the new political order signalled by the 2006 
people&#8217;s movement would foster greater respect for human rights and democracy have been 
severely tested. Despite many challenges, the peace process in Nepal continues to hold 
promise, provided all parties recommit themselves to the human rights principles at the 
centre of the peace agreement.

</p>
<p>process could be included.

<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Political developments in recent months have drawn attention to the increasingly 
fragile state of the peace process in Nepal. Ongoing political uncertainty following the 
withdrawal of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (UCPN-M) from 
Government in May 2009, led to a general stalling of the peace process which has hindered 
opportunities for Nepal to make progress on essential human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>2. Progress has been made through measures to improve social inclusion, in particular 
with regard to the representation of marginalized groups in the Constituent Assembly and 
steps to eradicate the practices of &#8220;untouchability&#8221; and bonded labour. A new act on 
domestic violence came into effect in May, one of only two pieces of legislation adopted by 
the Legislature-Parliament in 2009. The Government has also taken some positive steps in 
its preparation for a transitional justice process, and must now ensure their careful 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>3. The courts have instructed the Government to move forward on investigations into 
several conflict related cases, ,but minimal steps have been taken to end impunity, despite 
repeated commitments by the authorities. While the Government has provided reparation to 
a number of conflict victims, it has taken no visible steps to hold accountable any 
individual responsible for grave human rights violations and abuses committed during or 
after the conflict. According to the National Human Rights Commission, the Government 
has failed to implement the vast majority of recommendations issued by the Commission 
while cooperation by State security forces with human rights investigations, including 
investigations by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) into conflict-related violations, remains poor.  
</p>
<p>4. Criminal armed groups and militant organizations which espouse a political agenda 
continue to create a serious public security problem, particularly in the eastern and central 
Tarai regions. As the May 2010 deadline for the new Constitution approaches, protests and 
enforced general strikes (<i>bandhs</i>) are becoming more frequent and opportunities for 
constructive dialogue among all stakeholders are often overshadowed by narrow political 
interests. The Government has adopted a new security plan and other strategies to address 
the worsening public security situation and while the Government has reported subsequent 
improvement in public security, the implementation of the plan has given rise to a number 
of human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p>5. The ongoing political crisis has exposed fundamental differences between the major 
political parties on some of the most basic elements agreed to in the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement. Protracted inter-party disagreements have prevented the Government and the 
Constituent Assembly from functioning fully. Despite some initially encouraging progress 
on human rights issues, including a Government proposal for amending a number of 
discriminatory laws, the Legislature-Parliament has produced few tangible results, due in 
particular to obstructions by UCPN-M, the largest party.  
</p>
<p>6. Though Nepal faces many considerable challenges, all major parties continue to 
express their commitment to the peace process. Real progress is possible if all parties 
dedicate themselves to fostering a productive working relationship focused on the greater 
good of the Nepali people, for which respect for human rights is fundamental. The presence 
of the United Nations, including OHCHR, remains crucial during this period of post-
conflict transition, and provides support for emerging structures in Nepal whose aim is to 
build a more stable and inclusive political order based on respect for human rights and the 
rule of law.  </p>


<p><b> II. Centrality of human rights to the peace process 
</b></p>
<p>7. Historically embedded discrimination against marginalized groups, the lack of 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by a majority of the population and a 
deeply-entrenched culture of impunity contributed to the emergence of Nepal&#8217;s ten-year 
conflict and continue to pose significant challenges to long-term peace and stability. By 
conferring a central place to human rights in the 2006 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, 
both parties to the agreement affirmed that respect for human rights must be a bedrock 
principle of the peace process.  
</p>
<p>8. Three years since the signing of the peace agreement, the situation in Nepal 
demonstrates that respect for human rights is critical for the sustainability of the peace 
process. To date, not a single perpetrator of major human rights violations or abuses 
committed during the conflict has been convicted. De facto impunity for conflict-related 
violations and abuses, combined with ineffective policing, undermines the trust of Nepalis 
in the State to enforce the rule of law, particularly against those with political influence. 
The persistent lack of accountability contributes to an environment in which private citizens 
are increasingly taking the law into their own hands.  
</p>
<p>9. There is also an increasing lack of faith in the ability of the State to deliver basic 
services and to reduce escalating socio-economic inequalities that are now the highest in 
South Asia.1 Widespread poverty in Nepal remains a particularly pressing human rights 
concern, given its link to long-standing structural discrimination against historically 
marginalized communities. The diarrhea outbreak in the mid- and far western regionsin 
2009, which killed hundreds and severely impacted individuals from marginalized 
communities, including women, underscores the close connection between discrimination 
and poverty in Nepal.  
</p>
<p>10. The use of children for political purposes by the major political parties remains a 
significant concern, particularly with respect to UCPN-M, still listed in the annual report of 
the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict as a party to conflict which has 
recruited and used children. The plan of action for the discharge from the Maoist army, of 
2,973 minors disqualified during the 2007 United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) 
verification process, which was signed by the Government of Nepal, UCPN-M, and the 
United Nations on 16 December 2009, is a welcome development. 
</p>
<p>11. If the Government does not translate its repeated human rights into meaningful 
action and address effectively the legitimate grievances of many in post-conflict Nepal, this 
has the potential to further destabilize the political situation and ultimately imperil the 
peace process. The establishment of effective transitional justice mechanisms that will 
address conflict victims&#8217; claims for truth and justice, as envisaged in the peace agreement, 
should support a broader transformation in Nepal from a culture of impunity to one of 
accountability and respect for the rule of law.  
</p>
<p><b> III. OHCHR-Nepal operations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>12. The mandate of OHCHR -Nepal was first set out in the 2005 agreement between the 
Government of Nepal and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The 
</p>
<p>  
 1 World Bank, Nepal Country Overview 2009. </p>


<p>agreement was renewed in 2007 for a further two years and in July 2009, following an 
interim three-month extension issued to allow the then newly-formed Cabinet to discuss a 
longer-term extension, the agreement was renewed until June 2010. In addition, the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2006 itself mandates OHCHR to monitor the human 
rights provisions of the agreement. 
</p>
<p>13. OHCHR-Nepal has maintained a continuous field presence since it was established 
in May 2005. Given its long-standing and extensive presence in regions outside of the 
capital, the networks it has developed with authorities, civil society and the general public, 
the knowledge of the country it has acquired, and the capacity of its monitoring teams to 
rapidly deploy to the districts, the office continues to fulfil a significant role at this stage of 
the peace process, including with regard to minimizing potential violence among political 
actors.  
</p>
<p>14. In light of earlier positive developments in the post-conflict context, OHCHR-Nepal 
made the decision to reduce and rationalize its operations and to concentrate on 
strengthening partnerships and the capacity of national institutions and civil society to 
better support a sustainable peace process. At the same time, OHCHR monitoring teams 
continue to be active across the country.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Preventive role 
</b></p>
<p>15. One key impact of OHCHR&#8217;s work in Nepal has been to help expand the space in 
which local actors &#8212; victims as well as human rights defenders &#8212; can safely raise human 
rights issues and concerns without fear of repercussions. The close contact that OHCHR 
maintains with local human rights defenders in all regions, combined with its ability to 
deploy quickly human rights monitors to the field, has on multiple occasions enabled 
OHCHR to help defuse local tensions before they could escalate into serious incidents.  
</p>
<p>16. In addition to its regular field visits, the Office has responded to requests from 
Government officials to deploy human rights monitors to particular districts during times of 
local crisis. For example, district and regional officials requested OHCHR to send 
monitoring teams to Ramechhap district in May and June 2009 to help ease tensions 
between UCPN-M and the Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, which followed the 
resignation of the UCPN-M Prime Minister. In June 2009 an OHCHR team travelled to 
Kalikot district in the mid-western region in a joint mission with the UNMIN Political 
Affairs Office following several incidents between UCPN-M and cadres from the UML 
party and the Nepali Congress (NC) party which erupted into major clashes on 7, 14 and 15 
June. In October 2009 the Chief District Officer of Bhojpur district requested OHCHR to 
visit the district to verify the facts regarding a recent clash between UCPN-M and other 
political parties and to help ease tensions between political actors. OHCHR field teams 
responded recently to tensions and violent incidents during confrontations between the 
youth wings of UCPN-M and UML in Dhankuta and Taplejung districts.  
</p>
<p>17. As human rights concerns relating to the security situation in the Tarai increased in 
the post-conflict context, particularly in relation to protests by marginalized communities, 
OHCHR has intervened in a significant number of cases relating to detention, abduction, 
and torture, and continues to follow-up on numerous alleged extra-judicial killings by the 
police. The monitoring conducted by OHCHR reveals the continuing need for reform in the 
security sector; OHCHR has provided concrete recommendations to the authorities on this 
issue on a number of occasions. 
</p>
<p>18. OHCHR has continued to monitor political protests and rallies throughout the 
country, engaging with security forces and protest organizers to ensure that both sides are 
clear about their respective rights and responsibilities during demonstrations. OHCHR, </p>


<p>together with a network of human rights organisations, deployed a large number of 
monitoring teams to sensitive sites during the UCPN-M mass protests in Kathmandu on 12 
and 13 November 2009. The presence of human rights monitors in significant numbers 
appears to have had a moderating effect on actions by both security forces and 
demonstrators. 
</p>
<p>19. In all cases, work by OHCHR has benefited significantly from close collaboration 
with the National Human Rights Commission and local human rights defenders, who have 
long played an essential role in monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation in 
Nepal, often under very difficult circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Thematic approach 
</b></p>
<p>20. In connection with monitoring human rights aspects of the peace process, OHCHR 
has adopted a more programmatic and strategic approach to address some long-standing 
issues which are among the root causes of the conflict. 
</p>
<p>21. The efforts to build a constructive relationship with the National Human Rights 
Commission have required striking a balance between strengthening the role and capacity 
of the Commission and ensuring against an interim gap in human rights protection. 
OHCHR and the National Human Rights Commission signed a set of guidelines for 
cooperation in February 2009, reflecting this balance and signaling a new phase of 
cooperation.  
</p>
<p>22. A key task of OHCHR-Nepal in 2009 was to support the Government to design and 
begin to implement a transitional justice strategy, as provided for in the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement, to address impunity and the legitimate claims of conflict victims for 
truth, reparations and justice. With the establishment of transitional justice institutions still 
pending, ongoing dialogue with the Government and other major stakeholders on this issue 
has contributed to a higher level of awareness with regard to the necessary elements of an 
effective transitional justice programme.  
</p>
<p>23. With regard to issues of discrimination and economic, social and cultural rights in 
Nepal, the Office has significantly increased its advocacy activities with political actors and 
other partners in order to raise awareness and promote reforms. The far western region field 
office has been transformed into a project office devoted exclusively to anti-discrimination 
projects. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Cooperation with the United Nations country team and the donor 
community 
</b></p>
<p>24. OHCHR continued to collaborate closely with UNMIN to ensure complementary 
and, where appropriate, joint activities on human rights issues. Since the closure of UNMIN 
field presences in July 2008, OHCHR field offices have taken on a greater role in providing 
information to the mission and other partners regarding the situation in the field.  
</p>
<p>25. Through the United Nations country team, OHCHR collaborated closely with 
United Nations agencies in Nepal to encourage a human rights-based approach for all 
United Nations activities in the country. Cooperation between OHCHR and the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has focused in particular on strengthening the 
capacity of the National Human Rights Commission. In its capacity as lead agency of the 
protection cluster of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, OHCHR continued to monitor 
protection concerns with regard to floods, which have severely affected parts of the </p>


<p>country, and to build the capacity of national actors in the protection aspects of 
humanitarian disasters.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main human rights issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Impunity and transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>26. Despite the public and private made commitments by the Government, including 
those made by the Prime Minister before the General Assembly in September 2009, there 
has been no substantial progress in addressing impunity for conflict or post-conflict human 
rights violations and abuses. Both the Nepalese Army and UCPN-M continue to resist 
attempts to hold their personnel accountable for human rights violations and abuses and to 
withhold cooperation from civilian authorities responsible for investigating these cases. 
Progress made by the Government toward the establishment of transitional justice 
institutions is in danger of being undermined by insufficient political support and and by 
shortcomings in draft legislation, which has yet to be approved by the Legislature-
Parliament.  
</p>
<p>27. Persistent impunity for human rights violations has had had a corrosive effect on 
rule of law institutions and has further damaged their credibility. Impunity has contributed 
directly to widespread failings in public security by sending a message that violence carries 
no consequences for the perpetrator. Nepal has relatively independent rule of law 
institutions, but they remain vulnerable to political pressure and manipulation and are in 
need of support. 
</p>
<p>28. This lack of progress notwithstanding, the coming year, which should see the 
promulgation of a new Constitution and the beginning of a transitional justice process, will 
present important opportunities to the Government and the UCPN-M leadership to make 
good on their repeated commitments to ensuring accountability and the rule of law, which 
political actors in Nepal have affirmed is necessary for the success of the peace process.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Impunity for human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Government&#8217;s lack of response to serious allegations of human rights violations 
involving Army personnel remains a concern, including with regard to the non-
implementation of orders issued by Nepali courts. The Kavre District Court issued a 
decision in September 2009 ordering the Army to suspend an alleged perpetrator, against 
whom an arrest warrant is outstanding, in the torture and killing of 15-year-old Maina 
Sunuwar in 2004 and to produce relevant documents. The Army failed to comply with the 
order to suspend the suspect, whom it sent on a United Nations peacekeeping mission. The 
officer was subsequently repatriated by the United Nations. The Nepalese Army has refused 
to surrender him to civilian authorities for an independent investigation, despite requests 
from the Nepal Police and National Human Rights Commission. The Government has yet 
to arrest any of the four accused in the case, even though arrest warrants have been 
outstanding since July 2008.  
</p>
<p>30. The Nepalese Army has yet to take any action against personnel implicated either 
directly or through chain-of-command responsibility in acts of conflict-related torture and 
enforced disappearances at the Tenth Brigade&#8217;s Maharajgunj barracks in Kathmandu and at 
the Chisapani barracks in Bardiya district, which have been extensively documented by </p>


<p>OHCHR in public reports released in 2006 and 2008 respectively.2 One of the main alleged 
perpetrators of the violations in Bardiya district continues to serve with the Army and 
senior officers implicated in the Maharajgunj barracks violations have been promoted. 
OHCHR is seriously concerned by the recent Government decision to promote to 
Lieutenant General and second-in-command of the Nepalese Army Toran Bahadur Singh, 
who was Commander of the Tenth Brigade during the time of the Maharajgunj barracks 
disappearances in 2003-2004, without conducting a full, transparent and impartial 
investigation into his involvement in or responsibility for the disappearances.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>31. The leadership of UCPN-M has likewise failed to cooperate with criminal 
investigations into the involvement of its cadres in serious human rights abuses during and 
after the conflict, including the killings of nearly 40 civilians in the bombing of a public bus 
in Madi, Chitwan district in 2005 and the killings of Ram Hari Shrestha, Arjun Lama, and 
the journalist Birendra Sah. OHCHR documented the lack of progress in each of these cases 
in a letter to the Chairman of UCPN-M in July 2009, following a meeting between the 
OHCHR Representative and the UCPN-M Chairman, and has yet to receive a response. 
UCPN-M has also failed to make good on its public commitment to inform the families of 
victims abducted by its cadres in Bardiya district during the conflict about the fate of their 
loved ones. 
</p>
<p>32. Gaps and ambiguities in Nepal&#8217;s legal framework have further hampered the 
prosecution of human rights violations in Nepali courts. Despite years of advocacy by civil 
society organizations and the recent painful history of human rights violations and abuses in 
the country, neither torture nor enforced disappearance have been criminalized in Nepal. In 
the case of torture, the interim Constitution, the Convention against Torture (to which 
Nepal is a party) and decisions of the Nepal Supreme Court obligate the State to adopt laws 
criminalizing torture, yet the Government has taken no concrete steps to do so. These and 
other gaps in the legal framework place additional obstacles in the way of victims and 
families seeking accountability in an already impaired criminal justice system.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Transitional justice initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Government has taken positive steps towards the establishment of transitional 
justice institutions, including a commission of inquiry on disappearances and a truth and 
reconciliation commission. Draft legislation criminalizing disappearances and establishing 
the framework for a commission was approved by the Council of Ministers and sent to the 
Legislature-Parliament for consideration in November 2009. The Ministry of Peace and 
Reconstruction made improvements to the draft following consultation with human rights 
organizations, including OHCHR. However, the bill still falls short of international 
standards, including through a restrictive six-month limitation on the filing of criminal 
complaints, and makes no reference to crimes against humanity or other international 
crimes. 
</p>
<p>34. The Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction conducted a series of public consultations 
on a draft bill establishing the framework for a truth and reconciliation commission, 
including special consultations with indigenous people&#8217;s, children and women&#8217;s 
organizations. These consultations received strong and consistent feedback from the public, 
including demands that no amnesties should be granted for serious human rights violations 
and that any commission should include substantial representation from victims themselves. 
After further consultation with human rights organizations, including OHCHR, the 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See <i>Report of investigation into arbitrary detention, torture and disappearances at Maharajgunj RNA 
</i></p>
<p><i>barracks, Kathmandu, in 2003&#8211;2004</i>, OHCHR-Nepal, May 2006; and <i>Conflict Related 
Disappearances in Bardiya District</i>, OHCHR-Nepal, December 2008. </p>


<p>Government made substantial, positive changes to the draft, which is expected to be sent to 
the Council of Ministers and then the Legislature-Parliament for approval. The Government 
is confident that the process of approving the draft bills on the establishment of a 
commission on inquiry on disappearances and a truth and reconciliation commission will be 
finalized soon. OHCHR, through the implementation of a United Nations Peace Building 
Fund project, has been providing assistance to the Ministry. 
</p>
<p>35. The Government continues to distribute interim financial relief to families of 
individuals who were killed or disappeared during the conflict. Though the distribution of 
relief has been uneven, victims groups have had some success in securing relief for their 
members and relief payments have had a positive impact on many conflict-affected 
families. According to the Government, to date more than 1.43 billion rupees have been 
provided as interim relief payment to victims and their families. There remains a need for 
the Government to develop a comprehensive reparations policy.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Public security and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Nepal Police and the Armed Police Force continue to make efforts to integrate 
human rights principles into their training and orientation programmes, including the 
dissemination of a Nepal Police standing order on human rights and Armed Police Force 
human rights handbook, developed with the support of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>37. However, Nepal continues to experience serious challenges to law and order, 
particularly in the southern Tarai plains where armed groups engage in threats, extortion 
and abductions for ransom. In addition, the UCPN-M affiliated Young Communist League 
and other youth wings associated with political parties continue to engage in criminal 
activities, with little fear of being held accountable for their actions. In response to the 
deteriorating public security situation, the Government announced a new special security 
plan in July 2009 which includes an expansion of the Armed Police Force and an overall 
increase in police presence in troubled districts. The Government has indicated that violent 
criminal activity in some parts of the country has decreased since the Government began 
implementation of the plan. 
</p>
<p>38. In this context of poor public security and weak rule of law institutions, allegations 
of extra-judicial killings during &#8220;encounters&#8221; between police and members of armed groups 
continue to be reported. Though the Government is reluctant to acknowledge that extra-
judicial killings may have been committed by members of the security forces, OHCHR has 
documented over 30 credible allegations of extra-judicial killings attributed to the police in 
2008 and 2009. While some observers have linked recent killings to more aggressive 
policing under new Government security policies, there is to date no clear evidence that 
these are a direct consequence of the special security plan. In many of these cases, police 
refused to register complaints from victims&#8217; families or conduct investigations. To date no 
one has been held criminally responsible for any of these alleged extra-judicial killings. 
OHCHR has urged the Government to set up a special investigative unit with sufficient 
independence to inquire into these grave allegations. 
</p>
<p>39. Political interference in the work of the police, prosecutors and judges remainsof 
concern. OHCHR has documented numerous cases in which political parties at the local 
and national levels have exerted pressure on the authorities to secure the release of criminal 
suspects with political connections or have otherwise obstructed criminal proceedings. The 
Government continues to withdraw criminal cases that it characterizes as &#8220;politically 
motivated&#8221;, including charges for serious crimes such as murder. Such recent actions 
follow the withdrawal of hundreds of criminal charges in 2008, which drew widespread 
criticism from civil society and the international community. OHCHR continues to work 
closely with partners in the criminal justice system and to call on political actors to respect 
the integrity of all criminal proceedings and strengthen the rule of law. </p>


<p><b> B. Discrimination and the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>40. Long-standing discrimination and social exclusion remain deeply rooted in Nepal. 
Wide disparities in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights were one of the 
factors giving rise to the armed conflict, and remedying them will be crucial for a 
successful post-conflict transition. Discrimination associated with gender, caste, class, 
ethnicity, disability and geography, continues to be among the major barriers to the 
effective realization of economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>41. Marginalised and disadvantaged groups such as the <i>haliyas</i> (bonded labourers 
working as land tillers), formally freed from bondage by a Government declaration in 
September 2008, continue to live in often deplorable conditions, while their access to food, 
health, education and fair conditions of employment remains a major challenge. In the mid-
western Tarai, the practice of <i>kamalari</i>, by which girls (generally between the ages of 8 and 
14) from poor Tharu families are sent to work for years at a time in the private homes of 
wealthy or privileged families, remains prevalent, and puts them at risk of severe 
exploitation, including sexual exploitation. The practice continues despite a Supreme Court 
decision on 10 September 2006 ordering effective implementation of existing laws that 
prohibit child exploitation. OHCHR continues to engage in regional and central level 
advocacy on this issue, including through joint efforts with other United Nations agencies, 
and has a project in Baitadi and Dadeldhura districts dedicated to addressing caste-based 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people visited Nepal in December 2008. Among the issues 
discussed were the widespread concerns over appropriate implementation of International 
Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
in Independent Countries (Convention No. 169). Some groups in Nepal have invoked 
Convention 169 as a basis for assuming control of business and development projects, and 
international non-governmental organizations and donor programmes have been affected. 
The development community has had several meetings with representatives of indigenous 
groups to clarify the situation and, with the input and support from OHCHR, recently 
published a new policy on Convention No. 169 and the approach of the international 
community. Reflecting the need for greater clarity regarding the appropriate 
implementation of Convention in Nepal, the Government formed a task force in September 
2008 to develop a plan of action, a draft of which was submitted to the Cabinet on 28 
October 2009. 
</p>
<p>43. A wide spectrum of civil society organizations representing discriminated groups, 
including Dalits, indigenous peoples, disabled and religious and sexual minorities, prepared 
a joint report that was submitted at the Durban Review Conference. The organizations have 
continued to advocate for these issues in meetings with the Government.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Government continued to make progress with regard to ensuring the right to 
health, including the provision of free maternity care to all Nepalese women since 2009 and 
treatment of uterine prolapse, An outbreak of diarrhea occurred in the hill districts of mid 
and far western regions from mid-April to mid-October 2009. The outbreak reportedly 
claimed the lives of 367 people. Though Dalits constitute roughly 15 per cent of the 
population in the affected districts, they accounted for 39 per cent of the deceased.  </p>


<p><b> 3. Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>45. The effective enjoyment of the right to food remains a serious problem throughout 
the country. Natural calamities, including drought, landslides and floods, contributed to a 
significant decline in local food production in both 2008 and 2009, resulting in severe food 
shortages in several hill and mountain districts. Lack of infrastructure in the remote hill 
districts and frequent enforced general strikes (<i>bandhs</i>) imposed by political actors have 
further complicated food distribution, leaving the local population more vulnerable to 
hunger. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), approximately 3.7 million people 
are food insecure throughout the country. 3 The affected population has resorted to severe 
and unsustainable coping mechanisms, including skipping meals, removing children from 
school and selling assets.  
</p>
<p>46. Although food insecurity persists throughout the country, certain groups have been 
affected more than others. They include marginalised and vulnerable groups such as Dalits, 
indigenous peoples, former bonded labourers, persons with disabilities and people living 
with or affected by HIV/AIDS. In its proposed budget for the fiscal year 2009/10, the 
Government announced special programmes to address food shortage in 23 affected 
districts in the hill regions, but a delay in approval of the budget until the end of November 
2009 meant that many of these communities continued to remain at high risk of severe food 
shortages.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to justice  
</b></p>
<p>47. Members of marginalized groups continue to face obstacles in accessing justice, 
largely as a result of discrimination. Main challenges include the obstacles faced by victims 
and their families when they attempt to register a formal complaint with the police. 
Complainants are often encouraged, and in many cases coerced, to reach a settlement 
outside the formal justice system, even in cases of serious crime. The police often play a 
primary role in these informal settlements, which tend to favour wealthier individuals in 
positions of influence. Even when victims succeed in filing a formal complaint, in many 
cases they are forced to withdraw the complaint by community leaders or political parties in 
the name of maintaining community harmony.  
</p>
<p>48. Reports of violence against women have been increasing, with a surge in cases of 
dowry deaths and abuse of women accused of practicing witchcraft. In many communities, 
legislative weakness and inadequate policing continue to make prosecutions for domestic 
and sexual violence extremely difficult. To address one of the worst forms of violence 
against women, OHCHR and the Office of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers 
jointly launched a short television segment highlighting the issue of violence against 
women accused of practicing witchcraft.  
</p>
<p>49. The new act on domestic violence removes the previous 35-day statute of limitations 
on filing a case of rape, but this has yet to be implemented in practice. In response to 
increasing reports of violence against women, OHCHR and the Office of Prime Minister 
and the Council of Ministers conducted a joint field mission to the five most affected 
districts in the eastern region in July 2009. Following the visit and other expressions of 
concern, the Prime Minister announced a year-long campaign to combat violence against 
women which was launched on 25 November. OHCHR welcomes this promising initiative, 
while noting the magnitude of the challenge.

<p><b> C. Constitution drafting process  
</b></p>
<p>50. The Constituent Assembly has made slow progress in drafting the new Constitution, 
one of the key pillars of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Despite repeated delays, 
2009 saw an increase in activity by the Constituent Assembly, and the thematic committees 
have been actively engaged in deliberations on draft concept papers and texts. However, the 
Constituent Assembly Schedule has recently been revised for the eighth time in order to 
allow the thematic committees to finalize their respective concept papers. Out of 10 
thematic committees, eight have finalized their concept papers and draft texts. Failure to 
meet the deadline raises a potential risk of constitutional deadlock, as the extension of the 
Constituent Assembly&#8217;s tenure in a normal situation (a six-month extension is permitted by 
the Constitution in the event of state of emergency) would require an amendment to the 
interim Constitution, which is unlikely without political consensus. In addition, failure to 
meet the deadline may also erode public confidence in the Assembly and the political 
parties. Committees that have yet to complete their papers include those vested with the 
difficult topics of power and resource allocation under a federal structure. 
</p>
<p>51. The Constituent Assembly held a first round of public consultations in all districts of 
Nepal in February and March 2009. However, repeated amendments of the Constituent 
Assembly schedule have resulted in significantly less time being allocated to public 
consultations on the first draft (reduced from 12 to 4 weeks). This reduction raises 
questions about the quality of the public consultations, which are essential for ensuring 
national ownership of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR has noted the efforts made by the Committee on Fundamental Rights and 
Directive Principles and the Committee on the Rights of Minorities towards strengthening 
constitutional protection of all human rights in Nepal. The draft texts submitted by the 
committees include a number of provisions intended to strengthen human rights protection, 
including a more comprehensive non-discrimination clause; wider stipulation of economic, 
social and cultural rights; a number of collective rights including rights for minorities and 
the marginalized; and additional guarantees of the right to reparation for victims of crimes.  
</p>
<p>53. The drafting process for the new Constitution is under way and fundamental 
elements of the Constitution continue to be debated and discussed in the Constituent 
Assembly. It is crucial that the Constituent Assembly ensures the independence of the 
judiciary, particularly in the context of a recent proposal to shift the authority for 
determining the constitutionality of laws from the Supreme Court to a parliamentary 
committee. Shortcomings in the interim Constitution that should be remedied in the new 
Constitution include inadequate respect for the rights of non-citizens; inadequate guarantee 
of due process rights; limited coverage of the rights to liberty and security; lack of 
exception for retrospective criminal laws dealing with international crimes; provisions 
permitting broader derogations and limitations of rights contrary to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; lack of guarantees in relation to effective remedy 
and reparations for victims of human rights violations; and the lack of enforceability of 
economic, social and cultural rights guarantees on an equal footing with civil and political 
rights.  
</p>
<p><b> D. National capacity to promote and protect human rights  
</b></p>
<p>54. The key national institutions with specific mandates to promote and protect human 
rights &#8212; the National Human Rights Commission, the National Women&#8217;s Commission and 
National Dalit Commission &#8212; have each faced considerable challenges in realising their 
respective responsibilities. Though in principle each has been given considerable scope to 
engage in the defence of human rights, in practice each institution has had to overcome </p>


<p>serious handicaps, including lack of resources, insufficient legal basis, lack of cooperation 
from Government and, at times, direct political interference. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. The National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>55. The National Human Rights Commission, the principal constitutional body for the 
promotion and protection of human rights in Nepal, has had a particularly difficult year in 
its efforts to fulfil its mandate. Despite the Commission&#8217;s elevation to the level of a 
constitutional body in 2007, new governing legislation has yet to be passed. The draft 
finally submitted to the Legislature-Parliament in October 2009 has been criticised by the 
National Human Rights Commission itself, civil society and the international community as 
being inconsistent with the Paris Principles. OHCHR shares the Commission&#8217;s concerns 
that the bill as proposed would inhibit important powers of the institution, and that it 
removes a key reference to the &#8216;independence and autonomy of the Commission.  
</p>
<p>56. The failure of the Government to implement the recommendations of the National 
Human Rights Commission remains one of the Commission&#8217;s most significant challenges. 
According to the Commission, since its establishment in 2000, only 11 per cent of the 
Commission&#8217;s recommendations have been fully implemented by Government bodies, 
while more than 40 per cent have received no response at all from the State. Concerns about 
this lack of implementation have been raised repeatedly by the Commission. In February 
2009, the Chairperson threatened to resign if the Government continued to ignore the 
Commission&#8217;s recommendations.  
</p>
<p>57. The National Human Rights Commission has yet to establish fully effective 
cooperation with other human rights actors and has yet to develop a coherent strategy to 
fully engage with civil society or other national institutions with a human rights focus. In a 
memorandum to the Prime Minister in June 2009, the Commission claimed to have 
exclusive jurisdiction over the promotion and protection of human rights in Nepal, and in 
effect called into question activities by civil society and other human rights actors, 
including OHCHR. Existing coordination mechanisms are largely under the auspices of 
civil society actors or the international community, and Commission participation is 
minimal. While the Commission&#8217;s engagement with other human rights actors is more 
active at the local level, the absence of guidance from the national level has limited the 
development of these contacts.  
</p>
<p>58. In February 2009, OHCHR and the Commission agreed on a set of guidelines for 
regarding areas of future cooperation. The guidelines aim in particular at strengthening the 
Commission&#8217;s role in monitoring and investigating human rights violations; OHCHR 
would henceforth refer new cases to the Commission and follow up with active cooperation 
and support in the investigation of those cases. While the guidelines have led to improved 
collaboration between the offices and to a number of joint monitoring activities, there have 
been concerns regarding the current capacity of the Commission to undertake its caseload 
properly, particularly in the volatile Tarai districts. The Commission has not initiated 
investigations into nearly 75 per cent of cases referred by OHCHR, including cases of 
alleged extra-judicial executions and torture. Further capacity-strengthening is required for 
the Commission to be able to fulfil its mandate effectively and this will be a core 
component of the $2 million capacity-development project agreed in July 2009, which will 
be implemented jointly by OHCHR and UNDP.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. The National Dalit Commission and National Women&#8217;s Commission 
</b></p>
<p>59. The National Dalit Commission and the National Women&#8217;s Commission have been 
provided with insufficient resources to effectively realize their mandates to protect and 
promote the rights of Dalits and women respectively. The National Dalit Commission has 
also specific weaknesses in relation to its establishment due to the continuing absence of </p>


<p>governing legislation and is currently operating on the basis of a Government executive 
order. Although a draft bill was submitted to the Government in April 2009, there has been 
no subsequent progress, though a proposal has been tabled for both institutions to be given 
constitutional status when the new Constitution is promulgated.  
</p>
<p>60. The National Women&#8217;s Commission faced direct political interference when the 
cabinet issued a decision on 7 October 2009, relieving the Chairperson and all five 
commissioners of their posts, even though they had two more years of their mandates 
remaining. The Supreme Court later issued a stay order, preventing implementation of the 
Government&#8217;s decision until the court issues a ruling. However, the move can be viewed as 
direct political interference in the independence of a national institution, particularly when 
viewed alongside the decision of the Government not to extend the mandates of the 
Commissioners of the National Women&#8217;s Commission in June 2009, the removal of the 
national land reform commissioners, and the weaknesses in the National Human Rights 
Commission Bill referred to above. In 2009, OHCHR Nepal attempted to develop active 
working relationships with both institutions, focusing on core capacity-building activities 
and facilitating the contacts of each institution with the grass-roots level. The National 
Women&#8217;s Commission participated in a special regional consultation of seven similar 
specialised women&#8217;s commissions in the Asia-Pacific region in Jakarta in December 2009. 
However, in relation to the National Dalit Commission these efforts were impeded 
following the end of the mandates of the previous commissioners in June 2009. To date, 
only a new chairperson has been appointed. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Civil society and human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>61. Although the risks faced by civil society actors and human rights defenders have 
decreased since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the State&#8217;s inability to 
provide adequate public security and the proliferation of armed groups and increased 
criminal activities in the Tarai, have left many rights defenders vulnerable. Political and 
communal protestors often impose restrictions on the freedom of movement of human 
rights defenders and prevent access to sites of alleged violations. Civil society actors have 
in some cases been perceived as protecting persons engaged in criminal activities and faced 
direct threats from local communities. Human rights defenders who raised concerns about 
the rights of the detainees faced significant threats and intimidation from both the police 
and members of the community.  
</p>
<p>62. Journalists have faced regular threats from armed groups and political parties for 
filing reports about their activities, and a female radio journalist in Janakpur was murdered 
in January 2009. Women human rights defenders and the group of defenders representing 
sexual minorities are particularly at risk in Nepal. Women human rights defenders face 
additional threats from within their communities and families in relation to their work in 
defence of women&#8217;s rights, which is often viewed as a challenge to the existing social 
order. 
</p>
<p>63. Political parties and armed groups in the southern Tarai districts are among the main 
actors creating risks for human rights defenders. The fragile protection and security 
situation is compounded by the culture of impunity for violations committed against human 
rights defenders and journalists by both State and non-State actors, and in some cases by 
allegations of State actors colluding directly with perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>64. OHCHR is focusing its efforts on strengthening existing civil society networks 
through targeted capacity-building activities and developing tools for local rights defenders. 
At the national level, the European Union working group on human rights defenders 
involves collaboration between European Union missions in Nepal, OHCHR and other 
national and international stakeholders to produce practical recommendations for action and 
advocacy on protection issues on a local level; OHCHR supported a field visit by the </p>


<p>European Union working group to three districts of the eastern region in May 2009. Much 
is still to be achieved, particularly in the development of an effective safe house mechanism 
for human rights defenders at risk. Although the key donors have committed funds to 
supporting the development of a comprehensive framework, key civil society organisations 
have been unable to develop a joint proposal on this issue.  
</p>
<p>65. At the conclusion of her visit to Nepal in March 2009 the High Commissioner stated 
that the Government should take concrete steps to ensure the security of human rights 
defenders, including journalists, who are the first line in the defence of the human rights. 
The notable lack of progress on this issue requires the urgent attention of the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges and opportunities  
</b></p>
<p>66. The Government continues to provide assurances that it is committed to upholding 
its human rights obligations, including the commitments agreed to in the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement. OHCHR welcomes the Government&#8217;s renewed commitment to human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>67. At the same time, OHCHR notes that, despite repeated human rights commitments 
made by the Government over the past four years, only a minimal number of measures have 
been taken to implement recommendations made by OHCHR, the National Human Rights 
Commission, treaty bodies (including recommendations regarding individual cases) and by 
the special procedures mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>68. For the past three years, successive reports submitted to the Human Rights Council 
by OHCHR have included recommendations with regard to impunity and transitional 
justice mechanisms; social inclusion; national institutions and human rights defenders; civil 
liberties, including freedom of expression and assembly; law and order and reform of the 
security forces, as well as specific recommendations to political parties, in particular to 
UCPN-M, regarding human rights abuses committed both during and after the conflict and 
the use of violence for political purposes.  
</p>
<p>69. While the Government has taken some steps to improve public security, particularly 
in the Tarai, very little progress has been noted regarding the reform of security forces and 
the Government has taken no significant measures to address the issue of impunity. 
Moreover, the absence of Government measures to strengthen national human rights 
institutions and to protect human rights defenders continues to have a negative effect on 
human rights protection at both national and local levels.  
</p>
<p>70. A great deal remains to be accomplished if Nepal is to reach a satisfactory level of 
human rights implementation and ensure a solid foundation for long-term peace. The 
Government and all relevant partners need to identify the steps which must be 
accomplished to reach this level of implementation, including within the framework of the 
national human rights plan of action. The identification of these steps will help to clarify 
the areas that require additional support. OHCHR stands ready to assist the Government in 
this process. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Nepal has reached several major milestones in the past three years, including 
the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the declaration of a republic, and 
the holding of Constituent Assembly elections, while political actors have maintained 
dialogue across party lines and displayed flexibility on some key issues. Although the 
report raises substantial human rights concerns, Nepal retains all of the elements </b></p>


<p><b>necessary to meet its human rights commitments and conclude the peace process 
successfully. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The national human rights institutions established in recent years can, with 
adequate support, make considerable progress in the protection and promotion of 
human rights in Nepal. There are many civil society organizations engaged in human 
rights work and human rights defenders are active throughout the country, in spite of 
the multiple challenges and dangers they face. Concerted efforts to empower further 
these national actors, in particular the National Human Rights Commission, are of 
paramount importance for enhancing the impact of their work. The Commission 
agreed to the second phase of a comprehensive capacity development project with 
UNDP and OHCHR in July 2009, which represents one of several significant 
developments for strengthening the capacities of a human rights institution which is 
critical to the future of the country. Nepal will continue to benefit from a strong 
alliance of international and national actors engaged in efforts to support a safer 
environment for human rights defenders.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Key national actors are today well aware of the criteria which must be in place 
for a successful and just transitional justice process. A point emphasized by the High 
Commissioner at the conclusion of her mission to Nepal in March 2009 remains 
equally valid today: the demands of victims&#8217; families are not mere wishes, they are 
supported by law. Until these demands for justice are fulfilled and accountability for 
past and present violations is ensured, a truly new Nepal will not emerge, and the 
peace process could be jeopardised. With the launch of a &#8220;peace through justice&#8221; 
project in July 2009 under the United Nations Peace Fund for Nepal, OHCHR, in 
close coordination with the Government and civil society, has intensified its efforts to 
support the establishment of proper transitional justice mechanisms which will 
respect the needs of conflict victims and their families. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>To address long-standing discrimination and the lack of implementation of 
economic, social and cultural rights, OHCHR, together with the Government, the 
United Nations country team and development partners, is fostering a rights based 
approach. With the help of human rights mechanisms, including treaty bodies and 
special procedures, it is in a position to offer concrete assistance to the authorities to 
enable the Government to meet its human rights obligations.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Government thus has several significant sources of support for the peace 
process available to it and a unique opportunity to move the process forward in the 
interests of all Nepalis.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Acknowledging the progress made in taking steps towards establishing the 
transitional justice mechanisms named in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, 
OHCHR urges the Government to take concrete measures to fulfill its repeated 
commitments to end impunity, including by implementing transitional justice 
mechanisms in accordance with international standards, investigating the 
disappearances at Maharajgunj barracks and Bardiya documented in OHCH^R 
reports and prosecuting cases committed both by members of UCPN-M and the State 
security forces. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Noting the position of the Nepalese Army in the Maina Sunuwar case, where it 
is failing to comply with the directions of the Kavre District Court, which is acting 
pursuant to a Supreme Court directive, OHCHR calls on the Government to ensure 
that the Army complies with the court orders. </b></p>


<p>78. <b>Similarly, OHCHR calls on UCPN-M to cooperate fully with police 
investigations and the court orders regarding allegations of crimes committed by its 
members. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Comprehensive reforms in the security sector institutions would enhance the 
protection of human rights. The establishment of an independent special unit to 
undertake investigations into serious allegations against the Nepal Police and the 
Armed Police Force, including the investigation of alleged extra-judicial killings, 
would be an important first step. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Legislature-Parliament is encouraged to adopt legislation regulating the 
National Human Rights Commission in a manner consistent with the Paris Principles. 
The Government should also give serious consideration to all Commission 
recommendations and either implement them or provide a valid justification for not 
doing so. The National Dalit Commission and the National Women&#8217;s Commission 
should also have their mandates strengthened. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Constituent Assembly has an enormously important task to complete and 
is urged to do so on time. It should ensure that constitutional protections of human 
and fundamental rights are fully consistent with international human rights 
standards. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Government&#8217;s efforts to address long-standing discrimination, including 
the recent ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, are 
welcomed. Further legislative and practical measures are encouraged, including 
implementation of the recently formulated national plan of action for the elimination 
of violence against women. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>As in previous reports, OHCHR encourages the Government to put in place 
effective mechanisms to protect human rights defenders.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>OHCHR stands ready to continue to provide all necessary support and 
technical assistance to the Government and people of Nepal in meeting their 
aspirations for the enjoyment of all human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
