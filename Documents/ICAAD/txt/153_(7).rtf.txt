4. I have reviewed the evidence called in the trial and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors. I find that the verdict of the assessors were not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. Obviously, they accepted the prosecutions version of events on counts No. 1, 2, 3, and 7. The majority accepted the prosecution version of events on counts No.4 and 6.

5. On count No.1, the assessors accepted that the four accuseds broke into Ishwar Narayans residence, on 5th July 2008, between 1am and 2am.

8. On count No.4, the assessors also accepted that accuseds No.1, 2 and 3 then proceeded to damage a pursuing police car, registration no. GN 356, when they rammed "MEDIA 1" into it, on 5th July 2008, shortly before 3am, after fleeing from Suva Town House. They also accepted that the group, attacked the police car by smashing its windscreen. A majority of two assessors (ie. assessor No. 2 and 3) also found that accused No.4 was part of the group.

9. On count No.5, the assessors unanimously found that accused No. 1 did not criminally intimidate Detective Constable Sachin Chand, on 5th July 2008.

10. On count No. 6, the assessors accepted that accuseds No. 2 and 3 intentionally wounded Acting Corporal Mitieli Divarua when they struck him with pieces of timber and iron rods.

11. On count No.7, the assessors unanimously accepted that the four accuseds stole Ishwar Narayans Kenwood car stereo and CD changer, worth $2,000, when they abandoned "MEDIA 1", at Nasinu Secondary School, early morning on 5th July 2008.

12. I accept the assessors unanimous verdict of guilty as charged, on all four accuseds, on counts No.1, 2, 3 and 7. I find all four accuseds guilty as charged on counts No.1, 2, 3 and 7, and I convict each of them accordingly, on those counts.

13. On count No.4, the assessors unanimously found accuseds No.1, 2 and 3 guilty as charged. In a majority of two assessors to one, accused No.4 was found guilty as charged, on count no.4.
