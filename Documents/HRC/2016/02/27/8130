<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 18/15 on the incompatibility between democracy and racism of 14 
October 2011, the Human Rights Council recalled the commitment reached in the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action concerning the elimination of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The Council further recalled its 
decision 2/106 of 27 November 2006 and Commission on Human Rights resolutions 
2000/40, 2001/43, 2002/39, 2003/41, 2004/38 and 2005/36 on the incompatibility between 
democracy and racism. The Council acknowledged the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference. It reaffirmed that 
acts of racial violence do not constitute legitimate expressions of opinion but unlawful acts, 
and any endorsement by Government or public authorities of racism and discrimination 
violates human rights and may threaten democracy, endanger friendly relations and 
cooperation among nations, international peace and security and the harmony of persons 
living side by side within the same state. In paragraphs 3 and 4, the Council emphasized 
that democracy, transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory governance and 
respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms are essential for the prevention and 
elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and, by 
extension, the elimination of all forms of discrimination would contribute to strengthening 
and promoting democracy and political participation.  
</p>
<p>2. In paragraph 16 of its resolution 18/15, the Council invited the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to report to the Council at its twenty-first session on the implementation 
of the resolution. This report is therefore submitted pursuant to resolution 18/15 of the 
Council. In order to include the broadest number of contributions in her report, the Office 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights by a note verbale dated 12 March 2012 
transmitted an eight-point questionnaire to Permanent and Observer Missions to the United 
Nations in Geneva soliciting information on different aspects of resolution 18/15.  
</p>
<p>3. The current report contains information received from Member States as well as 
input from the United Nations human rights mechanisms, special procedures and treaty 
bodies on related activities.

<p><b> II. Contributions received 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Members States 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Azerbaijan 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[10 May 2012] 
</p>
<p>4.  Azerbaijan reported that its Constitution guaranteed the rights of national minorities 
and prohibited discrimination on grounds of ethnicity, language or religion. Dissemination 
of ideas based on racial hatred or superiority was punishable under the law. Azerbaijan was 
a member of the Council of Europe, a signatory to the Framework Convention of the 
Council of Europe for the Protection of National Minorities, and the European Charter for 
Regional or Minority Languages. Under the auspices of its cooperation programme with the 
Council of Europe, the Government had implemented several programmes on intercultural 
and interreligious dialogue aimed at improving multicultural teaching and developing 
educational curricula. The Government also reported that national minorities were allowed 
to establish their cultural centres and receive support through public funding. The Ministry 
of Education, in collaboration with national and international non-governmental 
</p>
<p><b>3 </b></p>


<p>organizations (NGOs), had invested in preventing and combating racism and racial 
discrimination and undertaken several public awareness initiatives. National minorities 
were well represented in State agencies and in top management of local authorities in areas 
where they constituted a substantial part of the population. 
</p>
<p><b>  Brazil  
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[7 May 2012] 
</p>
<p>5. Brazil reported that equality was enshrined as a fundamental constitutional principle 
and racism was criminalized under articles 3, 5 and 7 of the 1988 Constitution, which also 
permits affirmative action under articles 215 and 216. The constitutional provision on 
racism was complemented by Law No. 7716/1989 and Law No. 9459/1997.   
</p>
<p>6. Brazil reported that the fight against racism and racial discrimination had been 
incorporated as a cross-cutting element in the formulation and implementation of domestic 
policy initiatives and transformed into an underlying component of State strategy.  
Affirmative action measures required under the law had been established at various levels 
of governance to ensure multiculturalism in the political and legal spheres.  
</p>
<p>7. Extremist political parties, movements and platforms were subject to judicial and 
administrative control through various agencies, namely, the Office of the Public Defender 
and the Office of the Federal Public Prosecutor. The two administrative control bodies were 
linked to the Secretariat for Policies on the Promotion of Racial Equality, namely the Office 
of National Ombudsman for the Promotion of Racial Equality (Ouvidoria Nacional de 
Promo&#231;&#227;o da Igualdade Racial) and the National Council for the Promotion of Racial 
Equality (Conselho Nacional de Promo&#231;&#227;o da Igualdade Racial).   
</p>
<p>8. Since 2010, Brazil had undertaken a number of awareness and education campaigns 
and institutionalized the National Policy on the Promotion of Racial Equality through 
enactment of the Racial Equality Statute. There was an interministerial multi-year plan to 
confront racism and promote equality. The National System for the Promotion of Racial 
Equality (Sistema Nacional de Promo&#231;&#227;o da Igualdade Racial) was currently under 
finalization, which once established would facilitate the decentralizing of policies to 
address ethnic disparities in an articulated manner between the different levels of 
Government. The Intergovernmental Forum on Promoting Racial Equality (F&#243;rum 
Intergovernamental de Promo&#231;&#227;o da Igualdade Racial) was also established to facilitate the 
mainstreaming of the National Policy for the Promotion of Racial Equality in the 
programmes of states and municipalities.  
</p>
<p>9. In its submission, Brazil stated its belief in the Durban principles recognizing 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance as global phenomena that 
affected all nations albeit with different levels of intensity. Recognition of the existence of 
racism was the first step towards correcting past mistakes and combating modern-day racial 
prejudice. Social justice for victims of intergenerational racism required a three-pronged 
approach: rights and historical recognitions, material and symbolic redistribution, and 
political and legal representation in the public sphere. A key challenge remained addressing 
structural conditions that permitted racism and racial discrimination against Afro-
descendants.  
</p>
<p>10. Brazil highlighted the following priorities as proposed by the Ibero-American 
Conference on the International Year of Afro-Descendants (Encuentro Iberoamericano del 
A&#241;o Internacional de los Afrodescendientes &#8211; Afro XXI), held in Brazil in November 2011, 
namely the establishment of the Observatory for Statistical Data on Afro-Descendants in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, the creation of an Ibero-American Fund for Afro-
Descendants based on voluntary contributions, and the establishment of an Afro-
</p>
<p><b>4 </b></p>


<p>Descendant Forum in the United Nations to serve as a mechanism for consulting, 
coordinating, tracking and monitoring for Afro-descendants. 
</p>
<p><b>  Germany 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[18 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>11. In its submission, Germany reported that the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of 
Germany enshrined the equality of all before the law and prohibited discrimination on 
account of sex, parentage, race, language, homeland and origin, faith, or religious or 
political opinions. That was complemented by the General Equal Treatment Act which 
extended protection against discrimination to a number of private law fields as well as to 
public employment. 
</p>
<p>12. Section 86 of the Criminal Code criminalized dissemination of propaganda by 
unconstitutional organizations. The crime of incitement (section 130), which also covered 
incitement to racial hatred, was one of the most important provisions in the Criminal Code 
for combating right-wing extremism and xenophobia. Organizations based on racist ideas 
or which justified or attempted to foster racial hatred and racial discrimination faced 
criminal prosecution under sections 129 and 129a of the Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>13. Germany reported that its laws prohibited political parties and groups that fall short 
of constitutional requirements. Under the Basic Law (art. 9) and the Law on Private 
Associations, societies and associations other than political parties may be banned when the 
competent authority determines that its aims or activities contravene the criminal law or are 
directed against the constitutional order or against the concept of international 
understanding.  
</p>
<p>14. German authorities had adopted a multidimensional approach in combating racism, 
xenophobia and right-wing extremism. Measures intended to counter the activities of right-
wing extremists were complemented by efforts to address the root causes of extremism. 
Emphasis was placed, for instance, on financing local initiatives to strengthen democratic 
civil society and improving the situation of minority groups.  
</p>
<p>15. Germany reiterated its belief in the free, democratic basic order and a rejection of 
extremism and racism in all forms. Germany reported that its strategy against extremism, 
combines preventive and punitive elements. That was based on four pillars of intervention 
thus: strengthening civil society, encouraging people to have the courage to stand up for 
their convictions, promoting the integration of foreigners, and implementing measures 
directed at perpetrators and their environment. 
</p>
<p><b>  Greece 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[20 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>16. Greece reported that its constitutional law provided for the protection of life, dignity 
and freedom without discrimination due to nationality, race, language and religious or 
political beliefs. Incitement to racial hatred and violence, establishment or participation in 
organizations with racial objectives or that engaged in racial propaganda and official 
expression of racist ideas were criminalized. Racial motives were considered an 
aggravating factor when evaluating the penal value of a crime. Certain bodies were 
established by law to deal with labour-related discrimination, including the Ombudsman, 
the Labour Inspectorate and the Committee of Equal Treatment. To facilitate integration, 
foreigners legally resident in Greece were permitted to take part in local elections and the 
process of naturalization by third and second-generation immigrants had been simplified. A 
</p>
<p><b>5 </b></p>


<p>municipal-level Migrant Integration Council existed to assist migrants. Greece also reported 
that it had taken measures to protect vulnerable groups against racism including the 
establishment of the SOS telephone hotline and email to provide information round-the-
clock to immigrants in different languages. That work was complemented by several 
Government-funded projects implemented by departments or NGOs aimed at supporting 
vulnerable immigrant groups. The Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights 
was currently developing a system for collection of data on hate crimes. Beyond the 
statutory requirement for political parties to affirm under oath that their operations served 
the free functioning of democracy, the State was not permitted to intervene in their internal 
affairs. 
</p>
<p><b>  Japan  
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[17 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>17. According to information provided by Japan, its Constitution guaranteed equality to 
all and prohibited any form of &#8220;discrimination in political, economic or social relations 
because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin&#8221;.  Racist or xenophobic attacks 
were not specifically outlawed but offences might be punishable as defamation, 
intimidation or violence occasioning bodily harm. The human rights organs of the Ministry 
of Justice addressed violations of human rights in accordance with the Investigations and 
Treatment Regulations of Human Rights Infringement Incidents and the Civil Liberties 
Commissioners Law. Human Rights Counselling Offices for Foreign Nationals existed in 
Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Fukuoka, Takamatsu, Kobe and Matsuyama to provide 
human rights assistance to foreigners and respond to complaints against discrimination.  
</p>
<p>18. The right to participate in the political process was guaranteed to all nationals in 
accordance to law and without discrimination due to race or ethnicity. The human rights 
organs of the Ministry of Justice undertook a variety of awareness activities based on the 
Basic Plan for the Promotion of Human Rights Education and Encouragement, including 
issuance of posters, leaflets and organization of promotional activities, symposia and 
debates.  
</p>
<p><b>  Madagascar 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: French] 
[18 May 2012] 
</p>
<p>19. Madagascar noted that the preamble of its Constitution recognized the International 
Bill of Human Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, which were considered to be an integral part of Madagascan law. 
The Constitution also recognized that international treaties and agreements, which have 
been lawfully ratified or approved, shall, as from their publication, have higher authority 
than national laws. That entailed that Madagascan law was in conformity with the 
provisions of article 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>20. Madagascar referred to article 8 of its Constitution, which provided that citizens 
were equal before the law and enjoyed the same fundamental freedoms under the protection 
of the law without discrimination on the basis of sex, level of education, financial situation, 
origin, race, religious belief or opinion, and to article 14 which enunciated the freedom to 
create associations and political parties, except for those which undermined the unity of the 
nation or advocate totalitarianism or ethnic, tribal or religious segregation. 
</p>

<p><b>  Mexico 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: Spanish]  
[24 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>21. Mexico reported that racism and racial discrimination was prohibited under article 1 
of the Constitution and article 4 of the Federal Law for prevention and elimination of 
discrimination. In its submission, Mexico conceded that it faced structural problems in 
sufficiently developing institutions to fight racial discrimination. While the Penal Code did 
not cover discrimination, the trend among State-level institutions was towards 
criminalization. The Government was still working on developing a national penal 
definition of racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>22. The National Council to Prevent Discrimination had been created in 2003 to assist in 
realization of the protection against discrimination and to promote inclusion. The Council 
had developed guidelines for public administration and the promotion of the equal 
treatment and inclusion of the Afro-descendants. 
</p>
<p>23. The Constitution provided for a multicultural society and the National Institute for 
Indigenous Languages had been established with the objective of protecting and developing 
indigenous languages. Mexico reported that it had realized the need to develop a national 
legal framework to promote and protect Afro-descendants. The adverse effects on 
immigrant and indigenous peoples of the activities of organized criminal groups remained a 
challenge. Mexico also reported that it had commenced a legal assistance programme to 
protect its citizens living across the border from discrimination. Several initiatives had been 
undertaken to create awareness specifically in three areas, namely research, educational and 
public activities. Mexico concluded by underlining that a democratic society was 
impossible without real and effective inclusion of all groups. That could be achieved 
through deepening cooperation and a strong policy of multiculturalism. The most effective 
solutions must include recognition of the identity of the constituent ethnic nationalities, 
social awareness and recognition of the contributions of the ethnic groups, investigation and 
analyses of the situation of the groups, inclusion of all groups on an equal basis in the 
process of nation-building, training for public servants and law enforcement personnel on 
the specific needs of the different ethnic groups, combating racism and racial discrimination 
in the media and public places and promotion of citizen participation in governance.  
</p>
<p><b>  Norway 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[24 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>24. Norway reported that its domestic laws complied with the prohibition of 
discrimination under the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, which was also fully incorporated in the Norwegian Anti-Discrimination 
Act. The latter prohibited direct and indirect discrimination. Norwegian anti-discrimination 
laws avoided the use of race, which was seen as anachronistic since human race could not 
be divided into races. Discrimination based on perception of race was already fully covered 
within the meaning of ethnicity in the Anti-Discrimination Act. The anti-discrimination 
legislation was enforced by the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud and the 
Norwegian Equality Tribunal. Extremely serious forms of discrimination were criminalized 
and enforceable by prosecuting authorities. Norway also reported that its Action Plan to 
promote equality and prevent ethnic discrimination during 2009&#8211;2012 incorporated 66 
different measures with the engagement of 8 Government ministries. The Government of 
Norway had taken measures to promote the increased participation of persons with 
immigrant backgrounds in the electoral process. They included public awareness activities 
and other specific measures, including recruitment of employees with minority 
</p>
<p><b>7 </b></p>


<p>backgrounds and strengthening diversity training of Government personnel. The 
Directorate of Integration and Diversity had developed a tool box with methods and 
knowledge to assist public agencies in adapting their services to the multicultural 
population. Norway also reported that it had taken action to prevent radicalization and 
violent extremism through its adoption of the Government&#8217;s Action Plan to promote 
equality and prevent ethnic discrimination. The Action Plan focused on four priority areas, 
knowledge and information, strengthening cooperation between the authorities, 
strengthening dialogue and greater involvement and support to vulnerable and at-risk 
persons. Norway also reported that its laws did not regulate the internal organization of 
political parties. 
</p>
<p>25.  Norway had also taken several measures to raise awareness on racism and 
discrimination, including the Benjamin Award, given annually to a school that had 
distinguished itself in countering racism and discrimination. Finally, Norway reported that 
racism posed challenges to democracy and democratic institutions. Legal protection was 
necessary but not sufficient in itself to ensure equality. All sectors of the society had a role 
in promoting equality and preventing discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>  Paraguay  
</b></p>
<p>(Original: Spanish] 
[24 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>26. Paraguay reported that discrimination was prohibited under article 46 of its 
Constitution requiring measures to be taken under the law to ensure equality for all. The 
Criminal Code provided for the prosecution of crimes motivated by racial hatred including 
genocide. Although there was no ministry for human rights, as was the case with most 
countries in the region, the Government worked with regional mechanisms like the Meeting 
of High Authorities on Human Rights and Foreign Ministries of the Common Market of the 
South (MERCOSUR), through working groups that met regularly, to coordinate and 
promote regional action to combat discrimination, racism and xenophobia. The 
Government also worked with the human rights network, which brought together various 
groups and recently launched a national human rights plan to address among other issues 
racial discrimination. The Constitution also provided special protection for indigenous 
peoples, safeguarding their culture and access to economic and social life. In its 
submission, Paraguay noted that it had no knowledge of extremist groups in the political 
and social spheres. However, it continued to face challenges in implementing the protection 
granted indigenous peoples under Article 65 of the Constitution to guarantee their full 
participation in political life and economic and social development.  
</p>
<p><b>  Peru 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: Spanish] 
[26 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>27. Peru reported that its Constitution prohibited discrimination on the grounds of 
origin, race, sex, language, religion, opinion, economic condition or any other reason. The 
Penal Code covered discriminatory acts on the basis of race, religion, sex, affiliation, age, 
disability, language, ethnic and cultural identity, political opinion or economic condition, 
and all the acts having the effect of denying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of the 
individual rights. Recently, there has been an inclination to extend the understanding of 
discrimination to also cover acts to exclude or accord inferior treatment to a person or a 
group of persons because of their social group, limiting opportunities to realize their rights. 
Applicable laws provided penal, administrative and moral sanctions for discriminatory acts. 
In its effort to address racism in political circles and in the sphere of public opinion, Peru 
had declared 2012 as a &#8220;Year of National Integration and Recognition of our Diversity&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><b>8 </b></p>


<p>aiming to affirm the values of integration and multiculturalism. In its submission, Peru also 
reported that its constitution specifically protected ethnic and cultural plurality and the 
political system provided for quotas for women, young and indigenous peoples to ensure 
their participation in the political process. Political parties were required by law to preserve 
peace, freedom and to protect human rights. The ministries of Justice, and Culture and the 
Ombudsman had organized several workshops, events and campaigns to raise awareness 
about discrimination and racism.  
</p>
<p><b>  Portugal  
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[3 May 2012] 
</p>
<p>28. Portugal reported that racial discrimination was prohibited by law and criminalized. 
There was a legal framework for ensuring equal treatment and combating discrimination on 
the basis of race and ethnicity. Anyone convicted of founding an organization aimed at or 
engaged in organized propaganda or incitement to racism or racial hatred was liable to 
imprisonment and could be deprived of participation in the electoral process. In cases of 
homicide where racial hatred was involved it was considered an aggravating factor 
implying a more severe penalty. Administrative bodies that dealt with cases of racial 
discrimination against public authorities were the Commission for Equality and Against 
Racial Discrimination and the Ombudsman.   
</p>
<p>29. Portugal had been ranked second for two consecutive years among 31 developed 
countries for its policies in the area of integration of migrants by the Migrant Integration 
Policy Index, sponsored by the European Commission. The Alto Comissariado para a 
Imigracao e Dialogo Intercultural or National Immigrant Support Services (ACIDI) was 
responsible for, among other competences, combating racism, promoting the integration of 
immigrants and Roma communities and promoting intercultural dialogue.  
</p>
<p>30. Portugal reported that extremist political parties had not made any significant 
inroads in the political arena demonstrating a lack of support by the electorate. However, 
the Criminal Police, National Republican Guard and Public Security Police undertook 
preventive and public order measures to deter manifestations of extremism.   
</p>
<p>31. All political parties with parliamentary representation and their members were 
required to comply with the law at the risk of prosecution. Portuguese law recognized 
citizens&#8217; participation in political activities and prohibited the denial of membership in a 
political organization on grounds of place of origin. 
</p>
<p>32. Portugal reported that it had undertaken several public awareness initiatives and 
established bodies to promote diversity and intercultural dialogue and combat racial 
stereotypes and prejudices. One of those bodies, the Entreculturas Board, had been created 
to facilitate integration in the education sector. Programmes had also been developed on 
diversity for personnel in different sectors and trainers teams established to undertake 
public awareness campaigns and promotion activities on integration nationwide. Radio and 
television programmes had also been developed to facilitate the integration of immigrant 
communities.  
</p>
<p>33. Portugal reported that it had adopted policies to promote awareness of human rights 
and intercultural dialogue among journalists. Through those initiatives, ACIDI in 
collaboration with the Journalists Training Centre promoted specific workshops on 
migration issues for media professionals. Additionally, the Annual Journalism for Cultural 
Diversity had been established to reward any journalist who provided the most positive 
image of immigrants and/or intercultural dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b>9 </b></p>


<p>34. Portugal observed that economic crisis had a potential to stoke racial tension and 
harmful nationalistic tendencies. A strong investment in education and intercultural 
dialogue complemented by a policy to create and sustain national awareness of the absolute 
value of human dignity and commitment to foster these values within national social 
consensus would greatly contribute to addressing prejudice.  
</p>
<p><b>  Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[20 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>35. The Republic of Korea noted that although its Constitution did not specifically 
exclude discrimination on the basis of race, the jurisprudence of its Constitutional Court 
and practice had clarified that the constitutional provision against discrimination was open-
ended and covered racial discrimination. The laws also recognized affirmative action as 
evidenced in article 2, paragraph 4, of the National Human Rights Commission Act. The 
Act also recognized certain remedies in cases of discrimination, including suspension or 
termination of the discriminatory act, restitution, compensation for damages and preventive 
measures to avoid a recurrence. The Republic of Korea did not have any specific laws for 
the criminal prosecution of racism and racial discrimination. As a result, such crimes were 
covered under related provisions of the Criminal Act, for instance, incitement to racial 
hatred or propagation of racial superiority is punishable under articles 307 and 311 of the 
Criminal Act as an act of defamation or as an act of insult respectively. Violent acts 
motivated by racial discrimination were punishable under chapter 25 of the Criminal Act as 
crimes of inflicting bodily harm and violence. Since the Criminal Act stipulated that the 
motive for the commission of the crime should be taken into consideration in determining 
the penalty for a crime, judges might consider racial discrimination as an aggravating factor 
when evaluating the penal consequences of a crime.  
</p>
<p>36. The Republic of Korea had taken measures to provide opportunities for foreigners in 
the public service through the establishment of a special recruitment process. Under article 
26, paragraph 3, of the State Public Officials Act, foreigners could be appointed to political 
or privileged positions. In accordance with article 5 of the Local Referendum Act, 
foreigners aged 19 or above could also vote in local elections from the third year of 
acquisition of permanent residence status. The Government had established a monitoring 
system to respond to discriminatory practices on the grounds of race or nationality in 
accordance with the Basic Plan for Policies on Foreigners. 
</p>
<p>37. As recommended by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
during the consideration of its thirteenth and fourteenth periodic reports of the Republic of 
Korea (CERD/C/KOR/CO/14), the Government had taken measures to strengthen human 
rights education, stressing the importance of respecting human integrity regardless of race, 
colour, sex, or religion. As part of those efforts, the Government had designated human 
rights education and multicultural education as curricular subjects for primary and 
secondary education. The Government had also published and distributed teaching 
materials to supplement primary and secondary textbooks, helping students get a better 
understanding of human rights and the history and culture of diverse ethnic groups. The 
Republic of Korea had also expanded teacher training programmes to improve teachers&#8217; 
understanding of children from multicultural backgrounds and to raise their awareness of 
multicultural education, including through inviting parents of multicultural backgrounds to 
lecture on multicultural understanding. The Legal Research and Training Institute and the 
Human Rights Bureau of the Ministry of Justice provide human rights training for law 
enforcement officers with specific focus on understanding multiculturalism and elimination 
of racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b>10 </b></p>


<p>38. As the Republic of Korea evolved into a multicultural society, the Government had 
pursued various cultural programmes and projects to heighten the awareness and 
understanding of multiculturalism. Those have focused on global, national and local 
audiences.  
</p>
<p><b>  Romania  
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[27 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>39. Romania reported that the constitutional prohibition of racial discrimination was 
complemented by Government Ordinance No. 137/2000 on preventing and punishing all 
forms of discrimination. Additionally, incitement to discrimination was criminalized and 
the law allowed judicial authorities to consider racial motivation for a crime as an 
aggravating factor in sentencing. Emergency Ordinance No. 31, adopted in 2002, prohibited 
organizations and symbols with fascist, racist or xenophobic character or policies. By the 
same token, the Audiovisual Law No. 504/2002 prohibited broadcasting programmes, 
which contained any form of incitement to hatred on grounds of race, religion, nationality, 
gender or sexual orientation. The Government of Romania annually allocated funds in 
support of inter-ethnic projects aimed at combating intolerance and had supported 
awareness-raising initiatives through the Department for Inter-ethnic Relations.  
</p>
<p>40. Building on the experience of a decade-long initiative to improve the status of the 
Roma, the Government had adopted in 2011 a national strategy for improving the situation 
of Roma for the period 2011&#8211;2015. The strategy was implemented by the National Agency 
for Roma. Specific efforts to integrate the Roma had included reserved places at the Police 
Academy, schools and universities.  
</p>
<p>41. A critical component of the effort to develop an inclusive society is the National 
Strategy for Implementing Measures on Preventing and Combating Discrimination (2007&#8211;
2013) designed by the National Council for Combating Discrimination (NCCD). The 
Romanian political system was unique in providing a mechanism that allowed the 
representation of all 20 national minority groups in parliament. Law No. 14/2003 on 
political parties prohibited groups that propagated ideologies based on discrimination. The 
Code of Conduct for Civil Servants, approved by Law No. 7/2004 as modified by Law No. 
50/2007, codified the principle of equal treatment for all citizens by public institutions and 
authorities. Additionally, the educational system was organized on the basis of respect for 
human rights and equal access to all without discrimination of any kind. 
</p>
<p>42. Romania also reported that its Law No. 116/2001 on the processing of personal data 
prohibited processing of personal data related to ethnicity except under explicit situations 
allowed by law. The main political parties functioned on the basis of statutes and internal 
regulations developed in full respect of democratic principles. Incidents of racial 
incitements by political parties or their officials had been criticized both internally and by 
civil society groups or NCCD.  
</p>
<p>43. NCCD<b> </b>had undertaken several public awareness initiatives, while targeted sanctions 
against public officials in high profile cases had added to increasing awareness of its role. 
Informational booklets and folders had been developed in collaboration with Romanian 
Football Association, Professional Football League, Press Monitoring Agency and 
European Roma Grassroots Organization within the framework of the annual campaigns 
against racism in football.   
</p>
<p>44. Romania concluded that combating racism and intolerance was the backbone of any 
genuine democratic society. Preventing discrimination was only possible with a 
comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, efficient institutional framework and 
administrative and judicial mechanisms to sanction misconduct. That should be 
</p>
<p><b>11 </b></p>


<p>complemented with education and public policies and measures to support an inclusive 
society. The role of civil society was very critical as was continuing vigilance of 
Government, since no society was immune to racism and intolerance.  
</p>
<p><b>  Serbia  
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[15 May 2012] 
</p>
<p>45. Serbia reported that its Constitution prohibited discrimination and its Criminal Code 
criminalized offences motivated by racist and xenophobic tendencies. The constitutional 
and penal provisions on discrimination were complemented by the Law on the Prohibition 
of Discrimination. Offences against individuals or groups on the basis of race or cultural 
affiliation among others were criminalized and racism was considered an aggravating factor 
when evaluating the penal consequences of a crime. The Government of Serbia had 
established multiple mechanisms to address racism in political circles, including the 
Ministry of Human and Minority Rights, the Council for National Minorities, the Council 
for the Improvement of the Position of the Roma, the Office for Roma Inclusion in 
Vojvodina and the Equality Commission. Consistent with constitutional provisions on 
equality, efforts had been made by the Government to ensure that institutions reflected the 
cultural diversity of the country. Since 2010, 19 minority self-governing units had been 
established in exercise of constitutional autonomy for minority groups. As a result of the 
efforts by the Government, 31 (12.4 per cent) of 250 national deputies were members of 
minority groups, in a country with a 14.5 per cent minority population. Extremist political 
organizations were prohibited under the Constitution and, in 2009, the Public Prosecutor 
had submitted a list of such groups to be outlawed to the Constitutional Court. The Law on 
Protection of Rights and Freedoms of National Minorities provided that the educational 
curriculum should include aspects of minority cultures and languages.  
</p>
<p>46. The Government had undertaken several initiatives to raise awareness including an 
anti-discrimination campaign during May to August 2010, and a television series &#8220;Come 
Closer&#8221; broadcast on the national network from February to May 2010. The Government 
helped police officers deployed in minority or multilingual environments to study the 
languages spoken in their areas of assignment. According to Serbia, a major challenge to 
democracy by racism was the increased activities of nationalist organizations using the 
Internet and other social media. Efficient and timely response of national authorities was 
critical and the provision of specialized training on cybercrime. International collaboration 
was crucial in overcoming structural poverty, which was at the root of discrimination 
against the Roma. 
</p>
<p><b>  Slovenia  
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[20 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>47. Slovenia reported that its Constitution guaranteed equality irrespective of personal 
circumstances and its laws prohibited incitement to discrimination and intolerance. 
Additionally, the laws also criminalized public incitement of racial hatred and allowed 
courts to consider hate-related motives as aggravation in evaluating penal value of crimes.  
</p>
<p>48. Slovenia had established several institutional mechanisms to promote and advance 
equality. Those included the Equal Opportunities and European Coordination Service of the 
Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs and the Advocate for the Principle of 
Equality, a specialized national body with a mandate to assist victims of discrimination. 
There was also the Council for the Implementation of the Principle of Equal Treatment, 
which operated as an expert and consultative body for ensuring equal treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>12 </b></p>


<p>49. Slovenia had supported several initiatives to create awareness on racial 
discrimination. Those had included the  &#8220;equal in diversity&#8221; project, which had 
encompassed an analysis of anti-discrimination measures, a study on labour market 
discrimination, the training for judges, policymakers, representatives of employees and 
employers and NGOs, a media campaign and the launching of the Advocate&#8217;s website. The 
website provides information in 10 languages, including minority languages.  
</p>
<p>50. The two national minorities in Slovenia, Italian and Hungarian national 
communities, and a special Roma ethnic community enjoyed constitutional protection in 
accordance with articles 64 and 65 of the Constitution. The residence of the Roma in 
Slovenia was regulated by the Roma Community Act, which was an organic law providing 
for national and local authorities to implement the special rights granted to the Roma 
community, and regulated the financing and the organization of the Roma at national and 
local levels. 
</p>
<p><b>  Spain 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: Spanish] 
[27 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>51. In its submission, Spain reported that its Constitution protected equality as a right 
and supreme value under the legal system and required all public institutions to eliminate 
all obstacles to the full enjoyment of equality and freedom. The constitutional protection 
was further strengthened by the human rights plan adopted in December 2008, which 
established measures to prevent any form of discrimination on the grounds of religion, 
disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, racial origin or other reasons. The Penal Code 
regulated crimes committed on the grounds of discrimination and required that 
discriminatory motives for a crime should be considered an aggravating factor in 
considering the penal value of any crime. The Government had established specialized 
prosecutorial offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Malaga and Valencia to deal with hate crimes. 
Spain also reported that it endorsed the recommendations of the Council of Europe and 
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights regarding raising the awareness of the 
populace as a cornerstone of the strategy to address racism and discrimination in political 
and social circles.  
</p>
<p>52. In order to ensure real equality and diversity, the Government had adopted a 
quadrennial strategic plan aiming at addressing racism, racial discrimination and 
xenophobia especially considering the changes in Spanish society due to the influx of 
migrants. The first two plans covering the periods 2007&#8211;2010 and 2011&#8211;2014, respectively, 
included a management plan for diversity encouraging organizations to adopt a diversity 
charter to demonstrate their commitment to promoting diversity and to establish  &#8220;etiquettes 
and labels of diversity&#8221; and prizes to recognize and honour those promoting those values. 
Several programmes had been developed by the Government to create awareness and 
promote intercultural education, including, &#8220;Schools without racism, schools for peace and 
development&#8221;, in which over 263 Spanish schools had participated. Spain noted that the 
most effective measures in preventing or combating racism included encouraging public 
authorities to provide real protection to victims, undertake special activities and promote 
public awareness.   
</p>
<p><b>  Sweden 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: English] 
[20 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>53. Sweden reported that its Anti-Discrimination Act provided legal protection against 
discrimination on the grounds of sex, ethnic origin, religion or other belief, disability, 
</p>
<p><b>13 </b></p>


<p>sexual orientation, age and transgender identity or expression. The Swedish Penal Code 
criminalized discrimination and required that discriminatory motives should be considered 
an aggravating factor in assessing the penal value of a crime.  
</p>
<p>54. Combating hate crime had been ascribed a high priority by judicial, prosecutorial 
and police authorities. The police and prosecutorial authorities had developed guidelines, 
databases and training manuals to facilitate uniformity of practice in responding to racism 
and racial discrimination. The State provided funding to NGOs working against 
discrimination, racism, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance. 
</p>
<p>55. The languages of five national minorities, Jews, the Roma, the S&#225;mi, the Swedish 
Finns and the Tornedalers, were recognized as national languages. Additionally, the S&#225;mi 
were recognized by the Riksdag as only indigenous people of Sweden and as a people by 
the Constitution. A S&#225;mi Parliament had been in existence since 1993. 
</p>
<p>56. There are no &#8220;ethnic quotas&#8217;&#8217; or equivalent measures in place as regarded 
representation in the State&#8217;s democratically elected assemblies or its legal system. A 
number of provisions in Swedish law, notably the provisions prohibiting &#8220;incitement 
against a national or ethnic group&#8221; and &#8220;unlawful military activity&#8221; and provisions on 
conspiracy, preparation, attempt and complicity in crimes, meant that organizations 
engaged in racist activities could not pursue such activities without breaking the law.  
</p>
<p>57. A national action plan for safeguarding democracy and fighting violent extremism 
had recently been adopted for the period 2012&#8211;2014 and contained a range of measures to 
enhance knowledge and awareness of violent extremism, discourage recruitment to violent, 
extremist groups and help members of such groups to disengage from them. The national 
action plan also contained measures, which aimed at increasing coherence and cooperation 
among various Government agencies involved in the fight against violent extremism.  
</p>
<p>58. The Discrimination Ombudsman and the Forum for Living History undertook a 
range of measures to fight intolerance and raise awareness of human rights. The 
Government has recently launched a website aimed at dispelling prejudice and false 
information, including so-called &#8220;Internet myths&#8221;, relating to immigration, immigrants and 
persons belonging to minorities. 
</p>
<p>59. Sweden noted that freedom of expression, and in particular free and independent 
media, was a necessary precondition for combating racism and xenophobia. Abuse, 
wrongdoing and intolerance typically festered in areas less exposed to scrutiny and free 
debate. A strong legal framework enforced by an independent and efficient legal system 
was necessary to protect individuals from discrimination, hate speech and other racist 
crimes. All sections of society had a shared responsibility to combat racism and intolerance, 
and promote awareness and respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Switzerland  
</b></p>
<p>[Original: French] 
[19 April 2012] 
</p>
<p>60.  Switzerland reported that the constitutional provision prohibiting discrimination on 
grounds of origin, race, language or religious belief was reflected in article 261 bis of the 
Criminal Code and article 171 (c) of the Military Criminal Code. The law punished anyone 
who publicly incited hatred or discrimination against people because of their race, ethnicity 
or religion, violated human dignity, refused to provide a public service or propagated a 
racist ideology. That provision implied that freedom of expression was not absolute and 
could be subject to constraints, especially in relation to protecting the dignity and honour of 
others. The Confederation also takes preventive measures, such as information and 
</p>
<p><b>14 </b></p>


<p>education campaigns. Switzerland was a secular, pluralistic and multicultural society with 
foreigners constituting over 20 per cent of its resident population. 
</p>
<p>61. The fight against racism was an ongoing task for the Government and two 
institutions had been created for this purpose, namely, the Service for Combating Racism 
and the Federal Commission against Racism. The Service for Combating Racism was the 
Federal Government&#8217;s focal point for all matters relating to the fight against racism, anti-
Semitism and xenophobia. It played an important role in specialized support, including 
training and publication and networking. It awarded grants to specifically anti-racist 
projects. The Federal Commission against Racism is involved in awareness-raising and 
public relations activities through campaigns, public events, publications and newspaper 
articles.  
</p>
<p><b>  Trinidad and Tobago  
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
[7 June 2012] 
</p>
<p>62. Trinidad and Tobago reported that, although it had no piece of legislation that 
expressly defined racial discrimination, its Constitution, provided for the enjoyment of 
rights without discrimination on grounds of race, origin, colour, religion or sex. 
Additionally, the Equal Opportunities Act 2000 prohibited discrimination on the basis of 
race, ethnicity, origin, sex, religion, marital status or disability in the context of 
employment, education, and the provision of goods and services. The Equal Opportunity 
Commission and the Equal Opportunity Tribunal respectively investigated or adjudicated 
cases of discrimination. While penal law did not specifically mention racially motivated 
crimes, the Offences against the Person Act created penalties for offences some of which 
may be motivated by racial considerations. 
</p>
<p>63. Three pieces of legislation were in place to address extremist groups namely, 
Genocide Act, Anti-Terrorism Act and the Sedition Act. The Prime Minister and the 
Peoples Partnership Government had emphasized tolerance and cultural and religious 
awareness within her office and in the wider society. Trinidad and Tobago reported that 
racist attitudes were learned through acculturation and the family and schools had an 
important role to play in encouraging acceptance and tolerance.  
</p>
<p><b>  Turkey 
</b></p>
<p>[Original: French] 
[3 May 2012] 
</p>
<p>64. Turkey emphasized its commitment to the fight against all kinds of discrimination, 
in particular through the incorporation of sound and effective measures into its legislation 
concerning non-discrimination. Article 10 of the Constitution of Turkey guaranteed 
equality before the law and acts of discrimination were prohibited and penalized by law.  
</p>
<p>65. Equality was enshrined in various other laws regulating specific areas of political, 
social and economic life. Article 8 of the Civil Code enshrined equality in capacity of 
persons as subject to rights, while article 4 of the Law on Social Services and Child 
Protection underscored non-discrimination in eligibility to receive social benefits. The 
Political Parties Law (No. 2820) prohibited political parties founded on regional, racial, 
communitarian, religious or sectarian grounds and articles 4 and 8 of the Basic Law on 
National Education stipulated the principle of equality in education, and gender equality 
and affirmative action, respectively. These provisions were complemented by article 5 of 
the Labour Law which provided for non-discrimination and equal treatment, as well as 
article 4 of the Law on Disabled People which stipulated non-discrimination against people 
with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>15 </b></p>


<p>66. Turkey also noted that article 122 of its Penal Code criminalized economic 
discrimination on the basis of language, race, colour, sex and other reasons, while article 
216 provided penal sanctions against inciting the population to breed enmity or hatred or 
denigration. 
</p>
<p>67. In addition to judicial remedies, there were also governmental, administrative and 
parliamentary remedies for individual victims of discrimination, in particular through the 
Human Rights Presidency at the Office of the Prime Minister, numerous Human Rights 
Boards at provincial and subprovincial levels and the Human Rights Inquiry Commission 
of the Parliament. Those bodies investigated complaints and allegations of human rights 
abuses and, when substantiated, submitted their findings to relevant authorities for action. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations entities 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>68. Since the adoption of its resolution 18/15, the Human Rights Council has continued 
to pay particular attention to violations of human rights relating to the incompatibility 
between democracy and racism.  Through its Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review, the Human Rights Council had made recommendations to countries under review 
to eradicate all forms of racism and xenophobia within political circles and society at large 
in order to strengthen democratic institutions and uphold democratic principles. More 
specifically, recommendations have been made to reinforce democracy and social dialogue, 
promote understanding and tolerance between ethnic and racial groups within the political 
context, take action against racist political parties, political leaders and organizations and 
advance cooperation between all layers of society.   
</p>
<p><b> C.  Human rights treaty bodies  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>69. The question of the incompatibility of the principles of democracy, especially the   
freedom of expression and assembly, with racism has been frequently considered by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Article 4 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination prohibits all 
propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theories of racial superiority 
or incite racial hatred and discrimination. In its general recommendation No. 15 (1993) on 
organized violence based on ethnic origin, the Committee specifically requires States 
parties to penalize dissemination of ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred, incitement 
to racial hatred, acts of violence against any race or group of persons of another colour or 
ethnic origin, and incitement to, or financing of, such acts.  
</p>
<p>70. The Committee consistently applies article 4 in its consideration of the States party 
reports. On numerous occasions, the Committee emphasized the special duties and 
responsibilities of the freedom of expression and iterated the compatibility of the principles 
of the freedom of expression and assembly with the State obligations under article 4 of the 
Convention. For instance, during its fifty-seventh session in August 2001, the Committee, 
while emphasizing the mandatory nature of article 4 of the Convention, expressed that the 
obligation of the State to prohibit the dissemination of &#8220;racist ideas&#8221; was compatible with 
freedom of expression (CERD/C/304/Add.102, para 11).  
</p>
<p>71. On several occasions, the Committee has expressed its concerns over hate speech or 
racist remarks by politicians. For instance, during its sixty-ninth session, the Committee 
specifically raised the concern with a State party on the racist speeches made by politicians 
</p>
<p><b>16 </b></p>


<p>and pointed out that freedom of expression carried specific duties and responsibilities,<b> &#8220;</b>in 
particular the obligation not to disseminate racist<b> </b>ideas, and recommends that the State 
party take resolute action to counter any tendency to target, stigmatize,<b> </b>stereotype or profile 
people on the basis of race, colour, descent, and national or ethnic origin, especially by 
politicians&#8221; (CERD/C/DEN/CO/7, para. 11). More recently, during its seventy-eighth 
session in 2011, the Committee raised its concern over racist remarks made by a number of 
representatives of political parties and urged the State party to find the balance between 
freedom of expression and the need to effectively implement state obligations under article 
4 (CERD/C/NOR/CO/19-20, para. 21).1 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>72. In interpreting article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the Human Rights Committee has consistently emphasised the &#8220;special duties and 
responsibilities&#8221; of the freedom of expression (art. 19, para. 3) in its general comments and 
concluding observations. Precisely owing to the special duties and responsibilities, certain 
restrictions on freedom of expression to protect &#8220;the interest of other persons or those of the 
community as a whole&#8221; are permitted as long as such restrictions do not jeopardise the right 
itself.2 In its general comment No 34 (2011) on article 19, which replaces general comment 
No. 10, the Human Rights Committee has reiterated the indispensability of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in a free and democratic society and echoed its position 
on the possible restrictions on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>73. The Committee specifically raised the compatible and complementary nature of 
articles 19 and 20 in the general comment No. 34 and rearticulated the obligation of the 
States parties to penalize acts listed in article 20, namely war propaganda, and any 
advocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence. Through its concluding observations, the Committee 
has consistently asked State parties to prohibit hate speech and other acts motivated by 
racism or xenophobia. For instance, in 2009, the Committee urged a State party to 
prosecute incitement to national, racial and religious hatred (CCPR/C/CHE/CO/3, para. 
10).3  
</p>
<p>74. On several occasions, the Committee has also raised its concerns over hate speeches 
or racist comments made by political figures and public officers. In 2007, the Committee 
raised its concern over the persistence of racist and xenophobic speech against Muslims, 
Jews and ethnic minorities in political and media discourse and urged the State party 
concerned to &#8220;rigorously combat any advocacy of racial or religious hatred, including 
political hate speech&#8221; (CCPR/C/AUT/CO/4, para. 20).4

</b></p>
<p>75.  The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance submitted reports both to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Committee also raised the similar concerns in CERD/C/ISR/CO/13, CERD/C/BEL/CO/15,

<p>(A/HRC/18/44) and General Assembly (A/66/312) on the implementation of Assembly 
resolution 65/199. 
</p>
<p>76. He also submitted a report to the Human Rights Council at its twentieth session on 
the implementation of General Assembly resolution 66/143 on the inadmissibility of certain 
practices that contribute to fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance (A/HRC/20/38). In his report, the Special Rapporteur 
emphasized that preserving and consolidating democracy was essential in order to prevent 
and combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. He 
recommended that respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law should be the 
cornerstone of any programme or activity developed by political parties, and urged political 
leaders and political parties to promote multiculturalism, tolerance, mutual understanding 
and respect within their societies. In that context, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the Outcome Document of the Durban 
Review Conference and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination were major comprehensive frameworks to be implemented. The 
Special Rapporteur also addressed racism and democracy in his annual thematic report to 
the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/20/33).  
</p>
<p>77. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur raised the issue of the human rights and 
democratic challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups during a 
country visit where he noted with concern the resurgence of extremist ideas propagated by 
politicians, public figures and certain groups of individuals who encouraged racial 
discrimination and incited racial violence, particularly against Roma minorities 
(A/HRC/20/33/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Information from the contributions indicates that, while some countries have 
specific legislation on racial discrimination, others favour general statutory 
regulations prohibiting discrimination on grounds of race. By the same token, some 
States have penal regulations specifically covering racism and racial discrimination, 
but others generally cover those as incidental to general provisions of the Criminal 
Code. In some States, racial motivation for a crime is considered as an aggravating 
factor in evaluating the penal consequences of a crime.  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> Some States are by statute required to intervene when political groups overstep 
bounds, others understand independence of political competition to mean absence of 
State intervention in the affairs of political parties. Some States have also 
constitutionally prohibited political groups based on ideas of racial superiority.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> While some States have taken affirmative action measures to secure 
participation of minorities and groups susceptible to discrimination in the political 
process, other States rely on general legal provisions that provide for equality for all. 
Generally, respondent States recognized the need for preventive measures and 
collaborative action in responding to the threats posed to democracy by racism.
