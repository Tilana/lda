SUMMING UP

Ladies and Gentleman of Assessors,

1.      
 It is now my duty to sum up this case to you. I will direct on matters of law which you must accept and act upon. On matters of facts however, which witnesses to accept as reliable, which version of the evidence to accept, these are matters for you to decide for yourselves. So if I express my opinion to you about facts of the case or if I appear to do so it is a matter for you whether you accept what I say, or form your own opinion. In other words you are the judges of facts. All matters of facts are for you to decide. It is for you to decide the credibility of the witnesses and what parts of their evidence you accept as true and what parts you reject.

2.      
 You have to decide what facts are proved and what inferences drawn from those facts. You then apply law as I explain it to you and form your individual opinion as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty.

3.      
 Prosecution and defence made their submissions to you about the facts of this case. That is their duty. But it is a matter for you to decide which version of the facts to accept or reject.

4.      
 You will not be asked to give reasons for your opinions but merely your opinions of yourself and your opinion need not be unanimous but it would be desirable if you agree on them. Your opinions are not binding on me but I can tell you that they carry great weight with me when I deliver my judgement.

5.      
 On the question of proof, I must direct you as a matter of law that the onus of burden of proof lies on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts. There is no obligation on the accused person to prove his innocence. Under our criminal justice system accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. This is the golden rule.

6.      
 The standard of proof in a criminal trial is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This means you must be satisfied so that you are sure of the accused's guilt before you can express an opinion that he is guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt about his guilt then you must express an opinion that he is not guilty.

7.      
 Proof can be established only through evidence. Evidence can be from direct evidence that is the evidence that who saw the incident or felt the offence being committed. The other kind of evidence is circumstantial evidence that you put one or more circumstances together and draw certain irresistible inferences. Evidence presented in the form of a document is called Documentary evidence.

8.      
 In certain circumstances the court would allow witnesses to give their opinions on a matter. Theses witnesses should be experts on that particular subject. For example, you get experts on medical field. 

9.      
 The caution interview statement of the accused person is in evidence. What an accused says in his caution interview is evidence against him. I will direct you shortly on how you should consider that evidence.

10.     
 The facts which agreed between the prosecution and the defence are called agreed facts. You may accept those facts as if they had been led from witnesses from witness box.

 Your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence apply the law to those facts. Approach the evidence with detachment and objectivity. Do not get carried away by emotions.

13.     
 Now let's look at the charge.

 FIRST COUNT
Statement of Offence
INDECENT ASSUALT: contrary to section 212(1) and (2) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

Particular of Offence

TOMASI TAVAKATOGA TUIWAILEVU MATENI, on the 06th day of August 2012, at Savusavu, in the Northern Division, unlawfully and indecently assaulted M.M a 9 year old. 
 
 SECOND COUNT
Statement of Offence
RAPE: Contrary to section 207(1) and 207(2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

Particular of Offence

TOMASI TAVAKATOGA TUIWAILEVU MATENI on the 07th day of August 2012, at Savusavu, in the Northern Division, penetrated the vagina of M.M a 9 year old, with his finger. 
 
14. In order to prove the offence of Indecent Assault the prosecution has to prove 
 the following elements beyond reasonable doubt.

(i) The accused

 (ii) Unlawfully, and

 (iii) Indecently

 (iv) Assaulted

 (v) The female complainant. 

15. In Fiji law, the offence of Rape is committed when the vagina is penetrated either by the penis or by the finger of the accused. Hence in this case the prosecution has to prove:

 1. It was the accused

2. Who had sexual intercourse with the victim or that he sexually abused the victim by invading her with his finger,

 3. Penetrated the vulva or vagina of the victim to some extent, by inserting a finger,

 4. Without her consent.

16. As far as the element of consent is concern, in our law, a child is under the age of 13 years is incapable of giving consent. In this case victim was 9 years old at the time of the offence. Hence consent is immaterial in this case.

17. I now remind you of the prosecution and defence cases. In doing this it would be tedious and impractical for me to go through the evidence of every witness in detail and repeat every submission made by the counsel. I will summarize the salient features. If I do not mention a particular witness, or a particular piece of evidence that does not mean it is unimportant. You should consider and evaluate all the evidence and all the submissions in coming to your decision in this case.

18. Now let's look at the evidence led by the prosecution in this case.

 Analysis of Evidence
40. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, in this case the victim gave evidence first. According to her the accused came to her house on 6th and 7th August in the night and touched her body and inserted his finger into her vagina. She had identified the accused through the solar light which was on at that time. She knew the accused earlier as he too lived in Nakama Heights. She was not forced by anybody to implicate the accused in this case. She said that the accused was the person who entered her house on 6th and 7th of August 2012 and performed unpleasant acts on her. The accused wore a wig on both days but he removed it when he touched and inserted his finger into victim's vagina. The victim was a 9 year old girl when she encountered these unpleasant acts. She was not aware accused attending a Crusade on 6th and 7th August 2012. As assessors and judges of facts you have to consider her evidence very carefully. 

41. The victim's sister Kereleyani Wati corroborated the incident that happened on 07th August 2012. She had identified the accused through room light when he seated on the bed close to her sister. She too had seen accused wearing a mask but he removed it when he seated on the bed. She was 8 years old in the year 2012. 

42. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, you heard the evidence of victim's grandfather. He had seen blood marks on victim's skirt. No complain received from the victim when he saw blood on her skirt.

43. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, after seeing the victim's cry, the class teacher Vaseva took the victim's to school head teacher who then referred the victim to Savusavu Police Station. WPC Maca after recording victim's statement produced her before Dr. Dinesh Lingam for a medical examination. 

44. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, the doctor gave evidence and explained the injury. He had examined the victim's vagina. He gave evidence as an expert. According to his opinion hymen could be damaged due to entering a blunt object into the vagina.

45. Accused denied the charge. According to him on both disputed days and time he was present in a Crusade which was held at Savusavu. To prove a document marked D1 produced by the defence. Although the prosecution not objected for the production of the document D1, you have to be satisfied whether it came from proper custody. Accused admitted that he had a wig but was handed over to the owner one month before the incident. As Assessors and Judges of facts you have to consider this evidence very carefully.

46. Sanita was called to corroborate the accused's position taken in his defence. She is a relation of the accused.

47. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, in this case accused opted to give evidence from witness box and called a witness. That is his right. But he has nothing to prove to you. 

48. In this case the accused is charged for Indecent Assault contrary to section 212(1) and (2) and Rape contrary to section 207(1) and 207(2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009. I have already explained to you about the charges and its ingredients.

49. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, as per section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Decree 2009 no corroboration shall be required in sexual offence cases.

50. You have heard all the prosecution witnesses. You have observed them giving evidence in the court. You have observed their demeanour in the court. Considering my direction on the law, your life experiences and common sense, you should be able to decide which witness's evidence, or part of their evidence you consider reliable, and therefore to accept, and which witness's evidence, you consider unreliable and therefore to reject. 

51. You must also carefully consider the accused's position as stated above. Please remember, even if you reject the version of the accused that does not mean that the prosecution had established the case against the accused. You must be satisfied that the prosecution has established the case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused.

52. Ladies and Gentleman of Assessors, remember, it is for the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is not for the accused to prove his innocence. The burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and that burden stays with them throughout the trial.

53. Once again, I remind, that your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence, apply the law to those facts and come to a correct finding. Do not get carried away by emotions.

54. This is all I have to say to you. You may now retire to deliberate. The clerks will advise me when you have reached your individual decisions, and we will reconvene the court.

55. Any re-directions

 I thank you for your patient hearing to my summing- up.
