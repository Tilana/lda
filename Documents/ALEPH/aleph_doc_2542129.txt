NORTHGATE POSTS STRONG THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OF $8.8 MILLION 
ACQUISTION OF YOUNG-DAVIDSON MINES TO CLOSE IN EARLY NOVEMBER
VANCOUVER,  October  27,  2005  –  (All  figures  in  US  dollars  except  where  noted) –  Northgate  Minerals
Corporation (TSX: NGX, AMEX: NXG) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2005.
Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $19,731,000 or $0.10 per common 
share for the third quarter of 2005. Earnings for the quarter were $8,765,000 or $0.04 per share.
Third Quarter 2005 Highlights
(cid:120) Gold production of 75,665 ounces at a cash cost of $194 per ounce generated almost $20 million
in operating cash flow.
(cid:120) Northgate announced an agreement to acquire Young-Davidson Mines, Limited which has 1.5 million
ounces  of  gold  resources  within  a  prospective  land  package  located  in  the  prolific  Kirkland-Larder
Lake Gold Belt of northeastern Ontario.
(cid:120)
The  Kemess  North  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (“EIA”)  report was  submitted  to  the  Joint
Federal/Provincial review panel and the public comment period began.
(cid:120) Diamond drilling in the Kemess North region discovered a new zone of gold/copper mineralization to
the east of the Kemess North deposit.
Ken  Stowe,  President  and  CEO,  stated;  “As  expected,  Northgate’s  financial  results  improved
dramatically in the third quarter as mining operations moved into the western area of the Kemess South 
pit and ore grades returned to more normal levels. In the fourth quarter of this  year, given our strong
production  forecast  and  the  current  commodity  price  environment,  I  fully  expect  Northgate  to  post 
record  quarterly  cash  flow  and  earnings.  Our  management  team  continues  to  focus  on  the  wise  re-
investment of the significant cash flow that Kemess South generates into opportunities in the gold sector
that will create additional value for our shareholders. Our first substantial success in this regard will be
the  acquisition  of  Young-Davidson  Mines,  where we  are  acquiring  1.5  million  gold  resource  ounces  in
one of the premier gold mining camps in North America with excellent potential to discover additional
resources.  The  completion  of  this  transaction  combined  with  continued  progress  on  permitting of  the 
Kemess North project and strong financial results for the foreseeable future will provide Northgate with 
excellent momentum as we move into 2006.”

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2
Northgate recorded earnings of $8,765,000 or $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2005 compared 
with earnings of $10,053,000 or $0.05 per share during the corresponding quarter of 2004. Cash flow 
from operations before changes in working capital for the current quarter was $19,731,000 or $0.10 
per fully diluted common share compared with $21,150,000 or $0.11 per fully diluted common share 
in the same period one year ago. The slight decrease in earnings and cash flow from operations in the 
most recent quarter was primarily a consequence of lower sales volumes of copper and gold and higher 
production costs, which combined to more than offset the positive impact of higher metal prices.
Kemess Mine Performance
The Kemess Mine produced 75,665 ounces of gold and 16.9 million pounds of copper during the third 
quarter of 2005 compared with 79,311 ounces and 18.7 million pounds in the third quarter of 2004.
During  the  third  quarter  of  2005,  approximately  12.2  million  tonnes  of  ore  and  waste  were  removed 
from  the  open  pit  compared  to  13.9  million  tonnes  during  the  corresponding  quarter  of  2004.  The 
decline in the amount of material mined was the result of the large amount of ore milled from stockpiles 
and increased hauling distances as the Kemess South pit expands. Unit mining costs during the current 
quarter  were  Cdn$1.26  per  tonne  compared  with  Cdn$0.94  per  tonne  in  the  third  quarter  of  2004, 
representing  a  34%  increase  for  2005  compared  to  2004.  The  higher  unit  mining  cost  in  the  most 
recent quarter is primarily the result of higher diesel fuel prices and the lower quantity of ore and waste 
mined as a consequence of the longer haul distances associated with the deepening pit.
Mill  availability  during  the  third  quarter  of  2005  averaged  90%  which  was  2%  higher  than  the 
availability in the corresponding quarter of 2004. Mill throughput in the third quarter of 2005 averaged 
52,669  tonnes  per  calendar  day  compared  to  50,662  tonnes  per  calendar  day  in  the  corresponding 
quarter  of  2004.  The  higher  throughput  in  the  most  recent  quarter  was  the  result  of  milling  a  larger 
quantity of softer, inherently higher throughput supergene and leach cap ore in the most recent quarter 
relative to the third quarter of 2004. Gold and copper recoveries averaged 65% and 75% respectively in 
the third quarter of 2005 compared with 70% and 82% in the third quarter of 2004. Gold and copper 
recoveries in the most recent quarter were lower than the same period one year ago and lower than the 
typical  Kemess  average  of  71%  and  83%  respectively,  due  to  the  large  quantity  of  inherently  lower 
recovery supergene and leachcap ore that was processed.
Metal concentrate inventory was drawn down by 1,100 wet metric tonnes (wmt) in the third quarter to 
approximately 7,000 wmt, although the contained metal value in the inventory at the end of the quarter 
was  higher  due  to  substantial  increases  in  gold  and  copper  prices.  In  order  to  deal  with  the  record 
quantity  of  concentrate  in  the  production  plan  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2005,  additional  trucks  and 
railcars  have  been  secured  and  Kemess  is  targeting  to  have  less  than  5,000  wmt  of  concentrate 
inventory at the end of 2005.
The total unit cost of production during the third quarter of 2005 was Cdn$7.48 per tonne milled which 
was higher than the Cdn$6.95 per tonne recorded in the corresponding period of 2004 due primarily to 
the increase unit mining costs. Total site operating costs in the third quarter of 2005 were Cdn$36.4 
million  compared  to  Cdn$32.4  million  in  the  corresponding  quarter  of  2004.  The  net  cash  cost  of 
production in the most recent quarter was $194 per ounce compared to $129 per ounce in the third

quarter of 2004. Net cash costs in the most recent quarter were higher than those one year ago primarily 
as a result of the higher Canadian dollar operating costs, lower copper production, higher treatment and 
refining  charges  for  copper  concentrate  and  the  stronger  Canadian  dollar,  which  more  than  offset  the 
effect of the substantially higher copper price. Using the Gold Institute methodology which many other 
gold  companies  use,  Kemess’  net  cash  cost  during  the  most  recent  quarter  was  $137  per  ounce 
compared with $76 per ounce in the third quarter of 2004.
A  summary  of  operations  for  the  third  quarter  and  first  nine  months  of  2005  compared  with  the 
corresponding periods of 2004 is shown in Table 1.

The Kemess mine continued to operate safely during the quarter. Kemess is continuing to expand the 
scope  of  its  safety  program  by  providing  accident  investigation  training  to  supervisors  and  Joint 
Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Committee  members.  This  training  will  allow  a  broader  range  of 
employees within the Kemess operation to begin to examine the root cause of incidents and appreciate 
the process design factors necessary for safe operation.
Kemess  is  scheduled  to  process  above-average  grade  hypogene  ore  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2005 
resulting in the production of approximately 94,000 ounces of gold and 24.5 million pounds of copper 
at a net cash cost of less than $75 per ounce assuming copper prices of $1.65 per pound and a foreign 
exchange rate of 1.19 Cdn$/US$.

Financial Performance
4
Northgate’s revenues in the third quarter of 2005 were $50,409,000 compared to $51,288,000 in the 
corresponding period of 2004. Metal sales in the third quarter of 2005 consisted of 75,044 ounces of 
gold and 17.2 million pounds of copper compared with 81,908 ounces of gold and 20.5 million pounds 
of copper in the third quarter of 2004. The net realized metal prices received on sales in the current 
quarter  were  approximately  $402  per  ounce  of  gold  and  $1.70  per  pound  of  copper  compared  with 
$377 per ounce of gold and $1.29 per pound of copper in the corresponding quarter of last year. The 
net realized gold prices in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004 included the cost of closing out 21,750 
ounces of gold forward sales contracts in each quarter. These costs reduced realized gold prices by $37 
per ounce in the third quarter of 2005 and $24 per ounce in the corresponding period of 2004 relative 
to the average PM Fix for gold for these quarters on the London Bullion Market. The larger reduction in 
gold price realization in the most recent quarter was the result of the higher spot price for gold at the 
time  the  forward  sales  contracts  were  closed  out  and  the  lower  number  of  gold  ounces  sold  in  the 
quarter. The gold hedging loss reflected in earnings during the most recent quarter of $2,805,000 was 
part of the deferred hedging loss set up in the second quarter of 2005 when certain gold forward sales 
contracts were closed out prior to their original settlement dates. The remaining deferred hedging loss of 
$7,310,000 will be brought into earnings over the period that the related forward sale contracts were 
originally scheduled for settlement.
Cost  of  sales  in  the  third  quarters  of  2005  and  2004  were  $29,842,000  and  $27,312,000 
respectively.  Operating  costs  were  higher  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005  than  they  were  in  the 
corresponding period of 2004 primarily as a result of higher diesel fuel prices, increased labour costs 
resulting  from  the  new  collective  agreement  signed  in  February  and  the  stronger  Canadian  dollar. 
However, in the third quarter of 2004, a significant decrease in concentrate inventory increased the cost 
of sales recorded in that quarter by $2,534,000.
Administrative  and  general  expenses  were  $1,045,000  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005  compared  with 
$1,129,000 in the comparable period of 2004. Costs in the current quarter were lower due to reduced 
legal costs.
Depreciation  and  depletion  expenses  in  the  third  quarter  were  $7,220,000  compared  to  $9,234,000 
during  the  corresponding  period  of  2004.  The  decrease  in  depreciation  and  depletion  in  the  current 
quarter relative to the corresponding period of 2004 and earlier quarters of 2005 was the result of the 
lower amount of ore mined from the pit as a result of the large amount of stockpiled ore milled during 
the annual supergene/leachcap ore campaign.
Net  interest  expense  was  $646,000  for  the  three  months  ended  September  30,  2005  compared  to 
$966,000  in  the  corresponding  quarter  of  2004.  The  decrease  in  net  interest  expense  is  a  direct 
consequence of reduced amount of long-term debt which was only partially offset by increased interest 
rates.
Exploration expenses in the third quarter of 2005 were $1,877,000 compared with $1,010,000 during 
the same period of 2004. The increase in exploration expense reflects an intra-period timing difference 
in expenditures rather than an increase in annual exploration expenditures.

Capital  expenditures  during  the  third  quarter  of  2005  were  $5,159,000  compared  to  $7,425,000  in 
the  corresponding  period  of  2004.  Capital  expenditures  in  the  most  recent  quarter  included  the 
purchase of a D11 dozer for $1,502,000 and $2,009,000 for the ongoing construction of the tailings 
dam. The remaining capital was spent on various small projects in the mill and the mine in addition to 
$368,000 being invested in the permitting process for the Kemess North project.
KEMESS NORTH PROJECT UPDATE
During  the  first  week  of  October  2005,  Northgate  submitted  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment 
Report  (“EIA  Report”)  for  the  development  of  the  Kemess  North  mine  to  the  Joint  Federal/Provincial 
Environmental Review Panel. The EIA Report consists of an EIA Summary document and 14 supporting 
appendices  which  present  environmental,  socio-economic,  geological  and  engineering  data  and 
interpretation relating to all aspects of the Kemess North development.
After  receiving  the  Kemess  North  EIA  Report,  the  Review  Panel  officially  released  it  for  a  public 
comment period which is designed to ensure that the report meets all the terms of the EIA guidelines 
issued by the panel in August 2005. The public comment period will end on January 6, 2006 at which 
point  Northgate  may  be  asked  to  incorporate  certain  of  the  comments  received  by  the  Panel  into  the 
final EIA Report which will be the central focus of the public hearings on the project development.
CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
On September 13, 2005, Northgate announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Young-
Davidson Mines, Limited (TSXV: ODM). Under the terms of the Agreement, approved by both Boards of 
Directors, Northgate will issue 0.7212 common shares of Northgate for each share of Young-Davidson. 
Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of 66-2/3% of Young-Davidson shareholders and 
approval  of  Canadian  securities  regulators,  the  TSX,  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  and  the  AMEX.  An 
Information Circular was mailed to Young-Davidson shareholders in early October and the transaction is 
scheduled to close in early November following the required Young-Davidson shareholder vote scheduled 
for November 1, 2005.
The acquisition of Young-Davidson will add one and a half million resource ounces of gold which include 
almost half a million ounces of gold (Measured & Indicated Resources) within a low-strip ratio open pit 
configuration and slightly more than one million ounces of gold (Inferred Resources) in a low-cost bulk 
mineable  underground  configuration.  The  8,771  acre  package  of  exploration  and  mining  claims 
(Figure 1)  along  the  prolific  Kirkland-Larder  Lake  Gold  Belt  in  northeastern  Ontario  has  hosted  two 
mines  that  together  produced  almost  one  million  ounces  of  gold  between  1933  and  1957.  The 
production  history  of  these  mines  suggests  that  the  area  has  excellent  ground  conditions  for  low-cost 
bulk underground mining, ore which yields high gold recoveries through a simple metallurgical process 
and geology that yields environmentally benign waste rock and tailings.
After the transaction closes, Northgate will be mounting a $3 million surface diamond drilling program 
in 2006 to identify additional resources, while at the same time, applying for permits to dewater one of 
the existing mining shafts on the property which will be used for underground definition drilling in future 
years.

2005 KEMESS EXPLORATION RESULTS
Northgate budgeted $2.0 million during 2005 for approximately 15,000 meters of diamond drilling on
the Kemess claims surrounding the Kemess South mine. While complete results of the program are not 
yet  available,  hole  KN-05-24,  which  is  located  150  meters  east  of  the  Kemess  North  deposit  on  the 
other  side  the  east  boundary  fault  (Figure  2),  intersected 307.6  metres  of  gold/copper  mineralization 
grading  0.31  g/t  gold  and  0.24  %  copper.  Within  the  overall  mineralized  interval  (Table  2)  there  are
sections  of  higher grade  gold  and  copper,  the  lower one  of  which  is  associated  with  the  contact  zone
between the host Takla volcanic rocks and a monzonite intrusive body.
The  mineralization  found  in  this  hole  represents  the  discovery  of  either  the  faulted  extension  of  the
Kemess North deposit or a new mineralized system in an open untested area. At the present time the 
extent  of  the  new  mineralization  is  unknown  but  given  the  nature  of  the  block  fault  systems  in  the 
Kemess North region, it is possible that this new zone of mineralization may contain a high-grade core
like Kemess North and that sections of this higher grade mineralization may have been faulted upwards
much closer to the surface. Two additional holes have been drilled and assay results are pending.

NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 
(Dollar amounts in tables are expressed in thousands of United States dollars unless indicated) (unaudited)
1. Basis of Presentation
The  accompanying  unaudited  interim  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been 
prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in  Canada 
(“Canadian  GAAP”).  They  do  not  include  all  the  disclosures  required  by  generally 
accepted  accounting  principles  for  annual  financial  statements  and  should  be  read  in 
conjunction  with  the  Corporation’s  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  notes 
thereto 
the  year  ended 
December 31, 2004.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  all  adjustments  considered 
necessary for fair presentation have been included in these financial statements.

in
These financial statements are prepared using the same accounting policies and methods 
of  application  as  those  disclosed  in  Note  2  to  the  Corporation’s  consolidated  financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, with the exception of a policy change 
related to the Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
Effective  January  1,  2005,  the  Corporation  adopted  the  new  CICA  Accounting 
Guideline 15 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“AcG-15”). The new guidance 
establishes when a company should consolidate a variable interest entity and requires a 
variable interest entity to be consolidated if a company is at risk of absorbing the variable 
interest entity’s expected losses, or is entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest 
entities residual returns, or both. The adoption of AcG-15 did not result in any changes to 
the Corporation’s financial statements.

At  September  30,  2005,  Kemess  Mines  Ltd.,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  the
Corporation,  had  forward  sales  commitments with  major  financial  institutions  to  deliver
139,000  ounces  of  gold  at  an  average  forward  price  of  $307  per  ounce.  These 
commitments are in the form of forward sales contracts maturing between May 26, 2006 
and  December 31,  2007.  The  unrealized  loss  on  these  forward  sales  contracts  at 
September 30, 2005 was approximately $26,522,000.
In May 2005, the Corporation closed out 79,750 ounces of its hedge book at a cost of 
$10,146,000.  In  accordance  with  Accounting Guideline  13,  “Hedging  Relationships”,
losses  associated  with  the  early  settlement  of  these  contracts  were  capitalized  and  are 
being amortized  over  the  same  period  as  the  forward  sales  contracts  were  originally
scheduled for settlement. Of the 79,750 ounces of gold closed out in May 2005, 21,750
ounces represent gold forward sales contracts that were scheduled to be closed out in the
quarter  ended  September  30,  2005  and  1,250  ounces  in  the  quarter  ended  June 30,
2005.  The  associated cost  for  the  quarters  ended  September  30,  2005  and  June 30,
2005  was  $2,684,000  and  $152,000  respectively,  reducing  the  capitalized  deferred
hedge loss to $7,310,000 as at September 30, 2005.
4. Commitments and Contingencies
On  September  13,  2005,  the  Corporation  signed  an  Amalgamation  agreement  with 
Young-Davidson Mines, Limited (“Young-Davidson”). Under the terms of this agreement,
approved  by  both  Boards  of  Directors,  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Northgate  will  be 
amalgamated  with  Young-Davidson  and  Northgate  will  issue  0.7212  common  shares  of 
Northgate for each common share of Young-Davidson and agrees to convert outstanding
Young-Davidson common share purchase options and warrants to Northgate securities at 
the aforementioned exchange ratio.
