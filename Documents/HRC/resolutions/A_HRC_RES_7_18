<p><b>Human Rights Council 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/18.   Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the 
occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and affirming 
</p>
<p>the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations and as 
</p>
<p>elaborated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights and other applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, the Security Council and the General Assembly, most 
</p>
<p>recently General Assembly resolution 62/108 of 17 December 2007 in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly reaffirmed, inter alia, the illegality of the Israeli settlements in the occupied 
</p>
<p>territories, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>that Israel is a party to the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is 
</p>
<p>applicable de jure to Palestinian and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, 
</p>
<p>including East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted 
</p>
<p>by the Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, held 
</p>
<p>in Geneva on 5 December 2001,  
</p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own 
</p>
<p>civilian population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth 
</p>
<p>Geneva Convention and relevant provisions of customary law, including those 
</p>
<p>codified in Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and 
</p>
<p>relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), </p>

<p><i> Recalling </i>the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International 
</p>
<p>Court of Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the 
</i></p>
<p><i>Occupied Palestinian Territory</i>, and its conclusion that &#8220;the Israeli settlements in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in 
</p>
<p>breach of international law&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory constitute very serious violations of international humanitarian law and of 
</p>
<p>the human rights of the Palestinian people therein and undermine international efforts, 
</p>
<p>including the Annapolis Peace Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Conference for the Palestinian State, aimed at invigorating the peace process and 
</p>
<p>establishing a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State by the 
</p>
<p>end of 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its attachment to the implementation by both parties of their 
</p>
<p>obligations under the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the 
</p>
<p>Israeli-Palestinian conflict (S/2003/529, annex), and noting specifically its call for a 
</p>
<p>freeze on all settlement activity, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its grave concern </i>at the continuation by Israel, the occupying 
</p>
<p>Power, of settlement building and expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including plans to expand and connect Israeli settlements around Occupied East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem, thus threatening the creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, in violation 
</p>
<p>of international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines 
</p>
<p>the realization of a two-State solution, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing grave concern </i>at the continuing construction, contrary to 
</p>
<p>international law, by Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
</p>
<p>including in and around East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about 
</p>
<p>the route of the wall in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could 
</p>
<p>prejudge future negotiations and make the two-State solution physically impossible to 
</p>
<p>implement and which is causing the Palestinian people further humanitarian hardship, </p>

<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that the route of the wall has been traced in such a way as to 
</p>
<p>include the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate 
</p>
<p>fully with the relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied 
</p>
<p>since 1967, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 (A/HRC/7/17) and 
</p>
<p>calls upon the Government of Israel to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur to allow 
</p>
<p>him to discharge his mandate fully; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Deplores </i>the recent Israeli announcements of the construction of new 
</p>
<p>housing units for Israeli settlers in and around occupied East Jerusalem, as they 
</p>
<p>undermine the peace process and the creation of a contiguous, sovereign and 
</p>
<p>independent Palestinian State, and are in violation of international law and pledges 
</p>
<p>made by Israel at the Annapolis Peace Conference of 27 November 2007; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Expresses its grave concern </i>at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
</p>
<p>international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, 
</p>
<p>the demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion 
</p>
<p>of Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical 
</p>
<p>character and demographic composition of the  
</p>
<p>occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and constitute a 
</p>
<p>violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian 
</p>
<p>Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 of that 
</p>
<p>Convention; settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment of a just and 
</p>
<p>comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign and 
</p>
<p>democratic Palestinian State; </p>

<p> (<i>b</i>) The Israeli so-called E-1 plan aimed at expanding the Israeli settlement 
</p>
<p>of Maale Adumim and building the wall around it, thereby further disconnecting 
</p>
<p>occupied East Jerusalem from the northern and southern parts of the West Bank and 
</p>
<p>isolating its Palestinian population; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The implications for the final status negotiations of the announcement 
</p>
<p>by Israel that it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory, including settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones 
</p>
<p>on the Occupied Palestinian Territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which 
</p>
<p>create a fait accompli on the ground that could well be permanent and would be 
</p>
<p>tantamount to de facto annexation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev, in violation of international law 
</p>
<p>and relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory and the restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, 
</p>
<p>including the repeated closure of the crossing points of the Gaza Strip, which have 
</p>
<p>created an extremely precarious humanitarian situation for the civilian population and 
</p>
<p>impaired the economic and social rights of the Palestinian people; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) The continued construction, contrary to international law, of the wall 
</p>
<p>inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges </i>Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, 
</p>
<p>to stop immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural 
</p>
<p>growth&#8221; and related activities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories; </p>

<p> 5. <i>Urges </i>the full implementation of the Access and Movement 
</p>
<p>Agreement of 15 November 2005, particularly the urgent reopening of the Rafah and 
</p>
<p>Karni crossings, which are crucial to the passage of foodstuffs and essential supplies, 
</p>
<p>as well as the access of United Nations agencies to and within the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Demands </i>that Israel implement the recommendations regarding the 
</p>
<p>settlements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her 
</p>
<p>report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session on her visit to 
</p>
<p>the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, Egypt and Jordan (E/CN.4/2001/114); 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel to take and implement serious measures, including 
</p>
<p>confiscation of arms and enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of 
</p>
<p>preventing acts of violence by Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the 
</p>
<p>safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians and Palestinian properties in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal 
</p>
<p>obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Urges </i>the parties to give renewed impetus to the peace process in line 
</p>
<p>with the Annapolis Peace Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference 
</p>
<p>for the Palestinian State and to implement fully the road map endorsed by the Security 
</p>
<p>Council in its resolution 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003, with the aim of reaching 
</p>
<p>a comprehensive political settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the 
</p>
<p>Security Council, including resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 
</p>
<p>(1973) of 22 October 1973, and other relevant United Nations resolutions, the 
</p>
<p>principles of the Peace Conference on the Middle East, held in Madrid on 30 October 
</p>
<p>1991, the Oslo Accords and subsequent agreements, which will allow two States, 
</p>
<p>Israel and Palestine, to live in peace and security; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides </i>to continue the consideration of this question at its session of 
</p>
<p>March 2009. </p>
