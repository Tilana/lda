<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 1 October 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>30/9. Equal participation in political and public affairs 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> relevant international human rights treaties, in particular the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all relevant General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions 
</p>
<p>on participation in political and public affairs, in particular Council resolutions 24/8 of 26 
</p>
<p>September 2013 on equal political participation, and 27/24 of 3 October 2014 on equal 
</p>
<p>participation in political and public affairs, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any 
</p>
<p>of the distinctions stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
</p>
<p>without unreasonable restrictions, to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or 
</p>
<p>through freely chosen representatives, and to have access, on general terms of equality, to 
</p>
<p>public service in his or her country, as well as to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic 
</p>
<p>elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and held by secret ballot, 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors, and reaffirming also that the 
</p>
<p>will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that no distinctions are permitted among citizens in the enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs on the grounds of race, colour, sex, 
</p>
<p>language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
</p>
<p>other status, or on the basis of disability, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the critical importance of equal and effective participation in political 
</p>
<p>and public affairs for democracy, the rule of law, social inclusion, economic development 
</p>
<p>and advancing gender equality, as well as for the realization of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the active participation of women, on equal terms with men, at all 
</p>
<p>levels of decision-making, is essential to the achievement of equality, inclusive economic 
</p>
<p>growth and sustainable development, peace and democracy, 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>

<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the rights of everyone to freedom of expression, to peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly, to freedom of association, to education, and access to information, as well as 
</p>
<p>inclusive economic empowerment, are among the essential conditions for equal 
</p>
<p>participation in political and public affairs and must be promoted and protected, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the need for further work on the full and effective implementation 
</p>
<p>of the right to participate in public affairs in the context of article 25 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, including by identifying possible gaps in existing 
</p>
<p>guidance on the implementation of this right, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> the need to intensify efforts to eliminate barriers in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice and to actively facilitate full and effective participation in political and public 
</p>
<p>affairs, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the special procedures, the treaty bodies and other relevant human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms on identifying and addressing obstacles to the full implementation of the right 
</p>
<p>to participate in public affairs, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses concern</i> that, despite progress made towards the full 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to participate in public affairs worldwide, many people 
</p>
<p>continue to face obstacles, including discrimination, in the enjoyment of their right to 
</p>
<p>participate in the public affairs of their countries as well as in the enjoyment of other human 
</p>
<p>rights that enable it; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> that women, persons belonging to marginalized groups or 
</p>
<p>minorities, and persons in vulnerable situations are among those who are most affected by 
</p>
<p>discrimination in participation in political and public affairs; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reaffirms</i> the obligation of States to take all appropriate measures to ensure 
</p>
<p>that every citizen has an effective right and opportunity to equal participation in public 
</p>
<p>affairs; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Notes</i> the emergence of new forms of participation and grass-roots 
</p>
<p>engagement, in particular through new information and communications technology and 
</p>
<p>social media, and the challenges to established forms of political participation in some 
</p>
<p>States; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Notes with interest</i> the study on promotion, protection and implementation of 
</p>
<p>the right to participate in public affairs in the context of existing human rights law prepared 
</p>
<p>by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,<footnote name="1">A/HRC/30/26. </footnote> and welcomes 
</p>
<p>the contributions of States and other stakeholders to the study; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Invites</i> States to consider best practices and experiences with respect to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the right to participate in public affairs when fulfilling their human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations, and to share their best practices and experiences in this regard at the regional 
</p>
<p>and international levels, including when reporting to the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>system, in order to facilitate full, effective and equal participation in political and public 
</p>
<p>affairs; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges</i> all States to ensure the full, effective and equal participation of all

</p>
<p>participating fully and effectively in political and public affairs, including, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>reviewing and repealing measures that unreasonably restrict the right to participate in 
</p>
<p>public affairs, and considering adopting, on the basis of reliable data on participation,
