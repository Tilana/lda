</b></p>
<p><i> Having met </i>in Washington on 2 February 2010, with the assistance of <i>ARTICLE 19, 
Global Campaign for Free Expression </i>and the <i>Centre for Law and Democracy</i>;<i> 
 Recalling and reaffirming</i> our Joint Declarations of 26 November 1999, 30 
November 2000, 20 November 2001, 10 December 2002, 18 December 2003, 6 December 
2004, 21 December 2005, 19 December 2006, 12 December 2007 and 10 December 2008; 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i>, once again, the fundamental importance of freedom of expression &#8212; 
including the principles of diversity and pluralism &#8212; both inherently and as an essential 
tool for the defence of all other rights and as a core element of democracy; 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that many important gains have been made over the last 10 years since 
our first Joint Declaration was adopted in November 1999 in terms of respect for freedom 
of expression, including gains in respect for the right to information and considerable 
growth in access to the Internet; 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> that at the same time enormous challenges still exist in giving full effect 
to the right to freedom of expression, including restrictive legal regimes, commercial and 
social pressures, and a lack of tolerance of criticism on the part of the powerful; 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that some of the historic challenges to freedom of expression have still not 
been addressed successfully, while new challenges have arisen due to technological, social 
and political developments; 
</p>
<p><i> Aware of</i> the enormous potential of the Internet as a tool for realizing the right to 
freedom of expression and to information; 
</p>
<p><i> Cognizant </i>of the efforts by some governments to restrict the Internet, as well as the 
failure to recognize the unique nature of this medium, and emphasizing the need to respect 
freedom of expression and other human rights in any efforts to apply legal rules to it; 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that, while the last 10 years have witnessed impressive growth in global 
efforts to protect and promote freedom of expression, far more attention needs to be 
devoted to this effort, by governments and other official actors, by human rights and other 
civil society organizations, and in international cooperation; 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the impressive development of international standards regarding the 
promotion and protection of freedom of expression over the last 10 years by international 
bodies and civil society actors;  
</p>
<p><i> Adopt</i>, on 3 February 2010, the following Declaration on Ten Key Threats to 
Freedom of Expression: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> GE.10-12534 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Mechanisms of government control over the media 
</b></p>
<p> Government control over the media, a historic limitation on freedom of expression, 
continues to be a serious problem. Such control takes many forms, but we are particularly 
concerned about: 
</p>
<p> (a) Political influence or control over public media, so that they serve as 
government mouthpieces instead of as independent bodies operating in the public interest; 
</p>
<p> (b) Registration requirements for the print media or to use or access the Internet; 
 (c) Direct government control over licensing or regulation of broadcasters, or 
oversight of these processes by a body which is not independent of government, either in 
law or in practice; 
</p>
<p> (d) The abuse of State advertising or other State powers to influence editorial 
policy; 
</p>
<p> (e) Ownership or significant control of the media by political leaders or parties; 
 (f) Politically motivated legal cases being brought against the independent 
media; 
</p>
<p> (g) The retention of antiquated legal rules &#8212; such as sedition laws or rules 
against publishing false news &#8212; which penalize criticism of government. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Criminal defamation 
</b></p>
<p> Laws making it a crime to defame, insult, slander or libel someone or something, 
still in place in most countries (some 10 countries have fully decriminalized defamation), 
represent another traditional threat to freedom of expression. While all criminal defamation 
laws are problematical, we are particularly concerned about the following features of these 
laws: 
</p>
<p> (a) The failure of many laws to require the plaintiff to prove key elements of the 
offence such as falsity and malice; 
</p>
<p> (b) Laws which penalize true statements, accurate reporting of the statements of 
official bodies, or statements of opinion; 
</p>
<p> (c) The protection of the reputation of public bodies, of State symbols or flags, 
or the State itself; 
</p>
<p> (d) A failure to require public officials and figures to tolerate a greater degree of 
criticism than ordinary citizens; 
</p>
<p> (e) The protection of beliefs, schools of thought, ideologies, religions, religious 
symbols or ideas; 
</p>
<p> (f) Use of the notion of group defamation to penalize speech beyond the narrow 
scope of incitement to hatred; 
</p>
<p> (g) Unduly harsh sanctions such as imprisonment, suspended sentences, loss of 
civil rights, including the right to practise journalism, and excessive fines. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Violence against journalists 
</b> Violence against journalists remains a very serious threat with more politically 
motivated killings of journalists in 2009 than in any other year in the past decade. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12534 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Particularly at risk are journalists reporting on social problems, including organized crime 
or drug trafficking, voicing criticism of government or the powerful, reporting on human 
rights violations or corruption, or reporting from conflict zones. Recognizing that impunity 
generates more violence, we are particularly concerned about: 
</p>
<p> (a) A failure to allocate sufficient attention and resources to preventing such 
attacks and to investigating them and bringing those responsible to justice when they do 
occur; 
</p>
<p> (b) The lack of recognition that special measures are needed to address these 
attacks, which represent not only an attack on the victim but also an attack on everyone&#8217;s 
right to receive information and ideas; 
</p>
<p> (c) The absence of measures of protection for journalists who have been 
displaced by such attacks. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Limits on the right to information 
</b></p>
<p> Over the past 10 years, the right to information has been widely recognized as a 
fundamental human right, including by regional human rights courts and other authoritative 
bodies. Laws giving effect to this right have been passed in record numbers and this 
positive trend continues, with some 50 laws having been passed in the last 10 years. 
However, major challenges remain. We are particularly concerned about: 
 (a) The fact that a majority of States have still not adopted laws guaranteeing the 
right to information; 
</p>
<p> (b) The weak laws in place in many States; 
 (c) The massive challenge of implementing the right to information in practice; 
 (d) The lack of openness around elections, when the need for transparency is 
particularly high; 
</p>
<p> (e) The fact that many intergovernmental organizations have not given effect to 
the right to information in relation to the information they hold as public bodies; 
</p>
<p> (f) The application of secrecy laws to journalists and others who are not public 
officials, for example to impose liability for publishing or further disseminating information 
which has been leaked to them. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression 
</b> Equal enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression remains elusive and 
historically disadvantaged groups &#8212; including women, minorities, refugees, indigenous 
peoples and sexual minorities &#8212; continue to struggle to have their voices heard and to 
access information of relevance to them. We are particularly concerned about: 
</p>
<p> (a) Obstacles to the establishment of media by and for historically disadvantaged 
groups; 
</p>
<p> (b) The misuse of hate speech laws to prevent historically disadvantaged groups 
from engaging in legitimate debate about their problems and concerns; 
</p>
<p> (c) The lack of adequate self-regulatory measures to address: 
 (i) Underrepresentation of historically disadvantaged groups among mainstream 
</p>
<p>media workers, including in the public media; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-12534 
</p>
<p> (ii) Inadequate coverage by the media and others of issues of relevance to 
historically disadvantaged groups; 
</p>
<p> (iii) The prevalence of stereotypical or derogatory information about historically 
disadvantaged groups being disseminated in society. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Commercial pressures 
</b></p>
<p> A number of commercial pressures pose a threat to the ability of the media to 
disseminate public interest content, which is often costly to produce. We are particularly 
concerned about: 
</p>
<p> (a) Growing concentration of ownership of the media, with serious potential 
implications for content diversity; 
</p>
<p> (b) Fracturing of the advertising market, and other commercial pressures, leading 
to cost-cutting measures such as less local content, cheap, shallow entertainment and a 
decrease in investigative journalism; 
 (c) The risk that the benefits from the switchover to digital frequencies will go 
largely to existing broadcasters, and other uses such as telecommunications, to the 
detriment of greater diversity and access, and public interest media.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Support for public service and community broadcasters 
</b></p>
<p> Public service and community broadcasters can play a very important role in 
providing public interest programming and in supplementing the content provided by 
commercial broadcasters, thereby contributing to diversity and satisfying the public&#8217;s 
information needs. Both face challenges. We are particularly concerned about: 
</p>
<p> (a) The increasingly frequent challenges to public funding support for public 
broadcasters; 
</p>
<p> (b) The fact that many public broadcasters have not been given a clear public 
service mandate; 
</p>
<p> (c) The lack of specific legal recognition of the community broadcasting sector 
in licensing systems which are based on criteria that are appropriate to this sector; 
</p>
<p> (d) The failure to reserve adequate frequencies for community broadcasters or to 
establish appropriate funding support mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Security and freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p> The notion of national security has historically been abused to impose unduly broad 
limitations on freedom of expression, and this has become a particular problem in the 
aftermath of the attacks of September 2001, and renewed efforts to combat terrorism. We 
are particularly concerned about: 
</p>
<p> (a) Vague and/or overbroad definitions of key terms such as security and 
terrorism, as well as what is prohibited, such as providing communications support to 
terrorism or extremism, the &#8220;glorification&#8221; or &#8220;promotion&#8221; of terrorism or extremism, and 
the mere repetition of statements by terrorists; 
</p>
<p> (b) Abuse of vague terms to limit critical or offensive speech, including social 
protests, which do not constitute incitement to violence; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12534 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p> (c) Formal or informal pressures on the media not to report on terrorism, on the 
grounds that this may promote the objectives of terrorists; 
 (d) Expanded use of surveillance techniques and reduced oversight of 
surveillance operations, which exert a chilling effect on freedom of expression and 
undermine the right of journalists to protect their confidential sources. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Freedom of expression on the Internet 
</b></p>
<p> The significant potential of the Internet as a tool to promote the free flow of 
information and ideas has not been fully realized due to efforts by some governments to 
control or limit this medium. We are particularly concerned about: 
</p>
<p> (a) The fragmentation of the Internet through the imposition of firewalls and 
filters, as well as through registration requirements; 
</p>
<p> (b) State interventions, such as blocking of websites and web domains which 
give access to user-generated content or social networking, justified on social, historical or 
political grounds; 
</p>
<p> (c) The fact that some corporations which provide Internet searching, access, 
chat, publishing or other services fail to make a sufficient effort to respect the rights of 
those who use their services to access the Internet without interference, for example on 
political grounds; 
</p>
<p> (d) Jurisdictional rules which allow cases, particularly defamation cases, to be 
pursued anywhere, leading to a lowest common denominator approach.  
</p>
<p><b> 10. Access to information and communications technologies 
</b></p>
<p> While the Internet has provided over a billion people with unprecedented access to 
information and communications tools, the majority of the world&#8217;s citizens have no or 
limited access to the Internet. We are particularly concerned about: 
</p>
<p> (a) Pricing structures which render the poor unable to access the Internet; 
 (b) A failure to roll out connectivity the &#8220;last mile&#8221; or even further, leaving rural 
customers without access; 
</p>
<p> (c) Limited support for community-based ICT centres and other public access 
options; 
</p>
<p> (d) Inadequate training and education efforts, especially among poor, rural and 
elderly populations.
