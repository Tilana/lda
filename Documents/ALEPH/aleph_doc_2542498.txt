Item 4                     Summary Of Material Change
On October 16, 2005, Crew, Crew Acquisition Corp. (“Crew AC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Crew, and Guinor
entered into a support agreement (the “Support Agreement”) pursuant to which Crew AC agreed that, subject to the
terms and conditions of the Support Agreement, it will make an offer (the “Offer”) to acquire all of the issued and
outstanding common shares of Guinor (the “Shares”), including those Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of
outstanding options and broker warrants.
Item 5                     Full Description Of Material Change
On October 16, 2005, Crew, Crew AC, and Guinor entered into the Support Agreement. The Support Agreement
provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreement, Crew AC will make the
Offer to acquire all of the outstanding Shares and that Guinor will co-operate with Crew and take all reasonable action
to support the Offer.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Support Agreement, Crew AC is required to make the Offer within 15
business days from signing the Support Agreement.
Under the Offer, each holder of Shares will be offered C$1.50 in cash for each Share owned.  The Offer cannot be
extended beyond January 15, 2006.
The Support Agreement provides that the Offer is to be commenced by the mailing to Guinor shareholders of the
terms of the Offer by take-over bid circular with the Offer expiring no sooner than the 36th day, and no later than the
40th day, following the date of the mailing, unless varied, withdrawn or extended.
The take up of shares under the Offer is subject to certain conditions, including (1) that there has been validly
deposited under the Offer and not withdrawn at the expiration time of the Offer at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding
Shares (calculated on a fully diluted basis), (2) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by the Support Agreement, (3) subject to certain exceptions, that all required consents and approvals
have been received, (4) there has not been any change having a material adverse effect on Guinor, (5) subject to
certain exceptions, the representations and warranties of Guinor remain materially accurate, and (6) other customary
conditions. The required consents and approvals include approval by Crew’s shareholders of an increase in its
authorized capital and the approval of Crew’s existing convertible bondholders to additional borrowing by Crew. In this
regard, Crew has obtained written commitments from existing shareholders who hold approximately 53% of its
common shares to vote in favour of the authorized capital increase. Crew has also obtained written commitments
from 67% of Crew’s existing convertible bondholders to waive the prohibition on additional borrowing.
Crew AC may waive any condition of the Offer.  Crew AC may not, however, modify the minimum tender condition,
decrease the consideration payable, impose additional conditions to the Offer, or vary the Offer in a manner that it is
adverse to the holders of the Shares, without Guinor’s consent.
The Support Agreement contains certain termination rights for Guinor, Crew, and Crew AC and further provides that,
upon termination of the Support Agreement under specified circumstances, Guinor or Crew may be required to pay the
other party a termination payment of C$16 million or expense reimbursement payments of C$4 million.
Guinor is required to assist Crew AC in connection with any subsequent acquisition transaction that Crew AC may, in
its sole discretion, undertake to pursue, provided that the consideration per Share offered in such subsequent
acquisition transaction is at least equivalent in value to the consideration per Share offered under the Offer.
The Offer is fully financed. Crew has received private placement subscriptions for five-year senior unsecured
convertible bonds for an aggregate of US $150 million.  The bonds will have an annual coupon of 6% per annum and
will be convertible at the option of the holder into common shares of Crew at a conversion price of NOK 12.16 (C$
2.23) per common share. Crew has also received guarantees to subscribe for its common shares, on a private
placement basis, in the aggregate amount of US $150 million, which, together with the proceeds of the bond issues
and Crew’s existing cash reserves, will be sufficient to finance the transaction.
2
Crew is intending to undertake a broader placement of common shares by way of private placement offering of
subscription receipts in the range of approximately US $150-200 million that will be co-led be Pareto Securities Inc. of
Norway and Sprott Securities Inc. of Canada. Proceeds from the subscription receipts placement would replace the
US$ 150 million equity guarantees. Each of the guarantors who have provided the guarantees will be entitled to
subscribe for and be allotted common shares under the subscription receipt placement for amount equal to no less
than 75% of the amount of their guarantee commitment.
The foregoing description of the Support Agreement and the Offer does not purport to be complete and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the Support Agreement, which is attached as “Appendix A”.

Persons as are entitled to receive the Offer on behalf of the Offeror and to acting as depositary under the Offer.
Section 2.8            Subsequent Acquisition Transaction
If, within 120 days after the date of the Offer, the Offer has been accepted by holders of not less than 90% of the
outstanding Shares (other than any Shares held at the date of the Offer by or on behalf of the Offeror or an affiliate or
associate of the Offeror, as those terms are defined under the YBCA), the Offeror shall use its reasonable best
efforts, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to acquire the remainder of the Shares from those Target
Shareholders who have not accepted the Offer pursuant to a Compulsory Acquisition at the same price as in the
Offer. If that statutory right of acquisition is not available, the Offeror may pursue other means of acquiring the
remaining Shares not tendered to the Offer.  If the Offeror takes up and pays for Shares under the Offer representing
at least 66-2/3% of the Shares (on a fully-diluted basis), the Target agrees to cooperate with the Offeror and to use its
reasonable best efforts to enable the Offeror to acquire the remaining Shares by way of amalgamation, statutory
arrangement, capital reorganization or other transaction involving the Target and the Offeror (a “Subsequent
Acquisition Transaction”), provided that the consideration offered in connection with the Subsequent Acquisition
Transaction is at least equivalent in value to the consideration offered under the Offer.

incorporated under applicable law, is validly existing and has the corporate power and
authority to own its properties and assets and conduct its businesses as currently owned
and conducted, and is duly licensed, registered and qualified to carry on business in each
jurisdiction in which the character of its properties or the nature of its activities making

qualified would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect in respect of the Target.
(b)           Authority; No Conflict.  The Target has the requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.  The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Target and the consummation by the
Target of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by
the Board and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Target are necessary to

obligation of the Target, enforceable against the Target in accordance with its terms

Agreement and the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby will not:
(i)            result in a violation or breach or require any consent to be obtained or give rise to any termination
rights or other adverse consequences under any provision of:
(A)          the Target’s or any of the Target Subsidiaries’ Charter Documents;
11

bound or is subject or is the beneficiary;
(ii)           give rise to any right of termination, acceleration of indebtedness or constitute a default (or constitute
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would give rise to any right of termination, acceleration of
indebtedness or constitute a default), or cause any third party indebtedness owed by the Target or any Target
Subsidiaries to come due before its stated maturity or cause any of their available credit to cease to be
available;
(iii)          result in the imposition of any Encumbrance upon any assets of the Target or any Target
Subsidiaries, or restrict, hinder, impair or limit the ability of the Target or any Target Subsidiaries to carry on
the business of the Target or any Target Subsidiaries as and where it is now being carried on or as and where
it may be carried on in the future which would, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse
Effect in respect of the Target; or
(iv)          result in any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any contract, agreement or licence,
franchise or permit to which the Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries is bound or is subject or is the
beneficiary.
(c)           Consents and Approvals.  The execution and delivery by the Target of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Target Subsidiaries nor require any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations to be obtained by the Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries from any
Governmental Entity.
(d)           Compliance.  The Target and each of the Target Subsidiaries is in compliance with
its Charter Documents and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, certificates,
orders, injunctions, arbitral awards, grants, regulations and other authorizations of any
Governmental Entity, except where the failure to be in compliance would not, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect in respect of the Target.
(e)           Target Support for the Offer.
(i)            the Board, upon consultation with its legal and financial advisors, has unanimously determined that
the Offer is in the best interests of the Target, is fair to the Target Shareholders and has unanimously
approved the Offer, and has unanimously passed a
12
resolution to recommend that Target Shareholders accept the Offer; and
(ii)           after reasonable inquiry, the Target and the Board has been advised and believes that each of the
directors and senior officers of the Target intends to tender their Shares, including (x) the Shares of which he
is the beneficial owner, and (y) the Shares issuable on the exercise of all Target Options held by them, to the
Offer.
(f)            Target Subsidiaries.  The Target does not have any interests, direct or indirect, in
any Person other than in its five subsidiaries: (i) Kenor A.S. (the Target directly owns 100%
of the shares outstanding of Kenor A.S.), (ii) Delta Gold Mining Ltd. (the Target indirectly
owns 100% of the shares outstanding of Delta Gold Mining Ltd.), (iii) Goldex A.S. (the

equity ownership interests in Delta Gold Mining Ltd., Goldex A.S. and Scanor A.S. and

authority to own its assets and conduct its business as now owned and conducted by it
and is duly qualified to carry on business in each jurisdiction in which the character of its
properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a
Material Adverse Effect in respect of the Target. All of the outstanding shares or other
equity interests in the capital of each of the Target Subsidiaries that is a corporation are
validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable and all such shares or other equity interests
are owned free and clear of all Encumbrances, and there are no outstanding options,

13
complete copy of each Permit.  The Target and the Target Subsidiaries hold either mining leases, mining
concessions, mining claims, exploration permits or prospecting permits or other property or proprietary
interests or rights, recognized in the jurisdiction in which a particular Material Property is located, in respect
of the ore bodies and minerals located in the Material Gold Properties in which the Target or a Target
Subsidiary has an interest under valid, subsisting and enforceable title documents or other recognized and
enforceable agreements or instruments, sufficient to permit the Target or the applicable Target Subsidiary to
explore for and, in the case of the Dinguiraye Concession, extract the minerals relating thereto, free and clear
of all title defect or Encumbrance, except for such defects in title or Encumbrance that would, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect in respect of the Target.  All Material Gold Property
leases or claims and Permits in which the Target or any Target Subsidiary has an interest or right have been
validly located and recorded in accordance with all applicable laws; the Target and the Target Subsidiaries
have all necessary surface rights, access rights and other necessary rights and interests relating to the
Material Gold Properties in which the Target and the Target Subsidiaries have an interest granting the Target
or the applicable Target Subsidiary the right and ability to explore for minerals, ore and metals for
development purposes as are appropriate in view of the rights and interest therein of the Target or the
applicable Target Subsidiary, with only such exceptions as do not materially interfere with the use made by
the Target or the applicable Target Subsidiary of the rights or interests so held, and each of the property
interests or rights and each of the documents, agreements and instruments and obligations relating thereto
referred to above is currently in good standing in the name of the Target or a Target Subsidiary; and
(ii)           any and all of the Permits, agreements and other documents and instruments pursuant to which the
Target or any Target Subsidiary holds an interest in the Material Gold Properties are valid and subsisting
Permits, agreements, or documents in full force and effect, enforceable in accordance with terms thereof and

other than an aggregate of 975,000 Target Options and an aggregate of 1,681,000 Target Broker Warrants to
acquire an aggregate of 2,656,000 Target Shares which are issued and outstanding, no Person has any

agreement for the purchase, acquisition, subscription for or issue of any of the unissued shares or other
securities of the Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries.  There are no outstanding bonds, debentures or
other evidences of indebtedness of the Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries having the right to vote with

22
(i)            result in a violation or breach or except for Required Consents and Approvals of Parent and Offeror,

under any provision of:

to come due before its stated maturity or cause any of their available credit to cease to be available; or

Documents and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, certificates, orders,
injunctions, arbitral awards, grants, regulations and other authorizations of any
Governmental Entity, except where the failure to be in compliance would not, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect in respect of the Parent.

ensure that the required funds will be available to effect payment in full for the Shares
acquired pursuant to the Offer.  The Parent has received binding and enforceable

favour of waiving the threshold for additional borrowings in connection with the Parent’s
proposed bond offering to finance the Offer.
(i)            Commitments from Parent Shareholders.  Parent has received binding
commitments from holders of Parent Shares owning in aggregate, more than 53% of the
Parent Shares outstanding, by which such shareholders have agreed to vote the Parent
Shares owned by them in favour of any resolution required to be approved by holders of
the Parent Shares in order to give effect to the Offer.

Target or the Parent which shall prevent the taking up or paying for Shares
deposited under the Offer, the consummation of the Offer, or the
completion of any Compulsory Acquisition or Subsequent Acquisition
Transaction.  No act, action, suit or proceeding shall have been taken or
threatened before or by any domestic or foreign court or tribunal or
Governmental Entity (i) seeking to prohibit or restrict the acquisition by the
Parent or the Offeror, directly or indirectly, of any Shares,
34
(ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Offer or the completion of any Compulsory
Acquisition or Subsequent Acquisition Transaction, (iii) seeking to obtain from the Parent, Offeror or the
Target any material damages directly or indirectly in connection with the Offer or any Compulsory Acquisition
or Subsequent Acquisition Transaction, (iv) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of the Parent or
Offeror to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, directly or indirectly, any Shares, or
(v) which, if successful, in the judgment of the Offeror, acting reasonably, is likely to constitute a Material
Adverse Effect in respect of the Target or the Parent.
(5)           All representations and warranties of the Target qualified by
references to materiality or to Material Adverse Effect shall be true and
correct, and (ii) all representations and warranties not qualified by
materiality or to Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all
material respects, and in either case, as if made on and as of the Effective
Date (except for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific
date which shall speak of that date only) and the Offeror and the Parent
shall have received a certificate of the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of the Target (in each case without personal liability)
addressed to the Offeror and the Parent and dated as of the Effective Date
confirming the same.
(6)           The Target shall have complied in all material respects with all
covenants that are to be complied with at or before the Effective Date, and
the Offeror and the Parent shall have received a certificate of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of the Target (in each case
without personal liability) addressed to the Offeror and the Parent and
dated as of the Effective Date confirming the same.
(7)           The Board shall not have withdrawn any recommendation made by it
that Target Shareholders accept the Offer and shall not have issued a
recommendation in a manner that has substantially the same effect except
in the circumstances set out in Section 6.4.
(8)           The obligations of the Offeror and the Parent hereunder shall not
have been terminated pursuant to Article 7 hereof.
The foregoing conditions will be for the sole benefit of the Offeror and may be asserted by the Offeror regardless of
the circumstances (including any action or inaction by the Offeror or any of its affiliates) giving rise to any such
condition. The Offeror may, in the Offeror’s sole discretion, waive any of the foregoing conditions, in whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time, both before and after the Effective Date, without prejudice to any other rights which
the Offeror may have. The failure by the Offeror at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed
to be a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed to be an ongoing right which may be assessed
at any time and from time to time.
35
ARTICLE 6
ACQUISITION PROPOSALS, NON-SOLICITATION, ETC.
Section 6.1            No solicitation, etc.
Subject to this Article 6, the Target agrees:
(1)           not to, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
representative or agent of the Target or any of the Target Subsidiaries,
solicit, initiate, invite or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by
way of furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement,
arrangement or understanding) the initiation of or participate in any
inquiries, proposals or offers regarding an Acquisition Proposal;
(2)           not to participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal;
(3)           not to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Offeror the
unanimous recommendation by the Board of the Offer contemplated
hereby;
(4)           not to accept or approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
enter into any agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal;
(5)           to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
solicitations, encouragements, activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Person, any of its subsidiaries or any of their representatives or
agents (other than the Offeror and the Parent) with respect to any potential
Acquisition Proposal whether or not initiated by the Target;
(6)           not to release or permit the release of any third party from or waive
any confidentiality, non-solicitation or standstill agreement to which such
third party is a party; and
(7)           to immediately cease to provide any other party with access to non-
public information concerning the Target and the Target Subsidiaries and
request in accordance with the confidentiality agreement signed with such
parties, the return or destruction of all confidential information provided to
any third party that has entered into a confidentiality agreement with the
Target relating to any potential Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding this Section 6.1, nothing contained in this Section 6.1 or any other provision of this
Agreement shall prevent the Board from considering, participating in any discussions or negotiations or
providing non-public information in accordance with Section 6.3, to a Person who proposes an Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.1 after the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors and legal advisors that such Acquisition Proposal if consummated in
accordance with its actual or proposed terms, is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal.
36
Section 6.2            Notification of Acquisition Proposals
The Target shall promptly, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt, notify the Offeror, at first orally and then in
writing, of all Acquisition Proposals received by the Target or any amendments to the foregoing, or any request for
non-public information concerning the Target or any Target Subsidiary in connection with any potential Acquisition
Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the Target or any Target Subsidiary in connection with a
potential Acquisition Proposal, and shall provide the Offeror with (i) a copy of any written notice from any Person
informing it that such Person is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a copy of any
Acquisition Proposal (or any amendment thereto), and (iii) such other details of the Acquisition Proposal, such request
or such potential Acquisition Proposal as the Offeror may reasonably request including the identity of the Person
making such proposal or request, in each case promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, after it is received by the
Target or requested by the Offeror, as the case may be.
Section 6.3            Access to Information
(1)           If the Target receives a request for non-public information
concerning the Target and/or the Target Subsidiaries in connection with a
possible or actual Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties,
books or records of the Target and/or the Target Subsidiaries or any of
them from a Person who proposes an Acquisition Proposal and the Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and
legal advisors that such possible or actual Acquisition Proposal if
consummated in accordance with its actual or proposed terms, is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, then, and only in such
case, the Target may, subject to entering into, and providing the Offeror
with a copy of, a confidentiality agreement on substantially the same
terms as the Confidentiality Agreement and containing a standstill
provision substantially similar to that contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, provide such Person with access to such non-public
information, and subject to any restrictions in that regard contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Parent will be provided with a list of or
copies of the information and access to similar information as that
provided to such Person, except to the extent such information was
already provided or made available to the Parent.
(2)           The Target shall ensure that its officers, directors, representatives
and agents and the Target Subsidiaries and their officers and directors,
representatives and agents and any financial advisors or other advisors or
representatives retained by it are aware of the provisions of this
Section 6.3 and it shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 6.3 by
all such parties.
Section 6.4            Changes in Recommendation; Approval of
Superior Proposal
If the Target receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of Section 6.1 and which is reasonably
likely to constitute a Superior Proposal, the Target may only (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Offeror
the recommendation of the Board of the Offer; (ii) accept or approve or recommend such Acquisition Proposal or to
enter into any
37
agreement related to such Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with Article 7 if and
only if:
(1)           the Target has given written notice to the Offeror that there is a
Superior Proposal together with a copy of the Acquisition Proposal
document which has been determined and is reasonably likely to be a
Superior Proposal;
(2)           the Target has complied with Section 6.5; and
(3)           five Business Days shall have elapsed from the date the Offeror
received the notice referred to in Section 6.4(1).
Section 6.5            Right to Match
The Offeror may, but is not required to, during the five Business Day period provided for in Section 6.4(3), offer in
writing to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Offer and, if it does so, then the Board shall review any such
offer in good faith, in consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors and, if the Board:
(1)           determines that the Acquisition Proposal would thereby cease to be
a Superior Proposal, the Target will enter into an amendment to this
Agreement reflecting the offer by the Offeror to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Offer; or
(2)           continues to believe that the Acquisition Proposal would
nonetheless remain a Superior Proposal, the Target may, provided the
Target has paid to the Offeror the Termination Fee, take any of the actions
it is permitted to take under Section 6.4.
Section 6.6            Confirmation
The Target shall promptly reaffirm its recommendation of the Offer by press release after: (a) any Acquisition
Proposal which is determined by Target not to be a Superior Proposal is publicly announced or made; or (b) the
Offeror increases by a written notice to the Target the consideration offered under the Offer to match or better the
consideration offered under a Superior Proposal.
Section 6.7            Amendments to Acquisition Proposals
For greater certainty, any amendment of an Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of this Article 6.
