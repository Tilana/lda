<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 13 to 17 February 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, conducted a mission to Uruguay. 
The purpose of the mission was to assess the way in which the State implements the rights 
to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>2. The mandate holder would like to thank the Government of Uruguay for the 
invitation and the excellent cooperation demonstrated before, during and after the mission. 
The Special Rapporteur was honoured to be received by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, 
the Minister for Social Development, the Minister for Public Health, the Minister for 
Housing, Land Management and Environment, the Minister for Livestock, Agriculture and 
Fisheries and the Minister for Education and Culture. She also met with technical 
representatives of some of the aforementioned ministries. Meetings were also held with 
representatives of the National Parliament, the Regulatory Authority for Energy and Water 
Services (Unidad Reguladora de Servicios de Energ&#237;a y Agua, URSEA), service providers 
such as the State Sanitary Works (Obras Sanitarias del Estado, OSE) and the Municipality 
of Montevideo, United Nations agencies and funds, cooperation agencies and non-
governmental organizations, as well as with academics. The Special Rapporteur thanks the 
United Nations Country Team and the Resident Coordinator for their support to the 
mission. She was particularly grateful to meet with individuals who face challenges in their 
access to water and sanitation and thanks them for their openness and frankness in the 
dialogue with her. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited informal settlements in Montevideo, such as Malv&#237;n 
Norte, Casavalle, Borro and Casabo. She also visited other locations in the country, such as 
the regions of Maldonado and Canelones, as well as a wastewater treatment plant in Ciudad 
de la Costa and a drinking-water plant in Maldonado. During the visit, the Special 
Rapporteur also assessed the situation of the rights to water and sanitation of children in the 
Colonia Berro juvenile detention centre. 
</p>
<p>4. The key themes of the visit were the accessibility and affordability of water and 
sanitation for personal and domestic uses in all spheres of life. These included an analysis 
of homeless people, as well as people in detention centres, informal settlements and/or rural 
areas. The Special Rapporteur also devoted attention to possible impacts of large-
investment projects on water quantity and quality for present and future generations. 
Another theme was the importance of monitoring the implementation of the rights to water 
and sanitation, as well as accountability and access to effective remedies for cases of 
violations of these rights. 
</p>
<p>5. The population of Uruguay&#8212;over 3 million inhabitants&#8212;is mainly urban. 
Metropolitan Montevideo accounts for almost half of the country&#8217;s population, with about 
1.6 million inhabitants. Despite financial difficulties in the late 1990s and early 2000s, 
economic growth in Uruguay averaged 8.5 per cent in 2010.1 The country is on track to 
meet the Millennium Development Goals.2 Since the economic crisis that hit the country in 
2002, poverty and extreme poverty have been reduced. Poverty figures dropped from 29.6 
per cent in 2004 to 12.6 per cent in 2010, and extreme poverty was also reduced, from 4.6

<p>per cent in 2004 to 1.1 per cent in 2010.3 Net enrolment ratio in primary education was 99.5 
per cent in 2009. Regarding maternal health, the proportion of births attended by skilled 
health personnel was already 99.6 per cent in 1999.4 
</p>
<p>6. In terms of water supply and sanitation, the latest data indicate that 98.1 per cent of 
the population in urban areas has access to water, the rate for the city of Montevideo being 
99.6 per cent. In other locations with 5,000 inhabitants or more, the rate was 97.8 per cent, 
while in small locations it was 94.2 per cent.5 In urban areas, the percentage of households 
with access to a sewage system was 59.3 per cent (but not all are connected); the remaining 
40.7 per cent have access to sanitation through other means, such as cesspools or septic 
tanks. Sanitation coverage through a sewage system is broader in the city of Montevideo 
(85.7 per cent) than in areas with 5,000 or more inhabitants (46.9 per cent) or in smaller 
urban areas (21.8 per cent).6 
</p>
<p>7. Uruguay has one of the highest rates of access to safe drinking water in Latin 
America and the Caribbean and has also achieved considerable rates of access to sanitation. 
In Uruguay, a sewage system has traditionally been perceived as the ideal (if not the sole) 
solution as regards assuring access to sanitation. Despite the good results achieved in terms 
of use of improved sanitation facilities,7 a considerable part of the population is still not 
connected to the sewage system. The latest legal developments have recognized alternative 
forms of sanitation, however there remains an implementation gap, and the Special 
Rapporteur still encountered a perception that a sewage system is the ideal form of 
sanitation. 
</p>
<p>8. The legal framework regulating access to water and sanitation in the country is 
advanced. However, the existence of policy gaps hinders its implementation. The 
institutions in charge of monitoring and controlling compliance of this legal framework, 
namely, the National Water Directorate (Direcci&#243;n Nacional de Aguas&#8211;DINAGUA), the 
National Environment Directorate (Direcci&#243;n Nacional de Medio Ambiente&#8211;DINAMA) 
and URSEA do not have the human and financial resources necessary to implement their 
mandates, for instance, to ensure independent assessments of activities that can impair the 
enjoyment of the rights to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>9. Despite achievements in ensuring access to water and sanitation for the population 
as a whole, some sectors of the society remain left behind. The poorest in the country, 
people living in informal settlements, the homeless and people under the custody of the 
State, especially children and adolescents deprived of their liberty, still face several 
challenges regarding access to or the quality or affordability of services, impairing their 
enjoyment of these fundamental rights.

<p><b> II. Legal and institutional frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>10. Uruguay has ratified most core international human rights instruments.8 It has started 
the process for ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In the Inter-American System, Uruguay is party to 
the American Convention on Human Rights and to the Additional Protocol to the American 
Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(Protocol of San Salvador). These treaties do not make explicit reference to the human 
rights to water and sanitation,9 however, it is a precondition for the effective exercise of a 
number of other human rights, including the right to life, the prohibition of torture and other 
forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to an adequate standard of living, 
the right to health, the right to education, the right to adequate housing and the right to 
food. 
</p>
<p>11. The human right to safe drinking water and sanitation derives from the right to an 
adequate standard of living, which is protected under, inter alia, article 25 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, and article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights. In 2010, this right was also recognized by the General 
Assembly, in its resolution 64/292, which enjoyed the support of Uruguay, and by the 
Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/9, which was adopted without a vote. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the support of Uruguay for the adoption of such ground-
breaking resolutions. 
</p>
<p>12. Eight years before the adoption of the above-mentioned resolutions, the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights had defined the legal basis of the right to water as 
&#8213;entitl[ing] everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable 
water for personal and domestic uses. An adequate amount of safe water is necessary to 
prevent death from dehydration, to reduce the risk of water-related disease and to provide 
for consumption, cooking and personal and domestic hygienic requirements&#8214;.10 
</p>
<p>13. The same Committee also reaffirmed that &#8213;since sanitation is fundamental for 
human survival and to enabling humans to lead a life in dignity &#8230; the right to sanitation is 
an essential component of the right to an adequate standard of living, enshrined in article 11 
of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&#8214;.11 The Committee 
has further asserted that States must ensure that everyone, without discrimination, has 
</p>
<p>  
 8 The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  
</p>
<p> 9 Some explicit references to safe drinking water and sanitation are found in article 14 of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and article 24 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child.

</p>
<p>physical and affordable access to sanitation, &#8213;in all spheres of life, which is safe, hygienic, 
secure, socially and culturally acceptable, provides privacy and ensures dignity&#8214;.12 
</p>
<p>14. The rights to water and sanitation must be progressively realized to the maximum of 
available resources, meaning that a State must take concrete and targeted steps towards 
ensuring universal access to water and sanitation, prioritizing the poor and most vulnerable. 
Any retrogressive measure is presumed to be a violation of those human rights unless fully 
justified by the State.13 There must be opportunities for meaningful participation in 
decision-making, as well as transparency and access to information, and accountability 
mechanisms must be established to address cases in which these rights are violated. 
</p>
<p>15. Ratification of a human rights treaty and its incorporation into national law are not 
enough to ensure a practical implementation of international human rights law; the State 
must also review its domestic legislation in order to harmonize it with the treaties that have 
been ratified. The practical implementation of international human rights law is also related 
to knowledge and awareness-raising among legal professionals; it is therefore important to 
implement training programmes on human rights for legal professionals, on international 
human rights law in general, but especially on economic, social and cultural rights, such as 
the rights to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. Uruguay was the first country in the world to recognize the rights to safe drinking 
water and sanitation at the domestic level. The 1967 Constitution of Uruguay was amended 
in 2004 to recognize that access to safe drinking water and to sanitation constitute 
fundamental human rights.14 The Constitution also determines that the national policy on 
water and sanitation should afford priority to the provision of safe drinking water to the 
population (art. 47, para. 1 (c)) and that social grounds must prevail over economic grounds 
(art. 47, para. 1 (d)). The same article also establishes that civil society must participate at 
all levels of planning and control of water resources (art. 47, para. 1 (b)); and that those 
services will be provided exclusively and directly by State legal entities (art. 47, para. 3). 
The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that the Constitution provides a sound legal 
basis for guiding public action to comply with the obligations on the human rights to water 
and sanitation. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur notes the important role civil society 
played in promoting the referendum towards achieving this legal recognition. In the 2004 
referendum, 64.61 per cent of the population voted for the recognition of water and 
sanitation as human rights and for their exclusive provision by the State.15 
</p>
<p>17. The National Water Policy (Law No. 18.610 of 2009) establishes the basis for a 
national water law, which should build on concepts such as sustainability, integrated and 
decentralized management of water resources, efficiency in the use of resources, and social 
participation, among others. The National Water Policy provides for the creation of the 
National Water, Environment and Land Council (Consejo Nacional de Agua, Ambiente y 
Territorio), as part of the Ministry of Housing, Land Management and Environment, with

<p>the aim of developing a national water resources management plan and a comprehensive 
national plan for safe drinking water and sanitation. The Policy also creates regional water 
resource councils to discuss issues relating to water, such as promoting the development of 
regional water plans, as well as establishing watershed or aquifer commissions aimed at 
providing sustainability for the management of water resources at the local level and at 
managing possible problems relating to water uses, ensuring a broad representation of local 
actors with an active presence in the area concerned. 
</p>
<p>18. In regard to sanitation, the Law on mandatory connection to the sewage system 
(Law No. 18.840 of 2011) was recently adopted with the objective of connecting the 
households that are not connected to the sewage system. This law requires house owners 
and potential house buyers to connect their houses, within a one-year period, to the sewage 
system, when a sewage pipe is nearby. For those who do not have a sewage system close to 
their houses, a two-year period will be granted, starting from the installation of such sewage 
system by the State (art. 4). Failure to comply with this rule will be punished with fines 
until the connection to the sewage pipe is made (arts. 6 and 7). This law also determines 
that OSE or the Municipality of Montevideo might grant subsidies to the most vulnerable 
persons, provided that the Government ensures the adoption of the necessary regulations 
(art. 8, second paragraph); those regulations have not yet been adopted, impairing access by 
the most vulnerable to this service. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Ministry of Housing, Land Management and Environment is the authority 
responsible for formulating the national policy on water and sanitation. The Ministry carries 
out this function through DINAGUA, which oversees and regulates activities relating to 
water, regardless of its use. Furthermore, the Directorate grants permits for building dams, 
reservoirs and cesspools, and is responsible for the inventory of the country&#8217;s water 
resources. It also grants permits for digging water wells&#8212;both to individuals and 
companies. In her meeting with the Director of DINAGUA, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed that the Directorate does not charge fees foreseen in the law for granting permits 
to exploit water, not even when the permits are given to companies and regardless of the 
use given to such resource. She was surprised to learn this, as DINAGUA has complained 
about a general lack of financial and human resources to perform the tasks assigned to it, 
especially regarding oversight and monitoring. 
</p>
<p>20. Decree No. 78 of 2010 on universal access to sanitation16 establishes that 
DINAGUA is in charge of defining criteria for the identification of acceptable types of 
sanitation systems, and is also mandated to offer guidance to the municipalities in line with 
the national plan for drinking water and sanitation. DINAGUA is currently analysing 
alternative sanitation systems to be used in Uruguay. It is vital that it finalize this work so 
as to enable those without access to a sewer system in the country to have access to 
acceptable alternatives that comply with the normative content of the right to sanitation. 
</p>
<p>21. Despite an increase in human resources through a project financed by the Inter-
American Development Bank and the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Water and Sanitation 
in Latin America and the Caribbean, the current capacity of DINAGUA does not match its 
powers, especially in relation to oversight and monitoring. The project objectives are 
numerous, including the elaboration of the national plan for water resources; more human 
resources would be required in order to achieve them.

</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>22. DINAMA is part of the Ministry of Housing, Land Management and Environment. 
It was created in 1990 and has the mandate of developing, implementing, monitoring and 
evaluating plans to measure and assess the quality of environmental resources, such as 
water and air, as well as ecosystems, including protected and coastal areas. DINAMA is 
also mandated to assess environmental impact studies when companies wish to obtain 
licences for forestry, mining, agriculture or cattle breeding operations. However, according 
to the law, these studies are undertaken by the companies applying for the licence 
themselves. DINAMA then analyses the studies and considers them as the basis on which 
to issue the required licence. The Government itself has acknowledged17 that the limited 
human resource capacities of DINAMA do not match its needs, and the growing number of 
requests (up 29 per cent in 2011) hinders its capacity to analyse the environmental impact 
studies.  
</p>
<p>23. The Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries is responsible mainly for 
formulating and managing public policies relating to agriculture, agribusiness, livestock 
and fishing, and preserving renewable natural resources. Despite the economic importance 
of these commercial activities to the country, the Minister acknowledged their possible 
negative impacts. Hence, the Ministry is currently funding environmental impact studies to 
identify potential negative impacts that the existing afforested areas may have on the 
environment or people&#8217;s health, or that could endanger the enjoyment of the human right to 
water for present and future generations, with a view to minimizing such impacts. The 
results of these studies will help to inform how the Ministry should pursue its mandate of 
granting licences for afforestation. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commission of 
such studies; however, she notes that environmental impact studies on other activities, for 
example the use of irrigation or the building of dams and their present and future impact on 
the right to water, should also be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>24. The Ministry of Social Development is responsible for social policies; it implements 
programmes on social protection and provides information and advice on available 
programmes, particularly those relating to people living in poverty or extreme poverty. In 
terms of the realization of the right to water, the Ministry has the specific mandate to 
ascertain people&#8217;s eligibility for the social water tariff, which is then applied by OSE. The 
Ministry also identifies households or individuals that are eligible for other social 
programmes. An example of such a programme was the National Plan for Social 
Emergency Assistance (Plan de Atenci&#243;n Nacional a la Emergencia Social, PANES), which 
was implemented between 2005 and 2007 to provide solutions to families in the country 
who were living in poverty and extreme poverty. According to a briefing note by the World 
Bank, if the cash transfer programme (Ingreso Ciudadano), the main component of PANES, 
had not been implemented, both extreme poverty and poverty would have increased. The 
extreme poverty rate would likely have increased by 50 per cent in 2006, from 2.87 per cent 
to 4.27 per cent, and the poverty rate in 2006 would have been around 27.8 per cent, instead 
of 27.4 per cent.18 
</p>
<p>25. OSE is the State company, created in 1952 by the Government through Law No. 
11.907, responsible for supplying safe drinking water in Uruguay and sewerage services 
outside Montevideo. OSE is a decentralized company, independent but administratively 
part of the executive branch.

<p>26. In article 2 of Law No. 11.907, the Government established the tasks of OSE, which 
include the provision of sewerage services for the entire country with the exception of the 
Department of Montevideo (art. 2 (b)). However, recognizing the need for a more 
encompassing definition of sanitation, the President of the republic passed Decree No. 78 of 
2010 on universal access to sanitation, which defines sanitation in a broad sense, making it 
clear that different models of sanitation should be available and tailored to each context, in 
order to achieve universal access throughout the country. Article 6 of the decree also 
establishes that OSE is responsible for ensuring the treatment of waste water and excreta in 
the entire country, except in the Department of Montevideo.19 
</p>
<p>27. The mandate holder has defined sanitation, from a human rights perspective, as &#8213;a 
system for the collection, transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of human excreta and 
associated hygiene&#8214; (A/HRC/12/24, para. 63). A broader definition allows for the 
appropriate use of alternative models of sanitation and their incorporation into a 
comprehensive sanitation system, thus increasing access to and the quality of the services. 
It is vital to recognize that sanitation goes beyond access to the sewerage system. 
Furthermore, it is also crucial that alternatives to sewage comply with the normative 
content of the right to sanitation, by ensuring accessibility, availability, affordability, 
quality and cultural acceptability. 
</p>
<p>28. Sanitation services are provided by different actors. The Municipality of Montevideo 
is in charge of supplying sanitation services for the country&#8217;s metropolitan region. 
Municipalities (<i>intendencias</i>) are responsible for providing sanitation services in 
accordance with Law No. 9.515 of 1935 on Municipalities. In accordance with Law No. 
18.308 of 2008 on Land Management and Sustainable Development, sewage outlets must 
be connected to the local city system or to an alternate system that has passed a technical 
assessment carried out by the Ministry.  
</p>
<p>29. Uruguay also has a regulatory authority (URSEA) to oversee the water and 
sanitation sector and to protect the users of those services. However, the current capacities 
of URSEA are limited and do not meet its needs. Also, its monitoring capacities are limited 
to controlling the quality of the water provided by OSE and the treatment of wastewater 
produced through the sewage system; it has no competence over the treatment of the sludge 
extracted by vacuum trucks20, which must be deposited in treatment plants. Furthermore, 
due to resource limitations, URSEA monitors water quality only in areas having more than 
1,500 inhabitants. Although it receives complaints from consumers, the institution is not 
properly staffed to follow up on such complaints and to ensure compliance by OSE. The 
population in general is not aware of the role of URSEA in defending their rights and does 
not make use of the existing mechanisms for the protection of their rights. The Special 
Rapporteur also expressed concern about the institution&#8217;s independence for two reasons. 
First, its members are directly appointed by the political parties. Second, since its budget 
depends on allocations from Congress, it may restrain its assessment and limit potential 
calls for action or changes. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was informed that URSEA 
functions as an appeal body after users have complained to the service provider. Only if the 
service provider does not answer or gives an unsatisfactory answer do users have the option 
to complain to URSEA as an appeal body. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
of other countries where the regulator directly receives a copy of the users&#8217; complaints to 
the provider, as well as of the provider&#8217;s responses, and takes the initiative to follow up on 
the complaints, without putting the burden of appeal on the user. It is clear that for URSEA 
to exercise such powers, it would have to increase its human resources capacities.

<p>30. Accountability and access to effective remedies are essential, as providers and the 
State must be held accountable for deteriorating services, unmet performance standards, 
unjustified tariff increases, inadequate social policies or other breaches. To ensure 
accountability, roles and responsibilities have to be clearly designated and made 
transparent. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that despite the adoption 
of Law No. 18.446 by the Parliament, which created the National Human Rights Institution 
(Instituci&#243;n Nacional de Derechos Humanos), political parties had not reached an 
agreement on the appointment of the Institution&#8217;s members and its budget had not been 
approved by Congress. In May 2012, after her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
that members had been appointed to the Institution. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this 
important development. The Institution is mandated to monitor trends affecting the respect, 
protection and promotion of human rights, as well as the living conditions of those persons 
who face poverty and extreme poverty. Its mandate includes advocacy for possible legal 
and policy changes to ensure the harmonization of national legislation, regulations and 
practices with the international human rights instruments to which the State is a party, and 
their effective implementation. The Institution can also play an important role in easing 
access to judicial mechanisms, legal aid or other aspects of access to justice, in particular 
for those who are in a vulnerable situation. It can also follow up on the implementation of 
recommendations made to Uruguay by United Nations special procedures, including those 
contained in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The rights to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>31. In Uruguay, 93.4 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water21&#8212;one 
of the highest levels of access in Latin America and the Caribbean. Universal access to safe 
drinking water is the main priority of the National Water Policy (art. 14). 
</p>
<p>32. The population that still lacks access to safe drinking water lives mostly in rural 
areas throughout the country. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the OSE 
programme to supply safe drinking water in disperse rural communities (Programa de 
Abastecimiento de Agua Potable a Peque&#241;as Comunidades Rurales), which focuses on 
local schools in particular. About 1,100 schools in rural areas in the country are without 
access to water services; under the programme, OSE prioritized 355 schools in the poorest 
areas of the country. OSE trains schoolteachers on measuring water quality, which should 
be reported daily. OSE technicians visit to monitor the school water services and water 
quality approximately every two weeks. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in 2010, only 47.12 per cent of the water 
was invoiced; 52.80 per cent was unaccounted for, and not charged.22 Among some of the 
reasons why water is unaccounted for, OSE mentioned water leakages due to pipes that 
were in poor condition, but also illegal water connections. The Special Rapporteur was also 
informed that the price for sanitation services is based on the price paid for water, the 
sanitation fee corresponding to 60 per cent of the water bill. However, according to 
information received during the mission, the Municipality of Montevideo charges 100 per 
cent of the water expenses as the sanitation fee.

<p><b>A/HRC/21/42/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>34. Concerning sanitation, approximately 55.4 per cent of the households in the country 
have access to the sewerage system,23 however this indicator may not be an accurate 
reflection of the percentage of households that are actually connected to the system. The 
Government aims at expanding the sewerage system to cover other parts of the country, in 
particular the largest urban agglomerations, such as Montevideo, Ciudad de la Costa and 
Maldonado-Punta del Este. The Municipality of Montevideo, through its Urban Sanitation 
Plan,24 has expanded access to the sewage system to 91.92 per cent of the city&#8217;s population. 
This plan is aimed at serving 95 per cent of the population in Montevideo and 100 per cent 
of the urban areas by 2020. At the same time, OSE aims at expanding the sewerage system 
to other departments of the country through the National Sanitation Plan.25 
</p>
<p>35. At least 40 per cent of the population does not have access to the sewage system;26 
most use septic tanks.27 Decree No. 78 of 2010 on universal access to sanitation establishes, 
in its article 6, that OSE is responsible for ensuring the treatment of waste water and 
excreta. The Special Rapporteur was informed that OSE has started to purchase septic tank 
vacuum trucks, allowing municipalities to use them. During her visit, she was told that the 
trucks serving the municipalities are not sufficient to meet the demands. For instance, in the 
neighbourhood of Casabo, where approximately 100,000 people live, the vacuum trucks are 
available, but are broken down or out of service most of the time. Based on a preliminary 
calculation of the trucks&#8217; operating hours, taking into account the time needed to empty 
them, it would seem that their capacity remains significantly below the neighbourhoods&#8217; 
needs. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, for this reason, some families pay for a 
more expensive private service, while others have to empty the septic tanks themselves by 
hand because they cannot afford such costs. It was also reported that sometimes septic tanks 
do not get emptied properly and the waste simply leaches into the soil. 
</p>
<p>36. Furthermore, in Barrio el Borro, in Casavalle, where approximately 1,500 persons 
live, the Special Rapporteur met with people who did not have access to sanitation inside 
their houses or in their immediate vicinity. As a consequence, individuals were forced to 
either defecate in the open or to rely on the sanitation services of relatives or neighbours. In 
this settlement, those who had a toilet and a septic tank explained that once the septic tanks 
got full, they had to empty them by hand and with absolutely no protection gear. This 
situation does not respect the normative content of the human right to sanitation (quality- 
and safety-related aspects). As the Special Rapporteur has underscored in the past, 
sanitation facilities must be hygienically safe to use, which means that they must effectively 
prevent human, animal and insect contact with human excreta. Furthermore, manual 
emptying of pit latrines is unsafe, a source of disease, posing a significant threat to people&#8217;s 
health, and culturally unacceptable in many places, leading to the stigmatization of those 
burdened with this task; mechanized alternatives that effectively prevent direct contact with 
human excreta should be used (A/HRC/12/24, paras. 72-74). Moreover, the manual 
emptying of septic tanks might amount to degrading and inhuman treatment.

Eradication of Unhealthy Rural Housing, (Movimiento de Erradicaci&#243;n de la Vivienda

<p>Insalubre Rural, MEVIR), a programme for implementing a system aimed at ensuring 
access to adequate housing in rural areas. Created in 1967 (Law No. 13.640), MEVIR not 
only assists with the construction or restoration of housing, but also provides communities 
with necessary infrastructure, such as water, sanitation and electricity services. It also 
supports alternative sanitation systems. While the State funds 70 per cent of the 
implementation costs, beneficiaries cover the remaining expenses. Beneficiaries must 
contribute 96 hours of work per month during the construction or renovation of the house. 
According to information received, it usually takes 25 years to fully finance the project, 
depending on the situation of the family. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that 
special arrangements are foreseen, for example for single mothers to benefit from day care 
while they work on the project. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>38. The normative content of the rights to water and sanitation includes the dimension of 
affordability. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated that 
&#8213;water, and water facilities and services, must be affordable for all. The direct and indirect 
costs and charges associated with securing water must be affordable, and must not 
compromise or threaten the realization of other Covenant rights&#8214;.28 The provision of 
services includes the construction and maintenance of facilities, the treatment of water and 
the disposal of faecal matter. Affordability does not necessarily require services to be 
provided free of charge; however, when people are unable, for reasons beyond their control, 
to gain access to sanitation or water through their own means, the State has to find solutions 
for ensuring this access.29 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that in Uruguay a social tariff is applied 
for households that are connected to the formal water provider but that face difficulties in 
paying for such services. The social tariff is applicable for people benefiting from social 
programmes, for regularized settlements and for households identified as being in a position 
of socioeconomic vulnerability. This allows for a consumption of 15 m3 of water per month 
per household, for the price of 70.92 Uruguayan pesos (about US$ 3.50). In small villages 
throughout the country, the social tariff is managed with the participation of the community 
and is even lower (59.10 pesos per 15 m3). Besides the social tariff, all households 
consuming less than 15 m3 per month (which represents approximately 120 litres per person 
per day for a family of four), also benefit from a subsidized tariff. Finally, Uruguay also 
provides water free of charge in informal settlements in the country, which are not formally 
connected to OSE systems. 
</p>
<p>40. During her visit to Barrio Casabo, an informal settlement in Montevideo, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that some families were expecting to be connected to water and 
sanitation shortly, as their houses in the settlement were due to be regularized. However, 
some families expressed their concern that the services might not be affordable to them, 
because many of them are in the informal labour sector, and that even if they were eligible 
for the social tariff, the costs would still be too high. The families with whom the Special 
Rapporteur met said that their financial situation was such that they would not be able to 
cover their basic needs, including water and sanitation. For this reason, they might be 
forced to choose among different basic needs, for example giving priority to food, 
medicine, housing and clothing. This situation might lead some people to stop paying their

<p>water bills; in turn, their water and sanitation services may be cut by the service provider 
and they may resort to connecting themselves illegally to the water network. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned about the future affordability of water and sanitation services for 
persons who will soon be connected to the water and sewage networks and whose monthly 
income is barely sufficient to cover basic daily needs. These circumstances might impair 
these people&#8217;s access to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. People living in informal settlements 
</b></p>
<p>41. One of the immediate effects of the economic crisis in Uruguay between 1999 and 
2002 was an increase in the number of irregular settlements,30 particularly in Montevideo.31 
Some studies have revealed that increased land prices and high levels of unemployment or 
informal employment, among other causes, contributed to the increase in informal 
settlements, which are growing by about 10 per cent annually.32 This has led to a 
concentration of poverty, spatial segregation and social exclusion. About 11 per cent of the 
population in Montevideo lives in informal settlements, and the same situation is faced by 3 
per cent of the population elsewhere in the country. Overall, 6 per cent of the population&#8212;
195,772 people&#8212;live in informal settlements.33 
</p>
<p>42. The Government has deployed efforts to adopt programmes allowing people living 
in irregular settlements to have access to basic services such as sanitation and water. One of 
these is the Neighbourhood Improvement Programme (Programa de Mejoramiento de 
Barrios, PMB, formerly known as the Programa de Integraci&#243;n de Asentamientos 
Irregulares, PIAI). It provides basic infrastructure services, such as building or expanding 
supply networks for safe drinking water, sanitation systems, storm drains, among others; 
regularizes settlements; and grants titles of ownership to the residents. The programme also 
provides families with materials to improve sanitary conditions when needed. Furthermore, 
it relocates people to other houses, within or outside the settlement, under the following 
circumstances: regularization of the status of the settlement; pollution of the land and/or air; 
total or partial flooding; when the dwelling has no sanitation services; or when the house is 
located in a public area. The PMB can operate in the 51 per cent of existing informal 
settlements of the country considered &#8213;eligible settlements&#8214;34 and has so far intervened in 
112 irregular settlements, reaching 62,000 people. There are about 70,000 people living in 
eligible informal settlements where the PMB has not yet been implemented. During her 
visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the programme is targeted at the most 
vulnerable, based on criteria established through a preliminary social analysis.35 She 
observed that only those who are selected for assistance under the PMB receive information 
about the specific projects that will improve their houses or part of their infrastructure, 
while the remaining neighbouring households do not understand why they cannot benefit

<p>from the programme as well. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the potential 
negative aspects of not providing information to the entire neighbourhood. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur also visited Barrio Aquiles Lanza in Malv&#237;n Norte 
(Montevideo), an informal settlement where 280 families live. The settlement was built on 
private property and is affected by lead contamination. In this settlement, water has to be 
collected from a single water standpipe located at one extreme of the settlement. Living 
conditions, including intra-domiciliary access to water and sanitation, cannot be improved. 
In situations where a settlement occupies private property, the law forbids the installation of 
household water connections; the only option is the provision of a standpipe at the limits of 
the settlement, which becomes the only water source for the entire community. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that Law No. 18.308 of 2008, in its article 65, allows for the 
regularization of the right of possession or use of private lands where families have been 
living without the consent of the owner for at least five years.36 Since the period of five 
years is considered to have begun at the moment the Law entered into force, there will 
hopefully soon be cases where tenure is regularized and access to water and sanitation is 
improved. 
</p>
<p>44. In accordance with the normative content of the right to water defined in general 
comment No. 15 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right to 
water applies to everyone. No household should be denied the right to water on the grounds 
of their housing or land status (para. 16 (c)). The human right to water entitles everyone to 
sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and 
domestic uses. In the case of Malv&#237;n Norte, one standpipe is clearly not enough to allow 
280 families to enjoy their human right to water, in particular during winter, when they 
need to heat the water for personal use and to wash themselves. 
</p>
<p>45. In Malv&#237;n Norte access to sanitation was also very poor or non-existent, with 
residents resorting to defecating and urinating in latrines connected to septic tanks that were 
not in the best condition or simply using pots that were emptied into an open sewer in the 
neighbourhood. These solutions clearly do not meet the conditions of safety, quality or 
dignity.37 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Homeless people  
</b></p>
<p>46. According to information provided to the Special Rapporteur, there were 
approximately 1,800 people living in the streets in Uruguay, primarily in Montevideo. 
During her mission, the Special Rapporteur noted that there are not many public facilities 
that provide people who live in the streets with continuous access to water and sanitation. 
The Special Rapporteur was also informed that it is common practice for people living in 
the streets to use the toilet in local bars and restaurants, this access not corresponding to a 
right granted to homeless people, rather depending on the goodwill of the bar or restaurant 
owner. Homeless people have access to shelters during the night, where they can use water 
and sanitation facilities. However, shelters are open only during night hours, and due to the 
lack of other public installations for water and sanitation in the city, homeless people are

<p>left with no access to safe drinking water and sanitation on a continuous basis. States must 
ensure that everyone has physical and economic access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, 
which is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable, provides privacy and 
ensures dignity, without discrimination (A/HRC/12/24, para. 63). The same applies for safe 
drinking water.38 
</p>
<p><b> 3. State-run institutions: the case of Colonia Berro 
</b></p>
<p>47. States have the primary obligation to create an environment conducive to the 
realization of human rights, including the rights to water and sanitation for all without 
discrimination. In the case of State-run institutions, the legal obligations upon the State go 
beyond creating the conditions aimed at enabling people to exercise these human rights, 
and also oblige the State to ensure the fulfilment of these rights, for example for persons in 
detention. 
</p>
<p>48. In 2009, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, upon his mission to Uruguay, called attention to the conditions of 
detention in many facilities (see A/HRC/13/39/Add.2). In 2011, he issued a follow-up 
assessment, considering progress in implementing the conclusions and recommendations 
contained in his reports (A/HRC/19/61/Add.3). He noted with appreciation the 
establishment in Uruguay of three new centres for children and the qualitative improvement 
in nutrition, and urged the Government to continue taking steps aimed at improving the 
conditions of detention (ibid., pp. 511 ff). 
</p>
<p>49. According to one civil society organization active in Uruguay, many facilities face 
problems with sanitation, ventilation, temperature, lighting, shortages of beds and 
insufficient access to food and potable water.39 Thus, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
right to water and sanitation decided to follow up this matter and examine the conditions of 
detention of juveniles in relation to access to water, sanitation and hygiene at the Colonia 
Berro juvenile detention centre, run by the Institute for Children and Adolescents (Instituto 
del Ni&#241;o y Adolescente del Uruguay, INAU). According to information received from 
INAU, 252 children and adolescents aged 15 to 19 years were in detention at the time of the 
visit, even though the Colonia Berro has the capacity for only 161 children and adolescents. 
The Special Rapporteur visited two units of Colonia Berro. 
</p>
<p>50. In one building, where children and adolescents were held in a semi-open regime, 
there were no complaints about access to water or sanitation. The rooms were open and the 
children and adolescents could circulate freely inside the building and in the building&#8217;s 
courtyard, thus having free access to water and toilets. In the second building visited, the 
conditions of security were much stricter and the children and adolescents were locked in 
their rooms for 22 hours a day; they were allowed to go to the courtyard for one hour in the 
morning and one hour in the afternoon. There was an average of six children and 
adolescents per room, and the space available was clearly insufficient. Their access to the 
toilets was limited to obtaining authorization from the guards and passing two security 
controls, making the process long and impairing access to sanitation. The physical and 
hygiene conditions of the toilets were poor, and clearly did not meet human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>51. The issue of children&#8217;s rights to water and sanitation in detention facilities, such as 
in the case of Colonia Berro, is critical, as children in detention are under the direct 
responsibility of the State. Both rights are elements of the right to the highest attainable

<p>standard of physical and mental health as provided for in the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child (art. 24, para. 2 (c) and (e)). Due to its importance, the rights to water and 
sanitation of juveniles deprived of their liberty has also been explicitly recognized by the 
United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty.40 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Large-scale investment projects 
</b></p>
<p>52. As mentioned in paragraph 15 above, article 47, paragraph 1 (d), of the Constitution 
of Uruguay stipulates that the national policy on water and sanitation will be based on 
supplying safe drinking water to people, clarifying that social grounds must prevail over 
economic ones, as recognized by international human rights law. Montevideo and its 
suburban areas, with approximately 60 per cent of the country&#8217;s population, are supplied 
with safe drinking water from the reservoir formed by the Aguas Corrientes dam, located 
on the Santa Luc&#237;a river. The main cities in the country are supplied by surface water, while 
small and medium-sized cities are supplied by groundwater. 
</p>
<p>53. According to one study carried out in 2004, about 600,000 hectares of land in 
Uruguay (4 per cent of the surface of the country) was being used for agriculture. A large 
proportion of the total amount of water used in the country was devoted to monocultures, 
such as rice or soybean.41 Furthermore, the number of water points for irrigation has 
increased considerably during recent years, as has the number of reservoirs.42 As regards 
afforestation, some sources estimate that as many as 600,000 hectares may have been 
planted with eucalyptus and pine; concerns regarding the impact of this afforestion on water 
availability have been raised in some studies. These figures showed the increasing interest 
in exporting eucalyptus, pine and soybean. The Special Rapporteur was informed about the 
case in Cerro Alegre, Departament of Soriano, where a few years after eucalyptus 
plantations were established, all farmers&#8217; water wells dried up and the level of the river 
substantially decreased. Similar situations occurred in Paraje Pence, Department of

<p>54. The Special Rapporteur was also made aware during her visit that some livestock 
agribusinesses and large-scale projects were having negative impacts on water resources. 
Agrochemicals or faecal waste, mostly from pigs or cows, were discharged directly into 
water sources and were affecting the quality of the water, increasing the risks of various 
diseases. When it rains, the effluents leach into the ground or carry faecal matter to rivers, 
mobilizing the pollutants and mixing them with water polluting the rivers. According to 
information received, this was the situation in the Santa Luc&#237;a river basin&#8212;the main source 
of safe drinking water for people in the metropolitan area of Montevideo&#8212;due to dairy 
farms in San Jos&#233; and Canelones. In most cases, wells are also polluted, as the effluents

<p>penetrate the water table. The Municipality of Florida in the Department of Florida 
analysed water quality, and concluded that only 2 per cent of the wells were free of faecal 
coliforms. There is evidence that polluted water in rural areas is costly, not only in 
economic terms, but also in health terms. The Special Rapporteur received information and 
testimonies that in some areas, water is excessively chlorinated, possibly to counter the 
pollution. As a consequence, people who can afford other options do not drink tap water. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes to the Government of Uruguay that States must 
ensure the realization of the right to water, in a sustainable manner and without 
discrimination, for present and future generations.43 Taking into account that large-scale 
investment projects may impinge upon water availability, the State must take steps to 
prevent negative impacts, starting with the analysis of the impacts of such economic 
activities. The Government must consider the adoption of the national plan on water 
resources, including the assessment and verification of the availability of safe drinking 
water in the country. The Special Rapporteur also notes the need to carry out environmental 
impact studies to verify that specific economic activities do not affect people&#8217;s human 
rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. She notes that, currently, environmental impact 
studies are carried out by private companies and not by an independent actor; she urges the 
Government to ensure that DINAMA is allocated sufficient human and financial resources 
to independently monitor and assess the content and conclusions of such environmental 
impact studies. The Special Rapporteur also calls on the State to consider the creation of 
watershed or aquifer commissions. These commissions could benefit from active civil 
society participation, including in the discussion of issues and the development of regional 
plans, as it is stipulated in the National Water Policy. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The Special Rapporteur concludes that Uruguay has made important efforts in 
ensuring access to safe drinking water and sanitation for its population. The rates of 
</b></p>
<p><b>access in the country prove that State-owned companies can successfully promote the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of the rights to water and sanitation. Nevertheless, more efforts are needed 
</b></p>
<p><b>in order to reach certain groups that continue to be excluded, especially the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable. The State has demonstrated its willingness to tackle most challenges in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to progressively realize the human rights to water and sanitation, however some 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges remain. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Uruguay that acts of omission may amount to violations of human rights, including 
</b></p>
<p>the failure to take appropriate steps towards the full realization of everyone&#8217;s right to 
</p>
<p><b>water and sanitation. States are obliged to fulfil human rights as they relate to water 
</b></p>
<p><b>and sanitation by moving as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to safe, affordable and acceptable water and sanitation for all, in conditions of 
</b></p>
<p><b>dignity.  
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> Therefore, the mandate holder recommends that the State: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure the enjoyment of the rights to water and sanitation in all spheres 
</b></p>
<p><b>of life, including for people living in the street or in informal or rural settlements, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as in all public places, including juvenile detention centres. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur highlights the concluding observations adopted by the Committee on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the third and fourth periodic report of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Uruguay, in which the Committee called upon the State to strengthen its efforts to

<p><b>facilitate access to adequate housing and the provision of adequate sanitation services 
</b></p>
<p><b>(E/C.12/URY/CO/3-4, paras. 20, 21 and 22); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Fully guarantee the recognition of economic, social and cultural rights in 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic law, including by ensuring that these rights are justiciable in national courts, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and provide training on these rights for members of legal professions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Social and Cultural Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that the National Human Rights Institution receive adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>human and financial resources. While welcoming recent steps in establishing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>institution, namely the appointment of its members, the Special Rapporteur calls for 
</b></p>
<p><b>this institution to fulfil its mandate, in particular to monitor the enjoyment of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights in Uruguay, including economic, social and cultural rights, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>receive individual complaints; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Evaluate the extent to which people living in poverty face challenges in 
</b></p>
<p><b>relation to the affordability of water and sanitation services, ensuring adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue with them and increasing coordination among various stakeholders. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government should work in coordination with civil society organizations and donor 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies, if needed, towards the creation of a comprehensive social protection strategy 
</b></p>
<p><b>that goes beyond the current social safety net approach, focusing on an adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>standard of living and favourable conditions at work; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Adopt a comprehensive national plan on water and sanitation that 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees the rights to water and sanitation to all people in Uruguay by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Clearly designating the responsibilities of different actors at all levels, 
</b></p>
<p><b>with a view to ensuring the effective implementation of the legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies relating to water and sanitation and avoiding duplication of 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities and conflicting powers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Allocating sufficient human and financial resources to those institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordingly. This is particularly urgent in institutions, such as the National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Water Directorate (DINAGUA) or the National Environment Directorate 
</b></p>
<p><b>(DINAMA), that do not have sufficient human and financial resources to carry 
</b></p>
<p><b>out their mandate, which prevents them from discharging their functions 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Ensuring the meaningful participation of civil society in its design, 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation and control; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Guaranteeing a special focus on sanitation, seeking appropriate solutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>that ensure universal access and in compliance with the content of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution (art. 47) and Decree No. 78 of 2010. It is urgent that DINAGUA 
</b></p>
<p><b>define the criteria to determine which types of sanitation systems must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided in locations where a sewage system is not the best solution, while at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the same time informing municipalities and service providers about standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>for supplying such services; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure that large-scale investment projects do not cause negative 
</b></p>
<p><b>impacts on the quantity and quality of water for personal and domestic uses. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur urges the adoption of the national plan on water resources, with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular focus on monitoring the impact of large-scale investment projects on water 
</b></p>
<p><b>for personal and domestic uses, as well as on promoting the preservation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable use of water resources and the adequate management and disposal of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human excreta and wastewater; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/42/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Ensure that environmental impact assessment studies are undertaken 
</b></p>
<p><b>and/or monitored by actors acting independently from the companies providing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>services;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Strengthen the competencies of the Regulatory Authority for Energy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Water Services (URSEA) allowing it to monitor water and sanitation quality, prices 
</b></p>
<p><b>and access; to regulate service providers; to formulate and propose recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the harmonization of the law with the content of the right to water and sanitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to raise awareness about its role.
