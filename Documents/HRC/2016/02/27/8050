<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report has been prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, on behalf of the Secretary-General, pursuant to the 
Human Rights Council resolution 19/14, in which the Council requested the Secretary-
General to report to the Council at its twenty-second session on the implementation of the 
resolution. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/14, 
in which the Council called upon Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with relevant 
resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. 
The Council recalled in particular Security Council resolution 497 (1981), in which it 
decided, inter alia, that the decision of Israel to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
administration on the occupied Syrian Golan was null and void and without international 
legal effect, and demanded that Israel rescind forthwith its decision. The Human Rights 
Council also requested the Secretary-General to bring resolution 19/14 to the attention of all 
Governments, the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, international and 
regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations, to 
disseminate it as widely as possible, and to report thereon to the Council at its twenty-
second session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 19/14 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 20 September 2012, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed a note verbale to 
the Government of Israel referring to Human Rights Council resolution 19/14, requesting 
information on any steps taken or envisaged to be taken concerning the implementation of 
the said resolution. No reply was received.  
</p>
<p>3. Also on 20 September 2012, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, addressed 
a note verbale to all permanent missions in Geneva to draw their attention to resolution 
19/14 and to request the Governments of Member States to provide information on any 
steps taken or envisaged to be taken concerning the implementation of the relevant 
provisions of the resolution. The Permanent Missions of the Syrian Arab Republic and of 
Cuba responded by means of notes verbales, on 5 and 9 October 2012, respectively. 
</p>
<p>4. On 8 October 2012, OHCHR, on behalf of the Secretary-General, brought resolution 
19/14 to the attention of the competent United Nations organs, specialized agencies, 
international and regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian 
organizations, pursuant to the request of the Council made in the resolution. 
</p>
<p>5. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic stated that, despite 
repeated requests from the international community for the complete withdrawal of Israel 
from the Syrian Golan, Israel continued to occupy the territory, to pursue daily repressive 
practices against Syrians there and to persist in its &#8220;flagrant&#8221; violation of international laws 
and norms with impunity. It also stated that Israel continued to ignore the resolutions of the 
Security Council and the General Assembly, including such recent resolutions as Human 
Rights Council resolution 19/22 and General Assembly resolution 66/80. The Syrian Arab 
Republic pointed out that, after 45 years of Israeli occupation, and despite resolutions and 
demands from the international community, Israel continued undeterred its expansionist 
goals.  
</p>
<p>6. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic affirmed its desire 
to cooperate with the United Nations with a view to ending the occupation of the Syrian 
Golan and the other Arab territories. On the basis of that understanding, the Government 
added that United Nations resolutions continued to be the basis for a just and 
comprehensive settlement of the problems in the Middle East. President Bashar Al-Assad 
had declared, on more than one occasion, the willingness of the Syrian Arab Republic to 
resume peace negotiations on the same basis as that on which the Madrid peace process had </p>


<p>started in 1991. Furthermore, the Syrian Arab Republic had declared, in all international 
forums, its full commitment to the relevant international resolutions and had called for their 
implementation, particularly Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 497 
(1981), as well as for the implementation of the principle of land for peace, in order to 
ensure full withdrawal by Israel from all of the occupied Syrian Golan to the line of 4 June 
</p><p>1967. 
</p>
<p>7. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic deplored 
construction by Israel of a separation wall, which will be four kilometres long and eight 
metres high near the ceasefire line, opposite the occupied village of Majdal Shams, on the 
pretext that the wall would prevent Palestinians and Syrians from crossing the ceasefire line 
and entering the village. Within this context, the Government referred to the killing and 
injury of peaceful demonstrators by Israeli soldiers during the commemoration of <i>Nakba</i> on 
15 May 2011, near the ceasefire line with the occupied Syrian Golan, as well as the 
commemoration of <i>Naksa</i> on 5 June 2011 on the Syrian side of the ceasefire line. Both 
incidents were detailed in the report of the Secretary-General to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/19/46). 
</p>
<p>8.  In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic referred to Human 
Rights Council resolution 19/14, in which the Council expressed deep concern about the 
findings included in the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 
Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied 
Territories, deplored the Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories, and expressed 
regret at the constant refusal of Israel to cooperate with and to receive the Special 
Committee. The Government also condemned the campaigns conducted by Israel to 
promote settlement building in the occupied Syrian Golan, the latest of being the &#8220;Come to 
Golan&#8221; campaign in December 2010, aimed at bringing more Israeli settler families to the 
occupied Syrian Golan. The Government also condemned the establishment of a new site 
for Israeli tourism near the settlement of It&#8217;am, and the development of &#8220;tourist cities&#8221; in 
the al-Batiha region, particularly in the area of Tal Sayadin on the eastern shore of Lake 
Tiberias. It reiterated its condemnation of the organization of tourist trips by global Jewish 
organizations to the occupied Syrian Golan, the promotion of settlements and the 
development of infrastructure to service those settlements. The Government noted that such 
actions clearly demonstrated Israel&#8217;s disregard for peace and the decisions of the Security 
Council and the General Assembly, such as General Assembly resolution 66/80, in which 
the Assembly called on Israel to desist from changing the physical character, demographic 
composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, in 
particular to desist from the establishment of settlements. 
</p>
<p>9. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic condemned all Israeli practices and 
conduct in the occupied Syrian Golan, which constituted &#8220;flagrant violations&#8221; of Security 
Council resolution 497 (1981) and General Assembly resolution 66/225. The Government 
referred to recent Israeli media reports, in the newspapers <i>Maariv</i> and <i>Calcalist</i>, of Israel&#8217;s 
intention to establish and expand a wind farm in the occupied Syrian Golan. The 
Government affirmed that the project was being carried out in cooperation with Israeli and 
foreign companies, namely Mei Golan, Multimatrix and the United States-based 
corporation AES, and urged Member States to refuse to import natural and manufactured 
products from the occupied territories, in accordance with their obligations under 
international law, and to reaffirm the need for Israel to respect international law.  
</p>
<p>10. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic also deplored the 
fact that, in March 2012, Israel had prevented Syrian farmers from transporting their crop 
from the occupied Golan to other parts of the Syrian Arab Republic, in violation of the 
agreement between the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Israel. 
According to the Government , such arbitrary denial of passage had caused considerable </p>


<p>material losses to the Syrian farmers, who were unable to find an alternative market for 
their crop. The Government called on the Secretary-General to intervene in order to ensure 
that Israel respected its agreement with ICRC and the non-recurrence of such unjustified 
action. The Government repeated its condemnation of the fact that, in December 2010, 
Israel had confiscated water sources from the occupied Syrian Golan and allocated water 
exclusively to Israeli settlers, resulting in financial losses amounting to more than $20 
million for Syrians in the Golan, whose livelihood depends on farming and fishing, and 
would result in an economic and environmental catastrophe in the area. The Government 
believes that this was a deliberate violation of the human rights of Syrians and constituted a 
violation of the seventh preambular paragraph of Security Council resolution 465 (1980), in 
which the Council took into account the need for measures to ensure the protection of 
important natural resources of the territories under occupation, including water. According 
to the Government, it also violated paragraph 5 of the same resolution, in which the Council 
determined that all measures taken by Israel to change the physical character, demographic 
composition, institutional structure or status of Arab territories occupied since 1967 were 
null and void and with no legal validity. Referring to international law and the United 
Nations, the Government called on the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Human 
Rights Council and the international community to prevent Israel from continuing its 
violations, including looting natural resources from the occupied Golan and other Arab 
territories.  
</p>
<p>11. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirmed its 
rejection of the decision made by the Knesset on 22 October 2010 to mandate a referendum 
on any agreement that would lead to the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Golan and 
East Jerusalem, and requiring the support of more than 80 per cent of Israelis for any such 
withdrawal. It noted that the motion was a violation of and reflected contempt for 
international law, which stipulates that territory may not be acquired by force, and was also 
incompatible with Security Council resolution 497 (1981). 
</p>
<p>12. In its note verbale, the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirmed the 
request it had made to the Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly, the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the President of the Human Rights 
Council and the President of ICRC to put pressure on Israel to ensure that Syrian prisoners 
detained in its jails were kept in humane conditions. It also rejected the trials of Syrians by 
Israel on 14 July 2010: Majed Shaer, who was sentenced to five and a half years in prison, 
and his son Fidaa, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for establishing 
contact with their motherland. The Government expressed concern at the increasing number 
of cases of abduction of Syrian farmers and shepherds by Israel, including children, from 
the Syrian side of the ceasefire line, and condemned and rejected all these practices. The 
Government referred to other violations that were reported to the Human Rights Council at 
its twelfth and thirteenth sessions, as seen in the reports of the Secretary-General 
(A/HRC/13/52 and A/HRC/16/25). 
</p>
<p>13. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirmed the need to pressure Israel 
to respect paragraph 4 of Human Rights Council resolution 19/14, in which the Council 
called upon Israel to allow the Syrian population of the occupied Syrian Golan to visit their 
families and relatives in their motherland through the Quneitra crossing, and to rescind its 
decision barring these visits. The Government referred to the decision of Israel to deny the 
passage of a Syrian delegation of religious leaders from the occupied Syrian Golan to other 
parts of the Syrian Arab Republic to attend the funeral of Ahmed Alhijry.1 The Government 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic did not provide any further details on the deceased in 
</p>
<p>its note verbale. </p>


<p>stressed the material, psychological and physical suffering of Syrians as a result of Israel&#8217;s 
arbitrary practices, which violated the Geneva Conventions and customary international 
humanitarian law. The Government stressed that Israeli practices in the occupied Syrian 
Golan exceed all legal and moral boundaries.  
</p>
<p>14. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic concluded by stating that reaching 
sustainable peace and stability in the Middle East would require the adoption of measures 
ensuring the enforcement of all relevant international resolutions, including those of the 
Human Rights Council, without discrimination or selectivity, as well as the implementation 
of the Geneva Conventions.  
</p>
<p>15. On 9 October 2012, the Permanent Mission of Cuba reaffirmed in its note verbale 
that the acquisition of territory by force was inadmissible under international law and the 
Charter of the United Nations, and also referred to the applicability of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention in the occupied Syrian Golan. The Government placed great importance on the 
efforts made within the framework of the United Nations to bring the occupation by Israel 
of the Syrian Golan to an end. In its view, Israel continued to violate the human rights of 
Syrians, including the right to health, in blatant disregard of its obligation as the occupying 
Power. Israel had to comply with the resolutions adopted by the World Health 
Organization, the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council 
regarding the occupied Syrian Golan, and had to withdraw from this area. The Government 
expressed concern about information relating to the construction by Israel of a wall in the 
occupied Syrian Golan, from Majdal Shams in the north to Al-Hammi in the south. In this 
context, the Government of Cuba considered null and without juridical validity or effect all 
legislative, administrative and other actions that Israel had undertaken or could undertake 
aiming at modifying the legal status, the physical character and the demographic 
composition of the occupied Syrian Golan, as well as any measures taken by Israel to apply 
its jurisdiction and administration in this area. Furthermore, the Government of Cuba 
condemned the &#8220;brutal practices&#8221; used by Israel against prisoners connected with the 
occupation, and repeated its serious concern regarding the inhumane conditions of 
detention of Syrians held in the occupied Syrian Golan, which led to the deterioration of 
their physical health and put their lives in danger, in obvious violation of international 
humanitarian law. The Government demanded that Israel comply, immediately and without 
conditions, with the Fourth Geneva Convention and apply it with respect to Syrian 
detainees. The Government reiterated the inalienable right of the Syrian Arab Republic to 
the occupied Syrian Golan, and demanded the unconditional withdrawal of Israel from it, as 
well as from all occupied Arab territories.
