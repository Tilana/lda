</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the reports of the Secretary-General on the rule of law and transitional 
justice in conflict and post-conflict societies,2 including relevant recommendations 
contained therein, the report of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;Uniting our strengths: 
Enhancing United Nations support for the rule of law&#8221;,3 which designates the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as the lead entity within the United 
Nations system on, inter alia, transitional justice, subsequent reports of the Secretary-
General on the rule of law,4 the report of the Secretary-General on enhancing mediation and 
its support activities,5 as well as the guidance note of the Secretary-General on the United

</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights

version of those principles,7 as well as the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers submitted to the Commission on Human Rights,8 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and 
its subsequent resolutions 1820 (2008) of 19 June 2008, 1888 (2009) of 30 September 
2009, 1889 (2009) of 5 October 2009 and 1960 (2010) of 16 December 2010 on women, 
peace and security, and reaffirming the important role of women in the prevention and 
resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding, and the need to increase their role in decision-
making with regard to conflict prevention and resolution, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the role of the Peacebuilding Commission in this regard, and recalling 
the necessity for the Commission to intensify its efforts, within its mandate, in cooperation 
with national and transitional Governments and in consultation with the relevant United 
Nations entities, to incorporate human rights, when advising on or proposing country-
specific peacebuilding strategies for post-conflict situations in cases under consideration, 
where applicable, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the role of the International Criminal Court in a multilateral system that 
aims to end impunity, establish the rule of law, promote and encourage respect for human 
rights and international humanitarian law and achieve sustainable peace, in accordance with 
international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the inclusion of a range of sexual violence offences in the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court and the statutes of the ad hoc international criminal 
tribunals, and also that rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute a war crime, a 
crime against humanity, or a constitutive act with respect to genocide, 
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming </i>the activities of the United Nations, including through its field presences, 
in assisting States to design, establish and implement transitional justice mechanisms and 
promote the rule of law, as well as its conceptual and analytical work on transitional justice 
and human rights, and encouraging greater efforts to ensure that a gender perspective and a 
victim-centred approach are integrated fully into all of these activities, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming also </i>the increased integration of a human rights perspective, including 
through activities of the Office of the High Commissioner in cooperation with other 
relevant parts of the United Nations system, in the United Nations activities related to 
transitional justice, as well as the importance given to the rule of law and transitional justice 
by the High Commissioner and her Office, including its Rule of Law and Democracy Unit, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>that the full range of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights 
should be taken into account in any transitional justice context in order to promote, inter 
alia, the rule of law and accountability, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Emphasizes </i>the importance of a comprehensive approach to transitional 
justice, incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, including, among 
others, individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, vetting of 
public employees and officials, or an appropriately conceived combination thereof, in order 
to, inter alia, ensure accountability, serve justice, provide remedies to victims, promote 
healing and reconciliation, establish independent oversight of the security system and 
restore confidence in the institutions of the State and promote the rule of law in accordance 
with human rights law; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Underlines </i>that, when designing a transitional justice strategy, the specific 
context of each situation has to be taken into account with a view to preventing the 
recurrence of crisis and future violations of human rights, and to ensure social cohesion, 
institution-building, ownership and inclusiveness at the national and local levels;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also underlines </i>that truth-seeking processes, such as truth and reconciliation 
commissions, that investigate patterns of past human rights violations and their causes and 
consequences are important tools that can complement judicial processes and that, when 
established, such mechanisms have to be designed within a specific societal context and to 
be founded on broad national consultations with the inclusion of victims and civil society, 
including non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Stresses </i>the need within a sustainable transitional justice strategy to develop 
national prosecutorial capacities that are based on a clear commitment to combat impunity, 
to take into account the victim&#8217;s perspective and to ensure compliance with human rights 
obligations concerning fair trials; 
</p>
<p>5.<i> Reaffirms </i>the responsibility of States to comply with their relevant 
obligations to prosecute those responsible for gross violations of human rights and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law constituting crimes under international law, 
with a view to end impunity; 
</p>
<p>6.<i> Calls upon </i>States, in particular, to comply with their obligations under 
applicable international law when prosecuting persons for gender-based and sexual 
violence, to ensure that all victims of such violence have equal access to justice, and 
stresses the importance of ending impunity for such acts as part of a comprehensive 
approach to seeking truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence; 
</p>
<p>7.<i> Notes with interest </i>the position of the Secretary-General that peace 
agreements endorsed by the United Nations can never permit amnesties for genocide, 
crimes against humanity, war crimes and gross violations of human rights; </p>


<p>8.<i> Reaffirms </i>that remedies for gross violations of international human rights law 
and serious violations of international humanitarian law include, as provided for under 
international law, the victim&#8217;s right to: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Equal and effective access to justice; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Adequate, effective and prompt reparation for harm suffered; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Access to relevant information concerning violations and reparation 
mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Emphasizes </i>that a human rights-based approach should be incorporated into 
vetting processes as part of institutional reform aiming at preventing the recurrence of 
human rights violations and building confidence in State institutions; 
</p>
<p>10<i>. Welcomes </i>the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on human rights and transitional justice,<footnote name="9">A/HRC/18/23. </footnote> taking note of the analysis of the 
relationship between disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and transitional justice, 
and stressing that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and transitional justice 
processes are interrelated and that coordination between the two efforts is essential to 
facilitate their coherence and mutual reinforcement; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Emphasizes </i>that justice, peace, democracy and development are mutually 
reinforcing imperatives; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Welcomes </i>the fact that a growing number of peace agreements contain 
provisions for transitional justice processes, such as truth-seeking, prosecution initiatives, 
reparations programmes and institutional reform, and do not provide for blanket amnesties; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Underlines </i>the importance and urgency of national and international efforts 
to end human rights violations, restore justice and the rule of law in conflict and post-
conflict situations and, where relevant, in the context of transitional processes; 
</p>
<p>14.<i> Stresses </i>the importance of a comprehensive process of national consultation, 
particularly with those affected by human rights violations, in contributing to a holistic 
transitional justice strategy that takes into account the particular circumstances of every 
situation and is in conformity with human rights; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Underlines </i>the importance of giving vulnerable groups, including those 
marginalized for political, socioeconomic or other reasons, a voice in these processes and to 
ensure that discrimination, the root causes of conflict, and violations of all human rights, 
including economic, social and cultural rights, are addressed; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Recognizes </i>the important role played in the realization of transitional justice 
goals and in the reconstruction of the society, as well as in the promotion of the rule of law 
and accountability, by: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Victims&#8217; associations, human rights defenders and other actors of civil 
society, as well as national human rights institutions created in conformity with the Paris 
Principles; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Women&#8217;s organizations in the design, establishment and implementation of 
transitional justice mechanisms, so as to ensure that women are represented in their 
structures and that a gender perspective is reflected in their mandates and work; 
</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Free and independent media in informing the public about the human rights 
dimension in the area of transitional justice mechanisms locally, nationally and 
internationally; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Strongly condemns </i>violence against women and girls committed in conflict 
and post-conflict situations, such as murder, rape, including systematic rape, sexual slavery, 
forced pregnancy and enforced sterilization, recognizing that the term &#8220;violence against 
women&#8221; is not limited to sexual violence but includes any act of gender-based violence that 
results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to 
women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and calls 
for effective measures of accountability and redress where those acts amount to violations 
of international human rights and humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>18.<i> Recognizes </i>that sexual and gender-based violence is also committed against 
men and boys in conflict and post-conflict situations and, as such, can also constitute a 
gross violation of international human rights law and a serious violation of international 
humanitarian law and that such violations must be investigated, prosecuted and punished, 
and redress be provided to victims in accordance with applicable domestic law obligations 
under international law; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Also</i> <i>recognizes </i>that sexual and gender-based violence, particularly in 
conflict and post-conflict situations, affects victims, families, communities and societies, 
and stresses that effective remedies in those situations should include access to health care, 
psychosocial support, legal assistance and socioeconomic reintegration services for victims 
of such violence; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Underlines </i>the needs of women and the particular needs of children in 
transitional justice processes and the obligation to enable their full and effective 
participation and, in the case of children, as their age permits, in all aspects of post-conflict 
recovery, recognizing their crucial role in facilitating the reconstruction of the society, the 
promotion of the rule of law and ensuring accountability; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Underlines </i>the need for the rights of both victims and accused persons to be 
respected, in accordance with international human rights law, with particular attention paid 
to those most affected by conflicts and the lack of effective the rule of law mechanisms, 
among them women, children, migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons, persons 
with disabilities and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious or linguistic 
minorities and indigenous peoples, and to ensure that specific measures are taken for their 
free participation and protection and for the sustainable return of refugees and internally 
displaced persons in safety and dignity; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Emphasizes </i>the need to provide gender-sensitive human rights training in the 
context of transitional justice to all relevant national actors, including police, military, 
intelligence and security services, prosecution staff and members of the judiciary, in 
dealing with victims of human rights violations, particularly women and girls, in order to 
ensure gender sensitivity and gender mainstreaming in the restoration of the rule of law and 
transitional justice processes; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Calls upon </i>States to assist the United Nations in its ongoing work on the 
relevant recommendations of the reports of the Secretary-General on the rule of law and 
transitional justice in conflict and post-conflict societies,2 the report of the Secretary-
General entitled &#8220;Uniting our strengths: Enhancing United Nations support for the rule of 
law&#8221;3 as well as subsequent reports of the Secretary-General on the rule of law,4 including 
by incorporating international human rights law, principles and best practices into the 
development and implementation of transitional justice mechanisms and by cooperating 
fully with United Nations field presences in the area of human rights and transitional justice 
and by facilitating the work of relevant special procedures; </p>


<p>24. <i>Calls upon </i>the international community and regional organizations to assist 
countries, who so consent, in the context of transitional justice, to ensure the promotion and 
protection of human rights and to incorporate best practices into the development and 
implementation of transitional justice mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Recommends </i>that a human rights and transitional justice perspective be taken 
into account in peace negotiations, and that those conducting peace negotiations draw upon 
the relevant human rights and transitional justice expertise available within the United 
Nations system; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Welcomes </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, 
justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence,10 in which the Special Rapporteur 
concluded that, as a set of measures, the four components of his mandate are interrelated 
and mutually reinforcing, when implemented to redress gross violations of human rights 
and serious violations of international humanitarian law and that, with respect to the 
meaningful participation of victims, the participatory procedures necessary to address the 
different needs and opportunities of women, men and children have yet to be established; 
</p>
<p>27.<i> Acknowledges </i>the fundamental importance of human rights education and 
training in contributing to the promotion, protection and effective realization of all human 
rights, including the area of human rights and transitional justice; 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Invites </i>States to avail themselves of the expertise and advisory services of the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-
recurrence in the area of human rights and transitional justice, and encourages the Special 
Rapporteur, within his mandate, to share experience and information relating to good 
practices, technical assistance and capacity-building in his interaction with States in this 
regard; 
</p>
<p>29.<i> Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, 
reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence to work, within his mandate, in close 
cooperation with relevant special procedures of the Human Rights Council and relevant

the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, as appropriate, in the 
fulfilment of the gender-specific dimension of his mandate; 
</p>
<p>30. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to continue to enhance its 
leading role within the United Nations, including with regard to conceptual and analytical 
work regarding transitional justice, and to assist States, with their consent, to design, 
establish and implement transitional justice mechanisms from a human rights perspective, 
while stressing the importance of close cooperation between the Office of the High 
Commissioner and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparations 
and guarantees of non-recurrence, as well as with other relevant parts of the United Nations 
and other international and non-governmental organizations, with regard to incorporating 
human rights and best practices into the development and implementation of transitional 
justice mechanisms and to the ongoing process of strengthening the United Nations system 
in the area of the rule of law and transitional justice;  
</p>
<p>31. <i>Invites </i>other relevant actors of the United Nations system to cooperate fully 
with the Office of the High Commissioner and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of 
</p>

<p>truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence in the area of human rights and 
transitional justice; 
</p>
<p>32. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to submit an analytical study 
to the Human Rights Council, prior to its twenty-seventh session, focusing on gender-based 
and sexual violence in relation to transitional justice, the effective participation of victims, 
and the participatory procedures necessary to address the different needs and opportunities 
of women, men and children, including good practices in the field of truth-seeking, justice, 
reparation and institutional reform and undertaken in consultation with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, other 
relevant mandate holders, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual 
Violence in Conflict, other relevant actors of the United Nations system, civil society and 
other stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>33. <i>Decides </i>to continue its consideration of this matter at its twenty-seventh 
session or at the corresponding session in conformity with its annual programme of work.
