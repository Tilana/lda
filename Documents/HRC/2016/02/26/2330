<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 16/21 of 25 March 2011 on the review 
</p>
<p>of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council, in particular paragraph 61 of the 
</p>
<p>annex thereto, in which the Council decided to establish a task force to study the issues of 
</p>
<p>secretariat services, accessibility for persons with disabilities and use of information 
</p>
<p>technology, as envisaged in paragraphs 57, 58, 59 and 60 of the annex, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council decision 19/119 of 22 March 2012, in which 
</p>
<p>the Council endorsed the report of the task force, annexed to decision 19/119, including its 
</p>
<p>recommendations with the modalities made in the report, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> General Assembly resolution 66/246 of 24 December 2011, in 
</p>
<p>which the Assembly stressed the importance of an open, transparent and all-inclusive 
</p>
<p>United Nations, and decided to approve the live webcasting and subsequent storage of all 
</p>
<p>the formal meetings of its six Main Committees, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of the current arrangement between the Department of Public 
</p>
<p>Information, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>the Information Service, which relies mainly on extrabudgetary resources to fund webcast 
</p>
<p>coverage of Human Rights Council meetings, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the added value of the live webcasting and subsequent storage of the 
</p>
<p>formal meetings held in the framework of the sessions of the Human Rights Council and 
</p>
<p>the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, which constitute archive records of 
</p>
<p>Council meetings, in particular in view of the lack of summary records, as well as being an 
</p>
<p>important tool for public outreach, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recommends</i> to the General Assembly to consider ways to ensure sustainable live 
</p>
<p>webcasting and subsequent storage of Human Rights Council meetings held in the 
</p>
<p>framework of the sessions of the Council and of the Working Group on the Universal 
</p>
<p>Periodic Review.
