</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the third report to be submitted to the Human Rights Council by the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and it covers activities carried out in 2007. 
The activities of the Special Rapporteur are carried out in accordance with Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 1999/44, in which the Commission established the mandate and 
defined its functions. At its sixty-first session, the Commission decided, in its 
resolution 2005/47, to extend the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate for an additional three years, and 
this mandate was renewed by the Human Rights Council pursuant to its resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since his appointment to the mandate in July 2005, the Special Rapporteur has requested 
invitations to visit the following countries: Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Guatemala, Japan, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, the Philippines, Qatar, the Republic of Korea, Senegal, 
South Africa, Spain and the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>3. Australia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and the 
United States of America have responded positively to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s request. The 
Special Rapporteur visited the Republic of Korea and Indonesia in December 2006.<b>1</b> From 
30 April to 18 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur undertook an official visit to the United States 
of America.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>4. Visits to Mexico and Guatemala are scheduled to take place from 9 to 15 March and 
from 24 to 28 March 2008, respectively. Other visits to be undertaken in 2008 are under 
discussion. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Governments of the countries that 
have responded positively to his requests for visits and to urge the Governments that have not yet 
done so to reply to his requests. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communications with member States 
</b></p>
<p>5. From 1 January to 31 December 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a total 
of 25 communications alleging violations of the rights of migrants to 22 member States. Of the 
communications that were sent, 14 were in the form of urgent appeals, while the remaining 
communications were letters of allegation. Communications were sent to the following 
countries: Angola, Bulgaria, China, Congo, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Guinea, Iran (Islamic 
Republic of), Italy, Lebanon, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Mozambique, New Zealand, 
Saudi Arabia (2), Sweden, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland (2), the United States of America (2) and Yemen.

</b>  A/HRC/4/24/Add.2 and A/HRC/4/24/Add.3. 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  A/HRC/7/12/Add.2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. Out of the 25 communications sent, the Special Rapporteur received only 12<b> </b>responses 
from the concerned Governments. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank all Governments 
that have responded to his communications for their collaboration and would also like to remind 
Governments that have not responded, to do so and to address all concerns raised in each 
communication. 
</p>
<p>7. Out of the 25 communications sent, a total of 22 were sent jointly by the Special 
Rapporteur and the following special procedures mandate-holders: the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief; the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences; the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography; the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children; 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers; the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders; the 
independent expert on minority issues; and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination 
in this context. 
</p>
<p>8. A summary of all communications sent during the period under review, including urgent 
appeals and letters of allegation, as well as government replies, are included in an addendum to 
this report.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>9. In June 2007, the Special Rapporteur attended the Human Rights Council and took the 
opportunity of his stay in Geneva to meet and consult with staff from the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), including staff assisting other 
mandates, members of the OHCHR Task Force on Migration, and the secretariat of the 
Committee on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (CMW). 
He also met with representatives of the diplomatic community, non-governmental and 
international organizations. 
</p>
<p>10. On 26 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur visited New York, where he presented his 
report to the Third Committee of the General Assembly. The Special Rapporteur noted that, 
although it is the sovereign right of all States to safeguard their borders and regulate their 
migration policies, States should ensure respect for the human rights of migrants while enacting 
and implementing immigration laws. He also noted that States should cooperate, with a view to 
fostering regular migration and investing to provide better opportunities to migrant workers in 
their countries of origin, instead of focusing only on security aspects, which are clearly not 
preventing migrants from reaching their countries of destination. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  A/HRC/7/12/Add.1 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. Finally, the Special Rapporteur emphasized that, despite the fact that the International 
Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, adopted by 
the General Assembly in 1990, was one of the seven basic instruments defining a global human 
rights protection regime for migrant workers, a number of Governments still needed to be 
convinced that its ratification was necessary. He reiterated the need for a comprehensive 
approach to migrants&#8217; human rights in order to ensure that migrants had a framework for 
protection and enjoyed rights appropriate and adequate to their particularly vulnerable situations. 
</p><p>12. On International Migrants Day, 18 December, the Special Rapporteur issued a joint 
statement with the Chairperson of the Committee on Migrant Workers calling for wider 
ratification of the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p><b>II. THEMATIC ISSUES:  CRIMINALIZATION OF 
IRREGULAR MIGRATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Protection afforded to irregular migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  General trends and State responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur observes the ongoing abuse of irregular migrants throughout the 
migration process (in the country or territory of origin, transit and destination) and therefore 
deems it important to put forth a discussion to highlight some of the violations against 
irregular migrants and the responsibility of the State to take measures to prevent such violations. 
The State has broad authority in determining admission, conditions of stay, and the removal of 
non-nationals. In addition, the State has the sovereign authority to take measures protecting its 
national security, and to determine the conditions upon which nationality is to be granted. This 
power to manage admission and expulsion has, however, to be exercised in full respect for the 
fundamental human rights and freedoms of non-nationals, which are granted under a wide range 
of international human rights instruments and customary international law.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>14. Although it is the sovereign right of all States to safeguard their borders and regulate their 
migration policies, States should ensure respect for the human rights of migrants while enacting 
and implementing national immigration laws. It is the responsibility of the State, regardless of 
the legal status of the migrant, to ensure that fundamental human rights norms are adhered to and 
that all migrants are treated with dignity. The Human Rights Committee, which monitors the 
implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), has long 
since noted that reports from States have often failed to take into account that each State party 
must ensure the rights in the Covenant to &#8220;all individuals within its territory and subject to its

<p>jurisdiction&#8221;.<b>5</b> States have the responsibility and, indeed, the obligation to respect and protect the 
human rights of all those within its territory, nationals and non-nationals alike, regardless of 
mode of entry or migratory status.<b>6</b> In general, the rights set forth in the Covenant apply to 
everyone, irrespective of reciprocity, and irrespective of nationality or statelessness. 
</p>
<p>15. Despite the international standards designed to offer protection to all individuals, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to draw attention to the increasing criminalization of irregular 
migration and the abuses of migrants during all phases of the migration process. This 
criminalization is linked in many countries to persistent anti-migrant sentiments, which is often 
reflected in policies and institutional frameworks designed to manage migratory flows, often in a 
purely restrictive manner. The Special Rapporteur has received reports of the criminal justice 
practices used by States to combat irregular migration, including greater criminalization of 
migration offences (as opposed to treating them as an administrative offence) and cross-national 
collaboration by police and other authorities, which have in certain cases resulted in increased 
violations against migrants. 
</p>
<p>16. These general trends can be grouped into two broad categories - externalization of 
migration control policies and criminalization of labour migration. Within these categories it is 
relevant to further examine three specific sub-issues: violations against irregular migrants 
pertaining to interception and rescue at sea, detention and expulsion, and smuggling and 
trafficking, which will be discussed in terms of the applicable legal framework for protection and 
the general trends observed. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that this report is 
not intended to excuse irregular migration, nor encourage it, but rather to underscore the 
importance of States to adhere to international human rights standards during engagement with 
all migrants, whether documented or not. Accordingly, States should take measures to further 
promote legal migratory channels and provide assistance in the process. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Externalization of migration control policies 
</b></p>
<p>17. For decades, many States have responded to persistent irregular migration by intensifying 
border controls. State measures of border enforcement, anti-trafficking initiatives and 
immigration control measures have ranged from an increased use of the armed forces or military 
methods of policing the border, confiscation of the proceeds of trafficking, tougher sanctions 
against the employers of undocumented migrants and commercial carriers that bring to their 
borders foreigners without proper documentation, radar surveillance, and detention and 
expulsion of unwanted aliens.<b>7</b> This has also involved, inter alia, fingerprinting, the erection of

<b>6
</b>  Note also that article 16 of the ICCPR, as well as article 24 of the International Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, in very broad terms, 
grant the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law, which pertains to all people 
in any territory, regardless of status.

</p>
<p>walls and the deployment of semi-military and military forces and hardware in the prevention 
of migration by land and sea. These measures have often been targeted at wide geographic areas 
on the borders or coast of a main receiving country or region - for example, the 
Australasian/South-East Asian rim, the United States of America/Mexico border, and the 
southern coast of Europe - representing broad zones of exclusion.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>18. In recent years, in an effort to further curb irregular migration and simultaneously address 
issues of national security, some States seem to be employing techniques in order to 
&#8220;externalize&#8221; border controls to countries of origin and transit, whereby they may utilize bilateral 
agreements and/or promises of aid in order to transform these targeted countries into a potential 
buffer zone to reduce migratory pressures on receiving States.<b>9</b> This may involve supplying 
sending and/or transit countries with infrastructure and training in preventing irregular migration, 
potentially including, for example, naval and air patrol operations, radar systems, and other 
technology to be used in the securing of borders by intercepting migrants in the process and then 
subsequently detaining and expelling them. Under the auspices of these agreements, there have 
been reports of receiving countries financing, inter alia, detention centres, training programmes 
for police officers, and concerted expulsions involving charter flights. The Special Rapporteur is 
receiving reports of sending and transit States utilizing new, tougher immigration and visa 
regulations to restrict migratory flows, resulting in obstacles to movement and harassment at 
airports and border crossings.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>19. The concern is that these policies, while legitimately aimed at reducing irregular migration, 
and while often incorporated into bilateral agreements that can have significant positive aspects 
for the countries that are the recipients of the aid, have contributed to the criminalization of 
irregular migration insofar as they treat migration violations as a criminal rather than 
administrative offence without the proper human rights protections afforded to migrants in the 
process.<b>11</b> Moreover, these policies and the anti-migrant discourse that often accompany them 
have also in certain cases prompted and legitimized a notable increase in institutionalized 
discrimination, leading to further violations.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. The policies seem to be taking place both at the regional and bilateral levels. For example, 
there have been reports that some Southern European States have intensified border controls and 
have attempted to externalize migration control policies by pressuring West and North African 
countries to prevent irregular migration and to sign readmission agreements in exchange for 
aid, financial support and work permits. There have also been reports of certain immigration 
controls which are being imposed to restrict northward migration from Mexico and countries in 
Central America through the United States-Mexico border, including those imposed by States in 
the region which serve as countries of transit. In this regard, the phenomenon of transnational 
gang networks, and the complex financing and law enforcement agreements used to combat 
them, are a particular challenge.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>21. These migration control policies have also had a series of unintended side effects in the 
form of increasing violations of migrants&#8217; rights in the region. Moreover, they have led to a 
diversification of trans-Saharan migration routes and attempted sea crossing-points (e.g. through 
Cape Verde and the Canary Islands), which now cover large stretches of the African coastline 
from Guinea to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.<b>13</b> Organized crime networks involved in the 
smuggling of migrants into the United States have been similarly problematic as smugglers 
adjust their routes and increase the complexity of their efforts to account for the ever-increasing 
restrictions. There are persistent accounts of the dangers confronted by would-be migrants in 
transit in both of these regions, as well as in others, as increased measures in terms of 
infrastructure and surveillance may induce irregular migrants to take greater risks in 
circumventing the authorities.<b>14</b> The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the number of 
deaths occurring throughout the migration process. 
</p>
<p>22. In addition, there has been discussion about the effectiveness of such policies, which may 
have had unintended, perhaps even counterproductive, effects. For example, although many 
migrants are intercepted, detained and expelled in the process, satisfying the goal of preventing 
irregular migration, expulsion may not necessarily be a deterrent for future migration attempts as 
intended because migrants may try again through other avenues. There are cases of migrants who 
had planned to remain in the country of first destination<b>15</b> but subsequently decide to continue on

<p>  Often this is reflected in intraregional movement. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to a third country due to increasing repression by States - many of which are the recipients of aid 
and training and that are involved in the policies to externalize border controls. Finally, as 
explained above, the policies may have intensified smuggling efforts (in terms of diversification 
of routes and complication of strategies), and caused intermediaries (such as taxi and boat 
drivers, family members, for example) to inadvertently be deemed complicit in such smuggling 
efforts.  
</p>
<p>23. Despite these seemingly counterproductive effects, the management of migration flows 
depends on regional and bilateral cooperation, and many positive elements for social and 
economic development and enhanced security may arise from agreements between sending, 
transit and destination countries. The challenge remains to construct and implement such policies 
so that they both prevent irregular migration and protect migrants&#8217; rights. The promotion of 
increased collaboration can serve to prevent irregular migration if the migration control policies 
are adequately evaluated and implemented with a view to their effectiveness and with adequate 
consideration to the protection of all migrants in all phases of the movement process. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Criminalization of labour migration 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur observes that the increasing criminalization of irregular migration, 
in the case of movement for economic purposes, does not adequately address issues of 
demand-driven labour and the needs of the receiving economies. A predominant push factor for 
migrating is perceived employment and, despite the reciprocal relationship between economies 
that may be able to absorb additional migrants, and labourers which move in search of 
employment based on perceived demand in the host country, it is often the irregular migrant 
which is penalized. This manifests itself in vulnerability to detention and subsequent expulsion if 
the irregular migrant is not able to gain regular status and is intercepted during the process, or 
loss of job and livelihood if the migratory process was (temporarily) successful. 
25. Moreover, an inadequate understanding of the needs of a host society can lead to 
xenophobic sentiments towards the migrant population, even if the migrants are filling a labour 
gap which contributes to helping an ailing sector of the host economy. For example, there are 
situations where a host society, without fully comprehending the economic benefits of recruiting 
a particular labour group from abroad - often in the agricultural and medical fields, inter alia - 
has displayed aggressive attitudes towards these groups.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>26. Sharing information about the need for labour mobility and its contribution to the host 
economy may contribute to better integrating migrant populations into the host society. Where 
properly managed (including by regulating migration through increased legal channels and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>16
</b>  A particularly salient example is the case of Haitian migration of sugarcane labourers to the 
</p>
<p>Dominican Republic. See James Ferguson, &#8220;The Haitian minority in the Dominican Republic&#8221; 
and Maureen Achieng, &#8220;Managing Haitian migratory flows to the Dominican Republic&#8221; in 
<i>Intra-Caribbean Migration and the Conflict Nexus</i>, pp. 307-67. See also Mireille Kingma, 
<i>Nurses on the Move: Migration and the Global Health Care Economy</i> (Ithaca, Cornell 
University Press, 2005). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>supporting new efforts for the compilation of disaggregated data of labour supply and demand), 
labour mobility can form part of strategies to ensure dynamism, flexibility and competitiveness 
of economies of host countries, as well as in countries of origin. Indeed, remittances have 
become an important source of income for many countries of origin, while many industries and 
service providers in host societies benefit from a migrant-based labour force.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Despite the general agreement on the positive aspects of migration for development and 
the evolution of international forums for cooperation, the focus of States has largely been on the 
better management and control of the movement of migrants and their goods and services, rather 
than on the articulation and protection of their rights. One sees a trend toward viewing migrants 
as commodities, rather than as persons with rights and duties afforded to them through the 
international human rights framework.<b>18</b> With the further promotion of legal migratory avenues 
and assistance programmes, inclusive of an articulated and implemented perspective on the 
rights of migrants, States will be able to better address the challenges of irregular migration. 
Various forms of inter-State cooperation, including bilateral and regional labour agreements, can 
generate more predictable labour mobility flows and commitments of cooperation involving the 
private sector, which can result in more effective recruitment and employment procedures, while 
enabling the monitoring required to limit migrant exploitation. 
</p>
<p>28. Despite the increase of regional integration mechanisms over the last two decades with 
provisions for the free movement of labour, for example in the Caribbean, West Africa, and 
South-East Asia, regular migration is still not at its full potential in many regions, which often 
serves to foster undocumented migratory flows as well as hamper the potential for 
competitiveness among regional economies.<b>19</b> While regional integration processes may serve as 
useful building blocks in efforts to facilitate and better regulate labour mobility, challenges 
persist with respect to policy design and implementation. 
</p>
<p>29. For example, in West Africa, the Treaty of the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS) Protocol Relating to Free Movement of Persons, Residence and 
</p>
<p>

<p>  But, such mechanisms have often achieved greater mobility of persons through regional 
integration or trade regimes than has been achieved to date under Mode 4 of the World Trade 
Organization&#8217;s (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which remains limited 
in scope and number of commitments to a select category of highly skilled workers. See IOM,

effect (insofar as visas are not required for travel, mandatory residence permits have been 
abolished, and the subregional passport was adopted to replace national passports), but the parts 
on establishment and residence have not been put into effect, despite the close link to the right of 
free movement, integration of trade, tariff regimes and promotion of labour mobility in the 
subregion. National laws are still not harmonized with regional and subregional treaties and, in 
conjunction with investment codes, often restrict &#8220;foreigners&#8221; (including nationals of 
Community States), from participating in certain kinds of economic activities. 
&#8220;Community&#8221; citizens have been expelled by member States and sentiments against 
non-nationals persist, especially due to economic downturn, unemployment and political 
instability.  
</p>
<p>30. One finds another example with the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME). All 
member States were required to remove existing restrictions on the rights of establishment, 
provision of services, movement of capital and movement of skills for the full implementation of 
the single market by 1 January 2006, or shortly thereafter. Even though the legal actions should 
have been taken for the implementation of free movement of skills, provision of services and the 
right of establishment by this date, mobility is still impeded by cumbersome administrative 
processes, significant variations in transposition of treaty requirements into domestic legislation 
(e.g. family reunion), and the absence of supportive regional instruments (e.g. accreditation 
body). As a result, progress on free movement has been slow and the full realization of free 
movement was not achieved as planned and will require from member States further action at the 
national and regional levels.<b>21</b>

<p>31. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is the major political grouping in 
the South-East Asian region with links to East Asian and Pacific countries through the ASEAN 
Regional Forum (ARF). Through its associated ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), it is 
working towards the establishment of an economic grouping on the model of the 
European Union, but progress has been slow. In 2002, ASEAN also adopted a Plan of Action for 
Cooperation on Immigration Matters, which includes: accelerating the freer flow of skilled 
labour and professionals in the region; the establishment of mechanisms and infrastructure to 
facilitate travel within the region; strengthening collaboration to combat trafficking and crimes 
of violence against women and children; and strengthening regional capacity to address 
transnational crime. Supplementing initiatives by these general regional groupings are other

<p>regional initiatives focusing on migration, but none has yet to fully bring about the free 
movement of persons which would alleviate some of the concerns about irregular migration in 
the region.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>32. These are just three examples of regional mechanisms that can better regulate 
demand-driven migration, thereby reducing irregular intraregional migration flows, but much 
can be done at the bilateral level to facilitate permanent regularized labour mobility for all skill 
levels, as well as temporary and circular migration schemes. In a time of increased mobility, 
enhancing the gains from labour migration and facilitating their more equitable distribution 
requires comprehensive and coherent State policies, capacity-building and bilateral and 
multi-stakeholder cooperation.<b>23</b>  
</p>
<p>33. Central to this approach is the recognition of the scope of demand-driven migration as an 
inadequate understanding of the relationship between migration and its economic drivers has led 
to manifestations of xenophobia, whether in institutional policies or at the society/community 
level. A clearer picture of the economic needs of a given State and the gaps that labour mobility 
can fill, through regularized channels and with adherence to basic human rights standards, may 
contribute to the generation of a shift from such xenophobic tendencies in host societies.

<p><b>B.  Criminalization issues in focus 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Interception and rescue at sea 
</b></p>
<p>34. The phenomenon of migrants travelling by sea in search of safety, refuge or simply better 
economic conditions is not new. The term &#8220;boat people&#8221; has now entered into common parlance, 
with asylum-seekers, refugees, and migrants trying to reach the closest destination by boat, in the 
Mediterranean, the Caribbean and the Pacific regions, for example. Since the vessels used are 
often overcrowded and unseaworthy, rescue at sea, disembarkation and processing of those 
rescued has re-emerged as an important but challenging issue for States, international 
organizations, the shipping industry and, of course, the vulnerable migrants themselves. 
Moreover, in an effort to restrict these flows, destination States have increasingly resorted to 
interception practices within the broader context of migratory control measures. In both cases 
reports indicate that adequate protection safeguards and attention to the human rights of those 
rescued or intercepted have not always been evident.<b>24</b>

asylum-seekers and refugees<i>, </i>held in Lisbon on 25-26 March 2002. See also UNHCR and 
International Maritime Organization (IMO), <i>Rescue at Sea: A guide to principles and practice 
applied to migrants and refugees</i>, September 2006 (www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/450037d34.pdf). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. In addition to the international human rights framework, there is an applicable legal 
framework for rescue at sea in international maritime law, which stipulates the requirements for 
assistance afforded to those travelling by sea. Legal developments which have taken place with 
regard to the international law of the sea include the entering into force of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and recent amendments to the Safety of Life at 
Sea (SOLAS) and the Search and Rescue (SAR) Conventions, as well as their implementing 
guidelines issued by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). These conventions 
explicitly contain the obligation to come to the assistance of persons in distress at sea, and this 
obligation is unaffected by the status of the persons in question, their mode of travel or the 
numbers involved.<b>25</b>  
</p>
<p>36. There are also norms which govern the obligation of a State to stop and search vessels 
suspected of involvement in smuggling or trafficking by sea, but these interception measures 
must be in line with international human rights principles and they oblige States to ensure the 
protection - &#8220;humanitarian handling&#8221; or &#8220;humane treatment&#8221; - of all persons on board, regardless 
of their status.<b>26</b> Indeed, a stated purpose of the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by 
Land, Sea and Air is to protect the rights of smuggled migrants and it limits the criminal liability 
of migrants found to be the object of interception efforts.<b>27</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  See for example, paragraph 2.1.10 of chapter 2 of the annex to SAR, 1979, which states, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Parties shall ensure that assistance be provided to any person in distress at sea. They shall do so 
regardless of the nationality or status of such a person or the circumstances in which that person 
is found.&#8221; Regulation 15 of chapter V of the annex to SOLAS obliges each State to &#8220;ensure that 
any necessary arrangements are made for coast watching and for the rescue of persons in distress 
at sea around its coasts&#8221;. Article 98 (1) of UNCLOS, 1982, states that every State shall require 
the master of a ship flying its flag, insofar as he can do so without serious danger to the ship, the 
crew or the passengers, inter alia, to render assistance to any person found at sea and in danger of 
becoming lost. Some of these provisions have become so universally recognized as to be 
considered customary international law. 
<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  See article 12 of the IMO circular &#8220;Interim measures for combating unsafe practices 
associated with the trafficking or transport of migrants by sea&#8221;, adopted by the Maritime Safety 
Committee in 1998, which authorizes a State which has reasonable grounds to suspect that a ship 
&#8220;is engaged in unsafe practices associated with the trafficking or transport of migrants&#8221; to 
inspect the ship. Article 17 of the same document calls for the State to &#8220;ensure the safety and the 
humanitarian handling of the persons on board&#8221;. Article 9 of the Protocol against the Smuggling 
of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Crime similarly calls on States to &#8220;ensure the safety and humane treatment of the 
persons on board&#8221; and article 16 ensures further safeguards for protection. 
<b>27
</b></p>
<p>  See the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Crime, articles 2 and 5, respectively. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>37. Despite these norms, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the numerous reports 
received over the last few years concerning migrants who have been intercepted, detained or who 
have lost their lives at sea, in particular in the Mediterranean and Gulf regions. The current 
Special Rapporteur and his predecessor, Ms. Gabriela Rodr&#237;guez Pizarro, have entered into 
constructive dialogue with a number of countries, with regard to specific cases involving 
hundreds of individuals rescued at sea; the concerns of the Special Rapporteur and the responses 
of Governments were published in their periodic reports.<b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>38. Among the problems identified is the lack of individual assessment of migrants intercepted 
at sea, often resulting in detention and expulsion of groups without due process, and 
accompanying ill-treatment. This may include a lack of sensitivity to the rights of 
asylum-seekers, for instance mandatory detention and their return to countries where they may 
risk persecution or torture.<b>29</b> There have also been challenges in distinguishing migrants from 
those responsible for smuggling and trafficking.  
</p>
<p>39. In certain incidents, States have called upon countries of origin to identify possible 
collaborators in smuggling or trafficking networks among those rescued, and then charging 
certain irregular migrants with a criminal offence without due process, even though they may 
have been victims of trafficking or objects of smuggling practices, rather than perpetrators. This 
potentially exposes individuals fleeing persecution in their countries of origin to the risk of 
involuntary return under the pretext that they are involved in trafficking or smuggling. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur has received reports of criminal charges being brought against 
those involved in the rescuing or inadvertent transport of irregular migrants, such as fishermen. 
</p>
<p>40. All these violations concerning migrants who travel by sea contribute to the phenomenon 
of the increasing criminalization of irregular migration, putting both the migrants and the 
rescuers at risk of potential abuses. It is important that States take measures so that those 
intercepted and rescued at sea are processed on an individual basis and afforded due process, and 
that persons claiming international protection are allowed to enter the national asylum 
procedure.<b>30</b>

</p>
<p><b>2.  Detention and expulsion 
</b></p>
<p>41. Migrants are particularly vulnerable to detention, or restriction on their freedom of 
movement/deprivation of their liberty, usually through enforced confinement, either in the 
receiving country or during transit (by land or sea). In the interception of migrants lacking 
documentation, many States employ administrative detention of irregular migrants in connection 
with violations of immigration laws and regulations, which are not considered to be a crime and 
may include, inter alia, overstaying a permit or non-possession of valid identification or visa 
documents. The objective of administrative detention is to guarantee that another administrative 
measure, such as deportation or expulsion, can be implemented. Sometimes administrative 
detention is also employed on the grounds of public security and public order, inter alia, or when 
an alien is pending a decision on refugee status or on admission to or removal from the State.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>42. In some cases, however, national immigration regulations are often made into measures 
that criminalize and punish in an attempt to discourage irregular migration. Undocumented 
migrants therefore become particularly vulnerable to criminal procedures, which are by 
definition punitive in nature, for many of the same infractions as administrative detention would 
encompass, such as irregularly crossing the State border, leaving a residence without 
authorization, or breaching or overstaying conditions of stay.  
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention holds the view that criminalizing the irregular 
entry into a country exceeds the legitimate interest of States to control and regulate irregular 
immigration and can lead to unnecessary detention.<b>32</b> Moreover, often irregular migrants 
detained for immigration offences considered a criminal offence by the receiving State should be 
given the opportunity to appeal before an independent judiciary, but are not afforded such 
protection in practice. In such cases, detention of migrants may become arbitrary.<b>33</b> Arbitrary 
arrest and detention is expressly prohibited in international and regional human rights law and 
migrants&#8217; nationality or lack of legal status in the destination country cannot excuse States from 
their obligations under international law to ensure due process guarantees and dignified and 
humane treatment while migrants are held in detention.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>31
</b>  Much of this section draws from the work of the former Special Rapporteur on the human 
</p>
<p>rights of migrants, Gabriela Rodr&#237;guez Pizarro and the work of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention. See OHCHR, &#8220;Administrative detention of migrants&#8221;, Migration Discussion Papers,

E/CN.4/2003/85.

http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs26.htm#IV, pursuant to resolution 1991/42, as clarified by 
resolution 1997/50. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>44. Despite these standards, the Special Rapporteur has received numerous reports that in 
certain cases detention can become prolonged and the detainees subject to ill-treatment. In 
certain cases irregular migrants have been denied the right to communication, have been subject 
to physical or sexual assault, have been mixed with detainees charged with criminal offences, 
and often suffer from a lack of attention to the specific needs of children, women, 
asylum-seekers and other vulnerable groups.<b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>45. There seem to be enormous differences between immigration regulations among States, 
making oversight of detention conditions and States&#8217; adherence to international standards in this 
practice a challenge.<b>35</b> Some States entirely lack a legal regime governing immigration and 
asylum procedures that, when in place, can help to manage detention practices. Others have 
enacted immigration laws but often they do not provide for a legal framework for detention. 
Some States have legislation which provides for a maximum period of detention, whereas others 
are lacking such a time limit.  
</p>
<p>46. Some national laws do not provide for judicial review of administrative detention of 
migrants. In other instances, the judicial review of administrative detention is initiated only upon 
request of the migrant. In these cases, lack of awareness of the right to appeal, lack of awareness 
of the grounds for detention, difficult access to relevant files, lack of access to free legal counsel, 
lack of interpreters and translation services, and a general absence of information in a language 
detainees can understand on the right to instruct and retain counsel and the situation of the 
facilities where they are being held can prevent migrants from exercising their rights in practice. 
In the absence of lawyers and/or interpreters, migrants can often feel intimidated and obliged to 
sign papers without understanding their content.  
</p>
<p>47. Migrants and asylum-seekers are sometimes detained at airport transit zones and other 
points of entry, under no clear authority, either with the knowledge of government officials at the 
airport or simply on the instructions of airline companies before being returned to their countries. 
The difficulty or impossibility of reaching any outside assistance impedes the exercise of the 
right of the persons concerned to challenge the lawfulness of the State&#8217;s decision to be detained 
and returned and to apply for asylum, even in the presence of legitimate claims. In practice, some 
States misleadingly label migrant detention centres as &#8220;transit centres&#8221; or &#8220;guest houses&#8221; and 
&#8220;detention&#8221; as &#8220;retention&#8221; in the absence of legislation authorizing deprivation of liberty.  
</p>
<p>48. Often the legislative criteria of a given State allow for a high degree of discretion in 
ordering administrative detention: foreign nationals can be detained when immigration officers 
have &#8220;reasonable&#8221; grounds to believe that the person is inadmissible, is a danger to the public, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>34
</b>  Numerous international standards with regard to detention can be found in, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>ICCPR, CMW, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. See Amnesty International, &#8220;Migration-related detention: a research guide on human 
rights standards relevant to the detention of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees&#8221;,

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that the individual is unlikely to appear for an examination or a hearing, or where the officer is 
not satisfied about the identity of the person. Some anti-terrorism legislation allows for the 
detention of migrants on the basis of vague, unspecified allegations of threats to national 
security. The high degree of discretion and the broad power to detain accorded to immigration 
and other law enforcement officials, often coupled with a lack of adequate training, can give rise 
to abuses and to human rights violations. The failure to provide legal criteria can result in 
de facto discriminatory patterns of arrest and return of irregular migrants. 
</p>
<p>49. Moreover, there have been reports of searches that target the removal of migrants living in 
a host country. In some cases States have resorted to police &#8220;raids&#8221; on private homes in 
migrants&#8217; neighbourhoods, arresting and detaining all residents who cannot show documents of 
legal residence, leading to separation of children from their arrested parents, including children 
born in such countries. All cases of expulsion should be decided upon on an individual basis and 
States should ensure that no collective expulsions take place.<b>36</b>  
</p>
<p>50. With such diversity in national policy and law governing detention and expulsion, it is 
important that irregular migration be seen as an administrative offence and irregular migrants 
processed on an individual basis. Where possible, detention should be used only as a last resort 
and in general irregular migrants should not be treated as criminals. The often erratic and 
unlawful detention of migrants is contributing to the broader phenomenon of the criminalization 
of irregular migration. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Smuggling and trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur observes the continued abuse of irregular migrants who are 
involved, whether deliberately or inadvertently, in smuggling and trafficking operations. Over 
time the process of human trade has become more complex, whereby smugglers and traffickers 
may use a combination of deceptive, clandestine, or even legal modes of migration, switching 
strategies at different stages of the journey, and involving both legitimate and illicit actors at the 
governmental and non-governmental levels (inter alia, border officials, intermediaries, 
recruitment agencies, police officers, tourist agents, transport entrepreneurs and airline 
employees).<b>37</b> The facilitation of cross-border movements has increased to such an extent that the 
networks rely on many players who may not be actively and knowingly participating in 
smuggling or trafficking activities as such. There is a concern that, in the process of preventing 
the proliferation of such networks and intercepting those involved, irregular migrants may not 
receive adequate protection.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>36
</b>  The prohibition on the collective expulsion of non-nationals is arguably a recognized 
</p>
<p>principle of international customary law. Indeed, the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families is the most protective 
instrument for irregular migrants in international human rights law and affords additional rights, 
such as elaborate individualized protection against expulsion, which is limited to lawfully 
resident migrants in other instruments, such as ICCPR. See ICMW, article 22, and ICCPR, 
article 13, and the discussion in Cholewinski, et al., pp. 10-14. 
<b>37
</b></p>
<p>  Lee, pp. 2-3. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>52. Furthermore, due to such complexities, in certain cases there seems to be a largely 
superficial distinction between the two practices, as well as confusion about their definition and 
scope. In principle, trafficking is generally considered a crime against human beings, and 
routinely involves coercion, deception, abduction, debt bondage, abuse of power and financial 
gain for those who facilitate and profit from the trade, and general exploitation of the victims of 
trafficking. It can imply threats to personal safety, sexual and reproductive health, and can entail 
abuse and degrading treatment during the process. By contrast, smuggling of migrants has been 
seen essentially as a crime against States, whereby the procurement of the illegal entry into a 
country of a non-citizen is seen as a violation of States&#8217; sovereign power to refuse entry and 
expel aliens.<b>38</b>  
</p>
<p>53. In principle, smuggling is not, at least initially, a coercive practice because the potential 
migrant enters into a contract with the smuggler. However, smuggling practices have become 
much more comprehensive, as anti-migration policies have become more restrictive, opening up 
migrants to infinite abuses, inter alia, sexual exploitation, physical assault, debt servitude, and 
abandonment. As such, smuggled migrants are often susceptible to violations which they may 
not have foreseen before agreeing to be smuggled. Moreover, in certain cases, smuggled 
migrants can also become victims of trafficking, further blurring the distinction and causing a 
false hierarchy of victimization.<b>39</b>  
</p>
<p>54. In this regard, the notion of consent to being smuggled becomes ever-more complex. Once 
an irregular migrant is intercepted, it is up to the State in question to determine the migrant&#8217;s 
level of complicity in the mode of irregular entry, leaving much latitude for assignment of 
culpability or, by contrast, victimization, which impacts the level of protection that migrants may 
receive. That is, an irregular migrant that is thought to have consented to being smuggled may be 
perceived as deserving less protection than a victim of trafficking who may be perceived to 
have been unknowingly exploited. These distinctions are further complicated by 
discriminatory sentiments pertaining to country of origin or assumptions based on race 
and gender.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women 
and Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, both 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Crime, contain a saving 
clause providing for the continued application of human rights, humanitarian law, and, where

</p>
<p>applicable, refugee law.<b>41</b> But, while these branches of law continue to apply to irregular 
migrants, in practice such migrants continue to be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse due to 
their lack of legal status in a country.<b>42</b>  
</p>
<p>56. The purposes of the Trafficking Protocol are to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, to protect and assist the victims of trafficking, and to promote 
cooperation among States in order to meet these objectives.<b>43</b> The Trafficking Protocol provides 
that consent to exploitation is irrelevant where any of the &#8220;means&#8221; set out in the definition are 
used and calls upon States to establish the involvement of individuals in the process of 
trafficking as a criminal offence and mandates a number of measures to be taken to prevent and 
combat trafficking, unilaterally and in cooperation with other States.<b>44</b> Such measures include 
information exchange and training of relevant officials, strengthening border controls, and the 
security of travel or identity documents. 
</p>
<p>57. Despite these protections, victims of trafficking, often misinformed, commit administrative 
infractions, such as irregular entry, use of false documents and other violations of immigration 
laws and regulations, which make them liable to detention and contribute to their criminalization. 
Furthermore, the law of some States punishes as criminal offences irregular entry, entry without 
valid documents or engaging in prostitution, including forced prostitution. Victims of trafficking 
are thus often detained and deported without regard for their specific needs for protection 
and without consideration for the risks they may be exposed to if returned to their country of 
origin.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>58. The purposes of the Smuggling Protocol are to prevent and combat the smuggling of 
migrants, and promote cooperation among States parties to that end, while protecting the rights 
of migrants. In particular, it calls for special protection of migrants in the context of the right to 
life, the right not to be subject to torture or other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, as 
well as draws attention to the special needs of women and children. However, it is clear that the 
protection afforded to smuggled migrants is considerably less than that provided for victims of 
trafficking under the Trafficking Protocol, specifically because smuggled migrants are 
considered to have consented to the practice. The Smuggling Protocol&#8217;s emphasis is on

<p>prosecuted simply for being smuggled - it specifies that migrants shall not become liable to 
criminal prosecution for being the &#8220;object&#8221; of smuggling - it is significant that irregular entry 
remains a criminal offence in many countries.<b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>59. In contrast with the definition of trafficking, although smuggling can be abusive and 
dangerous, its definition does not necessarily denote the occurrence of exploitation or a violation 
of human rights. In practice, however, the distinction between the two can be hard to draw and, 
as explained above, migrants who initially consent to being smuggled may end up in exploitative 
situations.<b>47</b> Due to the ambiguities in such practices, and not least owing to the proliferation of 
networks as a response to ever more restrictive anti-immigration policies, it is particularly 
important that States receive irregular migrants perceived to be involved in trafficking and 
smuggling practices on an individual basis, investigating to the fullest extent their potential 
complicity, and providing for them guarantees of due process.

<p><b>III. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE  
PROTECTION OF IRREGULAR MIGRANTS 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages States to view irregular migration as an 
administrative offence, reversing the trend toward greater criminalization, and to 
incorporate the applicable human rights framework into their bilateral and regional 
arrangements for managing migration flows and protecting national security interests, as 
well as to harmonize their national laws and policies with international human rights 
norms. At the core of immigration policies should be the protection of migrants, regardless 
of their status or mode of entry. As such, the Special Rapporteur offers the following 
recommendations for the formation or reform of regional and bilateral cooperation 
mechanisms and agreements, as well as the enhancement of national training and analysis 
programmes and policy measures. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Incorporating a human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>States should incorporate the applicable human rights framework into their bilateral 
and regional arrangements for managing migration flows and protecting national security 
interests. Specific attention should be paid to detainees, smuggled migrants, victims of 
trafficking, children, women, asylum-seekers and other vulnerable groups. Policies 
designed for the readmission and reintegration of returnees should ensure that migrants 
seeking international protection are not forcibly returned without guaranteeing their rights 
to seek aslyum. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>States should incorporate international human rights norms into their national 
immigration laws and policies. In this context, States who have not yet done so should 
ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families, the first comprehensive international treaty focusing on

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>the protection of migrant workers&#8217; rights and on the link between migration and human 
rights; it provides very useful guidance for States on how to ensure that migration takes 
place in humane and equitable conditions. In particular, States should review their 
expulsion procedures and harmonize them with the Convention, which offers the most 
comprehensive protection for non-nationals in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>States should review their national policies to harmonize them with existing regional 
and subregional agreements on labour mobility. This should be done with a view to 
evaluating which national policies are restrictive in this sense, and what practical 
implications restrictive national frameworks have for the human rights of migrants, both 
documented and not, as well as for the obstacles it places on promoting the free movement 
of labour which might have positive consequences for the national economy. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>All cases of persons involved in the interception of migrants at sea, whether irregular 
migrants or those involved in the rescue or transport of migrants found to be irregular, 
should be treated on an individual basis and granted the basic right to due process. Persons 
believed to be smuggled or trafficked should be brought before an independent judge 
without the involvement of the country of origin; States should renew their cooperation in 
protecting witnesses and victims who assist in identification and prosecution of smugglers 
and traffickers. Persons claiming international protection should be allowed to enter the 
national asylum procedure without delay. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>States should take measures to review their national laws applicable to the detention 
of migrants to ensure that they are harmonized with international human rights norms 
that prohibit inhumane treatment and ensure due process. States should take measures to 
ensure that detention of irregular migrants is not arbitrary and that there is a national 
legal framework to govern detention procedures and conditions. States should develop and 
implement systems of alternatives to detention in the context of flows of undocumented 
migration - which could provide strong procedural safeguards including the obligation to 
have a judge decide on the legality of detention and on the continuing existence of reasons 
for detention - and generally permit detention only as a last resort.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Building national capacities 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>States should further develop and implement training and awareness-raising 
programmes for border authorities, officials at detention centres, police and military 
officers, and government officials on the human rights afforded to irregular migrants 
during all phases of the migration stage including, inter alia, interception and rescue at sea, 
detention and expulsion, and smuggling and trafficking, where applicable. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>States should consider establishing an independent body at the regional level that can 
help monitor the effectiveness of certain policies contributing to the externalization of 
border controls. This might be in the form of enhancing the capacity of an already existing 
academic or policy institute or by forming stronger ties with the data and monitoring 
sections of existing regional systems of human rights protection (e.g. the Inter-American 
System for Human Rights, the Council of Europe, or the African Commission on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights), where applicable. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>68. <b>States should take measures to further promote legal migratory channels to 
encourage regular labour mobility flows, including schemes for temporary and circular 
migration and the movement of skilled and semi-skilled labour under regional mechanisms 
for the free movement of labour. Where provisions for the free movement of persons 
already exist at the regional level, States should take measures to ensure the proper 
institutional structures are in place to implement such provisions, with particular regard to 
the human rights protections afforded to migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>States should take all measures to inform officials involved in potential interdiction at 
sea operations of the rights and protections afforded to migrants in transit, including those 
that are irregular. The rescue of persons in distress at sea is not only an obligation under 
maritime law but also a humanitarian necessity, regardless of the legal status of those 
found or their reasons for travelling by sea. Trafficked persons and other vulnerable 
groups such as separated children and asylum-seekers should receive specific assistance, 
including necessary health care at reception. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>States should take measures to inform potential migrants about the risks associated 
with smuggling and trafficking operations, as well as the rights afforded to migrants even if 
in an irregular situation, particularly if detention is used. Particular attention should be 
paid to the gender-specific stigmatization associated with irregular migration and to the 
exploitation of children in all forms. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>States should take measures to further understand and inform border officials, 
detention centre officials, and police and military officers about the distinctions between 
smuggled migrants, victims of trafficking, and other irregular migrants who potentially fall 
into both categories. All efforts should be made to fully and without prejudice investigate 
cases on an individual basis, provide due process guarantees and consular assistance, and 
to provide assistance to irregular migrants in their safe return, where applicable. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Data and analysis 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>States should bolster their ability to analyse data about migration policy. In support 
of individual States&#8217; domestic policies, laws and practices that have cross-border effects, an 
observatory could be established to compile accurate statistical and related data and to 
provide independent, impartial and expert analyses of key aspects of migration policy in 
order to discern their successes and deficiencies.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>States should take further measures to enhance annual quantitative data on labour 
demand by host countries, which is the driving force behind economic migration, in an 
effort to better regulate the supply of labour migrants with the needs of host countries. 
Host countries and countries of origin each need to identify, respectively, current and 
projected labour supply shortages and surpluses by economic sector, occupation, region 
and province; furthermore, differentiation between labour shortages that are structural 
and those that are seasonal or otherwise temporary is important for designing and 
implementing effective labour migration policies. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>States should devise plans for policymakers to explore the relationship between 
labour supply and demand and xenophobia at the institutional and community levels. 
Further consideration needs to be given to better integrating statistics into flexible, 
inclusive, and sustainable decision-making processes to govern admission, employment and 
residence status of migrants, as well as communication/education campaigns on the 
benefits of migration to the local and national economy. Recognition of demand-driven 
labour migration should mitigate the potential for anti-immigrant sentiments and rhetoric. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>States should take measures to review, compile and share information on irregular 
maritime migration. For bilateral and multilateral agreements to restrict irregular 
maritime migration States, relevant intergovernmental organizations and 
non-governmental actors should establish mass information campaigns to inform those in 
transit of the risks associated with such travel and improve communication among officials 
when migrants are intercepted at sea, including the risks associated with overland travel 
en route to the prospective embarkation point. Empirical data on the scale and scope of 
irregular maritime migration, interception, rescue at sea, disembarkation and treatment of 
persons who have disembarked should be harmonized and more systematically compiled 
by Governments and international agencies.
