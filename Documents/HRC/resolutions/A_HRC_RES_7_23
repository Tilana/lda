<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/23. Human rights and climate change 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>that climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to 
</p>
<p>people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of human rights, </p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that climate change is a global problem and that it requires a 
</p>
<p>global solution, </p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Vienna Declaration 
</p>
<p>and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the findings of the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Panel on Climate Change, including that the warming of the climate system is 
</p>
<p>unequivocal and that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures 
</p>
<p>since the mid-twentieth century is very likely human-induced,  
</p>
<p><i>  Recognizing </i>that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
</p>
<p>Change remains the comprehensive global framework to deal with climate change 
</p>
<p>issues, reaffirming the principles of the Framework Convention as contained in article 
</p>
<p>3 thereof, and welcoming the decisions of the United Nations Climate Change 
</p>
<p>Conference held in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2007, and in particular the adoption 
</p>
<p>of the Bali Action Plan, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action reaffirmed 
</p>
<p>the right to development, as established in the Declaration on the Right to 
</p>
<p>Development, as a universal and inalienable right and as an integral part of 
</p>
<p>fundamental human rights,  </p>

<p><i>Recognizing </i>that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development and that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably 
</p>
<p>meet the development and environmental needs of present and future generations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also </i>that the world&#8217;s poor are especially vulnerable to the effects 
</p>
<p>of climate change, in particular those concentrated in high-risk areas, and also tend to 
</p>
<p>have more limited adaptation capacities, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing further</i> that low-lying and other small island countries, countries 
</p>
<p>with low-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and 
</p>
<p>desertification, and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are 
</p>
<p>particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the relevant provisions of declarations, resolutions and programmes 
</p>
<p>of action adopted by major United Nations conferences, summits and special sessions 
</p>
<p>and their follow-up meetings, in particular Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on 
</p>
<p>Environment and Development, and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/60 of 20 April 
</p>
<p>2005 on human rights and the environment as part of sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> Council resolution 6/27 of 14 December 2007 on adequate 
</p>
<p>housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and in particular 
</p>
<p>paragraph 3 thereof, and Council decision 2/104 of 27 November 2006 on human 
</p>
<p>rights and access to water, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking</i> <i>note</i> of the contribution provided by special procedures of the Council 
</p>
<p>in examining and advancing the understanding of the link between the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights and the protection of environment,  
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> <i>also</i> of the conclusions and recommendations contained in the 
</p>
<p>report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>(A/62/214), which include a call for the Council to study the impact of climate change 
</p>
<p>on human rights, </p>

<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to request the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, in consultation with and taking into account the 
</p>
<p>views of States, other relevant international organizations and intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>bodies including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the secretariat 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, to conduct, within existing resources, a detailed analytical study on the 
</p>
<p>relationship between climate change and human rights, to be submitted to the Council 
</p>
<p>prior to its tenth session; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Encourages</i> States to contribute to the study conducted by the Office of 
</p>
<p>the High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides</i> to consider the issue at its tenth session under agenda item 3, 
</p>
<p>and thereafter to make available the study, together with a summary of the debate held 
</p>
<p>during its tenth session, to the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework 
</p>
<p>Convention on Climate Change for its consideration.  
</p>
<p><i>41st meeting 
28 March 2008 
</i></p>
<p> Adopted without a vote. </p>
<p> </p>
