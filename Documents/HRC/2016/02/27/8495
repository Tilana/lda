<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 11/2, requested the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to convene &#8220;an expert workshop, open to the 
participation of Governments, regional organizations, relevant United Nations bodies, civil 
society organizations and experts from different legal systems, to discuss specific measures 
for overcoming obstacles and challenges that States may face in preventing, investigating, 
prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators of violence against women and girls, as well as 
measures for providing protection, support, assistance and redress for victims&#8221; (para. 
11(d)). This workshop was held in Geneva on 24 and 25 November 2010.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the expert workshop 
</b></p>
<p>2. The workshop was announced on the OHCHR website and a note verbale dated 27 
October 2010 invited permanent missions, United Nations programmes and agencies and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to participate. The workshop, with an audience of 
approximately 100 participants, considered the challenges, good practices and opportunities 
in relation to five essential and cross-cutting aspects of the elimination of violence against 
women: (a) investigating cases of violence against women; (b) the prosecution of violence 
against women and punishment of perpetrators; (c) remedy and reparation for women 
subjected to violence; (d) prevention of violence against women; and (e) protection of 
women subjected to violence. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report contains a summary of the presentations and ensuing discussions. 
The outcome of the workshop has also informed the compilation of good practices in 
efforts aimed at eliminating violence against women, contained in document A/HRC/17/23, 
for consideration by the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Director of the Research and Right to Development Division of OHCHR, 
Marcia V. J. Kran, underlined in her opening remarks that the Human Rights Council had 
been tasked by the General Assembly with setting priorities in addressing violence against 
women as a follow-up to the consideration of the Secretary-General&#8217;s study on the subject. 
She emphasized that the experts were to present their work with the understanding that 
eliminating violence against women is a cross-cutting issue. Some presentations and 
reflections would be of a global nature, while others would focus on experiences and 
findings in particular regions, countries or contexts. The Director expressed the wish that 
the workshop&#8217;s presentations and discussions would inspire the Human Rights Council 
members to take further steps to accelerate the elimination of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>5. Introductory remarks from the floor were made by the Deputy Permanent 
Representative of Canada, the main co-sponsor of resolution 11/2. The representative noted 
that the workshop was being held at a very opportune time, after the 15-year review of the 
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the 10th anniversary of Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security. The representative said she was 
shocked by the reported horrific acts committed against women worldwide. She recognized 
that Canada also faced challenges, including higher rates of violence against aboriginal and 
migrant women, and underreporting of cases of domestic violence. </p>


<p><b> A. Panel 1: Challenges, good practices and opportunities in investigating 
cases of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>6. The first panel comprised Fran&#231;oise Roth, director of the NGO Corporaci&#243;n Punto 
de Vista; Serena Tiberia, Human Rights Officer from the United Nations Joint Human 
Rights Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and Gillian Holmes, Senior 
Adviser in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual 
Violence in Conflict. 
</p>
<p>7. Ms. Roth presented reflections around the topic of information and data gathering 
and analysis resulting from a study conducted in 2010 by her organization and the Benetech 
Human Rights Data Analysis Group on sexual violence in Colombia. She said that sexual 
violence in the Colombian armed conflict had not been perpetrated massively, but had been 
used strategically over decades. Hundreds of cases of sexual violence had been 
documented, mainly by women&#8217;s organizations, but until recently the issue had remained 
silenced. Nevertheless, the information gathered so far could not support the inference that 
conflict-related sexual violence had been widespread and systematic in Colombia. 
</p>
<p>8. Ms. Roth explained that the analysis of what kind of data exists or is absent, and 
how it is constructed and used, offers insight on how an issue is perceived, understood and 
dealt with. In Colombia, data-gathering efforts showed politicization around human rights 
violations. She added that existing statistics about sexual violence were strongly influenced 
by the perception that it is a domestic issue and/or a criminal justice problem to be dealt 
with from a purely legal perspective. This resulted in data collection being constrained by 
the legal definitions of both &#8220;sexual&#8221; and &#8220;violence&#8221; and information not necessary for 
judicial purposes not being systematically gathered or registered. Ms. Roth also emphasized 
access to information as an essential element to conduct a reliable analysis of sexual 
violence. In the context of the study, despite provisions in the Colombian Constitution1, 
accessing information from the military establishment and governmental agencies, in 
particular data related to the armed conflict, proved especially difficult. 
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Roth pointed out that the interpretation, analysis and use of information on 
sexual violence presented a number of unique challenges to any investigator, including 
those stemming from the multiple biases sexual violence is prone to. In the context of the 
Colombian internal armed conflict, it was also difficult to separate &#8220;conflict-related&#8221; from 
&#8220;normal&#8221; sexual violence. The study&#8217;s assessment of available data led to the conclusion 
that the existing data provided no basis for any quantitative claim about sexual violence in 
Colombia taking place at a broad population level. In order to craft accurate estimates of 
patterns of sexual violence, it was essential for researchers to understand the process by 
which data is collected, the underlying assumptions of their own hypotheses, and the 
potential limitations and biases of the data. Ms. Roth concluded by advocating for an 
increased investment in data and information research. 
</p>
<p>10. Ms. Tiberia presented ideas and impressions from quantitative approaches to the 
study of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, based on numerous 
interviews with victims and service providers. There is growing attention to sexual violence 
in the country, with a strong focus on quantitative data and statistics as the main basis for 
policymaking and limited attention paid to subjective perception of the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The 1991 Colombian Constitution, as amended in 1997, recognizes the right to individual privacy and 
</p>
<p>recognizes that the citizens shall have &#8220;the right to know, access, update and rectify any information 
gathered about them in databases, both public and private.&#8221;  </p>


<p>11. Ms. Tiberia explained the project&#8217;s assumptions that: (a) victims of sexual violence 
suffered stigma when the assault was known about by others, thus stigma could be one of 
the reasons for a victim to conceal the sexual violence experienced; (b) victims of sexual 
violence were rational actors who made decisions about what was in their interest; and (c) 
when it was possible to keep a sexual assault secret, a victim could calculate whether and to 
whom to disclose information about the assault. Disclosing information had different 
effects depending on whom the information was disclosed to (close friends or relatives, the 
police or courts, service providers, human rights activists, customary leaders, anonymous 
surveys, etc). 
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Tiberia noted that the decision to conceal or disclose an assault was linked to 
the characteristics of both the sexual assault and the victim. The victim&#8217;s age, sex, and 
marital status, as well as the number of perpetrators, degree of violence used, and location 
of the assault, influenced the reporting process. Data collection was similarly likely to 
reflect cases with certain characteristics while missing others. She concluded with case 
studies where different factors led to different results in disclosing or concealing sexual 
violence. 
</p>
<p>13.  Ms. Holmes presented an analytical framing of conflict-related sexual violence, 
crafted in response to Security Council resolution 1888 (2009). She recalled that resolution 
1888 was a follow-up to Security Council resolution 1820 (2008), which recognized sexual 
violence as an explicit tactic of war. Sexual violence is not collateral damage from armed 
conflicts, but a crime per se, which could constitute a war crime, crime against humanity, 
act of torture, or part of an act of genocide. The International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Special Court for 
Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Court defined conflict-related sexual violence 
to encompass sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced 
sterilization, or any other forms of sexual violence of comparable gravity, which may 
include indecent assault, trafficking, inappropriate medical examinations and strip searches. 
</p>
<p>14. Ms. Holmes presented a &#8220;six pillar test&#8221; designed to determine when sexual violence 
is a security issue: (a) the crime must be of concern to the international community as a 
whole; (b) command responsibility is entailed; (c) civilians are targeted; (d) there is a 
climate of impunity &#8211; sexual violence is &#8220;normalized&#8221; after the conflict; (e) there are cross-
border implications, such as displacement or trafficking; (f) there is a ceasefire violation. 
Recognition of sexual violence as a security issue justified a response from a broad range of 
actors, including peacekeepers, peacemakers, and humanitarian and development actors. 
</p>
<p>15. Ms. Holmes recalled that Security Council resolution 1888 (2009) called for the 
appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in 
Conflict; the creation of a team of rapidly deployable experts to bolster national rule of law 
responses; and better data to inform the deliberations of the Security Council, inter alia. A 
number of practical challenges were highlighted: the unreliable sexual violence statistics; 
difficulty engaging with non-State actors/armed groups; establishing command 
responsibility; building public trust in post-conflict security institutions; the normalization 
of rape as a chronic social problem; the threat of sexual violence as a barrier to women&#8217;s 
participation in public life; and the logistical and infrastructural challenges to delivering 
services to survivors. 
</p>
<p>16. In the discussions that followed, the representative of Timor-Leste outlined some of 
the challenges in effectively addressing violence against women and highlighted in 
particular the limited knowledge about women&#8217;s rights and existing judicial and other 
procedures and the underlying problem of lack of resources. He also wondered how the 
issue of rape and other forms of sexual violence committed by United Nations peacekeepers 
had been addressed and what measures could be envisaged to avoid impunity. The 
representative of Colombia acknowledged the challenges with respect to systematic </p>


<p>collection of data, in particular in the context of sexual violence, and noted that this issue 
had been highlighted in the context of Colombia&#8217;s Universal Periodic Review. She 
mentioned several initiatives, including at the Government level, to remedy this situation. 
The representative of the European Union underlined that unreliable data should not 
prevent attempts to identify gaps and challenges and stressed the need for confidentiality of 
information. It was also emphasized that the research process is key to data collection and 
qualifying quantitative data. 
</p>
<p>17. Ms. Holmes affirmed that &#8220;zero-tolerance&#8221; for sexual violence by peacekeepers was 
now well-established, although she agreed that implementation remained a challenge. Ms. 
Roth insisted that coherent and proactive data collection systems based on &#8220;footprints&#8221; and 
&#8220;indicators&#8221; of violence against women should be developed, rather than expecting and 
requesting victims, perpetrators and witnesses to come forward. Ms. Tiberia concluded that 
several elements were essential to prevent violence against women: combating impunity, 
education/awareness of both women and men, and gender equality in the society. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Panel 2: Challenges, good practices and opportunities in the 
prosecution of violence against women and punishment of perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>18.  The second panel comprised Patricia Viseur Sellers, independent legal expert, 
former legal adviser for gender and acting senior trial attorney at the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; Andrea Coomber, legal practice director at Interights; 
and Zoya Rouhana, director of Kafa (enough) violence and exploitation, Lebanon. 
</p>
<p>19. Ms. Sellers focused on the crime of genocide, recalling that genocide is an 
international crime which did not necessarily have to be linked to a conflict, even if it often 
was. She noted that the Genocide Convention of 1948 contained no explicit provisions 
against sexual crimes but that one recent manifestation of the &#8220;genderization&#8221; of genocide 
was the inclusion in the jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda of 
rape as an element of genocide if it occurred once there was intent to commit genocide. 
Given this and other developments, Ms. Sellers underlined that the gender perspective to 
genocide should be recognized. 
</p>
<p>20. Nevertheless, Ms. Sellers pointed to the fact that the existing definition of genocide 
was limited in two ways: by the list of acts that can constitute genocide and the categories 
of targeted groups. Simply adding the term &#8220;rape&#8221; to the list of acts would not be enough, 
since it would not cover instances of imposing methods to prevent reproduction, or forced 
marriages and breeding. Issues also arose with the categories of targeted groups; for 
instance, the definition does not include women, gender, sex, or political groups, showing a 
need to question the nature of groups protected by the current definition of genocide. 
However, infliction of rape and other forms of sexual violence can meet the evidentiary 
requirements of an &#8220;attack&#8221; against the civilian population, a prerequisite jurisdictional 
element of crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>21. Ms. Coomber&#8217;s presentation was based on her experience as a law practitioner with 
a focus on the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence regarding violations of 
women&#8217;s rights. She noted the dearth of case law concerning violence against women and 
hoped that the convention on violence against women currently under preparation at the 
Council of Europe would provide a better framework. The Court recognized gender-based 
violence as a form of discrimination under the European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms only in 2009. 
</p>
<p>22. Ms. Coomber presented a review of the key cases defined as &#8220;domestic violence&#8221; 
and &#8220;rape&#8221; in which the Court had developed its jurisprudence on due diligence obligations. 
In <i>Kontrova v. Slovakia</i> &#8211; regarding a woman whose husband killed himself and their two </p>


<p>children after she reported years of violence and threats to the police &#8211; was the first case 
where the Court applied the notion of due diligence to domestic violence. The Court 
deemed the State responsible for failure of the police to take action. In <i>Bevacqua and S. v. 
Bulgaria</i>, the Court acknowledged the limitations of private prosecution of domestic 
violence, confirming domestic violence as a matter of public concern and the State&#8217;s 
responsibility for failing to impose sanctions. In <i>Branko Tomasic and others v. Croatia</i>, the 
Court confirmed that the State had the obligation to protect the victims, noting the failure to 
provide adequate mental health care to the perpetrator. In the landmark case <i>Opuz v. 
Turkey</i>, the Court found a breach of the principle of due diligence, arguing that prosecution 
should have continued even in the face of repeated withdrawal of complaints from the 
alleged victim and confirmed gender-based violence as discrimination. In the most recent 
case of <i>A v. Croatia</i> concerning prolonged domestic violence and the effectiveness of 
protective orders, the Court found that the State&#8217;s failure to effectively enforce these 
measures violated the convention. 
</p>
<p>23. Ms. Coomber also referred to three rape cases before the Court. In <i>C. R. and S. W. v. 
the United Kingdom</i>, the Court underlined the State duty to protect women, including by 
criminalizing marital rape. <i>Aydin v. Turkey</i> confirmed that the crime of rape against a 
female detainee constitutes torture prohibited by the convention. Finally, in <i>M.C. v. 
Bulgaria</i>, the Court decided that physical resistance from the victim should not be a 
necessary requirement for convictions for rape, the focus lying on the lack of consent as a 
constituent element of the offence. Ms. Coomber concluded that with such limited 
jurisprudence, the discrepancy between the European Court of Human Rights case law on 
rape and domestic violence and the challenges and experiences of women on the ground 
was immense. She highlighted the challenge of finding women prepared to pursue litigation 
in light of the length of judicial proceedings and limited access to justice. Ms. Coomber 
pleaded for the strengthening of legal aid programmes, investments in the training of police 
and prosecutors to work with victims of violence against women, and a gender balance in 
the criminal justice system. 
</p>
<p>24.  Ms. Rouhana talked about her participation in the drafting of a new law to protect 
women from family violence in Lebanon. She explained that authority regarding family law 
was delegated to the many different recognized religious groups that shared the same 
patriarchal background. She added that the penal code still discriminated against women in 
many aspects and tolerated harmful practices, such as providing for mitigating excuses for 
crimes committed under the pretext of honour, or allowing for marital rape. Domestic 
violence was also not specifically addressed in the penal code, providing for a context of 
unlimited authority of men over women. 
</p>
<p>25. Ms. Rouhana said the process of drafting this law started in 2007 as a result of 
collaborative efforts of a committee of experts from the internal security forces, judges and 
lawyers, and civil society representatives. After two years of continuous advocacy and 
lobbying, the draft law was approved by the Council of Ministers in April 2010 and was 
pending approbation of the joint Parliament Committees and the general assembly of the 
Parliament. She said the law was designed to criminalize practices harmful to women but 
tolerated by traditional or religious cultures, and to extend protection to all familial 
relationships and include preventive, protective and punitive aspects. 
</p>
<p>26. Ms. Rouhana finally stressed that, even if the law was approved, there would still be 
major challenges to its implementation, mainly the unstable political and security situation 
in Lebanon, which had a negative impact on social issues in general and women&#8217;s issues in 
particular. Financial resources would be essential to implement the law effectively. 
However she recognized that much more needed to be done on a more general level, such 
as dealing with legal illiteracy and poor service delivery, change of attitudes, and educating 
women on their own rights. She also acknowledged the shortfalls of the draft law itself; i.e. </p>


<p>the persistence of the religious personal codes and courts &#8211; two articles had been introduced 
into the law to make sure that the power and authority of religious courts would not be 
contradicted or hindered &#8211; and the inability of the law to deal with abuses stemming 
directly from the personal status laws, for instance when these deal with custody of 
children. 
</p>
<p>27. In the discussions that followed, a question was asked about examples in European 
Court of Human Rights jurisprudence of how dealing with impunity would imply a local 
transformation in interpreting the law. The representative of the European Union noted the 
importance of addressing impunity, especially concerning female human rights defenders, 
and wondered if any good practices could be shared on how to combine punitive and 
preventive measures. A civil society representative insisted on the urgency of setting up 
specialized centres for reinsertion and rehabilitation. The representative of Turkey 
mentioned the national campaign launched on the international day against violence against 
women and noted that Turkey had implemented the decision of the Court in the <i>Opuz</i> case. 
Comments were further made about the importance of human rights education to 
addressing violence against women and on how universities could reinforce their 
participation in the work of the International Criminal Court and other courts.  
</p>
<p>28. Ms. Coomber recognized that, while legal aid was essential, there was also a need to 
consider how to improve investigative measures and evidentiary requirements. Regarding 
the European Court of Human Rights cases, she noticed that, while governments are quick 
to pay monetary compensations, law reform is a slower and less transparent process. Ms. 
Sellers reiterated the need for applying a gender lens when addressing issues related to 
genocide and crimes against humanity, not underestimating the relevance of the gender of 
victims. Ms. Rouhana mentioned that her organization had created a &#8220;clinic for men under 
stress&#8221; adopting the strategy of not naming it a clinic for abusers. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Panel 3: Challenges, good practices and opportunities regarding 
remedy and reparations for women subjected to violence 
</b></p>
<p>29. The panel comprised Ruth Rubio-Mar&#237;n, Chair in Comparative Public Law at the 
European University Institute; Sara Hossain, a lawyer and member of the consultative 
group of Bangladesh Legal Aid Service Trust; and Ruben Carranza, Director of the 
Reparative Justice Programme of the International Center on Transitional Justice. 
</p>
<p>30. Ms. Rubio-Mar&#237;n underlined three main challenges in setting up gender-sensitive 
reparations: (a) identification of facts through data gathering and investigation which needs 
to take violence against women seriously and consider the difficulties encountered in 
providing evidence; (b) understanding the extent of the harm caused by the violations when 
there is a lack of knowledge and ability to establish patterns of sequels and consequences 
for the victims; and (c) understanding the harm caused to family members and communities 
beyond the realm of the right-holder. Ms. Rubio-Mar&#237;n added two subsequent challenges, 
namely how to craft gender-specific reparations and ensure that they are an opportunity to 
transform the hierarchies of power that led to the violence. 
</p>
<p>31. Ms. Rubio-Mar&#237;n reviewed the Inter-American Court of Human Rights landmark 
judgement in <i>Gonz&#225;lez et al. (&#8220;Cotton Field&#8221;) v. Mexico</i> that dealt with femicide in Ciudad 
Ju&#225;rez, noting that it was the first time that an international human rights court had 
endorsed the notion that reparations have to be gender-sensitive and transformative. She 
explained that the judgement was made possible by the fact that the Court was willing to 
rely on soft evidence and various sources of documentation to set an adequate standard of 
proof. This broad understanding was also facilitated because the Court was open to taking 
the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence </p>


<p>against Women (&#8220;Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;&#8221;) as a framework for the due diligence requirements. The 
Court said that restoration of the situation prior to the violation was not sufficient and 
confirmed that the structural inequalities had to be subverted. Ms. Rubio-Mar&#237;n stressed 
that, for the first time, a case highlighted the gendered nature of the harms and applied a 
gender perspective to the reparations. 
</p>
<p>32. Ms. Hossain presented examples of public interest cases where national courts in 
Bangladesh had applied various international standards, including CEDAW and its general 
recommendation No. 19, regarding cases of gender-based violence. In these cases, focusing 
mainly on forced veiling and corporal punishment in public institutions, the remedies 
provided for by the courts not only focused on individual relief, but also on broader 
structural changes needed. Ms. Hossain explained that public interest litigation had also 
been used to prevent extra-judicial penalties against women in the name of &#8220;fatwa&#8221;, citing a 
case where the court acknowledged that &#8220;fatwas&#8221; are not recognized by Bangladesh law 
and referred to the constitution and international norms that prohibit violence against 
women. 
</p>
<p>33. Ms. Hossain noted that the main challenges were, inter alia: (a) the endemic level of 
non-compliance with judgements; (b) the difficulty in implementing the judgements from 
the Supreme Court at the local level; (c) the lack of access to justice and legal aid; (d) the 
lack of witness and victim protection measures; (e) gender bias in the criminal justice 
system; and (f) widespread structural poverty. In terms of good practices, these public 
interest cases provided for a combination of individual relief and broader social remedy; the 
possibility for women&#8217;s organizations to petition on behalf of the claimant; the use of 
international law in a progressive and strategic manner; and the focus of remedies on 
preventive aspects. She concluded by recommending the dissemination of progressive 
judgements promoting the use of international law at national level. 
</p>
<p>34. Mr. Carranza structured his presentation around three types of challenges: 
conceptual, practical and ideological. He argued that making reparations transformative 
conceptually went beyond gender. He also pointed out the need to recognize the larger 
context of violence that affects women, not only the direct victims of this violence. In 
Nepal for instance, there were important issues at stake, including caste, class, ethnicity and 
other forms of discrimination, which are usually not dealt with in the reparations 
programmes, in addition to gender discrimination. In Sierra Leone, the original reparations 
proposed by the truth commission could not be implemented for lack of resources. 
</p>
<p>35. Mr. Carranza also emphasized some practical challenges, including the mapping and 
registration of victims and beneficiaries, their participation in designing the reparation 
programmes, and the financial resources needed for implementation of the reparation 
programme itself and its longer-term sustainability, citing the problem of Nepal, where 
implementation of reparations was dependent on donors. Regarding ideological challenges, 
Mr. Carranza affirmed that, if they were to be transformative, reparations should not be 
limited to civil and political rights. He stated that one should wonder about the goals of 
reparations and transitional justice (is it truth, justice or equality?). Reparations should 
strive to subvert gender hierarchies, the systemic marginalization of groups and structural 
inequalities. 
</p>
<p>36. In the discussion session that followed, questions were asked about good practices in 
reaching out to religious leaders; the responsibilities of the State and donors regarding 
funding for reparation programmes; and the direction taken by the International Criminal 
Court vis-&#224;-vis reparations. The representative of Nepal affirmed his country&#8217;s commitment 
to address the issues stemming from the conflict via the two commissions on truth and 
reconciliation. The representative of Peru asked how to overcome obstacles regarding 
registration of victims and ascertainment of facts. The representative of Timor-Leste 
pointed to the uniqueness of the case of Timor-Leste, where most of the perpetrators of the </p>


<p>violations were not from Timor-Leste, and wondered how to bring third countries to 
participate in reparations. The issue of the definition of rehabilitation, which had been 
traditionally understood through a medicalized lens, was raised. It was also noted that in the 
case of the so-called &#8220;comfort women&#8221;, reparations claimed went beyond monetary 
compensation, including a dimension of remembrance and recognition of victims. The 
representative of Bangladesh mentioned that one major challenge was to reach the totality 
of victims of violence against women and raise awareness at community level. There was a 
need to face the issue of awareness at the community level and to address poverty. Finally, 
it was highlighted that in Latin America there had been an increasing acknowledgement of 
State responsibility regarding violence against women which influenced the outcome of the 
<i>Cotton Field</i> case. 
</p>
<p>37. Ms. Hossain explained that international human rights law was used to identify the 
nature of the discrimination and violations; reaching out to elected officials and making 
them aware of the existing law and penalties even for acts committed by private persons. 
Mr. Carranza indicated that some truth commissions had recommended that corporations 
that had profited from the conflict should fund reparations programmes, but these 
recommendations had not been implemented. He added that the International Criminal 
Court still had no reparations system in place, the issue being complicated by the fact that 
the Court convicts individuals and not States. Finally, Ms. Rubio-Mar&#237;n noted that the 
European Court of Human Rights had a narrow interpretation of reparations, intended 
mainly as monetary compensations, while the Inter-American Court of Human Rights had 
taken a broader interpretation. She concluded by insisting that creativity and flexibility are 
needed to reach out to the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Panel 4: Challenges, good practices and opportunities in the prevention 
of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>38. The fourth panel comprised: Jacqui True, senior lecturer at the University of 
Auckland, New Zealand; Zarizana Abdul Aziz, a lawyer and director of the Due Diligence 
Project at the Northeastern University School of Law, Boston, United States; Andrea 
Medina Rosas, representing the network of women from Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, Mexico; Ahmad 
Zia Langari, a Commissioner of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission; 
Rita Sabat, assistant professor at Notre-Dame University; and John Kapito, Chairperson of 
the Malawi Human Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>39. Ms. True explored the broader political and economic context of the violence and 
insecurity as experienced by women, and how economic empowerment could serve as a 
deterrent to violence. She observed that global and local economic power and structures 
played a role in reinforcing gender inequalities that made women more vulnerable to 
violence, in particular women living in poverty, migrant women, indigenous women, and 
young or elderly women. However, the United Nations Secretary-General&#8217;s in-depth study 
on violence against women acknowledged that legal and policy provisions on violence 
against women had not extended to the economic sphere or explored the economic causes 
and impact of this violence. 
</p>
<p>40. Ms. True highlighted the lack of research on what preventative factors to violence 
against women are, as opposed to risk factors. Risk factors at economic, political and social 
levels included the acceptance of violence in the society, the acceptance of male 
superiority, the low status of women, and, at the individual level, a low level of education, 
lack of economic power, alcohol abuse, lack of adequate housing, or lack of independent 
outcome. Preventative factors at the economic, social and political levels included 
property/land rights for women, adequate housing, economic independence, secondary 
education, gender equality norms, and norms on violence. At the individual level, </p>


<p>preventative factors included belonging to an association, healthy parenting, gender 
equality in the family, and education. Political economy theory is helpful to identify the 
causal mechanisms through which these factors affect violence against women, and 
therefore to inform policy interventions. 
</p>
<p>41. Ms. True indicated that violence against women should be addressed in any 
economic development scenario, since it had considerable health-care, employment, 
productivity and criminal justice costs. Preventing violence against women and promoting 
economic development could be mutually reinforcing. She stressed, however, that women&#8217;s 
rising social and economic status was also associated with increased violence against 
women, explaining that this could be the result of increasing economic activity being 
perceived as a &#8220;threat&#8221; to existing male entitlements. Ms. True concluded that every policy 
should be scrutinized to see if it would increase or reduce violence against women, whether 
at local, national or international level. 
</p>
<p>42. Concerning law reform, Ms. Abdul Aziz suggested that there was a need to consider 
the goals and objectives expected from reforming the law. She said that when the law is not 
enforced properly, for instance by the police, the State sends a contradictory message to 
society. Ms. Abdul Aziz insisted on the necessity of providing for an enabling environment 
to enforce the legislation and obtain the support of the various authorities, such as the 
police or religious leaders. 
</p>
<p>43. Ms. Abdul Aziz added that, as violence against women is often an issue that 
involves private or non-State actors, applying the principle of due diligence is key. She 
stated that when linking the issue of violence against women to State responsibility, it was 
not possible to limit this to simply using criminal law. She affirmed that criminal law also 
needs to be customized to address violence against women. Criminal law is adequate for 
one-time offences, but she wondered how to deal with cases of continuous harm, such as 
domestic violence. She explained that the due diligence principle is applied to the inaction 
of the State, because when a State decides not to act, it does not stay neutral, but takes a 
stance for which it should be accountable. Ms. Abdul Aziz concluded that using law reform 
to lead changes was a positive measure, but it was not sufficient and must be accompanied 
by the creation of an enabling environment to garner the support of the society&#8217;s various 
structures and institutions. 
</p>
<p>44. Ms. Medina Rosas noted that the judgment in the <i>Cotton Field</i> case was important 
because the Inter-American Court of Human Rights had applied all the contributions of 
previous work regarding the duty to prevent. The plaintiffs&#8217; legal team had also tried to 
ensure that the court would request Mexico to set up a full programme to prevent violence 
against women. The court had said that the laws and specific institutions already existing in 
Mexico were insufficient in terms of prevention. Yet, she stated, one year after the issuing 
of the judgment, the Mexican State had only published the judgement through the media 
and had just recently adopted a budget line for the compensations ordered in the ruling. 
According to the panellist, the promises to create databases, a memorial, training, protocols, 
counselling, etc. had not been acted upon. She also claimed that little had been done in 
terms of coordination with the various authorities and to fight the persisting impunity. In 
2010, in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez and the State of Chihuahua, no decrease in the murder rate for 
women had been observed. 
</p>
<p>45. Nevertheless, Ms. Medina underscored three good practices stemming from the case. 
She said that, despite the impunity, new victims and their relatives were still trying to 
obtain justice by organizing themselves and filing lawsuits, rather than trying to dispense 
justice themselves. She also noted that a strong network of organizations and people existed 
at local, national and international levels, providing for strong support without which she 
believed the situation would have become worse. Finally, she mentioned that a commission 
had been set up to assess access to justice and justice administration at the local level. </p>


<p>46. Mr. Langari explained that in Afghanistan the main causes of violence against 
women were found at family, society and structural/institutional levels. In the family, 
causes for violence were many and diverse, ranging from illiteracy, poverty, the male-
dominated culture, polygamy, and the prohibition on working outside of the home. At the 
societal level, Mr. Langari cited the abusive environment, cultural and security barriers to 
female education, misinterpretation of Islamic texts, a weak civil society, and lack of 
awareness of women&#8217;s rights, among other causes of violence against women. At the 
governmental level, he said that a weak political commitment to ensuring the presence of 
women in decision-making and managerial positions, the non-existence of affirmative 
measures to empower women, the inadequate educational facilities for girls, poor 
enforcement of the rule of law, and the influence of conservatism and discriminatory 
misperceptions all played a role in favouring violence against women. 
</p>
<p>47. Mr. Langari referred to the recent law on the elimination of violence against women 
adopted by presidential decree in August 2009, but not yet by the Parliament. He said that 
the law, based on both sharia and civil law, had the objectives of protecting the human 
dignity of women, the family and the victims of violence against women, as well as 
promoting public awareness of the issue, and prevention. The law, which recognized 22 
categories of violence, defined violence against women as a crime and a practice that goes 
against Islam, and provided for punishments for perpetrators. Mr. Langari concluded by 
noting that the law on violence against women should be applied over any other 
contradictory legal provision and that the Attorney General&#8217;s office had established a new 
prosecution department for perpetrators of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>48. Ms. Sabat said that while violence against women was internationally defined, at the 
local level State and non-State actors changed the norm or prevented it from being applied 
locally. She added that preventing violence against women requires understanding of the 
circumstances and factors that influence it. One cannot create effective prevention 
strategies for violence against women without identifying all the stages, agents and 
conditions needed to translate the international norm into local reality. She said that in 
Lebanon the prevention of violence against women had to take into account the social 
structural conditions which are tied closely to the country&#8217;s history of civil war, domination 
and occupation. Ms. Sabat emphasized that in Lebanon politics were conflated with 
religion, and the role of religious leaders and confessional laws is particularly important, 
with up to 15 different personal status codes existing in parallel. 
</p>
<p>49. Ms. Sabat indicated that there are inherent practices in society that pose obstacles to 
addressing violence against women: (a) family honour &#8211; whereby the society places the 
burden of upholding family honour on women, shifting the balance of power in favour of 
men who have to protect the family and women&#8217;s honour; (b) family cohesion &#8211; whereby 
women are perceived as ultimately responsible for the preservation of the family; and (c) 
language &#8211; whereby gender-specific language is used to structure relations. There is an 
urgent need to address the underlying causes of violence against women, with a focus on 
individuals, relationships, communities, and society as a whole at the same time. 
</p>
<p>50. Mr. Kapito highlighted the preventive interventions in Malawi. He acknowledged 
that, despite significant progress, women and girls remained highly vulnerable to violence 
and other types of abuse. The forms of violence against women were diverse, including 
high rates of domestic violence, violence related to HIV/AIDS, sexual exploitation, harmful 
traditional practices, and trafficking. Mr. Kapito attributed this situation to a combination of 
factors including high illiteracy rates, the underrepresentation of women in employment 
and the public sector, limited access to and control of productive resources, less access to 
legal and financial assistance, and discriminatory inheritance practices. He noted that all 
these trends led to a feminization of poverty and a perpetuation of the subordination of 
women and their economic dependency. </p>


<p>51. Mr. Kapito mentioned that Malawi had a strong legal framework relating to 
women&#8217;s rights. He said that the law review in progress (including review of the penal code 
and the domestic violence act) and the new legislation being drafted, in particular in the 
areas of human trafficking, gender equality, and HIV/AIDS, also constituted positive 
developments. However, he recognized that subsidiary policy instruments, such as 
implementation regulations, standards of operations and national plans of action, were 
lacking; that financial and human resources were often inadequate; and that services were 
often limited and no enforcement or monitoring systems had been put in place. The factors 
that impeded efforts for combating violence against women were mostly structural and 
deeply rooted, so the programmes for surmounting them should be sustainable and long-
term oriented. 
</p>
<p>52. In the discussion that followed, the representative of Mexico underlined the 
commitment to implement the <i>Cotton Field</i> ruling. The representatives of Algeria, Italy, 
Tunisia and Sweden expressed their countries&#8217; support for the elimination of violence 
against women, and highlighted concrete initiatives to this end, such as the recent launching 
in Italy of a campaign against female genital mutilation. The representative from the 
Russian Federation mentioned that violence against women linked to poverty and alcohol 
were being tackled in all regions of Russia as a matter of priority. The representative of 
Canada asked for specific recommendations on how to address violence against girls at 
school. The representative of the European Union inquired about the role of the new 
Working Group on discrimination against women in law and practice with respect to the 
prevention of violence against women. The representative of UNFPA noted the importance 
of community-based prevention strategies, explaining how traditional justice mechanisms 
can be used to support prevention mechanisms but also to deepen discrimination. The 
important role of civil society in preventing violence against women was also underlined.  
</p>
<p>53. Ms. Abdul Aziz referred to good practices in Indonesia of women&#8217;s groups reaching 
out to religious schools. She underlined the importance of not using religion as an excuse 
for harmful traditional practices, and concluded that this applies to all religions. Mr. Kapito 
highlighted the crucial role played by men in stopping violence against women. Ms. True 
stated that no country had adopted an approach of considering the impact on violence 
against women across all its policies. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Panel 5: Challenges, good practices and opportunities in the protection 
of women subjected to violence 
</b></p>
<p>54. The last panel comprised Sarah Buel, clinical professor of law and director of the 
Diane Halle Center for Family Justice at Arizona State University; and Leanne MacMillan, 
Director of Policy and External affairs at the Medical Foundation for the care of victims of 
torture in the United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>55. Ms. Buel, a domestic violence survivor herself, presented five strategies to enhance 
victims&#8217; protection. Firstly, she indicated that women must be provided with the means and 
information to stay alive at home, at school, at work, before the courts, etc., via a survivor-
centred action plan. Secondly, Ms. Buel said that interventions to protect survivors should 
be holistic; they should include community education to counter victim-blaming, teach 
survivors about their rights, force the media to report accurately, and monitor court 
hearings. These interventions should be &#8220;wrapping victims in services&#8221; and provide them 
with, for instance, budgeting skills, access to safety funds, job hunting assistance, and court 
accompaniment. 
</p>
<p>56. Ms. Buel stated that the third and crucial strategy was the economic empowerment 
of survivors to help them become self-sufficient and independent of the abuser. She said </p>


<p>that it was important to see beyond the abuse and ask the survivor what she or he wished 
for or dreamt of. However, Ms. Buel insisted that the interventions must be sustainable and 
available in the long term. Finally, Ms. Buel said that interventions should have a three-
pronged approach to problem-solving by identifying the problem, identifying who has the 
power or authority to remedy the problem, and how to remedy the problem. She concluded 
by highlighting the importance of the notion of respect for the survivors. 
</p>
<p>57. Ms. MacMillan stated the need to combine different approaches to reach a holistic 
human rights-based approach to victims&#8217; protection, including protecting survivors, 
contributing to the survivors&#8217; resilience and enabling them to access justice. Ms. MacMillan 
pointed out survivors&#8217; desire for rehabilitation, but also overall justice. She said it was 
important to learn from and work with the survivors to define the kind of redress they are 
seeking and use the power of their testimonies to inform and convince decision-makers. 
She added that there were a number of strategies and interventions to rehabilitate a torture 
survivor, the community and the society, but that it was a complex and non-linear process. 
Traumas were not easily conducive to official reporting and producing evidence needed for 
the litigation of cases. 
</p>
<p>58. Ms. MacMillan explained that the rationale behind a long-term holistic approach 
driven by the survivor is that torture has devastating impacts, shattering one&#8217;s identity, with 
consequences for the community and society over generations. She also stressed that 
survivors often did not have the same aspirations as human rights activists, and that redress 
through litigation had limits. Ms. MacMillan recommended developing a human rights-
based awareness of the signs of trauma, especially in asylum contexts; using data from 
survivors to inform the bilateral and multilateral prevention agenda; and using the 
mechanisms available at the United Nations and regional level. 
</p>
<p>59. In the discussion that followed, the representative of Hungary mentioned the 
excellent results obtained in Hungary through the national strategy for promotion of gender 
equality and the strategy for crime prevention. The representative of the European Union 
insisted that particular attention should be paid to violence against women belonging to 
vulnerable groups and noted that national borders were an obstacle to the continuity of 
measures of protection. It was also noted that there were many forms of torture with 
different direct and indirect consequences that had larger repercussions, for instance on 
children. The representative of Australia noted that there were remote areas where 
protection systems could not be built. It was also stressed that litigation put the burden on 
the victims. The need for support programmes for human rights defenders was mentioned. 
Finally, the need to empower victims in the criminal justice system was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>60. Ms. MacMillan explained that in the context of asylum in the EU, it was difficult not 
to have the survivors sent back, but that they had recently been trying to argue for people 
not to be returned to places where they cannot get access to the necessary rehabilitation 
services, not only to places where there is a risk of torture. She also underscored the 
importance of being honest with the victims, especially regarding litigation proceedings, 
and not making any promises, so as to allow for an informed decision. Ms. Buel insisted on 
the importance of involving men in combating violence against women. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions of the expert workshop 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, 
closed the two-day expert workshop by expressing her appreciation to all experts and 
participants for the efforts to shed light on challenges, good practices and 
opportunities in combating all forms of violence against women. She said the ideas, 
experiences, perspectives and contributions shared by all were instrumental in </b></p>


<p><b>improving the ways and means through which cases of violence against women are 
investigated, perpetrators are held accountable and reparations are granted to 
victims, and in contributing to protecting women and ultimately preventing violence 
from occurring. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>She highlighted that analyses from the international level, paired with concrete 
examples on regional and national experiences made for a constructive approach of 
the issue of violence against women. However, in-depth reflection on what works and 
what hampers progress in the elimination of violence against women was still 
essential. The High Commissioner stressed the need to spur further progress in 
implementing and enforcing women&#8217;s rights, and countering gender-based 
discrimination and violence that persisted in both public and private spheres, in 
peace, conflict and transition times. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The High Commissioner acknowledged that violence against women continues 
to be one of the most entrenched forms of discrimination worldwide and tangible 
improvements in the daily lives of millions of women lag well behind commitments 
and intentions. She pointed out that it is everyone&#8217;s responsibility to continue 
breaking down the wall of silence surrounding the countless women who face violence 
and exclusion and to counter the underlying prejudices and discrimination with 
holistic strategies. She concluded that addressing violence against women as a human 
rights issue encouraged an indivisible, holistic and multi-sectoral response. </b></p>
