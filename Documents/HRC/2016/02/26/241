<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons resulting from his visit to 
</p>
<p>Ukraine from 16 to 25 September 2014. The objective of the visit was to examine the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) following the political 
</p>
<p>upheavals and conflict that have affected, in particular, the Autonomous Republic of 
</p>
<p>Crimea and the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. 
</p>
<p>The Government of Ukraine must exercise primary responsibility, rapidly establish 
</p>
<p>more effective systems and step up its efforts to meet the needs and protect the human 
</p>
<p>rights of IDPs. Many fled their homes with few possessions, and thousands remain housed 
</p>
<p>in temporary facilities, reliant on humanitarian assistance. Civil society, churches and 
</p>
<p>volunteers are making heroic efforts, supported by United Nations agencies and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations. However, their capacity and resources are stretched thin and 
</p>
<p>require stronger intervention by government authorities working in close cooperation with 
</p>
<p>them. In view of the lack of comprehensive data on the number, location and needs of 
</p>
<p>displaced persons, full registration and profile of IDPs, including needs assessment, is 
</p>
<p>essential. All registration procedures should be harmonized, and IDPs provided with the 
</p>
<p>necessary documentation to access essential services, pensions, benefits, employment and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with his mandate under Human Rights Council resolution 23/8 and at 
</p>
<p>the invitation of the Government of Ukraine, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, conducted an official visit to Ukraine from 
</p>
<p>16 to 25 September 2014. The objective was to examine the human rights situation of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons (IDPs) following the political upheavals and conflict that have 
</p>
<p>affected, in particular, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the eastern regions of 
</p>
<p>Luhansk and Donetsk. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met senior government officials with responsibilities 
</p>
<p>relating to IDPs including senior representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, 
</p>
<p>Regional Development, and Construction and Housing; the First Deputy Head of the State 
</p>
<p>Service for Migration; the Head of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights; 
</p>
<p>members of the Presidential Administration; the Ombudsperson; the Head of the Kharkiv 
</p>
<p>regional department of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine; representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Lugansk regional state administration; Governors of Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkiv, 
</p>
<p>and Zaporizhzhya; and the former head of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis (Council of 
</p>
<p>Representatives), Mustafa Dzhemilev.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur met numerous civil society representatives, IDPs, volunteer 
</p>
<p>and church groups, and members of the international community. He thanks all of those 
</p>
<p>who met with him and provided essential information to inform his visit and report. He 
</p>
<p>particularly acknowledges the excellent support provided by the United Nations and 
</p>
<p>especially the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), and the Office of the High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Refugees.  
</p>
<p>4. He shared his preliminary findings with the Government and via the media, and 
</p>
<p>appreciates the willingness of government officials to continue to cooperate with his 
</p>
<p>mandate to guarantee the rights of IDPs.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Context of internal displacement in Ukraine 
</b></p>
<p>5. Following the Euromaidan protests and mass demonstrations against President 
</p>
<p>Victor Yanukovych and his suspension of a European Union Association Agreement in late 
</p>
<p>February 2014, the Government was ousted following significant violence in the capital, 
</p>
<p>Kyiv, and other regions. An interim government was formed and met with counter-protests 
</p>
<p>in some regions, notably Donetsk, Luhansk and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea&#8212;
</p>
<p>regions with a high proportion of ethnic Russians&#8212;on the grounds that, inter alia, it 
</p>
<p>allegedly included far-right and nationalist Ukrainian elements seeking to restrict the rights 
</p>
<p>of minorities, including their language and cultural rights. The activities of pro-Russian 
</p>
<p>separatists escalated in February and early March in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, 
</p>
<p>with protests against the Kyiv Government and with heavily armed groups, frequently 
</p>
<p>without insignia, occupying key buildings and strategic locations and confronting Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>military personnel with overwhelming force. The self-proclaimed authorities called a so-
</p>
<p>called &#8220;Referendum&#8221; on 16 March 2014, following which they claimed to have over 96 per 
</p>
<p>cent support for joining the Russian Federation.1  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 On 27 March 2014, the General Assembly established in its resolution 68/262 that the referendum 
</p>
<p>&#8220;had no validity&#8221; and upheld the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>6. March and April 2014 saw an increase in protests and the occupation of strategic 
</p>
<p>buildings by armed groups in several cities and towns in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk 
</p>
<p>regions. In response, on 15 April, the Government initiated an anti-terrorist operation. Over 
</p>
<p>the following weeks violent actions by armed groups escalated dramatically and they 
</p>
<p>declared the so-called &#8220;Peoples Republic of Donetsk&#8221; and &#8220;People&#8217;s Republic of Luhansk&#8221; 
</p>
<p>and called &#8220;referendums&#8221; in May on the future status of those territories. Separatist leaders 
</p>
<p>subsequently announced that, in Donetsk, 89 per cent of voters had opted for self-rule, and 
</p>
<p>that, in Luhansk, the figure was 96 per cent. Sporadic violence escalated into full-scale 
</p>
<p>armed conflict in some regions. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, over 3,600 
</p>
<p>people had been killed since April 2014.  
</p>
<p>7. The number of IDPs had dramatically increased since early June 2014, with 
</p>
<p>displacement from Luhansk and Donetsk regions accounting for the vast majority. Data 
</p>
<p>provided by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
</p>
<p>during the visit and compiled from registrations at the regional level by the State 
</p>
<p>Emergency Service and other bodies, officially showed 310,264 IDPs in Ukraine.2 Those 
</p>
<p>from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea accounted for 17,308, with those from the East 
</p>
<p>numbering 292,956. The Government does not register the ethnicity of those displaced; 
</p>
<p>however, they include ethnic Ukrainians and ethnic Russians, indigenous Tatars and 
</p>
<p>persons belonging to minority groups. There is a disproportionate number of women, 
</p>
<p>children and older persons among those displaced. Men may remain behind to protect 
</p>
<p>property, or resist registering for reasons such as to avoid conscription into the military. All 
</p>
<p>entities concurred that the actual number of IDPs could be up to three times the official 
</p>
<p>registered figure. 
</p>
<p>8. Despite a ceasefire agreement signed in September 2014, hostilities have continued, 
</p>
<p>thereby creating additional displacement. The possibility that the hostilities in the eastern 
</p>
<p>Donbas region will be prolonged and result in further large-scale displacement cannot be 
</p>
<p>discounted. The Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine highlighted3 that, since the 
</p>
<p>ceasefire had begun, between 6 September and 6 October, at least 331 fatalities had been 
</p>
<p>recorded, although some may have occurred prior to the ceasefire. Continued hostilities 
</p>
<p>mean that displacement, initially seen as a temporary measure by the Government and those 
</p>
<p>affected, is becoming longer term, with serious implications for the responses required. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur was informed by national and regional authorities that they 
</p>
<p>had been taken by surprise by events and the large numbers of IDPs and that they lacked 
</p>
<p>experience in responding. They consistently emphasized that the crisis and resulting mass 
</p>
<p>internal displacement was a result of, and had been fuelled by, aggression by the Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation and its direct and indirect support for armed opposition groups in the affected 
</p>
<p>regions. Government sources emphasized that resolution of the current hostilities and safe 
</p>
<p>return to their homes for IDPs was contingent upon an end to external support to armed 
</p>
<p>opposition groups.  
</p>
<p><b>  Autonomous Republic of Crimea 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur was unable to gain access to the Autonomous Republic of 
</p>
<p>Crimea, while remaining guided by General Assembly resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014 
</p>
<p>upholding the territorial integrity of Ukraine. He was unable to consult with any entities or 
</p>
<p>communities in Crimea or to assess the situation relating to the conditions leading to 
</p>
<p>displacement, or which might result in future displacement. In Kyiv he met civil society 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Data released by the State Emergency Service suggests that, as of 2 October, there were 375,792 
</p>
<p>officially registered internally displaced people in Ukraine. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>organizations supporting IDPs from Crimea, and the former head of the Mejlis, Mustafa 
</p>
<p>Dzhemilev. Officially, some 17,000 people have left the territory to date; however, actual 
</p>
<p>numbers are higher owing to some not officially registering with the authorities. The 
</p>
<p>territory has become a displacement destination for some, mostly ethnic Russians, who had 
</p>
<p>fled the Donbas region on account of the armed conflict. The situation of IDPs is difficult to 
</p>
<p>assess owing to a lack of access for the United Nations to the region.  
</p>
<p>11. Those IDPs from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea include ethnic Ukrainians, 
</p>
<p>Crimean Tatars, ethnic Russians and members of other minority ethnic and religious groups 
</p>
<p>as well as mixed families, asylum seekers and foreign nationals formerly resident in 
</p>
<p>Crimea. Numerous factors have influenced their decision to leave and include intimidation 
</p>
<p>and the threat of violence, citizenship issues and pressure to acquire Russian Federation 
</p>
<p>passports and forfeit their Ukrainian ones; and economic and social factors. Ethnic 
</p>
<p>Ukrainians may face intimidation and abuse, for example if using the Ukrainian language in 
</p>
<p>public or being critical of pro-Russian authorities. Some politically active individuals, 
</p>
<p>including leaders of the Mejlis, were banned from re-entering the territory on the grounds 
</p>
<p>of their activities and criticism of the de-facto authorities.  
</p>
<p>12. According to the Government of Ukraine, several Ukrainian citizens (Ukrainian 
</p>
<p>filmmaker Oleh Sentsov, Oleksandr Kolchenko, Oleksiy Chirniy and Gennadiy Afanasiev) 
</p>
<p>were arrested in Crimea and illegally transferred to the Russian Federation. The Russian 
</p>
<p>Federation authorities have reportedly rejected requests from the Government of Ukraine to 
</p>
<p>release them. These Ukrainian citizens, who are charged with terrorism and, according to 
</p>
<p>the Government of Ukraine, have been tortured and humiliated in Russian detention 
</p>
<p>facilities, have not been granted a meeting with the Ukrainian consular officer.  
</p>
<p>13. Interviews conducted by UNHCR and the the Organization for Security and Co-
</p>
<p>operation in Europe (OSCE) indicate that those displaced from the Autonomous Republic 
</p>
<p>of Crimea have lower expectations of return to their homes in the near future than those 
</p>
<p>from the conflict-affected eastern regions. Because of the circumstances and situation 
</p>
<p>leading to their displacement, those from Crimea were generally better prepared, took more 
</p>
<p>belongings and finances for a potentially protracted displacement and may have had greater 
</p>
<p>opportunities to arrange accommodation with relatives or friends than those from the 
</p>
<p>conflict-affected eastern regions. Some decisions to leave may have been based on broader 
</p>
<p>political, social and personal criteria rather than to avoid violence and, consequently, for 
</p>
<p>some IDPs there was an understanding that prospects for return in the short- to medium-
</p>
<p>term were slim.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Frameworks for providing protection and assistance 
to internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>14. In consultations with the Special Rapporteur, all stakeholders stated that legislation 
</p>
<p>on IDPs was amongst their highest priorities, providing a much-needed legislative basis and 
</p>
<p>framework for the protection of their rights and assisting the relevant authorities to swiftly 
</p>
<p>put in place urgently required policy and programme measures. At the time of the visit, 
</p>
<p>draft texts of an IDP law had been prepared that broadly conformed with international </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>standards.4 On 20 October 2014, the Law on the Rights and Freedoms of Internally 
</p>
<p>Displaced Persons was adopted by parliament.  
</p>
<p>15. The law extends a specific set of rights to IDPs, providing protection against 
</p>
<p>discrimination, forcible return and assistance with any voluntary returns. The law also 
</p>
<p>simplifies access to different social and economic services, including social and 
</p>
<p>unemployment benefits and residence registration, required for accessing banking services 
</p>
<p>and registering a business. The adoption of this law requires the Government to start 
</p>
<p>developing an integrated IDP policy. The law will assist the Government in its engagement 
</p>
<p>with international partners and donors and establishes a clear legal framework providing for 
</p>
<p>humanitarian response. 
</p>
<p>16. Prior to adoption of the law, on 1 October, the Cabinet of Ministers adopted 
</p>
<p>resolutions on the registration of IDPs and on financial assistance for acquiring temporary 
</p>
<p>housing. The resolution on registration provides that the Ministry of Social Policy will take 
</p>
<p>the lead in organizing registration, maintaining a unified database of IDPs, and issuing them 
</p>
<p>a standard certificate. The Ministry of Social Policy is working with UNHCR and experts 
</p>
<p>from Georgia on developing tools for registration and data collection, based on the 
</p>
<p>Ministry&#8217;s existing system for processing social benefits. UNHCR has shared its experience 
</p>
<p>and suggestions regarding registration. The registration exercise is scheduled to start in 
</p>
<p>mid-October. The resolution on financial assistance allows able-bodied adults to receive a 
</p>
<p>tax-exempt monthly subsidy of UAH 442 (US$ 34) if they are actively seeking employment 
</p>
<p>or have found employment in displacement locations. Those who are not able to work (i.e. 
</p>
<p>children, the elderly and the disabled) will receive a monthly subsidy of UAH 884 (US$ 68) 
</p>
<p>for six months.5  
</p>
<p>17. The financial costs of addressing the challenges of internal displacement are 
</p>
<p>considerable and are largely falling on regional authorities, which have to use existing 
</p>
<p>budgets earmarked for other activities. Regional authorities consistently raised concerns 
</p>
<p>that their financial resources were inadequate to support the immediate or longer-term 
</p>
<p>needs of IDPs. They underscored that they were hampered in their provision of services to 
</p>
<p>IDPs by legal requirements under which their budgets and financial allocations fell. They 
</p>
<p>urged the immediate adoption and implementation of legislation on IDPs, to create the 
</p>
<p>necessary national legal and budgetary frameworks upon which to base their activities in 
</p>
<p>support of IDPs and call upon additional financial resources. 
</p>
<p>18. In May 2014, the Government had adopted the Law on the Rights and Freedoms of 
</p>
<p>Citizens and the Legal Regime on the Temporarily Occupied Territory of Ukraine, which 
</p>
<p>established a legal framework relating to the occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea 
</p>
<p>and persons who had left that region of Ukraine. The Law regulates such issues as freedom 
</p>
<p>of movement between Crimea and areas under the control of the Government of Ukraine, 
</p>
<p>transit documentation and replacement of identity papers, access to unemployment benefits, 
</p>
<p>and the right to vote. The law does not refer to other territories, since the events in the 
</p>
<p>Donbas region took place after the passing of the law. It was noted that legislation on 
</p>
<p>internal displacement should be harmonized to ensure that there were no undue differences 
</p>
<p>in treatment for those from Crimea and those from other regions.   
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 The Special Rapporteur recommends that consideration be given to amending certain features of the 
</p>
<p>law. Criteria stipulating that IDPs must be citizens of Ukraine do not conform to international 
</p>
<p>standards, under which resident non-citizens may also be IDPs.  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Registration, data and needs assessment 
</b></p>
<p>19. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit there was no unified, coordinated 
</p>
<p>national registration system for IDPs in Ukraine. Registration was undertaken at a regional 
</p>
<p>level by the State Emergency Service and some non-governmental service providers, which 
</p>
<p>were each developing their own systems. However, while some registration systems 
</p>
<p>seemed to be efficiently run and managed via sophisticated computer software, others 
</p>
<p>appeared to be based on paper records or left to volunteer service providers, who record 
</p>
<p>those to whom they provide assistance on an ad-hoc basis.   
</p>
<p>20. Registration and issues relating to documentation is frequently a challenge for States 
</p>
<p>responding to displacement situations and this is no less the case in Ukraine. It is 
</p>
<p>imperative for all the relevant national bodies to achieve accurate data on the number, 
</p>
<p>location and status of displaced persons as soon as possible and to establish a secure and 
</p>
<p>complete database on IDPs. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, there were no 
</p>
<p>accurate statistics on the numbers and profile of displaced persons or any adequate form of 
</p>
<p>registration. Many have sought their own solutions to housing and other needs through 
</p>
<p>family or other ties and have not officially registered with the relevant authorities, not 
</p>
<p>seeing any benefit in registration.  
</p>
<p>21. As an important short-term step, appropriate documentation should be issued 
</p>
<p>enabling access to essential service providers and services. Procedures for displaced 
</p>
<p>persons to temporarily register as residents in their current locations are also necessary to 
</p>
<p>enable them to avoid administrative or documentation barriers to their securing work, 
</p>
<p>shelter or payment of pensions or other benefits. Coordination across government agencies 
</p>
<p>should be improved to ensure assistance can be quickly provided to displaced persons, who 
</p>
<p>frequently have few, if any, financial resources left and are dependent on continuing access 
</p>
<p>to their entitlements.  
</p>
<p>22. The majority of IDPs are unregistered and have found accommodation with relatives 
</p>
<p>or friends. While many are fending for themselves it must not be assumed that their 
</p>
<p>situation is satisfactory. It is important for the authorities to understand and assess their 
</p>
<p>conditions and those of families who may be hosting them, and to identify difficulties that 
</p>
<p>they may be experiencing and their essential needs. All possible efforts should be made to 
</p>
<p>conduct outreach and provide information to those IDPs who may be widely dispersed in 
</p>
<p>private accommodation, particularly in locations estimated to have received high numbers 
</p>
<p>of IDPs.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Preparedness structures, systems and institutions  
</b></p>
<p>23. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine established an inter-agency task force in June 
</p>
<p>2014 under the Deputy Prime Minister, Volodymyr Groisman, to respond to the developing 
</p>
<p>crisis. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service (SES), the government entity in charge of 
</p>
<p>protecting the population and territory from any emergency situations, was tasked to lead 
</p>
<p>the humanitarian response, while the Ministry of Social Policy functions as a Ministry-level 
</p>
<p>focal point for IDP issues and the direction and coordination of assistance at regional levels. 
</p>
<p>A new government coordination agency is envisaged, to take overall responsibility for IDP 
</p>
<p>issues, but was yet to be established. The regional visits undertaken by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur indicated the important role of regional governors and mayors in driving the 
</p>
<p>response to internal displacement through both formal means and more informal business 
</p>
<p>and other contacts. Civil society and volunteer groups frequently described government 
</p>
<p>responses as ad hoc and reactive. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>24. The State Emergency Service is playing an important, front-line role in receiving, 
</p>
<p>registering and referring IDPs to other service providers. The Special Rapporteur consulted 
</p>
<p>senior members of the Service as well as those conducting registration and other functions 
</p>
<p>in direct contact with IDPs in locations including Kharkiv, Mariupol and Zaporizhzhya. In 
</p>
<p>Mariupol and Zaporizhzhya, he visited reception and registration centres which were well 
</p>
<p>organized and efficiently run and in which a registration and needs assessment process was 
</p>
<p>under way. Such centres provided a stamped document indicating official registration as an 
</p>
<p>IDP, which was then required to be produced at a later stage for various forms of 
</p>
<p>assistance.  
</p>
<p>25. The State Emergency Service deserves praise for its efforts and accomplishments to 
</p>
<p>date. Nevertheless the Service is required to take on a role which is beyond its normal 
</p>
<p>functions, experience and responsibilities. Its staff and resources should be returned to their 
</p>
<p>normal duties as soon as possible and replaced by specialist reception and service teams. It 
</p>
<p>was evident that an important function of Emergency Service staff was as a first-contact 
</p>
<p>and information point. Thereafter new arrivals would be put in contact with a range of non-
</p>
<p>governmental and volunteer service providers.  
</p>
<p>26. The State Migration Service, the executive body responsible for migration 
</p>
<p>management, has been contributing to the management of the humanitarian response to the 
</p>
<p>crisis and has a potentially important role in assisting individuals to obtain new residential 
</p>
<p>registration documents. However, laborious procedures and long delays were reported by 
</p>
<p>some of those seeking to re-register their residence documents or receive new or duplicate 
</p>
<p>documents.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The role of volunteers 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur met volunteers working with Crym SOS and Kharkiv 
</p>
<p>Station, and others providing services in receiving areas he visited. They are doing heroic 
</p>
<p>work and selflessly dedicating their time to assisting IDPs. Many are young people, 
</p>
<p>students, some IDPs themselves, and even some with full-time jobs who assist in their spare 
</p>
<p>time. Volunteers consistently expressed the need for greater support from the Government. 
</p>
<p>It was evident that in collective accommodation centres the majority of those providing 
</p>
<p>assistance were unsalaried volunteers who performed a range of necessary functions, 
</p>
<p>including administration and registration, liaison with other service providers, provision of 
</p>
<p>information, sorting and distribution of food, clothing and other provisions, cooking, 
</p>
<p>cleaning and a range of other tasks.   
</p>
<p>28. Despite their tireless efforts, the pressures that volunteers are facing are immense. In 
</p>
<p>many locations the Special Rapporteur witnessed long queues in corridors and in 
</p>
<p>dilapidated reception centres as well as at food and clothing distribution points. Volunteers 
</p>
<p>and United Nations staff members in one location noted that piles of donated clothes could 
</p>
<p>not be distributed because volunteers to sort them were lacking. Volunteers described long 
</p>
<p>working hours to assist those in need and the continuing inflow of new arrivals requiring 
</p>
<p>assistance. The onset of winter placed increasing demands upon volunteers, while the 
</p>
<p>conditions under which they worked became more challenging. 
</p>
<p>29. The continuing reliance on volunteers is unsustainable and alternative staffing 
</p>
<p>solutions should be found that take into account the possibility of further displacement 
</p>
<p>flows from armed conflict-affected areas and the realization that displacement is becoming 
</p>
<p>protracted. Current volunteers may need to seek paid employment or return to their regular 
</p>
<p>jobs or studies, or may otherwise become unavailable, sometimes as a consequence of the 
</p>
<p>stress and workload that they are experiencing. Grants or other forms of short-term 
</p>
<p>employment contracts for volunteers should be considered, to compensate them and ensure 
</p>
<p>that they are able to continue their assistance if they are not otherwise employed. In view of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>parliament resolutions providing monthly payments to IDPs this may be particularly 
</p>
<p>appropriate.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Critical humanitarian and human rights challenges 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur directly consulted IDPs on their situations in all regions that 
</p>
<p>he visited. At the time of his visit, in the Kharkiv region they were mostly accommodated 
</p>
<p>in private houses and apartments, while there were 12 collective accommodation centres. In 
</p>
<p>western parts of Donetsk region, which are under government control, they were mainly 
</p>
<p>housed in summer camps and in rented houses and apartments. In northern and western 
</p>
<p>parts of Luhansk region they were mostly in private houses and apartments, with a 
</p>
<p>relatively small number housed in summer camps and other collective accommodation 
</p>
<p>centres.  
</p>
<p>31. Numerous individuals described the circumstances under which they had fled. Some 
</p>
<p>were visibly traumatized as they described regular indiscriminate shelling of their areas and 
</p>
<p>the destruction of their homes. Some described witnessing people killed and injured, and 
</p>
<p>having to endure periods of fear and uncertainty. Many had left with only what they could 
</p>
<p>carry to reach places of safety and in the hope of a quick return to their homes. For many, 
</p>
<p>their financial resources have been exhausted and they rely on humanitarian assistance for 
</p>
<p>all their shelter, food and other needs. Lack of payment of pensions or other financial 
</p>
<p>benefits or difficulties accessing bank accounts were common problems.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur visited a collective accommodation centre near Kyiv run by 
</p>
<p>the Protestant Church Union, with support by UNHCR. Approximately 196 people, 
</p>
<p>including 44 children, were housed in a hangar without external walls, in a former 
</p>
<p>industrial facility. Rows of bunk beds were arranged in close proximity and separated by 
</p>
<p>blankets or tarpaulins. Families and individuals were allocated sleeping space, with specific 
</p>
<p>areas provided for families. A kitchen and eating area and play area were provided outside 
</p>
<p>and washing and toilet facilities were also available close by. Services and funds were 
</p>
<p>provided by volunteers and donations of food, clothes and toys were being made by the 
</p>
<p>church and residents of Kyiv. No heating was installed and Church leaders noted that they 
</p>
<p>had sought urgent meetings with authorities to highlight the problem, but expected to have 
</p>
<p>to relocate residents to winter accommodation.  
</p>
<p>33. In Kharkiv, the country&#8217;s second city, the Special Rapporteur visited the railway 
</p>
<p>station, in which volunteers and members of the State Emergency Service have established 
</p>
<p>a reception centre where new arrivals are registered, receive information, and may stay for 
</p>
<p>up to two nights in disused railway carriages or station buildings. Some collective 
</p>
<p>accommodation centres visited by the Special Rapporteur in Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia 
</p>
<p>and Mariupol, housing hundreds of people, had basic and cramped conditions, poorly 
</p>
<p>maintained buildings frequently without heating, inadequate shared bathrooms and toilets 
</p>
<p>and only basic cooking or washing facilities. The Special Rapporteur was sometimes 
</p>
<p>informed of building improvement plans; however volunteers consistently expressed 
</p>
<p>concerns that such plans or alternative relocation of IDPs to winterized accommodation 
</p>
<p>were not being implemented.  
</p>
<p>34. The living conditions and well-being of those IDPs who have not registered and who 
</p>
<p>have found accommodation and support with family or friends remains difficult to assess. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is reasonable to assume that challenges include lack of space and facilities 
</p>
<p>in family homes, shortage of food and pressure on finances. It may be the case that for 
</p>
<p>some it is not sustainable to remain with family or friends for long periods and that they 
</p>
<p>may need to consider alternative options, potentially further increasing the pressure on 
</p>
<p>collective accommodation centres. The Special Rapporteur met families who had found </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>refuge in collective centres after having first stayed with relatives, citing the burden they 
</p>
<p>caused to relatives as a reason for leaving. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Winterized accommodation 
</b></p>
<p>35. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the situation was particularly 
</p>
<p>concerning as winter approached. The highest priority for many IDPs was winterized 
</p>
<p>accommodation. Many remained housed in collective centres, summer camps, summer 
</p>
<p>houses lent to them and other facilities inappropriate for winter conditions. The upgrading 
</p>
<p>of such facilities or the relocation of thousands of persons to more suitable accommodation 
</p>
<p>was required. The need for action was urgent and needed to be a high priority for national 
</p>
<p>and regional authorities and all stakeholders. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by 
</p>
<p>meetings with regional authorities, which acknowledged the problem but expressed 
</p>
<p>concerns over their ability to respond within their existing budgets and resources. They 
</p>
<p>underlined the need for legislation on IDPs and central government assistance.  
</p>
<p>36. It was evident that recognition of the impending winter accommodation problem 
</p>
<p>was not being matched with appropriate responses. The Special Rapporteur emphasized 
</p>
<p>that identification of accommodation that was adequate for winter conditions or could be 
</p>
<p>rapidly winterized was an urgent priority for all governments and international 
</p>
<p>organizations. While some regional authorities stated that they had identified land for the 
</p>
<p>construction of buildings and were developing plans, construction projects might not be 
</p>
<p>ready to accommodate individuals for some months and it remained imperative to identify 
</p>
<p>existing appropriate buildings. The Special Rapporteur visited a disused hospital in 
</p>
<p>Mariupol in a poor state of repair that was identified as a potential accommodation centre. 
</p>
<p>It remains necessary to ensure that provision is made for a possible increase in the number 
</p>
<p>of IDPs requiring accommodation.  
</p>
<p>37. It is essential that IDPs are fully informed and consulted about the accommodation 
</p>
<p>options available to them to enable them to make informed choices and consider all options. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was alerted to concerns regarding possible gas shortages over the 
</p>
<p>winter months which, if not resolved, might lead to additional heating problems, 
</p>
<p>particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable, including many displaced persons.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Food, clothing, health care and education 
</b></p>
<p>38. Many IDPs have exhausted their financial resources and rely on humanitarian 
</p>
<p>assistance, including for their access to food. While the public response, including 
</p>
<p>donations of food, has been excellent, it is likely that such donations will decrease over 
</p>
<p>time and alternative sources will soon be required. One volunteer described large quantities 
</p>
<p>of food being left in collection boxes early in the crisis, but stated that they were now 
</p>
<p>almost empty. NGOs are overstretched and short of essential supplies. The problem of 
</p>
<p>access to food is exacerbated by the onset of winter, creating new and heightened 
</p>
<p>challenges relating to the supply and distribution of foodstuffs, as well as communal 
</p>
<p>cooking facilities and fuel.  
</p>
<p>39. In some facilities that the Special Rapporteur visited, space considerations and 
</p>
<p>available facilities required volunteers to distribute food, clothes and other assistance in 
</p>
<p>outside distribution locations where people would queue, often for considerable periods. In 
</p>
<p>some locations, kitchen and eating facilities were also located outside of the main 
</p>
<p>accommodation buildings. Such facilities would not be viable in cold weather conditions 
</p>
<p>and alternative solutions would be required to enable people to queue to obtain food </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>products in indoor facilities close to their places of accommodation. Equally, non-food 
</p>
<p>items such as cooking sets were required.   
</p>
<p>40. Many were displaced over the summer months, with the expectation of a rapid 
</p>
<p>return, and were able to carry few belongings with them. Many fled without winter clothing 
</p>
<p>adequate for the harsh winter temperatures. Displaced persons and volunteers expressed 
</p>
<p>concerns regarding provision of winter clothing, particularly necessary for those living in 
</p>
<p>poorly heated or insulated accommodation, as winter temperatures regularly reach -20&#176; 
</p>
<p>Celsius. The elderly are highly vulnerable to the cold and require plentiful warm clothing 
</p>
<p>and blankets in addition to being housed in winterized accommodation. Those from the 
</p>
<p>eastern regions often left with few belongings, including clothes, owing to the urgency of 
</p>
<p>their flight to avoid the conflict.  
</p>
<p>41. While it was evident that the general public had made significant donations of 
</p>
<p>clothes, concern was expressed regarding the provision of suitable winter clothing, 
</p>
<p>including coats and boots, as well as the shortage of volunteers to sort and distribute 
</p>
<p>clothing effectively. Some initiatives to provide winter clothing were under way and 
</p>
<p>effective. In Mariupol, UNHCR was working closely with local authorities and private 
</p>
<p>business to ensure the provision of good quality warm children&#8217;s clothing. Upon 
</p>
<p>registration of families, the children&#8217;s sizes required were noted, enabling local producers 
</p>
<p>to meet the requirements precisely.   
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur learned that those with chronic health conditions may face 
</p>
<p>difficulties in accessing care that they may urgently need. While free basic primary health 
</p>
<p>care is in place in most localities, it is important to ensure that those in need of urgent 
</p>
<p>medical care or with chronic medical conditions are swiftly identified and that provision is 
</p>
<p>made for their treatment. Some IDPs indicated that they did not have access to essential 
</p>
<p>medicines, which were not available to them free of charge. The authorities acknowledged 
</p>
<p>the problem of access to medicines and noted that they were attempting to respond to needs 
</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis.  
</p>
<p>43. The provision of reproductive health care for pregnant women is a priority in terms 
</p>
<p>of their access to specialist medical assistance, winterized housing and other essential 
</p>
<p>services. Numerous stakeholders also noted the psychological impact of stress, trauma due 
</p>
<p>to proximity to armed conflict and subsequent displacement experiences. Children may be 
</p>
<p>particularly affected by their experiences. Counselling is being made available to IDPs by 
</p>
<p>specialists who frequently volunteer their time to assist them. Nevertheless such services 
</p>
<p>may be inconsistent or short-term in nature and a needs assessment is required to fully 
</p>
<p>understand the extent of requirements.   
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur was informed that most school-age internally displaced 
</p>
<p>children are able to continue their education through temporary registration in local schools 
</p>
<p>at the beginning of the school year, which coincided with his visit. He considers this to be a 
</p>
<p>significant and important achievement, rapidly addressing education needs and ensuring 
</p>
<p>that internally displaced children do not fall behind in their studies. Nevertheless the 
</p>
<p>situation should continue to be closely monitored to ensure that all internally displaced 
</p>
<p>children have access to quality education. A number of challenges in the field of education 
</p>
<p>remain to be addressed.  
</p>
<p>45. A shortage of kindergarten places was consistently highlighted, restricting younger 
</p>
<p>internally displaced children from gaining places; however this shortfall also affects the 
</p>
<p>general population. Any preferential treatment for internally displaced children may be 
</p>
<p>poorly perceived by some parents. Where possible, temporary and creative solutions should 
</p>
<p>be considered, which may include providing work for suitably qualified or experienced 
</p>
<p>internally displaced teachers. This may, for example, enable them to establish temporary or 
</p>
<p>longer-term kindergarten and childcare facilities which might also provide some income to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>women and enable other women to consider part-time employment opportunities while 
</p>
<p>their children are cared for.  
</p>
<p>46. Owing to the traumatic experiences of some internally displaced children, it is 
</p>
<p>important to monitor their psychosocial wellbeing to ensure that necessary counselling or 
</p>
<p>support is provided. Sensitivity should be exercised to ensure that internally displaced 
</p>
<p>children do not face any stigmatization, bullying, discrimination or exclusion on account of 
</p>
<p>their situation. In addition, internally displaced children may experience difficult 
</p>
<p>circumstances and require special assistance, for example with regard to meals, clothes and 
</p>
<p>school materials. It was noted that some parents were not sending their children to school, 
</p>
<p>primarily on account of their expectation of a rapid return to their places of origin. Where 
</p>
<p>displacement becomes longer term, all children must have access to appropriate education 
</p>
<p>at all levels.  
</p>
<p>47. Those students enrolled in higher education in their places of origin are frequently 
</p>
<p>unable to continue their studies in their new locations owing to shortage of places, lack of 
</p>
<p>financial resources to cover fees and inability to transfer fees or scholarships from their 
</p>
<p>previous education institutions. The Government, in coordination with education 
</p>
<p>institutions, is urged to consider solutions to ensure that students who have paid fees or 
</p>
<p>received scholarships are able to continue their studies while also ensuring that there is no 
</p>
<p>unfair impact on other students, for example, resulting in their losing places owing to 
</p>
<p>preference being given to IDPs. Lack of places at institutions of higher education may be a 
</p>
<p>challenge to the enrolment of IDPs.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Employment  
</b></p>
<p>48. A frequently stated problem for IDPs is finding employment and income-generating 
</p>
<p>opportunities. Some have had the personal and financial resources to set up small 
</p>
<p>businesses or to locate work opportunities. However, several of those interviewed described 
</p>
<p>barriers to employment, including problems with residence registration in their places of 
</p>
<p>origin, their work records&#8212;required by prospective new employers&#8212;which are still with 
</p>
<p>former employers, and discrimination when they identify themselves as displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>Some described negative reactions by potential employers in relation to their situation, 
</p>
<p>where they are from and the fact that they may not stay long term. Without access to 
</p>
<p>employment, many will need social benefits as guaranteed by law, placing further stress on 
</p>
<p>public finances.  
</p>
<p>49. Current economic conditions in some affected regions have resulted in high 
</p>
<p>unemployment rates among the general population. The industrial heartland of Ukraine, in 
</p>
<p>the eastern provinces, has been dramatically affected by the armed conflict. It is therefore 
</p>
<p>not easy for labour markets to absorb an influx of IDPs. Those with professional or 
</p>
<p>specialist skills have greater opportunities, and evidence suggests that some have found the 
</p>
<p>resources to set up small businesses in relocation areas. Challenges to finding employment 
</p>
<p>may be experienced by those without skills, women with young children, the elderly and 
</p>
<p>those lacking the required documents. Some have not sought work owing to the uncertainty 
</p>
<p>of their situation and their desire to return to their places of origin as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>Equally, some skilled workers may be reluctant to accept available low-skilled work. 
</p>
<p>50. Employment and livelihood programmes and initiatives are required for those who 
</p>
<p>are unable to return to their former employers or livelihoods, or who have had their 
</p>
<p>business premises damaged or destroyed.6 Some short-term initiatives to link IDPs with 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>prospective employers have begun, mostly by means of the provision of information boards 
</p>
<p>in reception centres. As displacement is becoming protracted, urgent consideration of 
</p>
<p>employment and livelihood initiatives must be considered, including public works 
</p>
<p>programmes, and construction and renovation projects that might also provide suitable 
</p>
<p>short- or longer-term accommodation solutions.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Property rights 
</b></p>
<p>51. The status of property belonging to IDPs in their places of origin in the Autonomous 
</p>
<p>Republic of Crimea and in Luhansk and Donetsk regions is inevitably an issue of 
</p>
<p>considerable concern for affected persons and authorities. The homes of many of those 
</p>
<p>displaced from the east of Ukraine have been badly damaged or destroyed by shelling. 
</p>
<p>Others who fled the fighting abandoned their homes and may not know whether they 
</p>
<p>remain intact. It is evident from interviews conducted with IDPs that in numerous cases 
</p>
<p>individuals&#8212;frequently male family members&#8212;may have remained in unsafe or occupied 
</p>
<p>locations in order to protect property and belongings, potentially putting themselves at risk. 
</p>
<p>Available statistics also indicate a far higher percentage of internally displaced women and 
</p>
<p>children than men. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur was informed by a number of those IDPs and others whom 
</p>
<p>he consulted that persons who had left regions that were under the control of the armed 
</p>
<p>groups were beginning to receive telephone calls or messages informing them that if they 
</p>
<p>did not return within a matter of days their property would be confiscated. While 
</p>
<p>unconfirmed, such reports were creating concern amongst IDPs. They might lead some to 
</p>
<p>return prematurely to locations that may not be safe in order to reclaim their property, 
</p>
<p>potentially putting them at risk. Further unverified reports indicated that persons wishing to 
</p>
<p>leave affected regions were required to register before departure and to pay bribes in order 
</p>
<p>to be allowed to leave with their belongings.  
</p>
<p>53. For those internally displaced from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, property 
</p>
<p>issues are no less concerning. Uncertainty over the long-term status of the territory and the 
</p>
<p>implications in terms of property rights for those who fled the region remains. NGOs 
</p>
<p>representing IDPs noted that it is currently not possible to sell property, including houses 
</p>
<p>and apartments or cars, in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea owing to the change in the 
</p>
<p>de-facto authorities and to administrative and bureaucratic procedures not being fully 
</p>
<p>operational. Some commentators report that a further flow of displaced persons may occur 
</p>
<p>as such issues are resolved and those in Crimea who do not wish to stay, but who have 
</p>
<p>remained to look after property, are eventually able to sell their homes.  
</p>
<p>54. For those who become permanently displaced owing to an inability or unwillingness 
</p>
<p>to return to their places of origin, durable solutions will be required that should include 
</p>
<p>solutions to outstanding property issues. Where property has been permanently lost, 
</p>
<p>appropriate compensation based on the value of the property lost or the provision of 
</p>
<p>property of commensurate value should be provided by the appropriate authorities. For 
</p>
<p>those who return to their properties to find them occupied, all ownership rights are retained 
</p>
<p>by the legitimate owners and the property should revert to them.    
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>regions have ceased activity owing to the fighting, leaving thousands without an income. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> E. Particularly vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>55. Some IDPs are particularly vulnerable and have specific medical and support needs. 
</p>
<p>The Ministry for Regional Development highlights that 34,700 persons with disabilities and 
</p>
<p>older persons were internally displaced as of 8 September 2014. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>met some individuals with disabilities and older persons and noted their particular concerns, 
</p>
<p>which included lack of access to essential medicines and to necessary specialist support. 
</p>
<p>The ability of such individuals to cope in unfamiliar conditions without regular support 
</p>
<p>networks is severely hampered and some whom he met were clearly distressed. A localized 
</p>
<p>assessment of the needs of the most vulnerable people should be undertaken as a priority, 
</p>
<p>with a view to ensuring that facilities provided fully reflect their physical and emotional 
</p>
<p>needs and ability to cope. 
</p>
<p>56. Representatives of the Roma community raised concerns about the estimated 1,000 
</p>
<p>Roma displaced as of 18 August owing to the prevailing insecurity.7 Roma reportedly face 
</p>
<p>discrimination and marginalization even under normal conditions and are among the 
</p>
<p>poorest in society. It was emphasized that many Roma lack documents and are therefore in 
</p>
<p>a precarious position. Lack of documents hampers the ability of Roma to register as 
</p>
<p>displaced persons and consequently they may face serious barriers to access to assistance 
</p>
<p>including accommodation, food and clothing. Roma may be isolated, reluctant to engage 
</p>
<p>with the authorities, and lack access to information about available services. The authorities 
</p>
<p>must provide outreach to Roma and ensure that no discrimination exists in access to 
</p>
<p>essential services for them or other marginalized groups.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Prevention of discrimination and stigmatization 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur has been impressed by the level of societal support for IDPs, 
</p>
<p>which has been evident through donations of food, clothing and other assistance by the 
</p>
<p>general public and the work of volunteers. However, he also heard reports of some 
</p>
<p>stigmatization and discrimination experienced by some individuals. It is important to 
</p>
<p>address any discrimination against displaced persons and any tensions that exist before they 
</p>
<p>are allowed to escalate. While the Special Rapporteur was not informed of significant 
</p>
<p>tensions, he did receive some anecdotal evidence of emerging tensions between host 
</p>
<p>communities and displaced persons and warned that measures should be taken to ensure 
</p>
<p>that such issues do not escalate.  
</p>
<p>58. As the political situation has evolved, some described a growth in negative 
</p>
<p>perceptions towards IDPs, which impacts on how those who have been internally displaced, 
</p>
<p>particularly those from the east, are viewed, and could affect their integration. Some are 
</p>
<p>perceived to be separatist sympathisers or unpatriotic on the basis of their places of origin, 
</p>
<p>which may impact on reactions to them in host communities, and their ability to gain 
</p>
<p>employment or to integrate easily into new localities. It was noted that some internally 
</p>
<p>displaced men may not register officially or seek to re-register their residence status, in 
</p>
<p>order to avoid conscription into the armed forces. Reactions to IDPs from the east among 
</p>
<p>those who have had family members recruited into the armed forces may be particularly 
</p>
<p>negative in such cases. While IDPs should abide by national laws, including conscription 
</p>
<p>laws, the fact that their families are in a displacement situation, with the loss of their usual 
</p>
<p>social environment, possible trauma and lack of livelihood opportunities should be taken 
</p>
<p>into account by the authorities when deciding whether to enrol them for military service. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>59. Host communities or families which are already poor may find their resources 
</p>
<p>severely stretched by the need to accommodate and support IDPs. Care is required to ensure 
</p>
<p>that host communities or families providing shelter do not suffer shortages or other negative 
</p>
<p>impacts. Where necessary they should have access to some of the appropriate support and 
</p>
<p>assistance mechanisms that are available to the IDPs.  
</p>
<p>60. Personnel of regional authorities in conflict-affected areas and those displaced 
</p>
<p>reported that some senior and junior officials were facing prosecution for their activities 
</p>
<p>while under the de-facto authority of the self-proclaimed &#8220;Donetsk people&#8217;s republic&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Luhansk people&#8217;s republic&#8221;. Many officials continued to carry out their duties in areas 
</p>
<p>taken over during the period. Charges, including accusations of collaboration, have been 
</p>
<p>made against some officials. Officials in some eastern regions suggested that they are 
</p>
<p>viewed with unjustified suspicion by the national authorities, which may impact on the 
</p>
<p>support that they receive.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Gender issues and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>61. Internally displaced women may face particular challenges on the basis of their 
</p>
<p>gender, identity and situation of displacement. They may be vulnerable to sexual and 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence both during the period of displacement and in displacement 
</p>
<p>destinations. Displacement may involve travel through militarized zones and checkpoints 
</p>
<p>controlled by both sides, which may make women passing through them highly vulnerable 
</p>
<p>to sexual violence or other forms of human rights abuse. In displacement destinations they 
</p>
<p>may be separated from their spouses, or find themselves in vulnerable situations owing to 
</p>
<p>the cramped conditions in which they live. Lack of financial resources may make some 
</p>
<p>women more vulnerable to exploitation or trafficking, particularly those who may not have 
</p>
<p>access to support mechanisms and services.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur notes that he was not informed of cases of sexual or gender-
</p>
<p>based violence against internally displaced women by those whom he met or the authorities 
</p>
<p>and others supporting them in the various locations that might indicate a pattern or practice 
</p>
<p>of violence against women. Nevertheless, the threat of such violations potentially targeting 
</p>
<p>women fleeing armed conflict by combatants and armed groups or other non-combatants 
</p>
<p>must be taken seriously and any incidents or allegations of such violations investigated and 
</p>
<p>monitored. Many of those leaving armed conflict-affected areas have not registered with the 
</p>
<p>authorities and may not have been in a position to report abuse or violence. No assumptions 
</p>
<p>should be made that sexual or gender-based violence is absent.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Detention and filtering of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>63. Some reports were received regarding allegations of detention and ill-treatment of 
</p>
<p>individuals, including IDPs, by armed groups in territories which they control, and 
</p>
<p>personnel of the Ukrainian armed forces. Those leaving areas of conflict are required to 
</p>
<p>pass through frequent checkpoints on both sides of the line of contact, during which time 
</p>
<p>they may be particularly vulnerable to violation of their rights by military personnel or 
</p>
<p>unidentified others manning checkpoints. Reports indicate that younger males, particularly, 
</p>
<p>have been subject to detention, interrogation, theft of their property, forced recruitment into 
</p>
<p>armed groups and forced labour, for example to dig trenches or other military installations. 
</p>
<p>Unverified reports of enforced or involuntary disappearances were communicated to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>64. Armed groups have been accused of arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of some 
</p>
<p>considered to be Ukrainian sympathizers in the areas under their control. Those returning to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>eastern regions either to remain or temporarily to regain property are vulnerable to abuse of 
</p>
<p>their rights, for example at checkpoints. Equally, unverified reports suggested that 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian volunteer battalions, including &#8220;Aydar&#8221;, &#8220;Dnipro-1&#8221;, &#8220;Kyiv-1&#8221; and &#8220;Kyiv-2&#8221;, are 
</p>
<p>responsible for enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of some IDPs 
</p>
<p>and of &#8220;filtering&#8221; to identify those who are accused of separatist activities or sympathies. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur reminded the Government and all armed groups that, under 
</p>
<p>international standards, IDPs must be free from arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment or any violation of their rights.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Achieving durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>65. The situation of many IDPs is likely to be protracted owing to the nature of the 
</p>
<p>political and military situations in both the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and affected 
</p>
<p>territories in Donetsk and Luhansk. The prospect of the situation in Donbas evolving into a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;frozen conflict&#8221;, under which some regions remain outside the administrative, political or 
</p>
<p>military control of the Government of Ukraine is increasingly possible, and will have a 
</p>
<p>significant impact on the possibility of, and desire for, return for some IDPs.  
</p>
<p>66. Reports received by UNHCR indicate that some IDPs have been returning to their 
</p>
<p>places of origin, including areas regained by the Ukrainian military under its Anti-Terrorist 
</p>
<p>Operation, and that others have been returning to the areas controlled by the armed groups. 
</p>
<p>Precise figures were unavailable at the time of the visit. UNHCR did not recommend return 
</p>
<p>to some locations owing to concerns including ongoing and indiscriminate shelling, as well 
</p>
<p>as lack of infrastructure and basic necessities, such as water, electricity and food in some 
</p>
<p>locations. Nevertheless some individuals return either with a view to staying permanently 
</p>
<p>and reclaiming property, or for shorter periods to gather belongings such as winter clothes.  
</p>
<p>67. Some IDPs may face physical impediments to their return to their area of origin by 
</p>
<p>de-facto authorities such as border or visa requirements or bans imposed on account of their 
</p>
<p>political or other allegiances. While many others may not face such impediments, the 
</p>
<p>political and social reasons for their initial flight may remain unresolved and include the 
</p>
<p>threat or fear of persecution or violence; political affiliation and/or the desire to remain 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian and not fall under another authority or be required to change citizenship; 
</p>
<p>economic factors including the loss of property or employment without the prospect of 
</p>
<p>compensation; and numerous other social and personal factors. Owing to the complex 
</p>
<p>dynamics of nationality, territory, geopolitics and personal identity, many will be faced 
</p>
<p>with a difficult equation regarding a decision to return to their former homes in the 
</p>
<p>Autonomous Republic of Crimea or the affected eastern regions. Any decision to return 
</p>
<p>must be entirely voluntary.  
</p>
<p>68. In view of the possible protracted displacement it is essential that government puts 
</p>
<p>in place policies, frameworks, support structures and programmes to ensure durable 
</p>
<p>solutions.8 It is imperative that short-term, transitional solutions, such as temporary 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
8
 According to The Inter-Agency Standing Committee Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally 
</p>
<p>Displaced Persons a durable solution is achieved when IDPs no longer have any specific assistance 
</p>
<p>and protection needs that are linked to their displacement, and can enjoy their human rights without 
</p>
<p>discrimination on account of their displacement. This can be achieved through sustainable 
</p>
<p>reintegration at the place of origin; sustainable local integration in areas where IDPs take refuge; or 
</p>
<p>sustainable integration in another part of the country. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution 
</p>
<p>enjoy, without discrimination: long-term safety, security and freedom of movement; an adequate 
</p>
<p>standard of living, access to adequate food, water, housing, health care and basic education; access to 
</p>
<p>employment and livelihoods; and access to effective mechanisms that restore their housing, land and 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>collective accommodation centres and modalities for the provision of food, clothing, 
</p>
<p>financial support, health care and education, are not mistaken for durable solutions. If a 
</p>
<p>displacement situation becomes extended, suitable housing must be provided, for example, 
</p>
<p>that allows IDPs to live in dignity in accommodation appropriate to their needs and their 
</p>
<p>family requirements with regard to available space, privacy, facilities and proximity to 
</p>
<p>services, and employment and livelihood opportunities. 
</p>
<p>69. It is essential that Ukraine learns from the experiences of countries facing similar 
</p>
<p>internal displacement challenges, such as Georgia, Azerbaijan and Serbia, in which internal 
</p>
<p>displacement has become protracted and durable solutions were delayed or neglected. 
</p>
<p>Lessons must be learned from such situations to help Ukraine as it puts in place the 
</p>
<p>necessary frameworks, structures and programmes to address the IDP situation, and moves 
</p>
<p>towards a situation in which many of those currently displaced can envisage secure and 
</p>
<p>supported return to their places of origin, or other appropriate durable solutions. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. The role of the international community 
</b></p>
<p>70. The ongoing crisis and consequent humanitarian and human rights challenges are of 
</p>
<p>a magnitude which is beyond the capacity of the national Government to respond to 
</p>
<p>effectively. The current capacity and resources of United Nations agencies and other 
</p>
<p>international and national NGOs are also stretched thin and are insufficient to respond to 
</p>
<p>existing needs, let alone the consequences of possible further displacement. As winter 
</p>
<p>approached, the pressure on all entities providing support to IDPs increased and they 
</p>
<p>required greater support and financial resources. The international community has an 
</p>
<p>important role in this respect.  
</p>
<p>71. In August 2014, the humanitarian community together with the Government issued a 
</p>
<p>Preliminary Response Plan to guide the humanitarian response in the country.9 It required 
</p>
<p>US$ 33.3 million in the fields of preparedness, humanitarian response and its coordination, 
</p>
<p>and national legislation to monitor the humanitarian situation, particularly in the areas 
</p>
<p>affected by violence, IDP-receiving areas and the areas of potential return, and to support 
</p>
<p>livelihood opportunities, basic services and reconciliation programming in post-conflict 
</p>
<p>areas. 
</p>
<p>72. Immediate needs include the provision of both food and non-food items and the 
</p>
<p>rapid construction or renovation of suitable accommodation in displacement locations. 
</p>
<p>Longer-term assistance and reconstruction efforts are also required to enable people to 
</p>
<p>return to their homes. Infrastructure projects to restore water, electricity and other essential 
</p>
<p>services must also be rapidly put in place.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur discussed with government and United Nations officials the 
</p>
<p>importance of early engagement in order to support self-reliance, livelihoods and 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic opportunities for IDPs and host communities. An important initiative is a 
</p>
<p>proposed European Investment Bank programme to restore the infrastructure of the areas 
</p>
<p>affected by fighting and meet the urgent needs of displaced persons. Early engagement by 
</p>
<p>development actors is essential and should be encouraged and replicated where required. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>property or provide them with compensation.

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General comments 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Government representatives frequently stated that Ukraine had been taken by 
</b></p>
<p><b>surprise by the crisis and the subsequent high numbers of IDPs and that they were not 
</b></p>
<p><b>experienced in dealing with internal displacement situations. The numbers of those 
</b></p>
<p><b>displaced had escalated rapidly as a consequence of the armed conflict and the actions 
</b></p>
<p><b>of armed opposition groups and those supporting them, and of </b>the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>subsequent Anti-Terrorist Operation. The national and regional authorities were 
</b></p>
<p><b>unprepared administratively and logistically to cope adequately with the large 
</b></p>
<p><b>numbers of IDPs.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Hostilities in the eastern regions of Ukraine have caused massive internal 
</b></p>
<p><b>displacement and untold suffering both to those displaced and to those remaining in 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas affected by the hostilities. It is essential for all parties to the hostilities to bring 
</b></p>
<p><b>the fighting to an end without delay, to protect civilians and to adhere fully to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions of peace agreements, including the Minsk Agreement of September 2014. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This is critical to the prevention of further internal displacement and to ensuring the 
</b></p>
<p><b>future secure return of IDPs to their homes on a voluntary basis.   
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 68/262, on the territorial integrity of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ukraine, measures must be taken to protect the rights of IDPs affected by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Credit must be given to regional authorities that have taken effective steps to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respond quickly to the situation despite limited resources. In Dnepropetrovsk, 
</b></p>
<p><b>Kharkiv, Mariupol and Zaporizhzhya, the Special Rapporteur was impressed by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment of the authorities to meet the needs of IDPs. Nevertheless, to date the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national Government</b>&#8217;s<b> support for its regional counterparts has been inadequate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>lacking in leadership. It is characterized by a reactive rather than anticipatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach that indicates a lack of acknowledgement of the extent and probable 
</b></p>
<p><b>duration of the IDP situation.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The budgetary resources of government bodies, in particular regional entities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>are stretched far beyond their ability to respond adequately to the IDP situation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nevertheless, to the fullest extent possible, they should focus their efforts and 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention, and dedicate the necessary resources, towards the needs of IDPs who face 
</b></p>
<p><b>urgent, and in some cases potentially life-threatening conditions. Urgent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>substantial international assistance is required to address the issue. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Government must ensure that it complies fully with its obligations under 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards, including the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, 
</b></p>
<p><b>for all those IDPs within its territories, and guarantee all their human rights without 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The adoption in October 2014 of the law on the rights and freedoms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>internally displaced persons is welcomed, although some revisions may be required to 
</b></p>
<p><b>bring it fully into line with international standards. It will enable more effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>responses to the needs of IDPs, with appropriate budgets in place. Full and rapid 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the Law is now of paramount importance and the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>should establish a clear roadmap and implementation strategy to ensure that it takes 
</b></p>
<p><b>effect without unnecessary delay.   </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>  Registration, data and needs assessment 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Registration procedures are currently ad hoc and inadequate to meet the needs 
</b></p>
<p><b>of IDPs, creating obstacles to their access to essential assistance, provision of social 
</b></p>
<p><b>benefits and residence registration, inter alia. Registration should be harmonized for 
</b></p>
<p><b>IDPs, with documentation for access to essential services and the chance to gain 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment and livelihood opportunities, and to vote in elections.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Noting the lack of comprehensive data on the number, location and needs of 
</b></p>
<p><b>IDPs, full registration and profiling, including a comprehensive needs assessment, are 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential. This should extend to the many who are unregistered and not receiving 
</b></p>
<p><b>government support with regard to housing, food and other essential needs. Data 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also be gathered on the needs of families and communities hosting IDPs that 
</b></p>
<p><b>may be significantly affected and also require assistance.   
</b></p>
<p><b>  Preparedness structures, systems and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>It is evident that there is no coherent coordination mechanism with, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>between, national and regional administrations. Frontline services are mostly 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided by volunteers, civil society and regional administration authorities, with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>support of UNHCR. Registration systems are not harmonized. There is an inadequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>organized response to the internal displacement situation in Ukraine. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Responsibility and coordination across government ministries, agencies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>services is currently unclear and inadequate to respond effectively to the situation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Now that legislation is in place, systems, processes and institutional mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be improved to ensure that assistance can be quickly provided to IDPs, who 
</b></p>
<p><b>commonly have few, if any, financial resources and are dependent on continuing 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to their pensions and other benefits.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>On the basis of the Law on IDPs, priorities must include: a harmonized and 
</b></p>
<p><b>coordinated registration process to be used both regionally and nationally; clearly 
</b></p>
<p><b>defined responsibilities for issues related to displaced persons and support for them 
</b></p>
<p><b>under the general leadership of a dedicated government body; and the establishment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of long-term planning and a national strategy to address the short-, medium- and 
</b></p>
<p><b>long-term needs of IDPs and the need for durable solutions.   
</b></p>
<p><b>  The role of civil society and volunteers 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Volunteers and church-based groups are making heroic efforts around the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country, supported by United Nations agencies and NGOs. Their capacity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources are stretched thin and require stronger intervention by government 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities working in close cooperation with them. The weight of responsibility on 
</b></p>
<p><b>voluntary and civil society organizations must be lifted through more direct 
</b></p>
<p><b>intervention by government authorities. Specific initiatives to support their efforts, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including financial assistance and the transfer of key responsibilities and services to 
</b></p>
<p><b>salaried staff, should be considered.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Winterized housing 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>At the time of his visit, no collective accommodation facilities visited by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur were appropriate for winter temperatures. Winter caused 
</b></p>
<p><b>increasing hardship for many who fled with few possessions, thousands of whom were 
</b></p>
<p><b>housed in such facilities. The Government must ensure as an urgent priority that 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate accommodation, including winterized shelter where necessary, is 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided for all IDPs, to alleviate the severity of the challenges. The Government </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>should take every measure to ensure that no one lacks access to heated housing in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which they can live in dignity.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Food, clothing, health care and education  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Addressing urgent needs in the area of provision of food, clothing, health care 
</b></p>
<p><b>and education must be a high priority for national and regional governments to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure the health and well-being of IDPs. Provision of essential assistance cannot be 
</b></p>
<p><b>left to voluntary contributions from the general public or non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations as has been commonplace in the response in some regions to date.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>A coordinated, government-led assistance strategy, in cooperation with regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities, and United Nations and other international entities as appropriate, is 
</b></p>
<p><b>required to ensure that adequate food, clothing and other essential non-food items are 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided in a systematic and timely manner. This is especially important in winter 
</b></p>
<p><b>and for children, the elderly, persons with disabilities and other particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable persons.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>While primary health-care needs are being met, including psychosocial care, 
</b></p>
<p><b>free access to medicines must be provided for all IDPs who lack resources. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific health-care needs of pregnant women, the elderly and disabled persons must 
</b></p>
<p><b>be given a high priority. Access to education for internally displaced children has 
</b></p>
<p><b>largely been facilitated. However, specific challenges include access to kindergarten 
</b></p>
<p><b>places, ensuring all children are attending school, and assisting students to find places 
</b></p>
<p><b>to continue higher education courses without additional costs.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Particularly vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Specific attention should be given to the situation of particularly vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, pregnant women and others 
</b></p>
<p><b>who are poorly equipped to cope with displacement, distressed or vulnerable to illness. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A comprehensive needs assessment should be conducted in each displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b>location.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Particular attention should also be given to those IDPs belonging to 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized groups or minorities such as Roma to ensure that all have equal access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to assistance and support services and that no discrimination exists with regard to 
</b></p>
<p><b>their seeking and gaining assistance. Lack of documentation should not be a criteria 
</b></p>
<p><b>for denying assistance and pro-active outreach to such population groups should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaken.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Discrimination and stigmatization 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Discrimination or stigmatization of any kind targeted against IDPs on account 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their situation, identity or political or other affiliation must be addressed 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediately.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Detention/filtering of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Allegations of civil and political rights violations by the armed groups and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ukrainian forces, including volunteer battalions, require independent investigation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>All sides must conform to all human rights standards in the treatments of IDPs, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including ensuring that they are free from arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and 
</b></p>
<p><b>any ill-treatment. Equally, it is important to ensure freedom of movement and 
</b></p>
<p><b>residence for IDPs, including their potential secure return to their places of origin.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/34/Add.3

</p>
<p><b>  Property rights 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Ownership of property should be retained, even for those unable or unwilling 
</b></p>
<p><b>to return to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or affected regions of eastern 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ukraine. In such cases, the sale of their properties should be facilitated, on a 
</b></p>
<p><b>voluntary basis and at market values. Those who wish to retain their property should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be permitted to do so without risk of its unauthorized occupation, confiscation or sale. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Where property has been damaged or destroyed, adequate compensation should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided to owners by the appropriate authorities and within a reasonable time 
</b></p>
<p><b>frame.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Achieving durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Consideration of relevant durable solution options must be included in national 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws and policies for IDPs and addressed at the earliest possible stage. National and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regional authorities should establish integrated planning informed by displacement 
</b></p>
<p><b>dynamics and ensure that urban development and upgrading plans, as well as poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b>reduction plans, include aspects specific to internal displacement. It is imperative that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the authorities ensure full participation of IDPs in processes that address durable 
</b></p>
<p><b>solutions, and undertake consultation with communities and neighbourhoods to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address their broader concerns. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Ukraine is encouraged to learn from the experience of similar situations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in the Balkans and Caucasus regions, where internal displacement has 
</b></p>
<p><b>become protracted. It is vital to ensure that short-term or transitional solutions, for 
</b></p>
<p><b>example regarding accommodation, do not become permanent. Lessons can be 
</b></p>
<p><b>learned to help Ukraine put in place vital policies, frameworks, support structures 
</b></p>
<p><b>and programmes to move towards a situation in which many IDPs can return safely to 
</b></p>
<p><b>their homes or find alternative durable solutions.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  The role of the international community 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Responding appropriately to the current displacement situation is beyond the 
</b></p>
<p><b>existing capacity and resources of the Government. The international community 
</b></p>
<p><b>therefore has an important role in supporting the Government to fulfil its obligations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through technical and advisory services and through financial assistance to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government and United Nations agencies.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The international community is urged to enhance its financial and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance. Humanitarian assistance and essential projects to provide accommodation 
</b></p>
<p><b>are amongst the urgent priorities. In regions affected by the armed conflict, projects 
</b></p>
<p><b>to reconstruct or replace housing, restore water, electricity and other essential services 
</b></p>
<p><b>are needed to enable IDPs to return to their homes.  
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur will continue his cooperation with the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ukraine regarding issues related to the human rights of IDPs and, in that context, 
</b></p>
<p><b>hopes to conduct a workshop with national and international partners at an 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate opportunity.
