LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the &#147;Partnership&#148;) and a 
consolidated
subsidiary of TETRA Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation 
(&#147;TETRA&#148;), entered into a Series&nbsp;A Preferred Unit Purchase 
Agreement (the &#147;Unit Purchase Agreement&#148;) with the purchasers party 
thereto (collectively, the
&#147;Purchasers&#148;) to issue and sell in a private placement (the 
&#147;Private Placement&#148;) an aggregate of 4,374,454 Series&nbsp;A 
Convertible Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in the 
Partnership (the &#147;Preferred
Units&#148;) for a cash purchase price of $11.43 per Preferred Unit (the 
&#147;Issue Price&#148;), resulting in total net proceeds to the Partnership, 
after deducting offering expenses, of approximately $48 million. The Purchasers 
include, among
others, HBC MLP LLC or certain of its affiliates (the &#147;Lead 
Purchaser&#148;) and CSI Compressco Investment LLC (&#147;CSI Investment&#148;),
a wholly owned subsidiary of TETRA. CSI Investment purchased $10 million of 
Preferred Units in the
Private Placement. The Lead Purchaser was granted a 45-day option to purchase up
to an additional $20 million of Series A Preferred Units on the same terms and 
conditions. The closing of the Private Placement (the &#147;Closing&#148;) 
occurred on
August&nbsp;8, 2016. Proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to reduce 
the Partnership&#146;s outstanding indebtedness. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt;
margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New 
Roman">Set
forth below is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Unit 
Purchase Agreement and the Preferred Units. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; 
margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New 
Roman">Pursuant to the
Unit Purchase Agreement, in connection with the Closing, CSI Compressco GP, 
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;General Partner) and the general partner
of the Partnership, executed a Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited 
Partnership
of the Partnership which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to the Partnership&#146;s 
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on the date hereof (the &#147;Amended and 
Restated Partnership Agreement&#148;) to, among other things, authorize and 
establish the rights
and preferences of the Preferred Units.&nbsp;The Preferred Units are a new class
of equity security that will rank senior to all classes or series of equity 
securities of the Partnership with respect to distribution rights and rights 
upon
liquidation. The holders of Preferred Units (each, a &#147;Preferred 
Unitholder&#148;) will receive quarterly distributions in kind in additional 
Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of 11.00% of the Issue Price ($1.2573 
per unit annualized),
subject to certain adjustments. The rights of the Preferred Units include 
certain anti-dilution adjustments, including adjustments for economic dilution 
resulting from the issuance of Common Units below a particular price.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">A ratable portion of the Preferred Units will be 
converted each month over a period of thirty months beginning in the seventh 
calendar month
following the Closing (each, a &#147;Conversion Date&#148;), subject to certain 
provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement that may delay or 
accelerate all or a portion of such monthly conversions. On each Conversion 
Date, the
Preferred Units will convert into common units representing limited partner 
interests in the Partnership (&#147;Common Units&#148;) in an amount equal to, 
with respect to each Preferred Unitholder, the number of Preferred Units held by
such
Preferred Unitholder divided by the number of Conversion Dates remaining, 
subject to adjustment as described in the Amended and Restated Partnership 
Agreement, with the conversion price determined by the trading price of the 
Common Units over the
month prior to such Conversion Date, among other factors, and as otherwise 
impacted by the existence of certain conditions related to the Common Units. The
Partnership may, at its option, pay cash, or a combination of cash and Common 
Units, to the
Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing Common Units on any Conversion Date,
subject to certain restrictions as described in the Amended and Restated 
Partnership Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, each Purchaser may convert its 
Preferred Units, generally on a one-for-one basis and subject to adjustment for 
certain splits,
combinations, reclassifications or other similar transactions and certain anti-
dilution adjustments, in whole or in part, at any time following May&nbsp;31, 
2017 so long as any conversion is not for less than $250,000 or such lesser 
amount, if such
conversion relates to all of such Purchaser&#146;s remaining Preferred 
Units.&nbsp;The Partnership has the right to be reimbursed for any cash 
distributions paid with respect to Common Units issued in any such optional 
conversion until
March&nbsp;31, 2018. The Preferred Units will vote on an as-converted basis with
the Common Units and will have certain other rights to vote as a class with 
respect to any amendment to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement that 
would affect
any rights, preferences or privileges of the Preferred Units, as more fully 
described in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, upon certain events involving a change
of control, each holder of the Preferred
Units may elect to (a)&nbsp;convert its Preferred Units to Common Units at the 
then-applicable conversion rate, (b)&nbsp;if the Partnership is not the 
surviving entity (or if the Partnership is the surviving entity, but its Common 
Units will cease
to be listed on a National Securities Exchange), require the Partnership or the 
acquiring entity, as applicable, to either (i)&nbsp;deliver a security in the 
surviving entity that has substantially similar rights, preferences and 
privileges as the
Preferred Units or (ii)&nbsp;redeem each Preferred Unit held by such Preferred 
Unitholder at a redemption price per Preferred Unit equal to 120% of the greater
of (A)&nbsp;$11.43 and (B)&nbsp;the intrinsic value of the Preferred Units 
determined as
of the applicable date of determination or (c)&nbsp;if the Partnership is the 
surviving entity and its Common Units continue to be listed or admitted to 
trading on a National Securities Exchange, continue to hold the Preferred Units.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">No Preferred Unitholder may transfer any Preferred 
Units without the prior written consent of the Partnership unless, after giving 
effect to
such transfer, the transferee will own at least $5 million of the Preferred 
Units. However, each Preferred Unitholder shall be able to transfer any 
Preferred Units owned by such Preferred Unitholder to its affiliates or to any 
other Preferred
Unitholder, subject to certain restrictions described in the Amended and 
Restated Partnership Agreement. Additionally, other than with respect to 
transfers by a Preferred Unitholder to its affiliates, each Preferred Unitholder
granted to the
Partnership and to TETRA a right of first refusal to purchase any Preferred 
Units that such Preferred Unitholder may propose to transfer. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Closing, the Partnership has
agreed to pay a transaction fee equal to 3% of the aggregate purchase price to 
Evercore
Group L.L.C. The Unit Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, 
warranties and covenants of the Partnership and the Purchasers, and Partnership 
has agreed to indemnify the Purchasers against certain losses resulting from 
breaches of its
representations, warranties and covenants. The Unit Purchase Agreement also 
provides for an expense reimbursement of up to $200,000 in connection with 
certain fees of counsel to the Purchasers. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Through its various wholly owned subsidiaries, 
TETRA owns approximately 42% of the Partnership&#146;s outstanding Common Units 
and
approximately 20% of the Partnership&#146;s outstanding Preferred Units, plus 
the approximately 2% general partner interest. Additionally, the General 
Partner, which holds the Partnership&#146;s incentive distribution rights, is a 
wholly owned
subsidiary of TETRA. Through the General Partner, TETRA manages and controls the
Partnership. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%;

the Common Units issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Units, including any 
Preferred Units issued in kind pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated
Partnership Agreement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the 
Partnership is required to file or cause to be filed a registration statement 
for such registered resale at its expense no later than 90 days after the

Agreement as so modified continues to express, without material change, the 
original intentions of
the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited nature, 
invalidity or unenforceability of the provision(s) in question does not 
substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of 
the parties or the practical
realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the 
parties.&nbsp;The parties will endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace 
the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s) with a valid provision(s),
the effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable 
provision(s), and (b)&nbsp;the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to 
modify the Transaction Documents so as to effect the original intent of the 
parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions 
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest

to any indemnified party other than under this <U>Section 2.05(c)</U> except to 
the

participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume and undertake the 
defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party

so selected; provided<I>, </I>however, that, (i) if the indemnifying party has

indent:2.00em; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This press release 
includes certain statements that are deemed to be forward-looking statements. 
Generally, the use
of words such as &#147;may,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; 
&#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;projects,&#148; &#147;anticipate,&#148; 
&#147;believe,&#148; &#147;assume,&#148; &#147;could,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; 
&#147;plans,&#148;
&#147;targets&#148; or similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future
events, activities, expectations or outcomes identify forward-looking statements
that the Company intends to be included within the safe harbor protections 
provided by
the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include statements
concerning the Company&#146;s expectations regarding its ability to comply with 
its financial covenants, as well as the Company&#146;s beliefs, expectations, 
plans,
goals, future events and performance, and other statements that are not purely 
historical. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions 
and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception 
of historical
trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it 
believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Such statements are subject to a 
number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the 
Company.
Investors are cautioned that any such statements are not guarantees of future 
performances or results and that actual results or developments may differ 
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Some of the 
factors that
could affect actual results are described in the section titled &#147;Risk 
Factors&#148; contained in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, as well as other risks identified from time 
to time in its
reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
