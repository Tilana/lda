Rights on challenges, lessons learned and best practices in a holistic, child rights and 
gender-based approach to protect and promote the rights of children working and/or living 
on the street,7 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note with appreciation</i> of the adoption by the General Assembly of the third 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, on a communications 
procedure,8 and of the signing ceremony held on 28 February 2012, at which 20 States 
signed the Optional Protocol, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the contribution of the International Criminal Court in ending impunity 
for the most serious crimes against children, including genocide, crimes against humanity 
and war crimes, calling upon States not to grant amnesties for such crimes and 
acknowledging the contribution of the international criminal tribunals and special courts in 
ending impunity for the most serious crimes against children, including genocide, crimes 
against humanity and war crimes,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and taking note 
with interest of its general comments Nos. 10 (2007), 11 and 12 (2009) and 13 (2011), 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming also</i> the work of special procedures mandate holders of the Human

</p>
<p>on the right to education,9 the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children,10 and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, 
including its causes and consequences,11 
</p>
<p><i>Profoundly concerned</i> that the situation of children in many parts of the world 
remains critical, and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is 
called for, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> that regional instruments can contribute to the strengthening of the norms of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that more than 7.6 million children under the age of 5 die each 
year, mostly from preventable and treatable causes caused by lack of access to services and 
interventions, including access to skilled birth attendants and immediate newborn care, as 
well as to health determinants, such as clean and safe water and sanitation, and safe and 
adequate nutrition, and that mortality remains highest among children belonging to the 
poorest and most marginalized communities, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of the family as the fundamental group of society and 
the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members, and particularly 
children, and that, as such, should be strengthened; that it is entitled to receive 
comprehensive protection and support; that the primary responsibility for the protection, 
upbringing and development of children rests with the family; that all institutions of society 
</p>

<p>should respect children&#8217;s rights and secure their well-being, and render appropriate 
assistance to parents, families, legal guardians and other caregivers so that children can 
grow and develop in a safe and stable environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love 
and understanding, bearing in mind that, in different cultural, social and political systems, 
various forms of family exist, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the need to mainstream a gender perspective and to recognize the child 
as a rights-holder in all policies and programmes relating to children,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the progress made towards the universal ratification of the Optional 
Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, and on the involvement of children in armed conflict, 
ahead of the tenth anniversary in 2012 of their entry into force,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that environmental damage has potentially negative effects on children 
and their enjoyment of their rights to life, to the highest attainable standards of health and to 
an adequate standard of living, 
</p>
<p><b> I. Implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other instruments

timely manner with their reporting obligations under the Convention and the first two 
Optional Protocols thereto, taking fully into consideration the guidelines elaborated by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child as well as the recommendations made by the 
Committee in the implementation of the provisions of the Convention;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also calls upon</i> States parties to designate, establish or strengthen relevant 
governmental structures for children, including, where appropriate, ministers in charge of 
child issues and independent ombudspersons for children, and to ensure adequate and 
systematic training in the rights of the child for professional groups working with and for 
children;  
</p>
<p>5. <i>Encourages</i> States to develop and strengthen the collection, analysis and 
dissemination of data for national statistics, including in the area of juvenile justice and on 
children deprived of liberty, as well as children of incarcerated parents, and, as far as 
possible, to use disaggregated data by, inter alia, age, sex, ethnicity, location, language, 
family income, disability and other relevant factors that may lead to disparities, and other 
statistical indicators at the national, subnational, subregional, regional and international 
levels, to develop and assess social policies and programmes so that economic and social 
resources are used efficiently and effectively for the full realization of the rights of the 
child;  </p>


<p>6. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to strengthen their international commitment, 
cooperation and mutual assistance with the objective of fully realizing the rights of the 
child, including through the sharing of good practices, research, policies, monitoring and 
capacity-building;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to ensure that their national legal systems are able to 
provide remedies to children who are victims of violations of their rights, and to ensure that 
such systems are accessible and appropriate for all children, irrespective of the child&#8217;s or his 
or her parents&#8217; or legal guardian&#8217;s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
</p>
<p>opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of the child to express his or her views freely in all 
matters affecting him or her and giving those views due weight in accordance with his or 
her age and maturity, and calls upon States to provide disability-, gender- and age-
appropriate assistance to enable the active and equal participation of all children, including 
children with disabilities, girls, and children belonging to minorities;  
</p>
<p>9. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to take all necessary measures to establish holistic child 
protection systems, including laws, policies, regulations and services across all social 
sectors, especially social welfare, education, health, security and justice, in order to address 
the multiple underlying vulnerabilities of children in the most disadvantaged and 
marginalized situations;  
</p>
<p><b> II. Mainstreaming of the rights of the child  
</b></p>
<p>10. <i>Reaffirms</i> its commitment to effectively integrate the rights of the child into 
its work and that of its mechanisms in a regular, systematic and transparent manner, taking 
into account the gender-based<b> </b>needs of boys and girls; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Urges</i> all stakeholders to take into full account the rights of the child in the 
second and subsequent cycles of the universal periodic review, in the preparation of 
information submitted for the review and during its dialogue, outcome and follow-up, in 
particular with regard to the implementation of recommendations on the rights of the child, 
and encourages States to consult civil society to this end, and to consult children as 
appropriate; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> special procedures and other human rights mechanisms of the 
Human Rights Council to integrate, in accordance with their mandates, the rights of the

cultural, economic, political and social rights without discrimination of any kind;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Notes with concern</i> the large number of children belonging to national, 
ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, migrant children, refugee or asylum-seeking 
children, internally displaced children and children of indigenous origin that are victims of 
all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, and stresses the need to incorporate special measures, in accordance with the

provide voluntary contributions for that purpose; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Also calls upon </i>States to take effective and appropriate legislative and other 
measures or, where they already exist, to strengthen legislation and policy to prohibit and 
eliminate all forms of violence against children in all settings;  
</p>
<p>27. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to take, as a matter of urgency, all appropriate 
measures to prevent, and to protect children from, torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and from all forms of violence, including physical, 
mental and sexual violence, to tackle all forms of bullying, child abuse and exploitation, 
domestic violence and neglect, child trafficking and violence perpetrated by the police,

of the child immediately after birth, irrespective of his/her status, to ensure that registration 
procedures are simple, expeditious and effective and provided free of charge, and to raise 
awareness of the importance of birth registration at the national, regional and local levels; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>30. <i>Also urges</i> all States to ensure birth registration of all children immediately 
after birth through universal, free, accessible, simple, expeditious and effective registration 
procedures in accordance with article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
article 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to raise awareness of 
the importance of birth registration at the national, regional and local levels, to facilitate 
late registration of birth, and to ensure that children who have not been registered have 
access without discrimination to health care, protection, education, safe drinking water and 
sanitation, and other basic services;

appropriate and with his or her legal guardians; 
</p>
<p>34. <i>Calls upon</i> States to guarantee, to the extent consistent with the obligations of 
each State, the right of children whose parents reside in different States to maintain, on a

<p>38. <i>Further calls upon</i> all States to translate into concrete action their 
commitment to the progressive and effective elimination of child labour that is likely to be 
hazardous, to interfere with the child&#8217;s education or to be harmful to the child&#8217;s health or 
physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, to eliminate immediately the worst 
forms of child labour, to promote education as a key strategy in this regard, including the 
creation of vocational training and apprenticeship programmes and the integration of 
working children into the formal education system, and to examine and devise economic 
policies, where necessary, in cooperation with the international community, that address
