<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report examines progress made in the implementation of Human Rights 
Council resolution 22/28 of 22 March 2013, entitled &#8220;Human rights situation in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem&#8221;. The resolution demanded, 
among other things, that Israel respect its obligations under international law, including 
with regard to practices and actions that violate the human rights of the Palestinian people. 
The report covers the period of 30 November 2012 to 25 May 2013. The information 
contained in the report is based primarily on monitoring and other information-gathering 
activities carried out by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) and other United Nations entities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It 
also contains information obtained from Israeli, Palestinian and international non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), human rights defenders and media sources.  
</p>
<p>2. The report highlights selected human rights issues related to Gaza, including the 
firing of rockets and mortars into Israel, the blockade and the access restricted areas 
(ARAs) and their enforcement mechanisms. It examines the situation in the West Bank, 
including East Jerusalem, including limitations on freedom of movement, forcible transfers, 
settler violence and lack of accountability, excessive use of force by Israeli security forces1 
and violations of human rights by the Palestinian Authority. The report also addresses the 
situation of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prison facilities. 
</p>
<p>3. Several issues identified in resolution 22/28 are addressed in reports of the 
Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly for its sixty-eighth session, including 
Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The human rights situation in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory is also reviewed in the recent report of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on the implementation of Human Rights Council 
resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1 (A/HRC/22/35 and A/HRC/22/35/Add. 1).  
</p>
<p>4. The applicable international legal framework has been set out in previous reports of 
the Secretary-General and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The 
High Commissioner&#8217;s first periodic report on the situation of human rights in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory contains a detailed analysis of the legal framework applicable and the 
basis for the obligations of the different duty-bearers in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
namely the State of Israel as the occupying Power, the Palestinian Authority and the de 
facto authorities in Gaza (A/HRC/12/37, paras. 5&#8211;9). This analysis remains valid. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The situation in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Killing and injuries in the course of hostilities  
</b></p>
<p>5. The escalation in hostilities between Israel, the de facto authorities in Gaza and 
armed groups in Gaza2 ended with a ceasefire understanding between Israel and the de 
facto authorities on 21 November 2012. The understanding was generally observed by the 
parties despite a number of incidents that occurred during the reporting period, especially 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The phrase &#8220;Israeli security forces&#8221; refers to law enforcement, military, governmental and 
</p>
<p>intelligence agencies of Israel.  
 2 From 14 to 21 November 2012, Israel conducted a military operation in Gaza. During the escalation 
</p>
<p>174 Palestinians, of whom 101 are believed to have been civilians, and six Israelis, including four 
civilians, were killed. </p>


<p>since March 2013. According to the United Nations Department of Safety and Security 
(UNDSS), 27 home-made rockets, four grad rockets and nine mortar shells were fired from 
Gaza towards Israel, while an additional two rockets and five mortar shells fell short and 
landed in Gaza, and three rockets exploded at the launching site. Based on the information 
available, the majority of projectiles fired into Israel struck empty land. No injuries were 
reported, although the rocket fire had an impact on Israeli civilians living near Gaza. A 
Salafist jihadist armed group called the Mojahideen Shura Council claimed responsibility 
for a number of rockets fired towards Israel.3 The de facto authorities reportedly arrested at 
least two persons alleged to have been involved in rocket firing following the 21 November 
agreement.4 Israel conducted five air strikes in Gaza. On 30 April, the Israeli air force 
targeted and killed one person and injured another, both allegedly members of an armed 
group.5 In addition, at least 23 incursions6 up to 300 metres within the fence were 
conducted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).  
</p>
<p>6. Six months after the end of the escalation in hostilities,7 there are serious concerns 
that neither Israel nor the de facto authorities have taken adequate measures to investigate 
credible allegations of violations of international law and to provide an effective remedy to 
victims. There is no information available in the public domain on investigations conducted 
into violations of international law committed by the de facto authorities and Palestinian 
armed groups. This is of particular concern following the findings of the recent report of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/22/35/Add.1), especially with regard to the direct targeting of civilians and the 
indiscriminate nature of rockets fired towards Israel, as well as the summary execution of 
alleged collaborators. 
</p>
<p>7. Human rights organizations in Gaza filed 96 complaints with the Israeli military 
justice regarding alleged violations, calling for investigations. The Israeli Military 
Advocate General (MAG) is responsible for investigating offences that occur during 
military operations, including allegations of violations of international humanitarian law 
and human rights law. Complaints filed do not automatically trigger a criminal 
investigation. On 11 April 2013, the MAG issued a public document indicating that it 
found no basis to open criminal investigations in relation to approximately 65 incidents 
during Operation &#8220;Pillar of Defence&#8221;.8  
</p>
<p>8. While it is positive that the MAG issued this update to outline steps taken by Israel 
to ensure accountability, it failed to provide sufficient information on the basis for deciding 
not to open criminal investigations. For example, according to information gathered by 
OHCHR in the case of the Al-Dalou family (A/HRC/22/35/Add.1, para. 17), on 18 
November 2012, 12 people, including five children and four women, were killed in an 
Israeli air strike that hit a three-storey house in a heavily populated area in Gaza City 
without prior warning. The MAG claimed that the casualties were caused by &#8220;an attack 
</p>
<p>aimed against a senior terrorist operative and several other terrorists&#8221; and had the aim &#8220;to 
</p>
<p>

<p>reduce the scope of missile and rocket launchings towards Israel&#8221;. Various precautions 
were reportedly taken in the attack, and it was stated that operations staff had not foreseen 
the civilian harm that resulted. However, even if one member of the Al-Dalou family was 
affiliated with an armed group, it would appear that the attack would not have met the legal 
requirement of proportionality in light of the fact that the other 11 persons killed were 
civilians. Given that the house, located in a residential area of Gaza City, totally collapsed, 
and numerous adjacent houses sustained damage, it is difficult to understand how the extent 
of civilian harm could not have been foreseen. If it could not have been foreseen for lack of 
sufficient information on the extent of civilian presence, the attack should not have been 
carried out. The lack of clarity regarding the compliance of the attack with international law 
would appear to require that an investigation be carried out.  
</p>
<p>9. There are concerns regarding the ability of Palestinians to seek redress for harm 
suffered as a result of Israeli military operations. Palestinians face a myriad of procedural 
requirements and legal obstacles that are effectively insurmountable, including 
unreasonable time limits imposed on accessing the civil court system for compensation, 
high fees for court guarantees and impracticable procedural requirements related to power 
of attorney from Gazan clients to Israeli lawyers. Further, recent legislative developments 
have widely expanded an exemption in liability afforded to the State of Israel for &#8220;an act 
done in the course of a military operation by the IDF&#8221;.9  
</p>
<p><b> B. Restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities on the civilian 
</b></p>
<p><b>population in  Gaza  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Blockade 
</b></p>
<p>10. The movement of Palestinians out of Gaza and access to basic utilities, housing, 
education, work, health and an adequate standard of living continued to be severely 
restricted due to Israel&#8217;s blockade. The unemployment rate remained one of the highest in 
the world, with 32.2 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s workforce unemployed.10 Despite the easing of the 
blockade following the ceasefire understanding,11 Gaza&#8217;s imports remained significantly 
short of pre-2007 levels. In February 2013, Israel&#8217;s Coordinator of Government Activities 
in the Territories (COGAT)12 announced measures regarding the movement of goods to 
Gaza,13 and in December 2012, Israel and Egypt lessened certain restrictions on importing 
construction materials.14 Israel allowed a daily quota of 20 truckloads of aggregates for use 
by the commercial sector. This amounts to about 15 per cent of the estimated need. Egypt 
permitted the entry of construction materials for Qatar-funded projects through the Rafah 
crossing. Although important, these measures remained insufficient given the limited 
volumes and materials allowed through the crossings.15

 9 Update on accountability for violations of international law during the escalation of hostilities in Gaza 
</p>
<p>and southern Israel between 14 and 21 November 2012, OHCHR, 21 May 2013. In February 2013, 
the Israeli Southern Central Court in Be&#8217;er Sheva dismissed 15 civil cases field by Gazan human 
rights organizations, a major setback to the right of victims to access justice and remedy.

<p>11. These improvements were negatively affected by the decision of Israeli authorities, 
following rocket fire from the Gaza Strip, to close Kerem Shalom, the only commercial 
crossing between Gaza and Israel, for several days between 27 February and 30 April 2013, 
and to restrict movement of people at the Erez crossing to humanitarian cases.16 As a result, 
the level of Gaza&#8217;s imports during February, March and April decreased by 17.5 per cent 
</p>
<p>compared to the previous three months,17 and to around 36 per cent of the pre-closure level. 
The blockade also continued to severely restrict Gaza&#8217;s exports, preventing the population 
</p>
<p>from maintaining their livelihoods. During the reporting period, Gaza exports equalled less 
than 2 per cent of the pre-blockade level.18  
</p>
<p>12. The United Nations and other international organizations continued to report 
significant delays and costs associated with the Israeli project approval process and the 
importation of materials for humanitarian purposes.19  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Access restricted areas  
</b></p>
<p>13. The November 2012 understanding included the easing of restrictions to the ARAs 
imposed by Israel on land and at sea. At sea, access for Palestinians was extended from 3 to 
6 nautical miles.20 Regarding the ARA on land, a lack of clarity regarding the restrictions in 
place heightened concern regarding the protection of civilians. 
</p>
<p>14. On 25 February 2013, COGAT reported on its website that Palestinian farmers were 
permitted to access land up to 100 metres from the fence. Previously, it had verbally 
informed various international organizations about this decision. On 20 February and 10 
March, the IDF spokesperson, in written responses to an Israeli human rights organization, 
provided different information, stating that the residents of Gaza were prohibited from 
getting closer than 300 metres from the fence. COGAT subsequently removed its 25 
February statement from its website. Exacerbating the lack of clarity, media reports, 
attributed to the then-Deputy Head of Hamas&#8217; political bureau, claimed a complete lifting 
of the ARA on land.21 
</p>
<p>15. Prior to the November 2012 escalation, in practice, the ARA on land was enforced 
by the Israeli military up to several hundred metres and often more than the officially 
declared 300 metres from the fence.22 Following the November understanding, farmers and 
non-farmers started to access land that they had not been able to access for years. Farmers 
reported to OHCHR that they were able to cultivate land up to 300 metres from the fence, 
although in some cases restrictions were perceived to be enforced beyond 300 metres. 
Some farmers noted that access had not changed after the November understanding.

<p>Despite the apparent increase in access, some farmers were not prepared to risk cultivating 
anything other than low-yielding rain-fed crops, due to the lack of clarity and 
unpredictability of the situation.  
</p>
<p>16. During the reporting period, three Palestinians were killed and 56 were injured in 
Gaza, including 16 children. Thirty-seven were injured in the context of demonstrations or 
other civilian activities in the areas up to, and at times beyond, 300 metres from the fence.23 
Several such incidents occurred on Fridays and, on some occasions, demonstrators threw 
stones at Israeli soldiers and their vehicles positioned across the fence.24 In two separate 
cases, two 20-year-old men were killed close to the fence, one on 30 November 2012 east 
of the village of Al-Shouka,25 and the other one on 11 January 2013, in Jabalia, in the 
context of demonstrations. The latter was shot in his abdomen about 50 to 60 metres from 
the fence, which he continued to approach notwithstanding tear gas and warning shots fired 
by the IDF. He was reportedly unarmed and did not pose any apparent threat to Israeli 
soldiers. No rockets were being fired from Gaza around the time of the incident.26  
</p>
<p>17. On 21 March, IDF and COGAT announced that the ARA at sea would again be 
reduced to 3 nautical miles in response to rocket fire from Gaza.27 The ARA at sea was 
subsequently re-established at 6 nautical miles on 21 May 2013.28 The means used by the 
Israeli navy to enforce the ARA at sea continued to put fishermen at risk. Numerous 
incidents of warning shots fired towards fishermen who were within the imposed limits 
were recorded. Six fishermen were injured and 45 were detained29 during the reporting 
period. Eight fishing boats were confiscated, 16 boats were damaged and the engines of 
nine boats, the fishing equipment of several boats and approximately 400 fishing nets were 
damaged by Israeli naval forces.30  
</p>
<p>18. On 21 January 2013, a boat with three Palestinian fishermen about 5 nautical miles 
from the shore was approached by an Israeli naval vessel and told to throw their catch back 
into the sea. Then they were told to take off their clothes, jump into the sea and swim to the 
Israeli vessel. Once aboard, they were given clothes, blindfolded, had their hands tied and 
were taken to Israel. After a medical examination and interrogation by the IDF, they were 
taken to the Erez crossing to return to Gaza.31 
</p>
<p>19. On 19 February 2013, a boat with six fishermen was 3 nautical miles from shore 
when two Israeli naval vessels approached. Once the naval vessels were around 50 metres 
from the Palestinians, the naval vessels started to shoot into the water in close vicinity of 
the Palestinians. The Israeli forces then shot with live ammunition towards the boat and 
damaged its front and engine. Two fishermen were hit in their legs with shrapnel. Shortly 
after, the naval vessels left the area.32

<p>20. The ARA undermines the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Gazans, violating their 
human rights, including the rights to work, to freely dispose of their natural wealth and 
resources, to an adequate standard of living and to food, which includes the possibility of 
feeding oneself directly from productive land or natural resources. Israel&#8217;s methods of 
enforcement often violate Palestinians&#8217; civil rights, including the rights to life, liberty and 
security. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Punitive measures that affect civilians 
</b></p>
<p>21. Restrictions on the freedom of movement of Gazans and imports and exports to and 
from Gaza began to be put in place by Israel in the 1990s. In 2007, following the takeover 
of Gaza by Hamas, such restrictions were tightened, although they were eased considerably 
in 2010 to allow the import of items not designated by Israel as &#8220;dual use&#8221;, i.e. having the 
potential to be used in weapon production.  
</p>
<p>22. While parties to an armed conflict may take security measures, such measures must 
comply with international law and should be necessary and proportional.33 Numerous 
statements made by Israeli officials in their professional capacities have made clear that the 
blockade is being imposed to apply pressure to the de facto authorities, and in response to 
acts committed by various groups in Gaza, including Palestinian armed groups, towards or 
in relation to Israel.34 However, the blockade and related restrictions target and impose 
hardship on the civilian population, effectively penalizing them for acts they have not 
committed. As such, these measures contravene article 33 of the Geneva Convention 
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Convention IV) prohibiting 
collective penalties.35  
</p>
<p>  
 33 See, in particular,  article 27 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons 
</p>
<p>in Time of War (Convention IV), and articles 57 and 58 of the Protocol additional to the Geneva 
Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of international armed 
conflicts (Protocol I). 
</p>
<p> 34 In September 2007, Israel&#8217;s Security Cabinet declared Gaza a &#8220;hostile territory&#8221;, and as a result  
decided that sanctions would be imposed on the Hamas regime in order to restrict the passage of 
various goods to the Gaza Strip, reduce the supply of fuel and electricity and restrict the movement of 
people to and from the Gaza Strip, see 
http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/pressroom/2007/pages/security%20cabinet%20declares%20gaza%20hosti
le%20territory%2019-sep-2007.aspx. The Defense Ministry Spokesperson Peter Lerner, according to 
Agence France Presse, stated that the opening of the crossings will be reviewed on a daily basis and 
will be subject to Palestinian militants halting their rocket fire against southern Israel, see 
http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iflhCqMdfmP6fA2nNDMm-fygUu7w. 
According to Gisha, on 4 April 2013, top security officials called to &#8220;refrain from using the border 
</p>
<p>crossings as a means for pressuring Hamas because they are not used for smuggling weapons. 
Therefore, closing them only increasing feelings of isolation and frustration among Gaza&#8217;s residents, 
rather than among senior members of terrorist organizations&#8221;, see 
http://www.gisha.org/UserFiles/File/publications/Creeping-Punishment/Creeping-Punishment-
may2013-eng.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 35 Article 33 reads: &#8220;No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally 
committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are 
prohibited. Pillage is prohibited. Reprisals against protected persons and their property are 
prohibited&#8221;.<b> </b>See also the statement of 13 June 2012 by the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian 
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Valerie Amos, available at:

<p>23. As a recent example of the ongoing punitive measures against the civilian 
population of Gaza, the IDF and COGAT announced on 21 March36 that &#8220;in response to 
rocket fire&#8221;, the permitted fishing zone for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip would be 
narrowed from 6 to 3 miles as instructed by the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Defence.37 A Salafist jihadist group had claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks.38 The 
mentioned restrictions were not directed towards members of this group, but instead 
targeted the civilian population by penalizing them for acts they had not committed. As 
noted above in paragraph 17, the fishing zone was subsequently re-extended to 6 nautical 
miles on 21 May 2013.

</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Settler violence and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>24.  Acts of violence by Israeli settlers continued to be perpetrated against Palestinians 
and their property, impacting negatively upon their physical security, access to livelihoods 
and natural resources, as well as access to education. One hundred ninety-one such 
incidents were recorded, including 62 that resulted in 98 Palestinian casualties, and 129 that 
resulted in destruction of or damage to private property. At least 3,793 productive trees 
were destroyed or damaged in settler attacks. Five incidents hindered access to education 
for 1,616 children39 and one incident at an educational facility was recorded.40 During the 
same period, 27 incidents of violence by Palestinians against Israelis, resulting in 47 Israeli 
casualties, were recorded, including the killing of a resident of Yitzhar settlement on 30 
April 2013. 
</p>
<p>25. Israel, as the occupying Power, has the obligation to maintain public order and 
ensure that protected persons &#8211; Palestinian civilians &#8211; are safeguarded against all acts or 
threats of violence (A/67/375, para. 30). This includes the obligation to protect Palestinians 
from settler violence, and to ensure the effective, prompt, thorough and impartial 
investigation of criminal attacks and prosecute those allegedly responsible. Despite 
repeated concerns raised by the Secretary-General, as well as statements by Israeli officials 
noting that steps would be taken to address this phenomenon, Israeli authorities continue to 
fail to prevent settler violence, protect Palestinians and their property, and ensure 
accountability for these criminal acts.41

 39 According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), in March 2013, two incidents affecting 
</p>
<p>the access to education of Palestinian children took place, while single similar incidents were 
recorded in January, February and April 2013.

<p> 40 Data provided by UNICEF.

<p>26. A lack of accountability opens the door to further violence. As referred to in a 
previous report (A/67/375, para. 38),  the analysis of an Israeli human rights organization of 
781 complaints registered from 2005 to 2011 found that an indictment was filed by Israeli 
authorities in less than 9 per cent of investigations, which are opened as a result of a 
complaint being made. Approximately 84 per cent of the investigations were closed due to 
investigatory failures.42 Furthermore, Palestinians who file complaints with the Israeli 
police often do not have access to information regarding the status or progress of any 
investigation following from their complaint.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Forcible transfer of Palestinians in Area C of the West Bank: Bedouin and herding 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities in the Jerusalem periphery and the Masafer Yatta communities 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Israeli Civil Administration in the West Bank maintains (A/67/372, paras. 36&#8211;
37 and 55) its plans to transfer approximately 2,300 Palestinians currently living in the 
eastern Jerusalem periphery, in connection with its plans to expand settlements in the 
area.43 An Israeli plan for a new Bedouin village in Area C, within the Jericho Governorate, 
is expected to be deposited for public comments later in 2013.44 If implemented, some 
Bedouin and herding communities in the Jerusalem periphery and the Jordan Valley would 
apparently be forcibly transferred to the new village, which would have the capacity for 
approximately 6,000 residents.45 Despite the prevailing coercive environment in Area C, the 
communities potentially affected by the different plans continue to oppose any transfer 
from their current locations.46 Such transfers would adversely affect the traditional 
economy and would likely lead to the disintegration of the social fabric of the affected 
communities. 
</p>
<p>28. In July 2012, Israeli military authorities confirmed their intention to &#8220;remove&#8221; eight 
Palestinian farmer and shepherd communities, comprising approximately 1,000 persons, 
living in the Masafer Yatta area, in order to enforce a &#8220;closed military zone&#8221; (&#8220;Firing Zone 
918&#8221;).47 In 1999, the Israeli military evicted most of the residents from the area (some 700 
Palestinians) and destroyed or confiscated most of their homes and property.48 The Israeli 
High Court of Justice, in response to a petition from the residents, allowed some of them to 
return until a final court decision was taken. This decision was still pending as of 25 May 
</p><p>2013.  The affected communities have been living in the Masafer Yatta area for decades, 
many since before the Israeli occupation began in 1967, and the majority of residents have 
titles to prove ownership of their land. They are experiencing increasing pressure to leave, 
but continue to peacefully oppose their eviction and transfer from the area.  
</p>
<p>29. Under international humanitarian law, the forcible transfer of protected persons is 
prohibited, although temporary evacuations may be undertaken in the context of active 
hostilities where the security of the protected population or imperative military reasons so 
demand. Neither of these circumstances applies in the cases of the above-mentioned 
communities. A transfer is forcible, and thus unlawful, unless the affected persons choose

<p>to move voluntarily without the threat of force or coercion, which is not presently the case. 
Accordingly, the implementation of the proposed Israeli plans to transfer Palestinian 
Bedouin and herding communities in the Jerusalem periphery and Jordan Valley from their 
current locations and to evict Palestinians in the eight villages of the Masafer Yatta area for 
the enforcement of &#8220;Firing Zone 918&#8221; would appear to amount to individual and mass 
forcible transfer, contrary to Israel&#8217;s obligations under international humanitarian law. It 
</p>
<p>also appears to amount to forced evictions contrary to Israel&#8217;s obligations under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law. Moreover, if the implementation of these plans were to 
entail the destruction or confiscation of the private property of protected persons, it would 
give rise to additional serious concerns regarding the compliance by Israel with its 
obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law.   
</p>
<p><b> 3. Freedom of movement and the respect of unity, continuity and integrity of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>territory of the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</b></p>
<p>30. Restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians living in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory continued to represent a major human rights concern. The principal 
restrictions consisted of physical obstacles, including the Wall, checkpoints and roadblocks, 
as well as administrative and legal restrictions, including closed military zones, prohibited 
roads and permit requirements. These restrictions severely limit Palestinian vehicular and 
pedestrian movement, including between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, movement 
within the West Bank itself, and movement between East Jerusalem and the remainder of 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  
</p>
<p>31. Israel has recently commenced construction of a highway through Beit Safafa in 
East Jerusalem, attempting to link West Jerusalem with settlements in the West Bank. This 
highway, if completed, would cut through the Beit Safafa community and negatively affect 
the livelihoods of 9,300 Palestinians, cutting off local roads and blocking access to 
kindergartens, schools, health clinics, offices and places of worship. 
</p>
<p>32. The construction of the Wall in the West Bank continued to have a negative impact 
on the human rights of Palestinian communities. Approximately 55,000 East Jerusalem 
Palestinians are physically separated from the urban centre of Jerusalem and must cross 
burdensome checkpoints to access health, education and other services to which they are 
entitled. Moreover, approximately four million Palestinians from the remainder of the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory continue to be generally prohibited from entering East 
Jerusalem. The Wall and related restrictions on Palestinian movement are decisively cutting 
off East Jerusalem from the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Planned settlement 
expansion in the Jerusalem area would exacerbate this separation. 
</p>
<p>33. In April 2013, the Special Appeals Committee of the Tel Aviv Magistrate&#8217;s Court, 
citing security concerns, approved the planned route of the Wall around the Cremisan 
Monastery in the West Bank. This route would surround the Salesian Nuns Convent and 
Primary School from three sides, confiscate most of the convent&#8217;s lands, and separate 
landowners from their private property. Overall, the completion of the Wall would cut the 
Bethlehem urban area from its agricultural hinterland and reduce access for approximately 
23,000 Palestinians to Bethlehem, a major services centre for health, education, markets 
and trade.  
</p>
<p>34. In a positive development, on 2 May 2013 the Israeli High Court of Justice ordered 
a halt to the building of the Wall in one particular area close to Bethlehem, referring to the </p>


<p>cultural heritage and livelihood values of the agricultural terraces in the village of Battir.49 
The Court requested the military to submit, within three months, the reasons why the route 
of the Wall should not be nullified or changed in this area.50 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Demolitions and forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>35. Israeli planning policies continue to severely restrict the construction of new 
housing for Palestinians in East Jerusalem and Area C, where Israel retains full authority 
for planning and zoning. Permits for new houses are rarely given, and homes of West Bank 
and East Jerusalem identification holders are frequently demolished on the basis that they 
were built without permission and are therefore illegal structures. From 1 December 2012 
to 21 May 2013, 271 Palestinian-owned structures in East Jerusalem and Area C were 
demolished due to lack of permits, resulting in the displacement of 476 Palestinians, 
including 263 children.51 
</p>
<p>36. Approximately 33 per cent of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem lack Israeli-
issued building permits, placing at least 93,100 residents at risk of displacement. Moreover, 
70 per cent of Area C in the West Bank is allocated to Israeli settlements or the Israeli 
military. An additional 29 per cent is heavily restricted by Israel, thus greatly limiting 
prospects for Palestinian construction, and less than 1 per cent of Area C has been planned 
for Palestinian development.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Excessive use of force by Israeli security forces  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Excessive use of force 
</b></p>
<p>37. Under international law, Israeli authorities are obliged to respect the right to life and 
protect the civilian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In a law enforcement 
context, Israeli security forces are bound by the general principles on the use of force by 
law enforcement officials, including the principles of necessity and proportionality 
contained in the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement 
Officials52 and the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials.53 The intentional lethal 
use of firearms is only permitted when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life. 
</p>
<p>38. During the reporting period, the use of force by Israeli security forces, including the 
IDF and the Israeli Border Police, resulted in 10 deaths, including four children and one 
woman, and 2,952 injuries54 in the West Bank. This constitutes a marked increase in the 
killing of civilians in the West Bank compared to the rest of 2012.55 OHCHR monitored 
and documented nine fatalities and several injuries. The monitoring and documentation by 
OHCHR identified serious concerns regarding potentially unlawful and unnecessary use of

<p>force against unarmed Palestinians. The following cases, documented by OHCHR, are 
examples of recent incidents of possible excessive use of force by Israeli security forces.56  
</p>
<p>39. On 12 January, an unarmed 21-year-old Palestinian man was shot in the back and 
killed while attempting to enter Israel through a gap in the Wall near the village of 
al-Ramadin. Witnesses reported that no warnings were issued prior to the shooting. The 
victim was evacuated by Israeli forces to a hospital in Israel and pronounced dead upon 
arrival. 
</p>
<p>40. On 15 January, a 17-year-old boy was shot dead on the outskirts of the village of 
Budrus. The victim was part of a group of boys playing in a restricted area near the Wall, a 
short distance from their school. A witness indicated that an Israeli soldier fired at the 
victim, without prior warning, from a distance of between 5 to 10 metres. The boy turned 
away and started running toward the village when another soldier fired three bullets, hitting 
him in the head and back. According to the statements to the media by Israeli authorities, 
the boys had thrown stones at the soldiers. 
</p>
<p>41. On 18 January, a 15-year-old boy was shot in the head from an IDF observation 
tower near the Ayda refugee camp, close to Bethlehem. The boy had been walking with 
another boy on a road leading towards the tower. He died of his injuries on 23 January. 
While there had been demonstrations and clashes in front of the camp in the weeks leading 
up to the incident, witnesses stated that no confrontations were occurring at the time of the 
incident. This is supported by video footage from a surveillance camera at a nearby 
children&#8217;s centre. According to Israeli authorities, the victim had attempted to enter 
Rachel&#8217;s Tomb while some 30 other Palestinians gathered next to the military post threw 
stones, as well as a fake bomb, at the soldiers.  
</p>
<p>42. On 23 January, a 22-year-old woman was shot in the head and killed by an IDF 
soldier in the al-Arrub refugee camp. Another woman was injured in the incident. The two 
were allegedly walking out of a college when what appeared to be a civilian car stopped on 
the road. Witnesses reported that a uniformed IDF soldier got out of the car and shot at the 
women from a distance of around 150 metres. An Israeli spokesperson stated that the 
soldiers had been attacked by Palestinians, who had hurled multiple firebombs at them and 
therefore the IDF soldier had returned fire.57 However, witnesses reported that there had 
been no clashes, confrontations or any similar incident in the area prior to the shooting. 
</p>
<p>43. On 3 April, IDF soldiers shot three Palestinian teenagers, two of whom were killed, 
outside of Anabta in the Tulkarem area. The Palestinians stated that they intended to throw 
stones at an IDF observation tower at the Ennab IDF checkpoint, near the settlement of 
Einav. This tower is fortified by concrete blocks, barbed wire and surveillance cameras. 
One teenager threw a stone when the group was 10 to 20 metres from the tower. IDF 
emerged from the tower and shouted at the teenagers to stop, whereupon the teenagers 
turned away and began to run back to their village. IDF allegedly opened fire as they ran 
back towards their village. Amer Nassar died from a gunshot wound in the back. Naji 
al-Bilbisi also died from a gunshot wound in the back. Fadi Abu al-Assal was treated for a 
gunshot wound to his upper arm and released from the hospital. 
</p>
<p>44. On 20 February, while conducting an arrest operation in the village of Birqin north 
of the West Bank, IDF soldiers allegedly opened fire at Rajih Qablawi, who was leaving his 
brother&#8217;s house. The soldiers who were surrounding the house allegedly shot at Mr. 
Qablawi without firing any warning shots or being exposed to any threat. Mr. Qablawi,

<p>who informed OHCHR that he had not even been aware of the presence of the IDF in the 
area, was struck in his thigh and transferred to a hospital.  
</p>
<p>45. During a demonstration held in the village of Abud on 22 February 2013, four 
Palestinians were shot and injured by rubber-coated steel bullets. One of them, Mohammad 
Sameeh Asfour, was shot with a rubber-coated steel bullet that penetrated his forehead and 
settled in his skull. He was evacuated to Rafidya hospital in Nablus and subsequently 
transferred to an Israeli hospital, where he died from his injuries on 7 March 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>46. Under international law, the State of Israel has the obligation to conduct 
independent, impartial, thorough, prompt and effective investigations into incidents 
involving the potential excessive use of force by law enforcement officials; to open judicial 
and/or disciplinary proceedings against perpetrators; and to ensure access to justice and an 
effective remedy for victims. In April 2011, in a positive development, the MAG 
announced a new policy pursuant to which a military police investigation is opened 
automatically in every case where an &#8220;uninvolved&#8221; civilian is killed by a soldier in the 
</p>
<p>West Bank (A/66/356, para. 18).  
</p>
<p>47. Military police investigations were opened in six out of the seven cases referred 
above, with the outcome still pending at the time of writing.58 In addition, on 18 March 
2013, an IDF soldier was convicted of negligent homicide in relation to the killing of a 
young Palestinian59 trying to cross to Israel for work, following a plea bargain. On 13 May 
2013, the soldier was sentenced to nine months&#8217; imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>48. However, recent figures raise concerns with regard to ensuring accountability in 
practice. As noted by an Israeli legal NGO with regard to investigations opened by the 
Israeli military, the data for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 shows that 14 investigation files 
out of the 534 opened during those three years produced indictments; i.e., only 2.62 per 
cent.60 In 2012, a total of 240 complaints were submitted to the Israeli military, and only 78 
criminal investigations were opened. Yet no indictment was filed as a result of these 
investigations.61 
</p>
<p><b> C. Violations of human rights by the Palestinian Authority 
</b></p>
<p>49. During the reporting period, the Palestinian security services in the West Bank 
reportedly carried out dozens of arbitrary arrests of Palestinians, often based on the 
person&#8217;s political affiliation. The Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>registered 91 complaints of arbitrary arrest during the period of January to March 2013.62   
</p>
<p>50. Ill-treatment, sometimes amounting to torture, was reported to have taken place in 
Palestinian places of detention.63 The allegations concern various methods including 
<i>shabeh</i>,64 beatings, threats, deprivation of sleep and solitary confinement. Allegations of ill-

 63 Testimony collected during OHCHR visits to Palestinian detention centres.  
 64 <i>Shabeh</i> refers to forcing a detainee to hold a painful position for extended periods of time. </p>


<p>treatment mostly arose during security campaigns carried out by the Palestinian Authority 
following serious incidents against its officials or institutions.  
</p>
<p>51. On 29 January 2013, Saleh Husni Abdulrahman Shomali, a Palestinian police officer 
on duty at Hebron Police Station, was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and 
transported to Ramallah for interrogation. Mr. Shomali states that interrogators beat him 
continuously with a cable while his arms were tied with a rope attached to the ceiling. Two 
officers allegedly sprayed tear gas directly into his face, causing him to lose consciousness. 
During the 13-day interrogation period, he reportedly was deprived of sleep for many 
hours, cursed, slapped, confined in a tiny cell and subjected to <i>shabeh</i> for many hours. He 
was then transferred to Addahiriya interrogation centre, where he was again subjected to 
<i>shabeh</i>.65  
</p>
<p>52. In a positive development, on 14 May 2013, President Mahmoud Abbas decreed that 
all Palestinian agencies must abide by the provisions of the Palestinian Basic Law, which 
prohibits all forms of torture and degrading treatment, and any behaviour that diminishes 
human dignity.66 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Palestinians in Israeli detention 
</b></p>
<p>53. As of March 2013, approximately 6,000 Palestinians were held in Israel detention 
facilities,67 of which 164 were in administrative detention.68 The majority was held in 
prisons and detention centres located in Israel, in violation of international humanitarian 
law establishing that residents of an occupied territory shall be detained and serve their 
sentences within the occupied territory.69 Israeli authorities restrict family visits through 
burdensome bureaucratic procedures to obtain a permit for entry into Israel.  
</p>
<p>54. On 14 May 2012, Israeli authorities agreed to certain demands made by detainees 
who had launched a mass hunger strike (A/67/372, para. 25). According to NGO sources,70 
the agreement has so far been partially implemented. In July 2012, visits from families 
based in Gaza took place. However, not all prisoners were able to see their families, in 
particular those detained in prisons in the north of Israel. Solitary confinement was 
reportedly lifted for all hunger strikers except one, who was reportedly still in isolation for 
security reasons.71 Several hunger strikers were released or agreements not to renew their 
administrative detention were reached.72  
</p>
<p>55. On 23 February 2013, Arafat Jaradat, a 30-year-old Palestinian, died while detained 
in the Israeli Megiddo prison. An autopsy report by the Director of the Palestinian Medico-
Legal Institute indicated that his death was caused by nervous shock resulting from severe

<p>pain caused by multiple injuries allegedly inflicted through torture.73  Israeli authorities had 
previously announced that he died of a heart attack, although this statement was 
subsequently withdrawn.74 International human rights obligations towards all Palestinian 
detainees and prisoners in Israeli custody must be fully respected, including the absolute 
prohibition on torture.  
</p>
<p>56. By 30 April 2013, there were 236 Palestinian children in Israeli detention, 44 of 
whom were under the age of 16.75 Data collected by UNICEF through affidavits76 and 
reports of victims collected by OHCHR show that the rights of Palestinian children were 
often violated by Israel. Thirty per cent of children reported being aggressively taken into 
custody in the middle of the night by armed Israeli soldiers. Night arrests are deeply 
traumatic for children, as they are akin to military operations and often include smashed 
windows and shouted verbal threats. Few children or parents were informed where the 
child was being taken, why or for how long. Parents were not allowed to accompany them, 
and 87 per cent of children were not informed of their right to legal counsel. Ninety-one per 
cent of children were painfully handtied and blindfolded and subjected to physical violence, 
including beating, slapping, kicking and/or verbal abuse during the journey to interrogation 
and detention.  
</p>
<p>57. Twenty-two per cent of children stated that during interrogations they had been 
threatened with death, physical violence, solitary confinement and sexual assault, against 
themselves or a family member. In the majority of cases, the principal evidence against a 
child was the child&#8217;s own admission of guilt, often elicited through a document drafted in 
</p>
<p>Hebrew, a language they cannot understand.77 According to UNICEF, ill-treatment of 
Palestinian children in the Israeli detention system is widespread, systematic and 
institutionalized.78 There are serious concerns that such treatment and combination of 
practices may, in some cases, amount to torture, as defined by article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Such 
practices would also violate the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 37) and 
international humanitarian law.79 Israeli authorities have stated that they will work towards 
the implementation of the UNICEF recommendations regarding children in military 
detention.80

<p><b> V. Enhancing Palestinian institutions and civil society actions in 
relation to human rights 
</b></p>
<p>58. In addition to monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, OHCHR continued to provide technical assistance to 
relevant Palestinian actors for the promotion and protection of human rights, including the 
Government of the State of Palestine, the Independent Commission for Human Rights and 
civil society actors. OHCHR also initiated a process of reaching out to community and 
religious leaders in Gaza, to engage in a dialogue on human rights and raise awareness of 
international standards.  
</p>
<p>59. OHCHR continued to support the Government, at its request, in preparing a 
Palestinian National Plan of Action for Human Rights, which will be an integral part of the 
Palestinian National Development Plan for 2014&#8211;2016. The development of the National 
Plan of Action, in consultation with Palestinian civil society, will provide concrete and 
specific targets for the State of Palestine&#8217;s ongoing efforts to improve its human rights 
</p>
<p>performance in all areas of development.  
</p>
<p>60. The United Nations system in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is preparing its 
United Nations Development Assistance Framework for 2014&#8211;2016, which defines the 
ways and means to support national development priorities. The United Nations is 
committed to providing assistance to the State of Palestine that is grounded firmly in the 
international human rights framework. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Serious violations of international law continue to be committed in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory. The general human rights situation remains of 
</b></p>
<p><b>heightened concern and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The Secretary-
</b></p>
<p><b>General is deeply concerned about the recurrence of violations already highlighted in 
</b></p>
<p><b>several of his previous reports and those of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights. The majority of these violations could be avoided if the relevant duty-
</b></p>
<p><b>bearers would take the necessary preventive and corrective actions as highlighted in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the recommendations below.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Recommendations to the Government of Israel  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>The Government of Israel is under an obligation to conduct investigations into 
all allegations of serious violations of international human rights law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law. Investigations must be conducted independently, 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartially, thoroughly, promptly and effectively. Transparency in investigations 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also be ensured. Where appropriate, individuals who are allegedly responsible 
</b></p>
<p><b>for violations should be prosecuted and victims should be provided with an effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedy, including equal and effective access to justice and reparations.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The Government of Israel should review the methods and mechanisms used to 
enforce the access restricted areas (ARAs) in Gaza, in order to ensure full compliance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with international human rights law and international humanitarian law.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Notwithstanding legitimate Israeli security concerns, the Government of Israel 
should fully lift the blockade of Gaza to remedy the ongoing punitive measures against 
</b></p>
<p><b>the civilian population. All measures taken to address security concerns should </b></p>


<p><b>comply with international law, including international human rights law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Israeli authorities should take all necessary measures to prevent violence 
perpetrated by Israeli settlers, and to address all such violence that is perpetrated. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Accountability for crimes, including through justice and effective remedy for victims, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be ensured without discrimination. Failure to do so will constitute a violation 
</b></p>
<p>of Israel&#8217;s human rights obligations and will perpetu<b>ate a culture of impunity.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Israeli plans that would result in the forcible transfer of Palestinian civilians 
should be terminated immediately. Israel, as the occupying Power, has the obligation 
</b></p>
<p><b>to protect the Palestinian civilian population and to administer the occupied territory 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the benefit of the Palestinians. Israel has an obligation under international law to 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide Palestinian communities in Area C, including communities at risk of forcible 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfer in the Jerusalem periphery and the Masafer Yatta area, with adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing, security of tenure and access to water and services, including health and 
</b></p>
<p><b>education, in their current locations. The forcible transfer of the Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>population, including that part currently residing in the eastern Jerusalem periphery, 
</b></p>
<p>would violate Israel&#8217;s obligations under international humanitarian and international 
</p>
<p><b>human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>In accordance with its international obligations, the Government of Israel 
should take immediate steps to respect and ensure the respect of the right to freedom 
</b></p>
<p><b>of movement for Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of movement between Gaza and the West Bank.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Government of Israel should review its use of administrative detention, 
with a view to ending it speedily. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Government of Israel should treat Palestinian children in detention with 
due consideration of their age and in accordance with international standards, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Government of Israel should ensure that any use of lethal force is in 
compliance with international law, including during law enforcement operations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including a review of regulations on the use of weapons and crowd control in 
</b></p>
<p><b>operations carried out by its forces, to ensure that these regulations are in line with 
</b></p>
<p>Israel&#8217;s international legal obligations. In cases of excessive use of force, Israel should 
</p>
<p><b>ensure accountability, including through investigations and, where appropriate, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations regarding accountability of the de facto authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Accountability for violations of international law committed by the de facto 
authorities or armed groups in Gaza, including the killing of civilians, must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensured by relevant actors. This includes violations that occurred in the context of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>&#8211;<b>21 November 2012 hostilities with Israel. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Recommendations to the Government of the State of Palestine 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Government of the State of Palestine should conduct effective 
investigations into all suspected violations of international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Investigations must comply with the standards of independence, impartiality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>thoroughness, promptness and effectiveness. Transparency in investigations should </b></p>


<p><b>also be ensured. Individuals found responsible should be held accountable and victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>compensated. Accountability for crimes must be ensured without discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Government of the State of Palestine should ensure the adoption of a 
comprehensive National Plan of Action for Human Rights which prioritizes 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with international human rights law and establishes concrete targets and 
</b></p>
<p><b>goals for integrating human rights into national development efforts, and should, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the assistance of international actors, ensure its full implementation through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian National Development Plan. 
</b></p>
