<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The open-ended Working Group on the Right to Development was established by 
the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1998/72 and the Economic and Social 
Council in its decision 1998/269 with a mandate to: monitor and review progress made in 
the promotion and implementation of the right to development, as elaborated in the 
Declaration on the Right to Development, at the national and international levels, providing 
recommendations thereon and further analysing obstacles to its full enjoyment, focusing 
each year on specific commitments in the Declaration; review reports and any other 
information submitted by States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations on the relationship between their 
activities and the right to development; and present for the consideration of the former 
Commission on Human Rights (subsequently the Human Rights Council) a sessional report 
on its deliberations, including advice to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with regard to the implementation of the right 
to development, and suggesting possible programmes of technical assistance at the request 
of interested countries with the aim of promoting the implementation of the right to 
development. 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 9/3, decided to renew the mandate of 
the Working Group until it completes the tasks entrusted to it by the Council in its 
resolution 4/4, and that the Working Group would convene annual sessions of five working 
days and submit its reports to the Council. Furthermore, the Human Rights Council, in its 
resolution 21/32, decided to consider the extension of the meeting time of the working 
group, as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>3. By resolutions 4/4 and 9/3, the Human Rights Council endorsed the request 
addressed to the High-Level Task Force on the implementation of the right to development 
by the Working Group on the Right to Development at its eighth and ninth sessions, 
respectively, to &#8220;[consolidate] its findings and present a revised list of right-to-development 
criteria along with corresponding operational sub-criteria and outline suggestions for 
further work, including aspects of international cooperation not covered until then for the 
consideration of the Working Group&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>4. By its resolution 9/3, the Human Rights Council decided that the criteria, &#8220;once 
considered, revised and endorsed by the Working Group, should be used, as appropriate, in 
the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the implementation of 
the right to development&#8221; and that, upon its completion, &#8220;the Working Group will take 
appropriate steps for ensuring respect for and practical application of these standards, which 
could take various forms, including guidelines on the implementation of the right to 
development, and evolve into a basis for consideration of an international legal standard of 
a binding nature, through a collaborative process of engagement&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>5. By resolution 12/23, the Human Rights Council endorsed the recommendations of 
the Working Group at its tenth session, that, inter alia, the task force focus on consolidating 
its findings and presenting a revised list of right-to-development criteria along with 
corresponding operational subcriteria and outline suggestions for further work, including 
aspects of international cooperation not covered until then; and that the revised criteria and 
subcriteria should address the essential features of the right to development, as defined in 
the Declaration on the Right to Development, in a comprehensive and coherent way, 
including priority concerns of the international community beyond those enumerated in 
Millennium Development Goal 8, and serve the purposes set out in all relevant provisions 
of Human Rights Council resolution 9/3.  </p>


<p>6. By resolutions 12/23, 15/25, 18/26, 19/34 and 21/32, the Human Rights Council  
reiterated its decision at its 9th session that, once considered, revised and endorsed by the 
Working Group, the criteria and corresponding operational subcriteria should be used, as 
appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the 
implementation of the right to development; and that the Working Group shall take 
appropriate steps to ensure respect for and practical application of the above-mentioned 
standards, which could take various forms, including guidelines on the implementation of 
the right to development, and evolve into a basis for consideration of an international legal 
standard of a binding nature, through a collaborative process of engagement. 
</p>
<p>7. By resolution 21/32, the Human Rights Council welcomed the launching of the 
process by the Working Group of considering, revising and refining the draft right to 
development criteria and corresponding operational subcriteria, with the first reading of the 
draft criteria, and acknowledged the need to further consider, revise and refine them. It 
further endorsed the recommendations of the Working Group at its thirteenth session that it, 
inter alia, pursue, at its fourteenth session, its work on the consideration of the draft 
operational subcriteria. 
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group accordingly convened its fourteenth session in Geneva from 13 
to 17 May 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p>9. In her opening statement, the representative of OHCHR, speaking on behalf of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, recalled the importance the Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action placed on the right to development. Three overarching themes were 
at the heart of the World Conference on Human Rights: the universality of human rights, 
the importance of democratic participation and the imperative of development. She 
highlighted a number of fundamental challenges confronting the world: climate change, 
environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity impacted heavily on the human rights of 
present and future generations; rising inequalities; and demographic changes and the 
changing contours of geo-political and economic relations, as well as multiple crises, 
placed new demands on governance at all levels and called for coherent and human rights-
based policies. The Declaration on the Right to Development enshrined a comprehensive, 
human-centred development paradigm that aimed at the improvement of human well-being 
for all. It recognized that every human person was entitled to participate in, contribute to 
and enjoy a development process in which all human rights could be fully realized. The 
statement pointed out that the right to development was not confined to declarations, 
summit outcomes or political debates within the United Nations. Real democratic 
participation can be measured by the extent to which &#8211; in the words of the Declaration on 
the Right to Development &#8211; &#8220;active, free and meaningful participation&#8221; determines policy 
and law. The global conversation about post-2015 development goals is an important 
opportunity for meaningful popular participation in global governance.1    
</p>
<p>10. At its first meeting, on 13 May 2013, the Working Group re-elected by acclamation 
Tamara Kunanayakam (Sri Lanka) as Chairperson-Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>  
 1  For the full text of the High Commissioner&#8217;s statement, see 
</p>
<p>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13320&amp;LangID=E. </p>


<p>11. In her opening statement,2 the Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled the mandate of the 
Working Group and the overall framework within which it is expected to review the draft 
criteria and operational subcriteria, the deliberations that had taken place at the previous 
session, the informal intersessional meeting, from 18 to 19 April 2013, with a view to 
improving the effectiveness of the fourteenth session, and the informal consultations held 
with a view to its preparation. She informed the Working Group that the General Assembly, 
in its latest resolution 67/171 of 20 December 2012 had, for the first time, invited the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur to present an oral report, instead of an update, and to engage in an 
interactive dialogue at its sixty-eighth session. She pointed out that the Declaration on the 
Right to Development defined development in broad and comprehensive terms, as a 
complex, multidimensional, integrated and dynamic process, which, through multiple 
interactions in the economic, social, cultural and political spheres, generated continuous 
progress in terms of social justice, equality, well-being and respect for the fundamental 
dignity of all individuals, groups and peoples. Given that the human person and all peoples 
are the central subjects, not objects, of development, development was a subjective process 
and, hence, could not be imposed from outside, but must be based on participation on the 
basis of equality and non-discrimination, in a process of integrated economic, social and 
cultural development, in accordance with peoples&#8217; aspirations to progress and well-being. 
In this connection, she recalled article 9 (1) of the Declaration, which provides that &#8220;[a]ll 
the aspects of the right to development set forth in the present Declaration are indivisible 
and interdependent and each of them should be considered in the context of the whole&#8221;. 
The Chairperson-Rapporteur underscored her determination to ensure that the Working 
Group would continue to make progress toward fulfilling its mandate on the basis of 
consensus built on shared principles and values that were at the very core of the Declaration 
on the Right to Development. 
</p>
<p>12. At its first meeting, the Working Group formally adopted the agenda (see annex I) 
and Programme of Work of its fourteenth session that it had elaborated at its informal 
intersessional meeting. Prior to their adoption, the United States of America, while not 
objecting to the adoption of the programme of work, noted that this did not imply that an 
agreement had been reached on the issue of indicators. The European Union and 
Switzerland, echoing the stance of the United States of America, stated that its adoption did 
not prejudice the discussion of indicators. The Islamic Republic of Iran (on behalf of the 
Non-Aligned Movement), Cuba and Egypt expressed their approval for the programme of 
work, stating that Human Rights Council resolution 21/32 had not mandated the Working 
Group to consider indicators. The Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that the respective 
positions had been noted at the informal intersessional meeting and appealed to the 
Working Group to continue with the task of examining the draft operational subcriteria, in 
accordance with the recommendation of the Working Group at its thirteenth session, 
endorsed by the Human Rights Council by resolution 21/32, in the absence of consensus 
within the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>13. The Chairperson-Rapporteur also reported3 on the informal intersessional meeting of 
the Working Group, which was held on 18 and 19 April 2013, pursuant to Human Rights 
Council resolution 21/32. At that meeting, the Working Group had elaborated and agreed 
on the draft programme of work for its fourteenth session, listing the draft operational 
subcriteria to be reviewed at each meeting, and identifying United Nations and other 
relevant international organizations which would receive a special invitation to contribute 
</p>

</p>
<p>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/Pages/14thSession.aspx. 
 3  The Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8217;s oral report on the informal intersessional meeting of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group is available at http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/Pages/14thSession.aspx. </p>


<p>to the examination of the draft operational subcriteria of particular relevance for the work 
of their respective organizations. Discussions at the intersessional meeting centred on (1) the 
issues to be discussed at its fourteenth session; (2) the experts to be invited; and (3) the 
methodology to be adopted to ensure their effective participation, taking into account the time 
constraints. There was general agreement that, at its fourteenth session, the Working Group 
would undertake its first reading of the draft operational subcriteria. There was also general 
agreement on the importance of expert contributions to the process of considering the draft right 
to development criteria and the operational subcriteria. However, positions diverged as to 
whether the indicators listed in the report of the High-Level Task Force should be reviewed 
along with the draft operational subcriteria, the kind of experts to be invited and the 
methodology to be adopted for expert contributions.  
</p>
<p>14. Commenting on the Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8217;s oral report, the United States of 
America requested that it be placed on record that there had been no agreement or outcome 
of the informal meeting, explaining that there had been a useful exchange but no agreement 
on the issue of indicators. Switzerland suggested using the current list of indicators to 
further refine the subcriteria, which was supported by Australia, the European Union and 
the United States of America. The Islamic Republic of Iran, on behalf of the Non-Aligned 
Movement, sought clarification on whether the Working Group was moving away from the 
adopted agenda and the programme of work. It reiterated the position of the Non-Aligned 
Movement that the Working Group had no mandate to discuss the so-called indicators. 
Egypt and Sri Lanka asked the Working Group to proceed with discussing the operational 
subcriteria. The Chairperson-Rapporteur said that the programme of work had been 
formally adopted and the issues under consideration had been clearly identified. She urged 
the Working Group to adhere to the programme of work and the time limit set.  
</p>
<p>15. During the session, the Working Group focused on the first reading of the draft right 
to development operational subcriteria proposed by the High-Level Task Force, gathering 
views and refinements to the proposed subcriteria, as well as proposals for additional 
subcriteria. For that purpose, the Working Group had before it two conference room papers 
(A/HRC/WG.2/14/CRP.4 and 5), prepared by the Secretariat pursuant to Human Rights 
Council resolution 21/32, containing, respectively, submissions received from 
Governments, groups of Governments and regional groups, and submissions from other 
relevant stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, funds, programmes and 
institutions, as well as other relevant multilateral institutions and forums. The papers were 
prepared by the Secretariat pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 21/32. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General statements 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Islamic Republic of Iran, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, pointed out 
that the international community faced financial, climate and economic crises, which 
threatened development and led to increased poverty. Despite the turbulence in financial 
markets, the current institutional arrangements did not adequately address these issues. It 
was necessary to include a strong development agenda at the national level and an 
international framework and cooperation that would promote development with adequate 
policy space. Creating adequate policy space and building a development-friendly global 
economic environment would require systemic reforms at the international level, for which 
the post-2015 development agenda discourse would be well suited. The Non-Aligned 
Movement reiterated that the right to development was an individual and collective right 
incurring national responsibility and international responsibility of States for the creation of 
an enabling environment for its full realization. It was essential to strike a balance between </p>


<p>national and international responsibilities, and to ensure access to resources by developing 
countries and their participation in global decision-making for the realization of the right to 
development. It called for systemic reforms and the establishment of a mechanism within 
the United Nations to evaluate the incorporation of the right to development in its work. 
The right to development was on par with all other human rights and its criteria and 
subcriteria should evolve into an international legal standard.  
</p>
<p>17. The European Union reiterated its commitment to sustainable development and 
poverty eradication. The right to development was based on the interdependence and 
indivisibility of all rights, and required that human rights and development policies make 
the human being the central subject. The European Union emphasized that States had 
primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions for 
development.  
</p>
<p>18. Sri Lanka said that it had taken steps to implement the right to development 
nationally with effective results such as rural development, high literacy rates and free 
health care. However, national responsibility alone was not enough, and the international 
element was essential for the realization of the right to development, including 
mainstreaming this right in the United Nations. Pakistan said that cross-cutting issues of the 
global economic crisis must be considered by the Working Group in order to build an 
enabling environment for development. 
</p>
<p>19. The United States of America stated that it was determined to engage in a 
constructive discussion to make the right to development unifying rather than divisive. It 
would not join a consensus on negotiating a binding treaty and believed that the Working 
Group should consider limiting the criteria and subcriteria to a few critical elements that 
focused on the human rights aspects of the right to development. It was of the view that 
indicators were consistent with development practice and necessary for evaluating its most 
significant effect on the lives of the largest number of people. International financial 
institutions did not have human rights obligations, States did not have human rights, and the 
primary responsibility for development rested with States. The Working Group should align 
criteria with specific rights and emphasized non-discrimination, gender and women&#8217;s 
rights, and good governance. The United States of America said it did not support 
subcriteria on the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the 
World Bank, nor the discussion of specific treaties such as the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. This should be discussed within a separate 
intergovernmental process, for instance, within the context of the post-2015 development 
agenda.  
</p>
<p>20. According to Switzerland, the right to development was a universal principle arising 
from human rights codification as a whole. The right to development could bring 
development and human rights together, and the full realization of human rights for all was 
the ultimate goal of development. Achieving the Millennium Development Goals required 
policy coherence toward global partnership that took the right to development into account. 
States had primary responsibility for the creation of national and international conditions 
conducive to the right to development. The Fourth High-level Forum on Aid Effectiveness 
called for international cooperation to meet the challenge of development. A human rights-
based approach was necessary to strengthen partnership for development. Switzerland did 
not think that a legally binding instrument on the right to development was a solution, but 
would support continuing dialogue and pragmatic solutions. The criteria and subcriteria 
could lead to a political agreement on guidelines for global partnership. 
</p>
<p>21. China said that the right to development was an inalienable human right and the 
process of development was not balanced. The international community should strengthen 
partnership for development and improve mechanisms of global governance. The United 
Nations played a leadership role in setting up an effective framework for sustainable </p>


<p>development. The international community should respect the diversity of States in making 
development decisions. 
</p>
<p>22. In the view of Norway, the right to development was complex and influenced by 
global trends. The mainstreaming of the right to development should be on par with other 
human rights and it should bring human rights and the right to development closer together. 
Poverty reduction and development required good governance. Development should be 
participatory and transparent. Human rights needed to be mainstreamed in development 
processes. Development was a human right, and States had the responsibility to protect, 
respect and fulfil human rights using the maximum available resources. Human rights 
should be the framework for development cooperation. Both national and international 
responsibilities were critical in ensuring an enabling environment. 
</p>
<p>23. Senegal said that given the uncertain times with the economic crisis, the realization 
of the right to development was more than ever a necessity. The international community 
must demonstrate its political commitment and give the right to development the high 
profile it deserved, in particular in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. It 
hoped that the current process could move towards adoption of a legally binding instrument 
at the end. Algeria, Cuba, Indonesia, South Africa and the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela also stressed the need for a legally binding instrument on the right to 
development. 
</p>
<p>24. Cuba reiterated the need to allocate more time to the Working Group in order to 
speed up its work. It said that the sole purpose of indicators was to permit developed 
countries to question the levels of the realization of rights. Cuba did not object to discussing 
freedom of expression and good governance, but there were more important issues to focus 
on, including the unjust and undemocratic international order. That was the reason the 
reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, international governance and the rule of law at 
the international level must be addressed. Disarmament and nuclear disarmament were 
relevant as they concern peace. The Working Group must also discuss real international 
cooperation, not limited to aid but also with regard to technology transfer, cooperation and 
trade. The principal obstacle to true development in Cuba was the economic and trade 
blockade by the United States, which was also recognized during the universal periodic 
review.  
</p>
<p>25. Australia said that it did not support providing additional working days to the 
Working Group and requested that the process be continued step by step in order to build 
consensus. It expressed concern about creating a new international instrument on the right 
to development and called for greater consensus on the definition and scope of the right to 
development. The Human Rights Council did not have a development or trade mandate; it 
should focus on the human rights mandate. 
</p>
<p>26. According to India, the draft criteria and operational subcriteria focussed unduly on 
individual national responsibilities. They must also focus on the international aspects and 
special needs of developing countries, such as special and differential treatment, common 
but differentiated responsibilities, and the need for policy space. Indonesia expressed 
concern about the non-implementation of the right to development and stressed the urgency 
of strengthening international cooperation in the face of multidimensional crises. 
</p>
<p>27. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela stated that the implementation of the right to 
development was necessary for the realization of all human rights and regretted that this 
right had been blocked by some countries, including through unilateral coercive measures 
which flagrantly violated the fundamental rights of some countries in the South. The 
predatory capitalist system directly threatened developing countries and least developed 
countries.  </p>


<p>28. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said it was 
committed to the promotion and implementation of the right to development and supported 
the work of the Working Group. As the focal point for consideration of trade and 
development and interrelated issues, UNCTAD placed development at the centre of its 
work. 
</p>
<p>29. Centre Europe &#8211; Tiers Monde said that the world today was marked by inadequate 
development, poverty and inequality, which demonstrated the failure of neoliberal policies. 
Concepts such as growth and competition should be ruled out from the criteria. Instead, 
focus should be given to respecting the right of peoples to self-determination, State 
sovereignty, democracy at the national and international levels, and the responsibility of 
international institutions. The ONG Hope International said that prevailing issues 
concerning food security, health and other human rights situations on the ground should be 
given priority by the Working Group. A legally binding instrument might not be an 
effective way to address these problems. It called for a day devoted to development efforts 
at the Human Rights Council or a development periodic review, which would create an 
environment favourable to the realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>30. Caritas Internationalis, on behalf of the Working Group of Catholic Organizations 
on the Right to Development and International Solidarity, said that it preferred the term 
&#8220;parameters&#8221; to &#8220;criteria&#8221;. It called for a periodic review of progress towards these 
parameters, which should allow flexibility for States to develop their own specific 
subparameters. Friedrich Ebert Stiftung said that States could not ignore human rights 
obligations when entering international agreements in other fields. The Indian Council of 
South America said that the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples must be 
recognized and expressed concern about the lack of participation of indigenous peoples in 
the development of international instruments.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Review of progress in the implementation of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p><b>including consideration, revision and refinement of the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>development criteria and operational subcriteria 
</b></p>
<p>31. At its 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th meetings, from 13 to 15 May, the Working Group 
considered and revised the draft operational right to development subcriteria listed in the 
annex of addendum 2 to the report of the High-Level Task Force on the implementation of 
the right to development on its sixth session (A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.2) under attribute 
1, &#8220;Comprehensive and human-centred development policy&#8221; as well as proposals for 
additional subcriteria under new criteria proposed at the last session of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>32. Prior to the substantive review of the subcriteria, the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
presented to the Working Group two conference room papers4 which contained submissions 
received since the last session of the Working Group from Governments, groups of 
Governments and regional groups, as well as inputs from non-governmental organizations. 
Providing a brief overview and highlighting the suggestions relevant to the discussion of 
the current session, the Chairperson-Rapporteur stated that the submissions varied 
significantly in their approach, ranging from detailed proposals to more general assessment 
or comments. One submission noted that the draft criteria and operational subcriteria 
provided a well-constructed and comprehensive framework to measure the essential 
features of the right to development. Another submission, while generally supportive of the 
methodology and approach, commented that there was inconsistency in the manner in 
</p>
<p>  
 4  All submissions received in 2012 and 2013 are available at 
</p>
<p>http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/Pages/HighLevelTaskForceWrittenContributions.aspx </p>


<p>which the criteria and subcriteria were drafted and suggested their reformulation, including 
by providing more concrete and practicable details for each subcriterion.  
</p>
<p>33. Among the suggestions made, one submission underlined the link between 
international solidarity and the right to development and its mutually reinforcing nature, 
and proposed reorganizing the criteria and operational subcriteria according to a suggested 
list of right to development principles and related articles of the Declaration on the Right to 
Development. Another submission expressed the view that the criteria and subcriteria 
lacked explicit reference to gender equality, and commented that civil and political rights 
were as important for development processes as economic, social and cultural rights, and 
they should be better reflected. Other suggestions included paying more attention to the 
development rights of indigenous peoples and minorities, adding new criteria on the 
recognition of international solidarity as a right, adopting and implementing a 
comprehensive and legally binding international instrument on the right to development, 
and recognizing the right to peace of persons and peoples, the Chairperson-Rapporteur said 
when concluding her presentation on the conference room papers. 
</p>
<p>34. During the consideration of the operational subcriteria, several speakers stressed the 
need to simultaneously consider the indicators proposed by the High-Level Task Force. 
They pointed out that the draft subcriteria identified by the High-Level Task Force were not 
operational and that operational elements or indicators would be required, consistent with 
development practice and a results-based approach. Raising concerns and objections, a 
number of other speakers stated that indicators were outside the mandate of the Working 
Group and that they had also been outside the scope of the mandate of the High-Level Task 
Force on the implementation of the right to development. They argued that indicators 
would only serve the purpose of judging the performance of developing countries, instead 
of contributing to the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of standards for the 
implementation of the right to development, in accordance with the resolutions of the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>35. The Chairperson-Rapporteur appealed to the members of the Working Group to 
refrain from introducing language or elements that relate to indicators, which were not 
mandated by the Human Rights Council and on which there was no consensus within the 
Working Group, and to pursue<b> </b>its work on the consideration of the draft operational 
subcriteria, in accordance with Council resolution 21/32. She drew the attention of the 
Working Group to paragraph 14 of the second addendum to the report of the High-Level 
Task Force on the implementation of the right to development on its sixth session 
(A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.2), which distinguished operational subcriteria from 
indicators: &#8220;The criteria and sub-criteria should be relatively long-lasting and suitable for 
inclusion in a set of guidelines or a legally-binding instrument that development actors may 
use over the long term when assessing whether their own responsibilities or those of others 
are being met. The indicators, on the other hand, are intended to help in assessing 
compliance with the criteria and sub-criteria, and are therefore context-specific and subject 
to change over time.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>36. During consideration of the operational subcriteria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, on 
behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, stated that human rights were interlinked and must 
be addressed in an integral manner, including all economic, social and cultural rights, some 
of which were not reflected in the list of draft criteria and operational subcriteria. 
Switzerland called for the use of human rights language such as the right to food, the right 
to water and the right to health. Non-discrimination, gender equality, a decent standard of 
living and certain aspects of civil and political rights, such as the right to life and freedom 
of expression, should be referenced from the very beginning. The Islamic Republic of Iran, 
on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, proposed different subcriteria with regard to 
compliance with international commitments by various multilateral policy regimes. It also </p>


<p>called for financial and technical assistance and capacity-building for developing countries. 
The United States of America noted its reservation to specific language regarding 
developing countries, stating that human rights were universal and belonged to those in 
developing and developed countries alike. The Islamic Republic of Iran, on behalf of the 
Non-Aligned Movement, referred to the Declaration on the Right to Development, which 
stated that sustained action was required to promote more rapid development of developing 
countries.   
</p>
<p>37. Commenting on the subcriterion on reducing risks of domestic financial crises, 
Centre Europe &#8211; Tiers Monde stated that in the globalized world, there was a hegemony of 
finance and a concentration of capital in certain entities such as banks and insurance 
companies, which had a real impact on people&#8217;s lives. Concerning the volatility of national 
commodity prices, Morocco stressed the need to fight against speculation in world markets, 
specifically when it led to price volatility of agricultural and food products. The United 
States of America cautioned that policy measures seeking to mitigate price volatility might 
distort the market, and suggested instead a focus on addressing the impact of price volatility 
with, for instance, social safety nets. In this context, UNCTAD stated that General 
Assembly resolution 66/188 of 22 December 2011 addressing excessive price volatility in 
food and related financial and commodity markets should be taken into account. It also 
noted that the General Assembly resolution in question commenced by recalling the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

<p>38. The Working Group also discussed a number of issues such as the transfer of 
technology, intellectual property rights, biofuels, the digital divide, natural resources, 
renewable energy, peace and security, and natural disasters in relation to the right to 
development.
