TEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST
NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2005
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position of Texas Pacific
Land Trust (the “Trust”) as of September 30, 2005 and the results of its operations for the three month and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and its cash flows for the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The financial statements and footnotes included herein
should be read in conjunction with the Trust’s annual financial statements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and
for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2004 included in the Trust’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
No value has been assigned to the land held by the Trust other than parcels which have been acquired through
foreclosure and a limited number of parcels which have been acquired because they were offered for sale and
were contiguous to parcels already owned by the Trust. Consequently, no allowance for depletion is computed,
and no charge to income is made therefor, and no cost is deducted from the proceeds of the land sales in
computing gain or loss thereon.
The Sub-shares and the Certificates of Proprietary Interest are freely interchangeable in the ratio of one
Certificate of Proprietary Interest for 600 Sub-shares or 600 Sub-shares for one Certificate of Proprietary Interest.
The Trust’s effective Federal income tax rate is less than the 34% statutory rate because taxable income is
reduced by statutory percentage depletion allowed on mineral royalty income.
The results of operations for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.
The Trust invests cash in excess of daily requirements primarily in overnight investments in loan participation
instruments with maturities of ninety days or less. Such investments are deemed to be highly liquid debt
instruments and classified as cash equivalents for purposes of the statements of cash flows.
Supplemental cash flow information for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 is
summarized as follows:
Federal income taxes paid
$3,933,000
$2,190,176

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” establishes standards for
the way public business enterprises are to report information about operating segments. SFAS No. 131 utilizes
the management approach as a basis for identifying reportable segments. The management approach is based
on the way that management organizes the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions and
assessing performance. The Trust’s management views its operations as one segment and believes the only
significant activity is managing the land which was conveyed to the Trust in 1888. The Trust’s management
makes decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment based on the same financial
information presented in these financial statements. Managing the land includes sales and leases of such land,
and the retention of oil and gas royalties.

Item 2.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the Financial Statements, including the Notes
thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. Period-to-period comparisons of financial
data are not necessarily indicative, and therefore should not be relied upon as indicators, of the Trust’s future
performance. Words or phrases such as “does not believe” and “believes”, or similar expressions, when used in this
Form 10-Q or other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, are intended to identify “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Results of Operations for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2005 Compared to the Quarter Ended September 30,
2004
Earnings per sub-share certificate were $1.20 for the third quarter of 2005 compared to $6.10 for the third quarter
of 2004. Total revenues were $4,523,076 for the third quarter of 2005 compared to $21,630,083 for the third quarter of
2004, a decrease of 79.1%.
This substantial decrease in revenues and earnings resulted from the fact that revenues for the third quarter of
2004 had been significantly higher than normal due to a September 2004 one-time sale of approximately 1,400 acres of
land near El Paso, Texas for aggregate consideration of $19,234,300. In the third quarter of 2005, land sales totaled
$1,691,883, representing the sale of 1,478.21 acres at an average price of $1,144.55 per acre. In the comparable period
of 2004, land sales totaled $19,356,335, representing the sale of 2,968.27 acres at an average price of $6,521.08 per
acre.
Land sales may vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter. The total dollar amount, the average price
per acre, and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of land sales
in the future. The Trust is a passive seller of land and does not actively solicit sales of land. The demand for, and the
sales price of, any particular tract of the Trust’s land is influenced by many factors, including, the national and local
economies, the rate of residential and commercial development in nearby areas, livestock carrying capacity, and the
condition of the local agricultural industry, which itself is influenced by range conditions and prices for livestock and
other agricultural products. Approximately 99% of the Trust’s land is classified as ranch land and intermingled with
other ownerships to form ranching units. Ranch land sales are, therefore, largely dependent on the actions of the
adjoining landowners.
Rentals, royalties and sundry income were $2,409,478 for the third quarter of 2005 compared to $2,054,273 for the
third quarter of 2004, an increase of 17.3%. This increase resulted primarily from increases in oil and gas royalty
income which more than offset a decline in easement and sundry income. The increase in oil and gas royalty revenue
was attributable to the significantly higher market prices for oil and gas which prevailed during the third quarter of 2005
compared to the third quarter of 2004, which more than offset decreases in the volume of production of oil and gas in
the 2005 period.
Oil and gas royalty revenue was $2,064,879 for the third quarter of 2005, compared to $1,662,328 for the third
quarter of 2004, an increase of 24.2%. Oil royalty revenue was $1,397,342 for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of
32.0% from the third quarter of 2004. Although crude oil production subject to the Trust’s royalty interest decreased
8.2% in the third quarter of 2005, this was more than offset by a 43.8% increase in the average price per royalty barrel
of crude oil in the 2005 third quarter compared to the 2004 third quarter. Gas royalty revenue for the third quarter of
2005 was $667,537, an increase of 10.6% from the third quarter of 2004, resulting from a price increase of 47.6%,
which more than offset a decrease of 24.9% in the volume of gas produced.
6
Easement and sundry income was $226,028 for the third quarter of 2005, a decrease of 19.5% from the third
quarter of 2004. This category of income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
Interest revenue was $421,715 for the third quarter of 2005 compared to $219,475 for the third quarter of 2004, an
increase of 92.1%, primarily due to a $136,057 increase in interest from notes receivable. This increase in interest from
notes receivable was primarily attributable to the fact that the notes receivable relating to the significant sale of land
near El Paso, Texas, which occurred late in the third quarter of 2004, were outstanding throughout the 2005 third
quarter. As of September 30, 2005, notes receivable for land sales were $19,079,395, a decrease of 19.2% from
September 30, 2004. This decrease resulted from prepayments of principal on outstanding notes receivable. Sundry
interest was $82,688 for the third quarter of 2005, a 401.0% increase from the third quarter of 2004. Sundry interest
income fluctuates based on cash on hand for investment and interest rates on short-term investments.
Taxes, other than Federal income taxes, increased 5.7% for the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third
quarter of 2004. This increase is attributable to an increase in oil and gas production taxes, which more than offset a
decrease in ad valorem taxes associated with land sales.
General and administrative expenses increased 13.2% for the third quarter of 2005 compared to the third quarter
of 2004, primarily due to an increase in professional fees.
Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005 Compared to the Nine Months 
Ended September 30, 2004
Earnings per sub-share certificate were $2.90 for the first nine months of 2005 compared to $7.26 for the first nine
months of 2004. Total revenues were $11,167,557 for the first nine months of 2005 compared to $26,468,114 for the
first nine months of 2004, a decrease of 57.8%.
This substantial decrease in revenue and earnings resulted from the fact that revenues for the first nine months of
2004 had been significantly higher than normal due to a September 2004 one-time sale of approximately 1,400 acres of
land near El Paso, Texas for aggregate consideration of $19,234,300. In the first nine months of 2005, land sales
totaled $2,986,748, representing the sale of 11,453.13 acres at an average price of $260.78 per acre. In the comparable
period of 2004, land sales totaled $20,171,626, representing the sale of 11,382.83 acres at an average price of
$1,772.11 per acre. During the first nine months of 2005, the Trust purchased 5,546.92 acres of land located in
Culberson County, Texas from the State of Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $315,501, or approximately,
$56.88 per acre. While the Trust is generally not a purchaser of land, the parcels purchased (which were among others
offered for sale by the state) were interspersed among parcels already owned by the Trust. The purchase of these
parcels will make the Trust’s holdings in Culberson County more contiguous.
Rentals, royalties, and sundry income were $6,868,842 for the first nine months of 2005 compared to $5,621,420
for the first nine months of 2004, an increase of 22.2%. This increase resulted primarily from increases in oil and gas
royalty revenue. The increase in oil and gas royalty revenue was attributable to the significantly higher market prices for
oil and gas which prevailed during the first nine months of 2005 compared to the first nine months of 2004, which more
than offset decreases in the volume of production of oil and gas in the 2005 period.
Oil and gas royalty revenue was $5,807,918 for the first nine months of 2005 compared to $4,591,971 for the first
nine months of 2004, an increase of 26.5%. Oil royalty revenue was $3,915,511 for the first nine months of 2005, an
increase of 32.3% from the first nine months of 2004. Although crude oil production subject to the Trust’s royalty
interest decreased 5.1% in the first nine months of 2005, this was more than offset by a 39.4% increase in the average
price per barrel of crude oil in the first
7
nine months of 2005 compared to the first nine months of 2004. Gas royalty revenue for the first nine months of 2005
was $1,892,407, an increase of 15.9% from the first nine months of 2004, resulting from a price increase of 24.9%,
which more than offset a decrease of 7.3% in the volume of gas produced.
Easement and sundry income was $668,005 for the first nine months of 2005, an increase of 1.5% from the first
nine months of 2004. This category of income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.
Interest revenue was $1,311,967 for the first nine months of 2005 compared to $675,068 for the first nine months
of 2004, an increase of 94.3%, due to increases of $517,018 in interest from notes receivable and $119,881 in sundry
interest, respectively, during the first nine months of 2005 compared to the first nine months of 2004. The increase in
interest on notes receivable was primarily attributable to the fact that the notes receivable relating to the significant sale
of land near El Paso, Texas, which occurred late in the third quarter of 2004, were outstanding throughout the first nine
months of 2005. As of September 30, 2005, notes receivable for land sales were $19,079,395, a decrease of 19.2%
from September 30, 2004. This decrease resulted from prepayments of principal on outstanding notes receivable.
Sundry interest was $159,362 for the first nine months of 2005, a 303.6% increase from the first nine months of 2004.
Sundry interest income fluctuates based on cash on hand for investment and interest rates on short-term investments.
Taxes, other than Federal income taxes, increased 6.4% for the first nine months of 2005 compared to the first
nine months of 2004. This increase is attributable to an increase in oil and gas production taxes, which more than
offset a decrease in ad valorem taxes associated with land sales.
General and administrative expenses increased 16.6% for the first nine months of 2005 from the first nine months
of 2004, primarily due to increases in pension expense and professional fees.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Trust’s principal sources of liquidity are revenues from oil and gas royalties, lease rentals and receipts of
interest and principal payments on the notes receivable arising from land sales. In the past, those sources have
generated more than adequate amounts of cash to meet the Trust’s needs and, in the opinion of management, should
continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes in the information related to market risk of the Trust since December 31,
2004.
Item 4.   Controls and Procedures
Pursuant to Rule 13a-15, management of the Trust under the supervision and with the participation of Roy
Thomas, the Trust’s Chief Executive Officer and David M. Peterson, the Trust’s Chief Financial Officer, carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the Trust’s fiscal quarter covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, Mr. Thomas and Mr.
Peterson concluded that the Trust’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material
information relating to the Trust required to be included in the Trust’s periodic SEC filings.
There have been no changes in the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting during the Trust’s most recently
completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.
