<p><i> Noting</i> the efforts under way in the framework of the Working Group on the Right to

<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Working Group (A/HRC/12/28); 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i>: </p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To continue to act to ensure that its agenda promotes and advances sustainable 
development and the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and, in this regard, to 
lead to raising the right to development, as set out in paragraphs 5 and 10 of the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action, to the same level and on a par with all other human rights 
and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To endorse the workplan for the task force for the period 2009-2010, outlined in 
paragraph 46 of the report of the Working Group, which would ensure that the criteria for the 
periodic evaluation of global partnerships, as identified in Millennium Development Goal 8, and 
their corresponding operational sub-criteria, to be submitted by the task force to the Working 
Group at its eleventh session in 2010, address in a comprehensive and coherent manner the 
essential features of the right to development, as defined in the Declaration on the Right to 
Development, including by addressing the priority concerns of the international community 
beyond those enumerated in Millennium Development Goal 8; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) That the above criteria, once considered, revised and endorsed by the Working 
Group, should be used, as appropriate, in the elaboration of a comprehensive and coherent set of 
standards for the implementation of the right to development; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) That, upon completion of the three phases of the workplan, the Working Group will 
take appropriate steps to ensure respect for and practical application of these standards, which 
could take various forms, including guidelines on the implementation of the right to 
development, and evolve into a basis for consideration of an international legal standard of a 
binding nature, through a collaborative process of engagement; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To renew the mandate of the Working Group until it completes the tasks entrusted to 
it by the Council in its resolutions 4/4 and 9/3, and that the Working Group shall convene annual 
sessions of five working days and submit its reports to the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue to take all necessary measures and allocate necessary resources for the effective 
implementation of the present resolution, taking into account the needs for the effective 
implementation of the workplan referred to in subparagraph (b) above; 
</p>

a matter of priority at its future sessions.
