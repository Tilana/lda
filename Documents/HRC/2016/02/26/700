<p><b>  28/8. The effects of foreign debt and other related international 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and other relevant international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> all resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and the Human Rights Council on the effects of structural adjustment and economic 
</p>
<p>reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, the latest being Council resolution 25/16 of 15 April 
</p>
<p>2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also </i>its resolutions 25/9 of 27 March 2014 and 27/30 of 26 September 
</p>
<p>2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>further </i>its resolution S-10/1 of 23 February 2009 on the impact of the 
</p>
<p>global economic and financial crises on the universal realization and effective enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
</p>
<p>2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international 
</p>
<p>cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or 
</p>
<p>humanitarian character, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the 
</p>
<p>international community to make all efforts to help to alleviate the external debt burden of 
</p>
<p>developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such 
</p>

<p>countries to attain the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of their 
</p>
<p>people, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the determination expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration 
</p>
<p>to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income 
</p>
<p>developing countries through various national and international measures designed to make 
</p>
<p>their debt sustainable in the long term, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of the role, mandate and activities of other United Nations agencies, funds 
</p>
<p>and programmes in dealing with the issues of foreign debt and international financial 
</p>
<p>obligations, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the concern expressed in the declaration that heads of State and Government 
</p>
<p>of the Group of 77 and China issued on the occasion of the summit entitled &#8220;For a New 
</p>
<p>World Order for Living Well&#8221;, held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Plurinational State of 
</p>
<p>Bolivia, on 14 and 15 June 2014,1 that reiterates the importance of not allowing vulture 
</p>
<p>funds to paralyse the debt restructuring efforts of developing countries, and that these funds 
</p>
<p>should not supersede the State&#8217;s right to protect its people under international law, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden faced 
</p>
<p>by the most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is 
</p>
<p>unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people-
</p>
<p>centred sustainable development and poverty eradication and that, for many developing 
</p>
<p>countries and countries with economies in transition, excessive debt servicing has severely 
</p>
<p>constrained their capacity to promote social development and to provide basic services to 
</p>
<p>create the conditions for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> that, despite repeated rescheduling of debt, developing 
</p>
<p>countries continue to pay out more each year than the actual amount they receive in official 
</p>
<p>development assistance, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the sovereign right of any State to restructure its sovereign debt, which 
</p>
<p>should not be frustrated or impeded by any measure emanating from another State, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its concern</i> about the voluntary nature of international debt relief 
</p>
<p>schemes, which has created opportunities for vulture funds to acquire defaulted sovereign 
</p>
<p>debt at vastly reduced prices and then seek repayment of the full value of the debt through 
</p>
<p>litigation, seizure of assets or political pressure, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 68/304 of 9 September 2014, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly decided to elaborate and adopt a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt 
</p>
<p>restructuring processes with a view to, inter alia, increasing the efficiency, stability and 
</p>
<p>predictability of the international financial system and achieving sustained, inclusive and 
</p>
<p>equitable economic growth and sustainable development, in accordance with national 
</p>
<p>circumstances and priorities, and recalling also Assembly resolution 69/247 of 29 
</p>
<p>December 2014, in which the Assembly decided to establish an ad hoc committee to 
</p>
<p>elaborate through a process of intergovernmental negotiations such a multilateral legal 
</p>
<p>framework, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that debt burden further complicates the numerous problems facing 
</p>
<p>developing countries, contributes to extreme poverty and is an obstacle to sustainable 
</p>
<p>human development, and is thus a serious impediment to the realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>in particular the right to development, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>1. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign 
</p>
<p>debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/28/59. 
</footnote> and welcomes the work 
</p>
<p>and contributions of the Independent Expert;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. <i>Recall</i>s the endorsement of the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 20/10 
</p>
<p>of 5 July 2012, of the guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights;<footnote name="3">A/HRC/20/23, annex. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reiterates</i> its encouragement to all Governments, relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies, funds and programmes and the private sector to take into consideration the 
</p>
<p>guiding principles when designing policies and programmes; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Recalls</i> that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural development of its people and, to that end, has the right and 
</p>
<p>responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to 
</p>
<p>external specific prescriptions for economic policy;  
</p>
<p>5. <i>Recognizes</i> that structural adjustment reform programmes and policy 
</p>
<p>conditionalities limit public expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give 
</p>
<p>inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries 
</p>
<p>manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reaffirms</i> the fact that responses to the global financial and economic crises 
</p>
<p>should not result in a decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop 
</p>
<p>debt relief measures, as that would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights in affected countries; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its concern</i> that the level of implementation and the reduction of 
</p>
<p>overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still 
</p>
<p>low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long-
</p>
<p>term debt burden; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its conviction</i> that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve 
</p>
<p>debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the 
</p>
<p>above-mentioned initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in 
</p>
<p>the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices 
</p>
<p>for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt 
</p>
<p>overhang; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Regrets</i> the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the 
</p>
<p>unsustainable foreign debt burden of low- and middle-income heavily indebted countries, 
</p>
<p>and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current 
</p>
<p>system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those 
</p>
<p>of indebted countries and the poor in those countries, and therefore calls for an 
</p>
<p>intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce 
</p>
<p>substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those 
</p>
<p>severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, 
</p>
<p>and by armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p>10<i>. Condemns</i> the activities of vulture funds for the direct negative effect that the 
</p>
<p>debt repayment to those funds, under predatory conditions, has on the capacity of 
</p>
<p>Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, particularly economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights and the right to development; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>11. <i>Affirms</i> that, from a human rights perspective, the existence of vulture funds 
</p>
<p>has a direct negative effect on the capacity of Governments to fulfil their human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations, especially with regard to economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p>12.<i> Reaffirms</i> in this context that the activities of vulture funds highlight some of 
</p>
<p>the problems in the global financial system and are indicative of the unjust nature of the 
</p>
<p>current system, which directly affects the enjoyment of human rights in debtor States, and 
</p>
<p>calls upon States to consider implementing legal frameworks to curtail predatory vulture 
</p>
<p>fund activities within their jurisdictions; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Acknowledges</i> that, in least developed countries and in several low- and 
</p>
<p>middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a 
</p>
<p>considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals for development and poverty reduction will not be 
</p>
<p>attained; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Recognizes</i> that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that 
</p>
<p>should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and 
</p>
<p>development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, 
</p>
<p>including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that 
</p>
<p>debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, 
</p>
<p>ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are 
</p>
<p>accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Recalls once again</i> the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief without 
</p>
<p>further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for 
</p>
<p>their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction;  
</p>
<p>16. <i>Urges</i> the international community, including the United Nations system, the 
</p>
<p>Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions 
</p>
<p>for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of major 
</p>
<p>United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World 
</p>
<p>Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular 
</p>
<p>those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in 
</p>
<p>particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with 
</p>
<p>economies in transition; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Recalls</i> the pledge contained in the Political Declaration annexed to General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly, to find effective, 
</p>
<p>equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-
</p>
<p>servicing burdens of developing countries; 
</p>
<p>18.<i> Stresses</i> the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign 
</p>
<p>debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new 
</p>
<p>loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative 
</p>
<p>frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established 
</p>
<p>to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and 
</p>
<p>programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their 
</p>
<p>implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an 
</p>
<p>equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of broader social development 
</p>
<p>goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor </p>


<p>countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the 
</p>
<p>overall realization of human rights; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Also stresses</i> that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt 
</p>
<p>should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national 
</p>
<p>development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that 
</p>
<p>ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights;  
</p>
<p>20. <i>Further stresses</i> that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt 
</p>
<p>relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not 
</p>
<p>worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Calls upon</i> States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to 
</p>
<p>continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the 
</p>
<p>Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
</p>
<p>and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without 
</p>
<p>affecting ongoing programmes; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Calls upon</i> creditors, particularly international financial institutions, and 
</p>
<p>debtors alike to consider the preparation of human rights impact assessments with regard to 
</p>
<p>development projects, loan agreements or poverty reduction strategy papers; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Reaffirms</i> the fact that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor 
</p>
<p>countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy 
</p>
<p>environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment 
</p>
<p>policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 
</p>
<p>24<i>. Urges</i> States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take 
</p>
<p>urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly 
</p>
<p>affected by HIV/AIDS so that more financial resources may be released and used for health 
</p>
<p>care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Reiterates </i>its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt 
</p>
<p>problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need 
</p>
<p>for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral 
</p>
<p>financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared 
</p>
<p>interests and responsibilities; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Encourages</i> all States to participate in the negotiations aimed at establishing 
</p>
<p>a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes, as referred to by 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly in its resolution 68/304, and invites States participating in the 
</p>
<p>negotiations to ensure that such a multilateral legal framework will be compatible with 
</p>
<p>existing international human rights obligations and standards;  
</p>
<p>27. <i>Reiterates</i> its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in 
</p>
<p>particular of least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures 
</p>
<p>arising from foreign debt; 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to continue to explore the interlinkages with 
</p>
<p>trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural 
</p>
<p>adjustment and foreign debt, and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted 
</p>
<p>with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development with a 
</p>
<p>view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign 
</p>
<p>debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p>29. <i>Encourages</i> the Independent Expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Human </p>


<p>Rights Council and its Advisory Committee on issues relating to economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights and the right to development in his work; 
</p>
<p>30. <i>Requests </i>the Independent Expert to report to the General Assembly on the 
</p>
<p>issue of the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of 
</p>
<p>States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights; 
</p>
<p>31. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to provide the Independent Expert with all 
</p>
<p>necessary assistance, in particular all the staff and resources required to carry out his 
</p>
<p>functions; 
</p>
<p>32. <i>Urges</i> Governments, international organizations, international financial 
</p>
<p>institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with 
</p>
<p>the Independent Expert in the discharge of the mandate; 
</p>
<p>33. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to submit a report on the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the present resolution to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-first session; 
</p>
<p>34. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter at its thirty-first session 
</p>
<p>under the same agenda item.
