<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Human Rights Council on the issue of the human rights and international solidarity, including 
Commission resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolutions 5/1 entitled &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council&#8221; and 5/2 entitled &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of 
the Human Rights Council&#8221;, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall 
discharge his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and their annexes, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the importance, in view of the promotion and protection of international 
solidarity, of the declarations and programmes of action of international conferences such as the 
World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in 1993, the International Conference on 
Financing for Development, held in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2002, the United Nations Conference 
on Environment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002, and the World 
Conference on Disaster Reduction, held in Kobe, Japan, in 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that the widening gap between economically developed and developing 
countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the international 
community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its capacities, to 
make the maximum effort possible to close this gap, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital 
component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the right to 
development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>

international solidarity for a period of three years; 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To promote the realization of the right of peoples and individuals to international 
solidarity, inter alia, through the further development of guidelines, standards, norms and 
principles enhancing the enjoyment of this fundamental right and the adoption of measures at the 
regional and international levels, to promote and consolidate international assistance to 
developing countries in their endeavours in development and the promotion of conditions that 
make the full realization of all human rights possible; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To seek views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, other 
relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the discharge of 
his/her mandate, taking into account the outcomes of all major United Nations and other global 
summits and ministerial meetings in the economic and social fields; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To examine ways and means of overcoming existing and emerging obstacles to the 
realization of the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To make recommendations on possible steps with a view to attaining progressively 
the full realization of the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, and 
suggestions to address the increasing challenges of international cooperation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To work in close cooperation with all States and intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations, as well as with other relevant actors representing the broadest 
possible range of interests and experiences, within their respective mandates, to mainstream fully 
the effective realization of the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity in the 
activities of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To continue participating in and contributing to relevant international conferences 
and events with the aim of promoting the realization of the right of peoples and individuals to 
international solidarity; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests </i>all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities, and to cooperate with the independent 
expert in his/her mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by him/her and to give 
serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the independent expert to visit 
their countries, and to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate effectively; 
</p>

necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the 
independent expert; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests </i>the independent expert to continue work on the preparation of a draft
