<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 18/8 the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism to 
prepare a study on the role of languages and culture in the promotion and protection of the 
rights and identity of indigenous peoples, and to present it to the Human Rights Council at 
its twenty-first session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Expert Mechanism called for submissions to States, indigenous peoples, non-
State actors, national human rights institutions and other stakeholders to assist it in the 
preparation of this study. The submissions received by the Expert Mechanism are, where 
permission was granted, available on the Expert Mechanism's website.1  The study also 
benefited from contributions made at the Brunel University Law School and Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights expert seminar on indigenous peoples&#8217; languages 
</p>
<p>and cultures in London on 8 and 9 March 2012.2  The Expert Mechanism appreciates all the 
submissions received. 
</p>
<p>3. This study builds upon and supports the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s first study on lessons 
learned and challenges to achievement of the right of indigenous peoples to education 
(2009).3  As the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights notes, &#8220;cultural life is 
intrinsically linked to the right to education &#8230; , through which individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities pass on their values, religion, customs, language and other cultural references, 
and which helps to foster an atmosphere of mutual understanding and respect for cultural 
values.&#8221;4 
</p>
<p>4. This study builds upon the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s study on indigenous peoples and the 
right to participate in decision-making,5 not least because indigenous peoples have the right 
to participate in decision-making impacting on their languages, cultures and language and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>5. Unless indicated otherwise, references to languages and culture are to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; languages and cultures. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Relevant international and regional standards  
</b></p>
<p>6. As the most comprehensive and detailed compilation of the rights of indigenous 
peoples, and with near-universal endorsement by States, the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples provides an authoritative description of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in 
</p>
<p>relation to their cultures and languages.  Many of the articles in the Declaration relate to the 
protection and promotion of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures. 
</p>
<p>7. The Declaration includes numerous provisions on protection against discriminatory 
and adverse treatment of indigenous peoples on cultural grounds and positive measures to 
support indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures.  These include rights: against assimilation and 
destruction of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures (art. 8); to prevention of, and redress for, forced 
assimilation, dispossession of their lands, territories and resources (art. 8); to belong to an 
indigenous community or nation in accordance with indigenous peoples&#8217; traditions and 
</p>
<p>customs (art. 9); to practise and revitalize indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural traditions and 
  
</p>

 5 A/HRC/18/42 and A/HRC/15/35. </p>


<p>customs (art. 11); to teach their cultural and religious traditions and to repatriation of their 
human remains (art. 12); to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their 
histories, languages and oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures (art. 
13); to control their own education systems and institutions providing education in their 
own languages (arts. 14 and 15); to &#8220;maintain, control, protect and develop&#8221; their cultural 
heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions (art. 31); to determine 
their own identity and membership; and to promote, develop and maintain their institutional 
structures and their distinctive customs, spirituality, traditions, procedures, practices, 
juridical systems or customs (art. 34). Central to all of these rights is indigenous peoples&#8217; 
right to self-determination, which includes indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to freely determine 
their cultural development, to autonomy and to participate fully, if they so choose, in the 
political, economic, social and cultural life of the State (arts. 3, 4 and 5). 
</p>
<p>8. Cultural and language rights are indivisible and central to all the other rights, 
including as expressed in International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 
(1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.  It requires, for example, due regard for 
indigenous peoples&#8217; customs and customary law and respect for the special importance for 
</p>
<p>the cultures and spiritual values of the peoples concerned with their relationship with their 
land and territories. 
</p>
<p>9. The provisions of the Declaration are consistent with, and elaborate upon, 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their cultures and languages as expressed in a number of other 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, including the right of all to participate in the cultural life of the 
community in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and in United Nations human 
rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>10. The Human Rights Committee, in interpreting article 27 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has expressed the positive duties incumbent on 
States to protect indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural rights, including their rights in relation to 
their lands, territories and resources as well as in relation to their traditional activities,6 the 
need to include indigenous peoples in decisions affecting them,7 the requirement to 
interpret the right to culture consistently with the right to self-determination in the context 
of indigenous peoples&#8217; issues,8 and has called on States to adopt measures to support the 
revival of cultures and languages.9 
</p>
<p>11. Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, States 
parties recognize the right of everyone to take part in cultural life.  The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has consistently called upon States parties to protect 
and promote indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their cultures and languages.  In its general 
comment No. 21 on the right of everyone to take part in cultural life, it recognizes the 
collective element of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to culture, noting that &#8220;the strong communal 
</p>
<p>dimension of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural life is indispensible to their existence, well-being 
and full development, and includes the right to the lands, territories and resources which 
they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired.&#8221;10  It also notes that 
States&#8217; educational programmes should respect the cultural specificities of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples and incorporate them in such programmes.   
</p>
<p>12. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has called upon States 
to &#8220;recognize and respect indigenous distinct culture, history, language and way of life as

<p>an enrichment of the State's cultural identity and to promote its preservation&#8221;, to &#8220;provide 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples with conditions allowing for a sustainable economic and social 
development compatible with their cultural characteristics&#8221; and to &#8220;ensure that indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities can exercise their rights to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and 
customs and to preserve and to practise their languages.&#8221;11  It has expressed specific 
concern about prohibitions on the use of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages.12 
</p>
<p>13. The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that indigenous children shall not 
be denied the right to enjoy their culture, to profess and practise their own religion or to use 
their language.  In its general comment No. 11 on indigenous children, the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child recognizes that special measures may be needed to enable 
indigenous children to enjoy their cultural rights, including positive action on the part of the 
State; the significance of the collectivity to indigenous children&#8217;s enjoyment of their 
cultures; and the need to include indigenous peoples in decisions about the best interests of 
indigenous children, noting the need for cultural sensitivity.13 
</p>
<p>14. Cultures and languages are an integral part of the mandate of the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  UNESCO has a number of 
instruments especially relevant to cultures and languages, as well as a broader policy of 
encouraging indigenous peoples&#8217; self-determined cultural development and work in relation 
to endangered languages.  The 2001 UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity 
includes specific references to cultural diversity, cultural rights and indigenous peoples.14  
Accordingly, under article 5, 
</p>
<p>All persons have therefore the right to express themselves and to create and 
disseminate their work in the language of their choice, and particularly in their 
mother tongue; all persons are entitled to quality education and training that fully 
respect their cultural identity; and all persons have the right to participate in the 
cultural life of their choice and conduct their own cultural practices, subject to 
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>15. The UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 
(2003) recognizes that &#8220;communities, in particular indigenous communities, groups and, in 
some cases, individuals, play an important role in the production, safeguarding, 
maintenance and re-creation of intangible cultural heritage.&#8221;  The UNESCO Convention on 
the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005) includes 
references to indigenous peoples and requires that States parties endeavour to create an 
environment which encourages groups to &#8220;create, produce, disseminate, distribute and have 
access to their own cultural expressions, paying due attention to the special circumstances 
and needs of women as well as various social groups, including persons belonging to 
minorities and indigenous peoples.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. Other international standards reinforce the importance of rights to cultures and 
languages and can be of relevance to indigenous peoples, including the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>Belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious or Linguistic Minorities, the European Charter for 
Regional and Minority Languages, the ASEAN Declaration on Cultural Heritage and 
various policy documents of the international and regional system.

<p>17. Courts and commissions on human rights at the regional level have supported robust 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their cultures and languages.  Notably, the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights have firmly 
established that States should create effective mechanisms for titling and demarcating 
indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources in accordance with their customs, 
cultures and traditions.15  The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
following the Inter-American Court, has drawn similar conclusions. 
</p>
<p>18. The United Nations special procedures and, in particular, the Special Rapporteur on 
the rights of indigenous peoples and the Independent Expert in the field of cultural rights, 
have examined cultural and language rights in depth as they relate to indigenous peoples.  
The Independent Expert notes that cultural rights relate to a broad range of issues, 
including: &#8220;expression and creation, including in diverse material and non-material forms 
of art; information and communication; language; identity and belonging to multiple, 
diverse and changing communities; development of specific world visions and the pursuit 
of specific ways of life; education and training; access, contribution and participation in 
cultural life; the conduct of cultural practices and access to tangible and intangible cultural 
heritage.&#8221;16 
</p>
<p>19. The international legal framework for the protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions and genetic resources has been an 
area of significant development recently, especially under the Convention on Biodiversity 
and within the World Intellectual Property Organization. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Cultures and languages and their relationship to indigenous 
</b>peoples&#8217; self<b>-determination and rights to lands, territories 
and resources 
</b></p>
<p>20. The close relationship between indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural rights and the right to 
self-determination is reflected in article 3 of the Declaration, which states that by virtue of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to self-determination, they may freely pursue their cultural 
development.  An integral part of the right to self-determination is the promotion and 
protection of all rights necessary for indigenous peoples to pursue their cultural 
development, underlining the indivisibility, interdependence and interrelation of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights.  Cultural and language rights are inherent in the array of rights set out in the 
Declaration and, as such, are critical to the overall implementation of the Declaration.17 
</p>
<p>21. The right to culture in the context of indigenous peoples includes their right to self-
determine their own culture and languages as an internal matter as well as to practise and 
celebrate their cultures and languages in the wider public domain.18  Indigenous peoples&#8217; 
cultures include their justice systems and the practice thereof, as well as their &#8220;right to 
maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural 
institutions, while retaining their right to participate fully, if they so choose, in the political, 
economic, social and cultural life of the State.&#8221; (art. 5). 
</p>
<p>22. Languages are an important element and expression of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
self-determination and can facilitate the practice of indigenous peoples&#8217; self-determination.  
Languages contain within them the tools to express indigenous collective juridical and

<p>political methodology and organization.  In many cases, indigenous peoples have 
maintained their traditions orally, embedded in their languages. As some submissions to the 
Expert Mechanism stated, indigenous peoples&#8217; control over their languages can be a tool in 
their decolonization.19 
</p>
<p>23. Recognition of the close connection between indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural and 
language rights and their rights related to their lands, territories and resources is necessary 
to ensure respect for indigenous peoples&#8217; right to self-determination,20 as recognized in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on indigenous peoples and their relationship to land.21  The 
Special Rapporteur outlines the following elements of the relationship of Indigenous 
peoples to their lands, territories and resources:22 
</p>
<p>(i) a profound relationship exists between indigenous peoples and their lands, 
territories and resources; (ii) this relationship has various social, cultural, spiritual, 
economic and political dimensions and responsibilities; (iii) the collective dimension 
of this relationship is significant; and (iv) the intergenerational aspect of such a 
relationship is also crucial to indigenous peoples&#8217; identity, survival and cultural 
</p>
<p>viability. 
</p>
<p>24. The maintenance and development of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures requires the 
protection of their lands, territories and resources.  Indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional 
territories, where their homes and kinships are located, are the spaces in which they practise 
their cultures. Indigenous peoples&#8217; connections to traditional territories, to their homes and 
to their communities, are important, even for those who have migrated elsewhere for work 
and education, to maintaining and developing indigenous cultures.23 
</p>
<p>25. Often there is a close relationship between indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures and 
languages and their physical and spiritual environments. Moreover, languages can contain 
information about practices associated with indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and 
</p>
<p>resources such as knowledge about hunting, fishing, trapping and gathering. Environmental 
and other harms to indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources can be devastating 
</p>
<p>to their cultures.  For all these reasons, it is imperative to protect and respect indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights to their lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p>26. Nomadic indigenous peoples have frequently faced additional challenges in seeking 
to have their rights to their land, territories and resources recognized, which has adversely 
impacted on their ability to practise, protect and promote their languages and cultures.  
Some of the problems stem from failures to recognize and respect indigenous peoples&#8217; laws 
regulating the use of their lands, territories and resources and ways of life which are 
different from that of non-indigenous populations. 
</p>
<p>27. International human rights standards and jurisprudence have clearly recognized the 
relationship between indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures and their rights to their lands, territories 
</p>
<p>and resources.  The Declaration recognizes &#8220;the urgent need to respect and promote the 
inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political, economic and social 
structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories and philosophies, especially 
their rights to their lands, territories and resources&#8221; and states the conviction that &#8220;control 
</p>
<p>  
 19 Kontin&#243;nhstats &#8211; The Mohawk Language Custodians.  
 20 For example, when indigenous peoples conduct cultural ceremonies and songs that express treaty-
</p>
<p>making principles, these ceremonies and songs protect their traditional lands, territories and 
resources.

<p>by indigenous peoples over developments affecting them and their lands, territories and 
resources will enable them to maintain and strengthen their institutions, cultures and 
traditions, and to promote their development in accordance with their aspirations and 
needs&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>28. Equally, regional human rights bodies have determined that the right to property and 
the right to non-discrimination mean that indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and 
resources held under indigenous law are entitled to the same level of protection and 
recognition as other types of property.24 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights has highlighted the link between cultural rights, rights to lands, territories and 
resources and the duty to obtain indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed consent in 
relation to the taking of indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources25. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. </b>Rights related to indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and identity<b> 
</b></p>
<p>29. In addition to the standards outlined above, the Declaration includes specific articles 
on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their languages, supported by international instruments 
</p>
<p>such as, inter alia, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  Under article 13, 
indigenous peoples &#8220;have the right to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future 
generations their histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and 
literatures, and to designate and retain their own names for communities, places and 
persons&#8221;.  States are also required to ensure that indigenous peoples can understand and be 
</p>
<p>understood in political, legal and administrative proceedings, where necessary through the 
provision of interpretation or by other appropriate means.  As discussed in the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s study on education, indigenous peoples have the right under article 14 to 
establish institutions providing education in their own languages.  Moreover, article 16 
states that &#8220;indigenous peoples have the right to establish their own media in their own 
languages&#8221; and that States &#8220;shall take effective measures to ensure that State-owned media 
duly reflect indigenous cultural diversity.&#8221; Also, States &#8220;should encourage privately owned 
media to adequately reflect indigenous cultural diversity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>30. ILO Convention No. 169 also includes specific rights in relation to languages, 
requiring that indigenous children, where practicable, be taught to read and write in their 
own indigenous language and that adequate measures shall be taken to preserve and 
promote the development and practice of the indigenous languages of the peoples 
concerned (art. 28).   
</p>
<p>31. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has many provisions which recognize the 
right of the child to education with a view to achieving this right progressively on the basis 
of equal opportunity, and that these rights be ensured by the State parties. 
</p>
<p>32. Language is an essential part of, and intrinsically linked to, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
ways of life, culture and identities.26  Languages embody many indigenous values and 
concepts and contain indigenous peoples&#8217; histories and development.  They are

p. 41. </p>


<p>fundamental markers of indigenous peoples&#8217; distinctiveness and cohesiveness as peoples.27 
Knowledge of languages is often necessary to enable indigenous individuals to fully 
participate in their families and communities and to create a sense of belonging.28 As one 
submission states, &#8220;(y)our language holds your identity, your family&#8217;s history, your 
</p>
<p>belonging, roots, how to pass on knowledge and information, names of trees, plants, place, 
alive, growing.&#8221;29  
</p>
<p>33. Language is the main mechanism in the intergenerational transmission of indigenous 
knowledge and is one of the signs of life of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures.  It is one of the 
essential elements of the identity of indigenous peoples.  Indigenous women are central to 
this transmission of knowledge as traditional purveyors in communities in preserving and 
teaching languages. 
</p>
<p>34. Many languages are threatened with extinction. UNESCO estimates that at least 43 
per cent of the estimated 6,000 languages spoken in the world are endangered,30 of which 
many are those of indigenous peoples. This is a global challenge, affecting all regions of the 
world. On the Australian continent, at the time of European settlement, there were an 
estimated 250 indigenous languages in existence.  Statistics suggest that in less than 300 
years at least 205 of those 250 languages have either been lost or are at very serious risk of 
being lost.31  In the Russian Federation, some languages are now spoken by people 
numbering less than ten.  Africa is considered the most linguistically diverse continent in 
the world, but many of the languages spoken by its indigenous peoples are the most 
endangered. 
</p>
<p>35. Small indigenous groups,32 and those groups not formally recognized as indigenous 
peoples, face additional challenges in their efforts to promote, revitalize and keep their 
languages. 
</p>
<p>36. Despite the dismal state of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages generally,33 ongoing 
negative external influences upon them, and rights in relation to their languages, there is 
often a lack of State support for their retention and revitalization.34  For example, 
indigenous peoples&#8217; languages are often not officially recognized in legislation and policy 
and insufficient funding is available for language revitalization. Even where official efforts 
are made to adopt bilingual education programmes, implementation can be a problem.35 
</p>
<p>37. There are numerous concerns regarding loss of indigenous languages due to the 
introduction of the mainstream language as the national language, including the exclusive 
use of mainstream languages in government education systems. 
</p>
<p>38. Indigenous peoples&#8217; languages are usually spoken by a minority of individuals 
within a State and have been, historically and today, subject to assimilationist policies 
including physical repression or punishment of indigenous individuals speaking their 
languages.36  There are examples of the placement, often forced, of indigenous children into 
schools, including residential, boarding and day schools, to teach them non-indigenous

<p>ways, which has had a tremendously negative impact on the continuation and preservation 
of languages and cultures, on the physical and mental health of indigenous individuals and 
on the retention of their traditional knowledge.37 Even when the schools closed, indigenous 
cultures remained devalued.  The urbanization of many indigenous peoples, often mobilized 
by economic pressures and the introduction of market economies, can separate indigenous 
peoples from the lands and territories where their languages and cultures are practised, 
often leading to forced assimilation.  As the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of 
Canada recently concluded, assimilationist policies were a direct assault on indigenous 
cultures and languages.38 
</p>
<p>39. Discrimination against indigenous peoples on the basis of their languages continues, 
which can have a negative impact on indigenous peoples&#8217; identity and collective dignity,39 
with serious consequences, including in terms of health and social behaviour.40 
</p>
<p>40. In some places, fewer indigenous children are learning their languages, even when 
their parents, families and communities speak the language, meaning that indigenous 
languages are more commonly spoken by elders.  As UNESCO has recognized, social 
factors can contribute to failures to transmit languages, such as perceptions of their lack of 
utility in mainstream society and concerns about the discrimination that can attach to 
indigenous language speakers, especially indigenous children.  It is important that 
indigenous peoples, with appropriate State and international support, pass on their 
languages to the next generation of youth and that youth take responsibility for learning 
their languages.41 One submission also highlighted the need to protect against 
discrimination against individuals who do not speak their indigenous language.42 
</p>
<p>41. There are too few positive examples of the promotion and revitalization of 
languages.  However, where they exist, they have usually involved indigenous peoples and 
States working in partnership to provide the requisite support, including official recognition 
of indigenous languages as national languages, the recognition of indigenous language 
place names, funding for indigenous language immersion and/or bilingual schooling for 
children and adults,43 media available in indigenous languages, the use of indigenous 
languages in official proceedings (including legal and judicial and quasi-judicial), with 
provision made for translation and interpretation,44 support for publications in indigenous 
languages, support for indigenous-led and culturally sensitive education systems,45 public 
awareness campaigns and the allocation of funds for language revitalization.46 
</p>
<p>42. Research indicates that children who receive indigenous language immersion 
education have stronger indigenous language skills than children who learn indigenous 
languages in second language programmes and, in addition, have the same level of the

<p>dominant language of the State.47 They are also better equipped to take part in cultural 
activities. Notably, the UNESCO strategy for language in education is guided by principles 
to foster mother-tongue instruction and bilingual and multilingual education.48 
</p>
<p>43. Traditional knowledge associated with indigenous peoples&#8217; natural environment is 
often embedded in indigenous peoples&#8217; languages.49  
</p>
<p>44. Families and, in particular, indigenous women, are repositories of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; traditions and cultures and can play a central role in the retention, transmission and 
revitalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages. As a caregiver, a mother has an integral 
role in passing on indigenous languages to her children and embedding in them the 
importance of language.  Concern has been raised about legislation and policies that 
discriminate against indigenous women and the impact that has had on the retention of 
languages and cultures.50 Notably, the Declaration requires that particular attention be paid 
to the rights and special needs of indigenous women, youth and children, inter alia (art. 22). 
</p>
<p>45. Indigenous women and youth inherit much responsibility for the preservation of 
their indigenous languages and should work together with other members of their 
communities to do so, including elders.51 
</p>
<p>46. States should take primary responsibility for providing formal legal and policy 
support for the promotion and, where necessary, revitalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
languages, albeit with the consent of the indigenous peoples affected.52  Positive examples 
include the New Zealand Maori Language Act 1987, which recognizes the Maori language 
as an official language, the Constitution of Morocco 2011,53 the Norwegian Constitution 
and Norwegian Sami Act, the Northwest Territories&#8217; Official Act and the establishment of 
the Foundation of Indigenous Languages in Canada, which developed draft legislation 
aimed at promoting and protecting indigenous languages. 
</p>
<p>47. In some States, support of indigenous languages and cultures is consistent with their 
obligations in treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between indigenous 
peoples and States.54 
</p>
<p>48. Use of indigenous languages need not be confined to indigenous individuals and 
peoples and should be encouraged outside of their communities.55 As one submission noted 
in the Australian context, &#8220;the adoption of First Peoples languages by the wider Australian 
</p>
<p>community as everyday vernacular, including place and street names, national park and 
conservation reserve names and interpretative signage, plant and animal names and 
description of natural phenomena and landmarks is an important part of Australian society, 
reconciliation, awareness-raising, as well as being a matter of deep pride for First 
Peoples.&#8221;56

<p>49. Media and information technology, including the internet, can provide essential and 
effective tools for the promotion and revitalization of indigenous languages and are 
particularly valuable tools to educate children.  The use of indigenous languages in media 
increases the visibility of indigenous languages, illustrates and promotes their relevance in 
contemporary life, demarginalizes indigenous languages and improves indigenous peoples&#8217; 
access to their languages. Positive examples include the development of the Google search 
engine site in the Maori language and the Cree Dictionary online project in collaboration 
with the University of Alberta and the Maskwac&#237;s Cree. 
</p>
<p><b> V. </b>Indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural identity<b> 
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> </b>Indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures are often one of their defining features, 
of crucial importance to their identity as collectives, forming a bond as nations, and as 
indigenous individuals. Indigenous cultures are often based on the concept of respect for 
others, mutual support and the maintenance of the integrity of the individual, providing the 
basis for harmonious relations.57  Indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural distinctiveness, on the one 
hand, and commonalities between indigenous cultures, such as the value placed on 
collectivity and spirituality have provided cohesion to the global indigenous peoples&#8217; 
movement.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Definition of culture 
</b></p>
<p>51. Numerous definitions of culture have been proposed at the international level, as 
reviewed by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.58 The Declaration 
does not define culture per se, although indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural rights are implicit in 
many articles and are clearly recognized and delineated throughout, as detailed above.  The 
Independent Expert in the field of cultural rights has noted that it is unnecessary for her to 
define culture, &#8220;and may be inappropriate.&#8221;59  Any definition of culture, including that 
implicit here, should not be viewed as exclusive. 
</p>
<p>52. Indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures include tangible and intangible manifestations of their 
ways of life, achievements and creativity, are an expression of their self-determination and 
of their spiritual and physical relationships with their lands, territories and resources.  
Indigenous culture is a holistic concept based on common material and spiritual values and 
includes distinctive manifestations in language, spirituality, membership, arts, literature, 
traditional knowledge, customs, rituals, ceremonies, methods of production, festive events, 
music, sports and traditional games, behaviour, habits, tools, shelter, clothing, economic 
activities, morals, value systems, cosmovisions, laws, and activities such as hunting, 
fishing, trapping and gathering.  Indigenous cultures are influenced by their environment, 
impacting on a people&#8217;s common perspective of the world and underlining its connection 
with nature.  Indigenous cultures shape their views of the world and life. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Collective 
</b></p>
<p>53. Values of collective responsibility and respect for elders, ancestors, spirits and the 
community are often embodied in indigenous cultures, which can guide indigenous 
individuals&#8217; behaviour in everyday life. Indigenous social systems are closely related to the 
</p>
<p>  
 57 J. Lasimbang, H. Maran and J. Lasimbang, &#8220;Asia Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Perspectives on Development&#8221;. 
 58 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 21 (2009). 
 59 A/HRC/14/36, para. 5. </p>


<p>culture on which they are based, including respect for the dignity of all members of the 
community, expressed through reciprocity, mutual trust and service to others.  Many 
indigenous social systems uphold and recognize the equal rights, worthiness and usefulness 
of each member of a community. Balanced, harmonious and cohesiveness relations provide 
the basis for co-responsibility to each member. The close relationship among members of 
indigenous peoples is one of their key characteristics. 
</p>
<p>54. Indigenous peoples have unique structures and institutions that have developed over 
time. These structures often have the family as a primary unit, expanding to larger 
communal and social institutions, and are generally governed by indigenous law and sacred 
teachings. 
</p>
<p>55. In many communities, the values of collectivity and of working and socializing 
together are being undermined, in part due to the imposition of administrative structures. In 
the past, many societies had councils of elders dealing with issues in the community but 
now these issues are in the hands of State governmental bodies, in which the local 
community has no say. The value of collectivity, the traditional work ethic and communal 
work is challenged and also endangered as money matters take up a larger role. The 
Declaration states that indigenous peoples have the right to determine their own identity 
and membership in accordance with their customs and traditions and the right to promote, 
develop and maintain their institutional structures and their distinctive customs, spirituality, 
traditions, procedures, practices and, in the cases where these exist, juridical systems or 
customs. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Indigenous spirituality 
</b></p>
<p>56. The concept of indigenous spirituality is the application of respect for Creation into 
everyday living and relationships.  The important elements of indigenous spirituality 
include maintaining connections with ancestors and spirits or deities, social relations, 
respect for nature and the relationship with their lands, territories and resources.  
Indigenous spirituality is inclusive and may be practised by holding rituals, ceremonies, 
applying positive and respectful values, and by ensuring spirituality is transferred through 
generations. It is closely linked to indigenous culture and nature. In particular, land is a 
source of spirituality. There is a strong belief that belongingness to land is also socio-
economical, emotional and political. 
</p>
<p>57. Mainstream religions can be a threat to indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural development, 
particularly if governments adopt policies to promote a particular religion or prohibit 
indigenous spiritual practices or if States&#8217; laws and policies and courts do not recognize 
indigenous peoples&#8217; spirituality and spiritual associations, including to land, territories and 
</p>
<p>resources, as equal to other forms of spirituality. Some argue that to lose one&#8217;s language 
means one can no longer practise spirituality as originally given. 
</p>
<p>58. The Declaration guarantees indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to manifest, practise, develop 
and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies and to maintain, 
protect, and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites (art. 12).  The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated that &#8220;States parties must 
</p>
<p>also respect the rights of indigenous peoples &#8230; to maintain and strengthen their spiritual 
</p>
<p>relationship with their ancestral lands and other natural resources traditionally owned, 
occupied or used by them, and indispensable to their cultural life.&#8221;60  
</p>
<p>  
 60 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 21 (2009), para. 49. </p>


<p><b> D. Cultural diversity and heritage 
</b></p>
<p>59. Indigenous peoples have made considerable contributions to the world&#8217;s cultural 
diversity and heritage. 
</p>
<p>60. The Declaration affirms that all peoples contribute to the diversity and richness of 
civilizations and cultures, which constitute the common heritage of humankind and express 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future 
manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, 
designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature (art. 11).  
The Independent Expert in the field of cultural rights has stated &#8220;in order to respect and 
protect cultural identity, tangible cultural heritage should be preserved with a view to 
maintaining its authenticity and integrity, intangible cultural heritage should be safeguarded 
to ensure viability and continuity, and the rights of access to and enjoyment of cultural 
heritage should be guaranteed.&#8221;61 
</p>
<p>61. An important component of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their cultural heritage is 
their right to the repatriation of ceremonial objects and human remains (art. 12), which 
requires the cooperation of the places where such objects and remains are stored, such as 
museums. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions and genetic 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources 
</b></p>
<p>62. As is well documented, indigenous peoples have expressed the concern that existing 
international mechanisms to protect intellectual property are inadequate to protect 
traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions and genetic resources and are 
culturally inappropriate. Concerns identified include the fact that intellectual property 
systems are focused on protecting the intellectual property of individuals rather than 
collectives, view intellectual property as alienable, and are not consistent with indigenous 
peoples&#8217; laws and policies related to their knowledge.  
</p>
<p>63. It is essential that international processes in which laws governing the use of 
traditional knowledge, cultural expressions and genetic resources that are developed 
conform to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights under the Declaration and, in particular, article 31.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Positive duties 
</b></p>
<p>64. As expressed by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right 
to culture includes positive, as well as negative, obligations on States.62  Moreover, the 
Human Rights Committee has stated that,63 
</p>
<p>culture manifests itself in many forms, including in a particular way of life 
associated with the use of land resources, especially in the case of indigenous 
peoples.  That right might include such traditional activities as fishing or hunting 
and the right to live in reserves protected by law.  The enjoyment of those rights may 
require positive legal measures of protection and measures to ensure the effective 
participation of members of minority communities in decisions which affect them.  
</p>

 62 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 21 (2009).   
 63 Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 23 (1994) on article 27. </p>


<p>The protection of these rights is directed to ensure the survival and continued 
development of cultural identity, thus enriching the fabric of society as a whole. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Challenges faced in the promotion and protection of 
indigenous language and culture rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Adaptation of culture 
</b></p>
<p>65. As the Independent Expert in the field of cultural rights has noted, protecting 
cultures can be challenging &#8220;especially in societies where people feel that their cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage is under threat, due in particular to the dynamism or dominance of other cultures, 
globalization and development processes and/or the dominant position of corporate actors 
in the field of culture and leisure.&#8221;64  Moreover, loss of lands, territories and resources can 
limit the ability of indigenous cultures to adapt organically. Because of these changes and 
obstacles, there must be an effort to maintain traditional values and instil cultural strength, 
pride and dignity. Part of this effort may include fostering traditional ways of learning to 
transfer indigenous knowledge, culture and traditions to future generations and to maintain 
pride and identity in indigenous culture. 
</p>
<p>66. Cultural identity cannot exist without people practising their culture and traditions. 
New expressions of traditional values may be necessary to revitalize cultural practices in 
the modern context but should not alter the essence of the indigenous culture. Adaptation of 
cultures is an indicator of their strength and is necessary to attract the young.  Indigenous 
cultures should not be viewed as relics of the past belonging to museums but, instead, be 
understood and protected as alive and dynamic, in need of enrichment, to enable them to 
strengthen despite external influences.   <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Revitaliz</b>ation of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures<b> 
</b></p>
<p>67. Where indigenous languages and cultures are under threat, indigenous peoples and 
States together in partnership have the primary responsibility for the revitalization of 
cultures and languages.  In many cases, it is for indigenous peoples, as an expression of 
their right to cultural self-determination, to show the commitment and take the necessary 
action to implement practices in support of their cultures and languages.  For example, 
mandatory immersion programmes should be established. 
</p>
<p>68. The role of States should be to support indigenous peoples in their endeavours to 
practise and express their cultures and languages.  States should be careful not to intrude on 
indigenous peoples&#8217; self-determination in this respect by, for example, implementing 
cultural and language programmes without the free, prior and informed consent of 
indigenous peoples.  Instead, States may be better placed to provide the requisite legislative 
and institutional framework necessary to protect and promote indigenous peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>languages and cultures and, in addition, provide financial and technical support.65 
</p>
<p>69. There are many positive examples of indigenous peoples taking the initiative to 
protect and promote their cultures and languages, such as activities leading to the 
revitalization of the Maori language, which now has considerable State support,66 including 
</p>
<p>

 66 Ibid., New Zealand Government.  </p>


<p>in the reservation of radio frequencies for the promotion of Maori culture and language and 
the legislative creation of a Maori television service.  In Canada there is the Aboriginal 
Peoples Television Network. 
</p>
<p><b> C. </b>Recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures<b> 
</b></p>
<p>70. In some States, indigenous peoples are required to provide evidence of their 
historical connections to their lands, territories and resources to obtain formal and official 
recognition of their rights to those lands, territories and resources.  Imposing such 
evidential burdens on indigenous peoples is costly and difficult, especially where they were 
colonized, and had lost their lands, territories and resources many centuries in the past.  
There are also significant threats to indigenous cultures when they are subjected to imposed 
legal evidentiary tests that require the inappropriate public sharing of cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The right to equality 
</b></p>
<p>71. Unique measures to support indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures may be required to achieve 
substantive equality.  In many cases, and especially where indigenous peoples are not 
dominant in the State within which they are located, they may find it difficult to protect 
their cultures as compared with the non-indigenous dominant groups.  Non-indigenous 
dominant groups can better reflect their cultural preferences in law and policy, to which 
indigenous peoples are subjected.  At the same time, it must be recognized that indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights should not be conceptualized as special measures but, instead, as distinct 
and permanent rights.   
</p>
<p>72. Measures to promote indigenous cultures should be premised on an intercultural 
approach &#8211; a coming together of different but equal cultural viewpoints. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Individual and collective aspects 
</b></p>
<p>73. Indigenous peoples have consistently asserted the collective nature of their cultural 
rights.  The Declaration is clear that cultural rights can be vested in indigenous peoples as 
collectives.  Other instruments also recognize collective rights, such as the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.  These instruments recognize the value of the collective in 
</p>
<p>its own right and, also, that violations have occurred against the cultures of collectives such 
as indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>74. One of the challenges to the recognition of collectives&#8217; rights to cultures has been 
the perception that they pose a threat to the sovereignty of States.  However, in many cases 
it is States&#8217; failures to recognize collectives, in attempts to assimilate them and/or 
discriminate against them, which have fuelled groups&#8217; desires to challenge the authority of 
the State. 
</p>
<p><b> F. </b>Development as a threat to indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures and languages<b> 
</b></p>
<p>75. Non-indigenous development of indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources 
has had, in many cases, a detrimental effect on indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures, including the 
</p>
<p>destruction of the places and spaces where indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures are practised.  In 
some cases, indigenous peoples have been involuntarily displaced.  Ongoing threats to </p>


<p>indigenous cultures include the power of dominant cultures and the influx of non-
indigenous people into indigenous territories, for reasons including resource exploitation, 
extraction and tourism.67 
</p>
<p>76. Indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures should, as UNESCO policy provides, be at the centre 
of the development of their lands, territories and resources, which in most cases requires 
their participation and consent. As ILO Convention No. 169 provides, indigenous peoples 
&#8220;shall have the right to decide their own priorities for the process of development as it 
affects their lives, beliefs, institutions and spiritual well-being and the lands they occupy or 
otherwise use, and to exercise control, to the extent possible, over their own economic, 
social and cultural development&#8221; (art. 7). The Human Rights Committee has confirmed that 
&#8220;economic development may not undermine the rights protected by&#8221; the right to culture.68   
</p>
<p><b> G. Climate change 
</b></p>
<p>77. Equally, many indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures are threatened by the consequences of 
climate change, including, potentially, loss of their lands, territories and resources.  
Moreover, neo-liberal approaches to measures to address climate change, such as the 
commodification of natural resources, conflict with some indigenous peoples&#8217; philosophical 
approaches to their relationship to the natural world. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Private sector 
</b></p>
<p>78. Many of the human rights challenges facing indigenous peoples in their enjoyment 
of their cultures come from the private sector.  States&#8217; duties to protect indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights to languages and cultures extend to preventing third parties from interfering with 
such rights.69  Moreover, in accordance with the Human Rights Council&#8217;s Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights, business enterprises have the responsibility to 
respect human rights, including cultures and languages, for example to ensure 
understanding in negotiations and agreements with indigenous peoples by providing 
translation in indigenous languages where necessary. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Gender 
</b></p>
<p>79. In many indigenous peoples&#8217; communities, men and women have distinct and 
gendered responsibilities to transmit their knowledge. Frequently, the gendered roles are of 
equal importance and should receive equal protection and acknowledgement. However, 
indigenous women have a unique role to play in the protection and promotion of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; cultures. Further, they may be the principal victims of violations of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights to their cultures, meaning that they deserve considerable attention in the 
protection and promotion of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures, consistent with article 22 of the 
Declaration.

<p><b> J. Children and youth 
</b></p>
<p>80. Indigenous children and youth have an important role as progenitors of indigenous 
languages and cultures. Many indigenous children and youth have no or limited access to 
education in their languages or to curricula reflecting their history, languages, creation 
stories and teaching them how language and culture reinforce their identity and their 
relationship to the land and all of Creation. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Assimilation 
</b></p>
<p>81. The perceived threat of indigenous cultures to &#8220;the national identity&#8221; has led many 
States to counter-factually deny the existence of indigenous peoples and to implement 
policies directed at assimilating them into mainstream society. Assimilation of indigenous 
peoples and individuals into mainstream cultures is a violation of international human 
rights law and especially indigenous peoples&#8217; and individuals&#8217; right to culture. 
</p>
<p>82. The forced and sometimes violent separation of indigenous children from their 
families and placement in boarding, residential or day schools or orphanages, with the aim 
of assimilating them into mainstream culture, constitutes a serious and ongoing breach of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to culture, contrary to article 8 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> L. </b>Indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to engage in economic activities associated 
<b>with their culture 
</b></p>
<p>83. Indigenous peoples&#8217; economic activities embody much of their culture and often 
involve the application of their knowledge, skills, technologies and values, as passed down 
to them by their ancestors.  They may also contain information about the sustainable use of 
the natural environment.  
</p>
<p><b> M. Importance of indigenous cultures and languages for indigenous health 
</b></p>
<p>84. The importance of indigenous languages and cultures to their social, mental and 
physical health has been highlighted.  The dislocation and disaffection experienced by 
indigenous peoples who have been colonized, dispossessed, urbanized and assimilated has 
had a devastating impact on the health of many indigenous peoples as collectives and as 
individuals.  In contrast, strong cultural affiliations to cultures can be positive and, 
&#8220;protective factors against the high risk of suicide in indigenous communities&#8221;.70 
</p>
<p><b> N. Cultural relativity 
</b></p>
<p>85. As the Independent Expert has noted, &#8220;there is a misplaced tendency to equate 
cultural diversity with cultural relativism.&#8221;71 Equally, it has been noted that the full 
promotion and protection of cultural rights has been hampered by the perception that these 
support cultural relativity, undermining the universality of human rights.  As outlined 
above, cultural diversity is of universal value, with each culture and language contributing 
to our understanding of human capacity.  Similarly, cultural rights are of universal

<p>application and indivisible from other human rights, especially when applied to indigenous 
peoples.   
</p>
<p><b> O. Alleged discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>86. Sometimes indigenous cultures, and especially their traditions and customs, are 
criticized on the grounds that they are allegedly discriminatory.  Too often, alleged 
discrimination within indigenous cultural practices is cited as a reason not to respect, 
promote and fulfil indigenous peoples&#8217; right to culture, to the detriment of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; right to self-determination and the marginalization of their cultures. 
</p>
<p>87. In assessing whether indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural practices infringe individuals&#8217; 
human rights, caution is necessary lest the judgment be made from a non-indigenous 
perspective and with a poor understanding of indigenous peoples&#8217; philosophies or the 
</p>
<p>rationales behind their mores.  The perspectives of the alleged victim of the allegedly 
discriminatory practice should be prioritized.  Indeed, the perspective of indigenous women 
is often unique, different from the perspectives of non-indigenous women. At the same 
time, discrimination against individuals should be eliminated. 
</p>
<p>88. It is important that the causes of discrimination within indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures 
are understood in an assessment of discrimination within indigenous cultural practices, such 
as the role that colonization and domination may have played, and are taken into account in 
measures to balance indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural and self-determination rights and the 
human rights of individuals. 
</p>
<p><b> P. Limitations on the right to culture 
</b></p>
<p>89. Human rights law permits certain limitations on the right to culture, which has been 
analysed by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Article 46(2) of the 
Declaration states that any limitation must be &#8220;in accordance with international human 
rights obligations&#8221;, &#8220;non-discriminatory and strictly necessary solely for the purpose of 
securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for meeting 
the just and most compelling requirements of a democratic society.&#8221; It has been required 
under human rights law that a limitation be reasonably and objectively justified, 
proportionate and necessary.  Accordingly, the means to address discriminatory indigenous 
cultural practices should impinge to the smallest extent possible on indigenous peoples&#8217; 
cultural and self-determination rights.72  Thus, in most cases, discriminatory indigenous 
cultural practices are best addressed by the indigenous peoples themselves, according to 
their own processes. 73 This may mean, for example, that it is inappropriate for States to 
abolish a cultural practice outright but to, instead, adopt a gentler means of influencing 
change consistent with human rights, as has been recognized by the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child.74

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Expert Mechanism Advice No. 3 (2012): 
Indigenous p</b>eoples&#8217; <b>languages and cultures 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>1. Distinct cultures and languages are often a central and principal feature of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; identities as collectives and as individuals, providing unity.  Indeed, 
the distinctiveness of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures is a common feature of 
</p>
<p>many indigenous peoples and the global indigenous peoples&#8217; movement.  Indigenous 
</p>
<p>cultures cannot be divorced from indigenous peoples&#8217; histories, often including 
colonization and dispossession, which have had a powerful impact on their languages and 
cultures. 
</p>
<p>2. Healthy indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures, while rooted in history, must 
not be understood as static.  It is essential that States, indigenous peoples, international 
institutions, national human rights institutions, non-governmental institutions and the 
private sector take a perspective on cultures that enhances their vitality, allowing them to 
live and breathe and take on new forms and shapes as voluntarily and customarily 
determined by indigenous peoples themselves.  Contemporary expressions and forms of 
indigenous languages and cultures are important modern extensions of their age-old 
traditions and an indicator of the good health of their cultures. 
</p>
<p>3. Indigenous cultures include their ways of life, protected by the right to self-
determination, and indigenous peoples&#8217; relationships, including spiritual connections, with 
</p>
<p>their lands, territories and resources.  They include manifestations of cultural practices, 
including economically driven activity, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions, 
jurisprudence, cosmovisions, spirituality, philosophies, membership codes, dispute 
resolution techniques, social values, arts, dress, song and dance. 
</p>
<p>4. Cultural diversity is a value in its own right, supported by the international legal 
framework, particularly as established by UNESCO. 
</p>
<p>5. The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples should be the basis of all 
action, including at the legislative and policy level, on the protection and promotion of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their languages and cultures.  Many of the rights in the 
</p>
<p>Declaration relate to indigenous cultures and languages, especially indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights to self-determination and to lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p>6. The impact of assimilationist policies on indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures 
has been in many cases extremely harmful, leading to the near extinction of indigenous 
languages and cultures. The deliberate use of boarding, residential schools and orphanages 
for indigenous children, with a focus on integrating them into non-indigenous mainstream 
societies, has been tragically harmful for indigenous peoples and their cultures and 
languages and the health of indigenous individuals, including the inter-generational trauma 
suffered by the children and grandchildren of attendees of such schools. 
</p>
<p>7. Strong action is required to address the effects of historical and ongoing 
discrimination against indigenous peoples and individuals based on their cultures and use of 
their languages.  Their languages and cultures will only flourish in environments when they 
are more broadly respected in their own right and for their contribution to an understanding 
of humanity. </p>


<p>8. Significant attention should be focused on understanding the historical and ongoing 
impact of the denigration of, and discrimination against, indigenous cultures and languages, 
which can led to social, mental and physical ill health.  Policies to address the social, 
mental and physical ill health of indigenous peoples cannot be divorced from an 
understanding of indigenous peoples&#8217; histories of marginalization and dispossession.  In 
many cases, the revitalization of indigenous cultures and languages, instilling pride in 
indigenous peoples on account of their distinctiveness, can be beneficial in addressing 
social problems associated with indigenous peoples&#8217; loss of their cultures and languages. 
</p>
<p>9. Where indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures are alleged to discriminate against individual 
members, the circumstances should be examined from the perspective of all the indigenous 
individuals involved, taking into account indigenous philosophies and the alleged victims&#8217; 
positions.  In general, indigenous peoples should be supported in their efforts to address the 
issues in the way that they choose.  Unapproved non-indigenous interference in indigenous 
cultures alleged to discriminate is not to be recommended unless sought by those who are 
the alleged victims of the discrimination. 
</p>
<p>10. Many of the ongoing threats to indigenous cultures and languages can be traced to 
the impact of the private sector on indigenous peoples, as is too often the case when 
indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources are exploited for business purposes.  As 
the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights clarify, business enterprises have the 
responsibility to respect human rights, including indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to languages 
</p>
<p>and cultures and traditional knowledge. 
</p>
<p><b> B. States 
</b></p>
<p>11. The protection and promotion of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures 
requires States to recognize them in their constitutions, laws and policies. 
</p>
<p>12. Indigenous peoples have the right to cultural self-determination, including the right 
to cultural autonomy, together with the right to advance their cultures within mainstream 
societies.  This right includes duties to obtain indigenous peoples&#8217; free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent when developing and implementing laws and policies related to indigenous 
languages and cultures, including to promote indigenous peoples&#8217; control over the 
</p>
<p>development of their languages and cultures and their traditional knowledge. 
</p>
<p>13. States must take measures to protect indigenous peoples from discrimination and 
violence, and from measures that would result in their forced assimilation. 
</p>
<p>14. States, in partnership with indigenous peoples, must advance the protection, 
promotion and respect for indigenous cultures, languages, traditions and customs.  State 
laws and policies addressing indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures must go beyond 
symbolism and be effective in practice, setting out clear and practical methods to support 
indigenous peoples in their own promotion and protection of their languages and cultures, 
in accordance with their right to self-determination.  This must include the allocation of 
sufficient financial, legal and policy support for the learning of indigenous languages, the 
teaching of indigenous cultural values and the training of indigenous educators.  Also, 
States must provide incentives for indigenous peoples to transmit their languages and 
cultures to younger generations, recognition of place names in indigenous languages, 
strategic plans for implementing public awareness campaigns about indigenous cultures and 
languages, incorporating indigenous language and cultures in relevant media, publishing 
books (for example, textbooks) and establishing immersion and bilingual schooling. 
</p>
<p>15. States are encouraged to create an environment of tolerance and understanding 
where indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures are celebrated within the State, 
promoting an understanding of the value of cultural difference within the society at large. </p>


<p>16. States should provide incentives for museums and other places where indigenous 
remains, artifacts and other cultural heritage are stored to inform the relevant indigenous 
peoples when they hold such treasures and to establish mechanisms to have them restored 
to indigenous peoples when they so desire. 
</p>
<p>17. There is a need for the recognition of the continuing value to communities and 
society of indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional knowledge, including spiritual, cultural and 
</p>
<p>linguistic knowledge. This will require long-term financial investments in measures for the 
reclaiming and relearning and sharing of this knowledge. The resources spent on this 
should be, at a minimum, commensurate with the monies and efforts previously spent to 
destroy such knowledge. 
</p>
<p>18. Indigenous peoples should have the necessary support to speak their languages in 
both the public and private domains, including in schools, legal proceedings, and in places 
providing health services. In addition, it may be appropriate to establish mechanisms to 
monitor States&#8217; compliance with indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to speak their languages and 
practise their cultures, such as an ombudsman to address complaints about failures to 
respect, protect and promote indigenous cultures and languages. 
</p>
<p>19. In protecting, promoting and respecting indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their cultures, 
States should treat all indigenous languages equally and take precautions not to favour 
supporting indigenous languages spoken by larger numbers of individuals. It is especially 
important that numerically small indigenous groups receive the support necessary to assist 
them in retaining their languages. 
</p>
<p>20. States should establish mechanisms, including monitoring, to ensure that indigenous 
peoples&#8217; traditional knowledge is not expropriated without the free, prior and informed 
</p>
<p>consent of indigenous peoples and provision is made for appropriate access and benefit-
sharing arrangements. 
</p>
<p>21. States should ensure that non-indigenous third parties, especially the private sector, 
do not infringe indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to languages and culture and understand the 
</p>
<p>flow-on effects that their activity on indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources can 
have on their languages and cultures. 
</p>
<p>22. When developing and implementing laws and policies to address social problems 
facing indigenous peoples, it is imperative that States take an approach that is sensitive to 
the impact of historical marginalization and dispossession on indigenous peoples and their 
cultures and languages. 
</p>
<p>23. In providing redress to indigenous peoples for the negative impacts of State laws and 
policies on indigenous peoples, States should prioritize the views of indigenous peoples on 
the appropriate forms of redress, which can include the return of lands, territories and 
resources, recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; governance structures, including their laws 
and dispute resolution processes and the finances necessary to enable indigenous peoples to 
implement their own techniques to revitalize and protect their languages and cultures.  
Customs, values and arbitration procedures of indigenous peoples should be recognized and 
appropriately respected by the courts and legal procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>24. Indigenous peoples have the primary responsibility to take control of the promotion 
and protection of their languages and cultures, with the support of the State as outlined 
above.  Thus, for example, indigenous peoples have a responsibility to work together to 
pass on their languages and cultures to younger generations and indigenous youth have a 
responsibility to learn their cultures and languages. </p>


<p>25. When indigenous peoples&#8217; consent is necessary for the State to enact or implement 
laws and policies that relate to their cultures and languages, indigenous peoples are 
encouraged to establish their own methods to facilitate the consent-seeking process, which 
should include all members of the indigenous peoples concerned. 
</p>
<p>26. Indigenous peoples have the responsibility to ensure that their cultures are enjoyed 
equally by all indigenous individuals and especially those who may be vulnerable to 
exclusion.  This includes the responsibility to establish mechanisms to effectively address 
allegations of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> D. International institutions 
</b></p>
<p>27. The United Nations should dedicate resources and expertise to the promotion and 
protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and culture. 
</p>
<p>28. It is imperative that United Nations institutions and related entities take a human 
rights-based approach to the development of international legal standards and policies on 
traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions and genetic resources, including in 
relation to access and benefit sharing, to ensure that they conform to the Declaration.  In 
addition, it is essential that such processes include the direct, full and equal participation of 
indigenous peoples to protect indigenous peoples&#8217; traditional knowledge. 
</p>
<p>29. Indigenous peoples should be included in the development of all local, national, 
regional and international endeavours to address climate change and a human rights 
approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation should be adopted at all levels. 
</p>
<p><b> E. National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>30. National human rights institutions have an important role to play in the revitalization 
and protection of indigenous languages and cultures, including promoting and monitoring 
States&#8217; laws and policies to protect and revitalize their cultures and languages and providing 
technical support for the implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to their cultures and 
</p>
<p>languages.  National human rights institutions are also well placed to create public 
awareness of cultures and languages, especially when dealing with indigenous peoples&#8217; 
issues. 
</p>
<p><b> F. International donors 
</b></p>
<p>31. While States have the primary obligation to respect, protect and promote indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights, it is essential that other entities, including the private sector and 
development agencies, respect indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to control development as it 
</p>
<p>affects them.  For example, international donors who fund educational projects in States 
with indigenous peoples should pay special attention to the ways in which their policies 
might impact on their languages and cultures. 
</p>
<p>32. The international donor community should make resources available to communities 
for the revitalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures.  This could be done 
through the creation of an international fund for the revitalization of indigenous languages 
and cultures. It is essential that beneficiaries are indigenous peoples and that the 
establishment, management and disbursement of funds is carried out with the full and 
effective participation of indigenous peoples.  Such an international fund must ensure the 
protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; intellectual property rights, based upon the principles of </p>


<p>indigenous ownership, access, control, and possession of any research on indigenous 
peoples&#8217; languages and cultures. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Media 
</b></p>
<p>33. The media are encouraged to promote and protect indigenous languages and 
cultures. Further, the media should not demonize indigenous cultures or in any other way 
promote discrimination against them. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Keep</b>ers of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural heritage<b> 
</b></p>
<p>34. Museums and other places in which indigenous peoples&#8217; cultural heritage is stored 
should inform the relevant indigenous peoples and develop mechanisms to facilitate the 
return of such cultural heritage where sought by the indigenous peoples concerned. 
</p>
