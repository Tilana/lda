<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 7/28 of 28 March 2008 entitled &#8220;Missing persons&#8221;, the Human 
Rights Council decided to hold a panel discussion on the question of missing persons at its 
ninth session and requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a 
summary of the panel&#8217;s deliberations with a view to subsequently charging the Advisory 
Committee of the Human Rights Council, at the same session, with the preparation of a 
study on best practices in the matter. 
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to the above-mentioned resolution, the Human Rights Council held a panel 
discussion on the question of missing persons at its ninth session, with the participation of 
experts of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), delegates of Governments 
and non-governmental organizations and national human rights institutions and 
international organizations. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
prepared a summary of the panel&#8217;s deliberations.1 
</p>
<p>3. Subsequently, the Human Rights Council adopted decision 9/101, in which it 
renewed its request to the Advisory Committee to prepare the study and to submit it to the 
Council at its twelfth session. 
</p>
<p>4. The Advisory Committee, at its second session held on 26&#8211;30 January 2009, set up a 
drafting group with the task of preparing a study on best practices in the matter of missing 
persons in situations of armed conflict, and designated the following of its members as 
members of the drafting group: Ansar Burney, Chinsung Chung, Wolfgang Stefan Heinz 
(Chairperson of the drafting group), Latif H&#252;seynov (Rapporteur of the drafting group), 
Miguel Alfonso Mart&#237;nez and Bernards Andrews Nyamwaya Mudho. The drafting group 
was also requested to submit the results of its work on the study to the Advisory Committee 
at its third session, with a view to submitting them to the Council at its twelfth session. 
</p>
<p>5. The Advisory Committee, at its third session held on 3&#8211;7 August 2009, continued its 
deliberations on the issue of missing persons. As a result of those deliberations, the 
Advisory Committee adopted recommendation 3/2 entitled &#8220;Missing persons&#8221; in which it 
noted that considerable difficulties had been encountered by the drafting group in finding 
the necessary information and research resources, and requested the latter to submit the 
results of its work on the study to the Advisory Committee at its fourth session, with a view 
to submitting them to the Council at its fourteenth session. 
</p>
<p>6. In its decision 12/117 of 1 October 2009, the Human Rights Council took note of 
recommendation 3/2 and requested the Advisory Committee to submit the study to the 
Council at its fourteenth session. 
</p>
<p>7. In order to continue its work on the above-mentioned study, the drafting group of the 
Advisory Committee elaborated a questionnaire addressed to Governments, which was 
transmitted by note verbale dated 2 November 2009 by the Secretariat. At the time of 
submission of the present report, the Secretariat has received 21 Governments&#8217; replies to 
the questionnaire. 
</p>
<p>8. At its fourth session held from 25 to 29 January 2010, the Advisory Committee 
continued its deliberations on the issue of missing persons and adopted this progress report 
on best practices in the matter of missing persons prepared by its drafting group on missing 
persons.

</p>
<p>9. The progress report mainly focuses upon the international legal obligations of States 
and parties to an armed conflict relating to the issue of missing persons. For the final report, 
the drafting group will have to thoroughly analyse the replies received from the States and, 
based upon this analysis, identify the best practices in the matter of missing persons. The 
Advisory Committee expresses its gratitude to the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights for the support in the process of collection of information 
and to other partners. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The respect for and implementation of international law 
</b></p>
<p>10. For the purposes of this study, &#8220;missing persons&#8221; are those whose families are 
without news of them and those who are reported, on the basis of reliable information, 
unaccounted for as a result of an international or non-international armed conflict. This 
term is different from and broader in scope than &#8220;enforced or involuntary disappearance&#8221;, 
as defined in the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance.2 
</p>
<p>11. International obligations to prevent and resolve situations of missing persons in 
connection with armed conflict are based both on international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law. Whereas international humanitarian law is specifically 
designed for armed conflicts, human rights treaties apply at all times and in all 
circumstances to all persons within the jurisdiction of a State party. Strict observance of 
such fundamental rights as the right to life, the right not to be subjected to torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the right to liberty and security, the 
right to a fair trial and the right to respect for private and family life could, to a great extent, 
prevent persons from going missing, including as a result of an armed conflict. If, in armed 
conflict, protected persons were treated in conformity with rules of international 
humanitarian law, including in terms of exchanges of family news, and if humanitarian 
organizations were allowed access to particularly vulnerable individuals, there would be 
fewer missing persons and fewer families without information on the fate and whereabouts 
of their loved ones. In this context, the general obligation of States parties to the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949 to respect and to ensure respect for the rules of international 
humanitarian law should be specifically mentioned. 
</p>
<p>12. International rules regarding missing persons apply in both international and non-
international armed conflicts.3 States must take all appropriate measures to reduce the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 &#8220;For the purposes of this Convention, &#8216;enforced disappearance&#8217; is considered to be the arrest, 
</p>
<p>detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or 
groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a 
refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law&#8221;, International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, art. 2. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 ICRC has stipulated, for situations of international armed conflict, that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Families have the right to be informed of the fate of missing relatives (Protocol I, art. 32) 
&#8226; The parties to a conflict must search for persons reported missing by an adverse party (Protocol I, 
</p>
<p>art. 33) and facilitate enquiries made by members of families dispersed as a result of the conflict so 
as to help them restore contact with one another and try to bring them together again. The parties 
to a conflict must also encourage the work of organizations engaged in this task (Geneva 
Convention IV, art. 26) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lists showing the exact location and markings of the graves, together with particulars of the dead 
interred therein, must be exchanged (Protocol I, art. 34) 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>GE.10-12433 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>likelihood that people will go missing. Such measures might be practical and of a general or 
specific nature, as detailed in the following section. Also, they must ensure that their laws 
implement their international obligations aimed at preventing persons from becoming 
unaccounted for and accounting for persons missing as a result of an armed conflict. 
Measures on implementation of international humanitarian law should be adopted by States 
in times of peace so as to ensure that international humanitarian law is immediately 
applicable in case of conflict. 
</p>
<p>13. Obligations relating to the issue of missing persons are incumbent not only on 
States, but also on the parties to an armed conflict. Each party to an armed conflict must 
take all feasible measures to account for persons reported missing as a result of an armed 
conflict and must provide their family members with any information it has on their fate. It 
is to be underlined that States and parties to an armed conflict continue to be bound by 
certain obligations of international humanitarian law even if the conflict has ended. For 
instance, it is obvious that the search for missing persons should continue without any time 
limit until all feasible measures to account the missing persons have been taken. In practice, 
this means that the measures are often carried out after the conflict, because it is only at that 
time that parties are in a position to fulfil their obligations. 
</p>
<p>14. The rules of international humanitarian law, including those to prevent persons from 
going missing, cannot be respected if they are not known. Dissemination of international 
humanitarian law is therefore the responsibility of States and the parties to armed conflicts. 
Thus, each party to a conflict must ensure that the forces under its command are aware of 
their obligations under international humanitarian law and their responsibility for any 
failure to comply with the relevant provisions. The civilian population, including civil 
servants, should receive the necessary education in international humanitarian law. 
Furthermore, members of the armed forces and the civilian population should receive the 
necessary education in international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>15. International humanitarian law must be duly incorporated into domestic legislation. 
Enacting domestic legislation is highly important in dealing with the issue of missing 
persons, preventing disappearances, ascertaining the fate of missing persons, ensuring the 
proper management of information and supporting the families of missing persons. There 
may be good reasons for bringing together into a single law relevant provisions relating to 
missing persons.4 In this respect, a specific law on missing persons that was adopted in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina5 should be noted. National legislation concerning the punishment 
of grave breaches of international humanitarian law, the treatment of prisoners of war and 
the protection of civilians is also pertinent. 
</p>
<p>16. Furthermore, all necessary measures must be provided for in domestic legislation for 
the suppression of all acts contrary to international humanitarian law, whether committed 
by members of the armed forces, public officials or civilians. 
</p>
<p>17. The International Committee of the Red Cross has prepared a draft model law on 
missing persons6 containing the main elements to be taken into account by States when 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Similar treaty-based and customary rules apply in situations of non-international armed conflicts

<p>indicated that the national policies should entail the passage and enactment of a national law on 
missing persons, accompanied by the necessary regulatory and administrative measures. Resolution

help national authorities to bring legislation into conformity with the requirements of 
international law. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Measures to prevent persons from going missing 
</b></p>
<p>18. Under both international humanitarian law and human rights law, States are obliged 
to take measures to prevent persons from going missing. In its resolution 61/155 of 
14 February 2007, the General Assembly called upon States that were parties to an armed 
conflict to take all appropriate measures to prevent persons from going missing in 
connection with armed conflicts and account for persons reported missing as a result of 
such a situation. Such measures, especially those of a legislative and institutional nature, 
must preferably be adopted in peacetime. 
</p>
<p>19. National authorities should establish strict lines of command within armed forces, 
security forces and armed groups so as to ensure effective supervision. 
</p>
<p>20. Proper identification of members of armed forces or armed groups is a key means of 
preventing people from becoming missing in armed conflict. Personal records, identity 
cards and identity discs are the only secure means of identification. Measures should be 
taken to ensure that these means of identification are mandatory and properly used since 
they can &#8212; in particular identity discs &#8212; help to establish the status of the persons who fall 
into the hands of the adverse party and the identity of those who have been seriously 
wounded or killed. The issue of identification also involves other populations at risk such as 
isolated populations, civilians in conflict zone, displaced persons, the elderly and children.7 
Furthermore, it is recommended that the personal data of members of armed forces or 
armed groups and persons at risk, including in particular unaccompanied children, elderly 
and disabled persons be properly registered, which may assist in a later identification of 
mortal remains. 
</p>
<p>21. National authorities should register deaths and issue the appropriate certificates. 
Moreover, an information bureau8 and graves registration service,9 as provided for under 
the 1949 Geneva Conventions, should be set up. More particularly, national information 
bureaux should be tasked to collect and forward information (documents and objects) on 
individuals protected by international humanitarian law (principally prisoners of war and 
civilian internees) who have fallen into enemy hands. Registration of such persons is fully 
in keeping with the objectives of humanitarian law, one of which is to protect persons not 
or no longer taking part in hostilities. By setting up an information bureau in accordance 
with the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, a party to an armed conflict provides 
itself with a means of obtaining information about individuals who have gone missing

 The importance of identification of children is aptly emphasized in the report of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>on missing persons of 18 August 2008 (A/63/299). In particular, it states that &#8220;Means of personal 
identification for minors is of importance in terms of prevention, as they are particularly vulnerable in 
time of conflict, notably to forced recruitment. State authorities must, in that regard, take effective 
measures to provide means of personal identification to minors with a view to preventing their 
disappearance&#8221; (para. 16).

<p>either on the battlefield or on enemy-controlled territory, and hence of easing the anguish of 
their families and relatives.  
</p>
<p>22. Administrative rules and regulations should be adopted in keeping with the 
internationally recognized norms regarding such matters as arrest, detention, imprisonment 
and captivity. The security and physical integrity of all those who are not or no longer 
taking part in the hostilities, in particular, persons deprived of their freedom should be 
ensured. Delivery of news and mail between members of armed forces/groups and their 
families at least once a month should be ensured. For this to function effectively, clear 
responsibilities should be established on all levels of military, police and other relevant 
State agencies, with a clear-cut information and reporting system established before armed 
conflict starts. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Missing persons and the restoration of family links 
</b></p>
<p>23. Families have the right to communicate with their family members and to know the 
fate of their relatives. Respect for the right to exchange family news is essential to prevent 
individuals from becoming unaccounted for. 
</p>
<p>24. The population groups most at risk of losing contact with their relatives are members 
of the armed forces and armed groups, isolated civilians in conflict areas, displaced people 
and refugees, persons deprived of their liberty and vulnerable persons such as children, the 
elderly and persons with disabilities. In armed conflicts, when the usual means of 
communication are disrupted, the ICRC together with the National Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Societies help to maintain and restore contact between family members through 
the worldwide Red Cross and Red Crescent Family Links Network. 
</p>
<p>25. This network facilitates the exchange of personal news between family members 
everywhere in the world, using all available means, subject to agreements with the 
authorities: Red Cross messages are collected and distributed, satellite/mobile phones are 
provided to those who have the telephone number of their relatives and Internet is used to 
trace people via the ICRC Family Links website. With the consent of those concerned, lists 
of people either providing news or looking for news from relatives are published in hard 
copies (in newspapers or ad hoc) and on the ICRC website, and broadcast on radio or 
television. 
</p>
<p>26. In order to facilitate searches, the parties to an international armed conflict must 
transmit all relevant information concerning people reported missing by an adverse party 
and their requests concerning their own missing persons. This information must be 
transmitted directly to the Central Tracing Agency established by the ICRC under the 1949 
Geneva Conventions.  
</p>
<p>27. During an armed conflict, ICRC and the National Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies collect tracing requests and all available information on people unaccounted for 
and the circumstances under which they disappeared from their families, direct witnesses, 
the authorities and any other reliable source. This information is crucial when tracing a 
person and establishing his or her fate. The information is stored centrally and managed in 
accordance with the legal provisions applying to the protection of personal data. 
</p>
<p>28. Using this information, ICRC tries to locate the person in places of detention, 
hospitals, internally displaced person and refugee camps, morgues, remote villages, etc. 
Tracing activities also include supplying the authorities with lists of people unaccounted 
for, together with information on the circumstances in which they disappeared, requesting 
information on location of graves and asking authorities to allow the recovery and 
identification of human remains. The tracing process also involves maintaining a constant </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-12433 
</p>
<p>dialogue and making confidential representations to the authorities or armed groups in 
order to clarify the fate of the missing person. 
</p>
<p>29. There are also other humanitarian organizations involved in activities linked to 
restoring family links. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
and the International Organization for Migration are regular partners of the Red Cross and 
Red Crescent. Other agencies, such as United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and non-
governmental organizations such as Save the Children Fund cooperate with the Red Cross 
and Red Crescent in specific cases, for example in assisting unaccompanied children. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Mechanisms established to clarify the fate of missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>30. The efficient treatment of missing persons requires the establishment of competent 
mechanisms at various levels. It might be necessary to put into place mechanisms ensuring 
coordination and information-sharing process between the parties concerned. They are 
usually set up in the period following the end of the conflict and might be included in 
documents aiming at settling the situation, such as ceasefire and peace agreements. 
</p>
<p>31. When such mechanisms are set up, particular attention should be given to their 
mandate which should focus on their humanitarian objectives, i.e., tracing persons that are 
unaccountable for because of a situation of armed conflict and informing their families 
accordingly. They should be granted sufficient capacity and powers to be able to carry out 
their mandate effectively. For instance, the constitutive documents should ensure that such 
mechanisms have access to grave sites and human remains so as to proceed to exhumation 
and identification. Appropriate rules of procedure specifying the representatives&#8217; necessary 
qualities and number, the quorum rule and the voting procedure should be drafted. 
Sufficient attention should be given to creating an environment that is conducive to 
information-sharing, including the possibility of working in a confidential manner. 
</p>
<p>32. States need to organize at national level the efficient treatment of missing persons. 
One way promoted by the ICRC Model Law on the Missing is to establish an independent 
and impartial State authority responsible for tracing missing persons and identification of 
human remains. Of course, it must be ensured that such an authority does not overlap with 
other structures already existing, such as the national information bureaux mentioned 
earlier. In such a case, the extension of the latter&#8217;s mandate should be explored.  
</p>
<p>33. An independent and impartial national institution could play a crucial role in 
clarifying the fate of missing persons. States should ensure the establishment and day-to-
day functioning of such an institution (commission or committee for missing persons) 
through adequate structures such as working groups or other appropriate mechanisms. The 
commission for missing persons should have a clear humanitarian mandate established by 
law, focusing on tracing persons that are unaccountable for as a result of an armed conflict, 
and the necessary resources and powers. It should, inter alia: (a) receive tracing requests 
and, on the basis of submitted tracing requests, collect, check and provide the applicant and 
State authorities with available information and facts on disappearance, as well as 
information on the whereabouts and fate of a person in accordance with the national 
legislation and standards on the protection and management of personal data; (b) be 
responsible for the operation of a registry of data and adopt necessary regulations to this 
end; (c) take appropriate measures to ensure the right of persons deprived of freedom to 
inform their relatives of their condition, whereabouts and circumstances of their detention/ 
imprisonment; (d) take measures to ensure the enjoyment of rights by relatives of the 
missing person; and (e) execute any other tasks required for the performance of its duties. 
Said body should provide mechanisms such as telephone hotlines and web pages for 
relatives and witnesses to register missing persons and trace potential burial sites. </p>


<p>GE.10-12433 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>34. It must be kept in mind that the longer it takes to establish functioning mechanisms 
to deal with the issue of the missing, the less likely it will be that the missing will be 
identified and returned to their families. 
</p>
<p>35. The commission for missing persons should work closely with the judiciary and 
other governmental and non-governmental entities, employing a strong coordinating 
mechanism. Furthermore, it should closely cooperate with a team of forensic 
anthropologists, conducting the exhumations and identifications of the remains of missing 
persons. 
</p>
<p>36. As practice shows, these commissions focus largely on the missing persons of their 
own side of the conflict. It is essential that they deal with the issue of missing on both sides 
and not make their work conditional on the results achieved by any other side. Their 
mandates should make it clear that they also have responsibility, insofar as they have 
information or control over the relevant territory, for clarifying the fate of the missing on 
the other side(s) as well. In addition, the commissions need to cooperate with their 
counterparts. When there is no cooperation between respective commissions of the parties 
to armed conflict, the latter should consider establishing an international commission to 
look into the issue of the missing, with persons on the commission acting in an individual 
capacity but from the region and chosen by the different parties to the conflict (as in Cyprus 
and Nepal). 
</p><p>37. The commissions need to be as depoliticized as possible, work in a transparent 
manner and have, alongside members of Government bodies, representatives of civil 
society and representatives of the families of the missing. They should deal with the issue 
of missing persons as a humanitarian and not a political issue. 
</p>
<p>38. Apart from commissions for missing persons, other instruments and mechanisms 
could be explored when dealing with the issue of missing persons; for example, bodies such 
as human rights commission and ombudspersons. Both usually have a broad mandate to 
address human rights violations and should therefore include the missing within their 
jurisdiction. 
</p><p>39. All justice and rule of law mechanisms, including the local judiciary, parliamentary 
commissions and truth-finding mechanisms, are of key importance for solving the issue on 
the basis of transparency, accountability and public involvement in the process of 
addressing the issue of missing persons. Judicial process might for instance permit victims&#8217; 
families to intervene at various stages of proceedings and exercise their right to know. Also, 
when tribunals are investigating large-scale killings and initiating mass exhumations and 
forensic activities, it should be ensured that such work is conducted in a manner serving the 
best interests of the families in terms of being provided with an answer, while also bringing 
the persons responsible for those crimes to justice. Exhumations can reveal what happened 
to victims of such killings and give families information about the fate of loved ones. They 
can also enable the next of kin to honour the dead in conformity with the precepts of their 
culture and religion. 
</p>
<p>40. Truth and reconciliation exercises may have a role to play in clarifying events and 
helping communities move forward. Such exercises would undoubtedly benefit families for 
answers about the fate of missing relatives. In its resolution 12/11 of 1 October 2009 
entitled &#8220;Human rights and transitional justice&#8221;, the Human Rights Council emphasized that 
&#8220;truth-seeking processes, such as truth and reconciliation commissions, that investigate 
patterns of past human rights violations and their causes and consequences are important 
tools that can complement judicial processes and, when established, such mechanisms have 
to be designed within a specific societal context and to be founded on broad national 
consultations with the inclusion of victims and civil society, including non-governmental 
organizations&#8221;. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-12433 
</p>
<p><b> VI. The right to know 
</b></p>
<p>41. The right to know is the pillar of the protection that ought to be given to missing 
persons and their families.  
</p>
<p>42. The right of family members to know the fate of missing relatives as a result of 
armed conflict, including their whereabouts or, if dead, the circumstances and cause of their 
deaths and the correlative obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding a disappearance, is provided for both under international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>43. The Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
provides in article 24, paragraph 2, that: &#8220;Each victim has the right to know the truth 
regarding the circumstances of the enforced disappearance, the progress and results of the 
investigation and the fate of the disappeared person. Each State Party shall take appropriate 
measures in this regard.&#8221; Under article 24, paragraph 1, of the Convention, &#8220;victim&#8221; means 
&#8220;the disappeared person and any individual who has suffered harm as the direct result of an 
enforced disappearance&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>44. The right of the relatives to know the fate of their family member is also laid down, 
as earlier mentioned, in article 32 of Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Article 33 
of that Protocol further provides that &#8220;as soon as circumstances permit &#8230; each party to the 
conflict shall search for the persons who have been reported missing by an adverse Party&#8221;. 
The same was recognized as applying in non-international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>45. The right to know also includes the right to get information about the place of burial 
of a missing relative, if known. Parties to a conflict must endeavour to facilitate the return 
of the remains of the deceased upon request of the party to which it belongs or upon the 
request of the next of kin, to whom the deceased&#8217;s personal effects must be returned. 
</p>
<p>46. In addition to international instruments which lay down obligations in relation to 
missing persons, there is also a wealth of relevant case law that has been built up by 
regional supervisory bodies over the past 20 years. Thus, it has been generally recognized 
that a person&#8217;s disappearance can inflict grievous suffering not only on the person who has 
disappeared but also on his family, and that this suffering can amount to inhuman 
treatment. Relevant examples from the case law of the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights are the <i>Vel&#225;squez Rodr&#237;guez </i>case (1988) and the <i>Blake </i>case (1998). The African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights took a similar line in the case of <i>Amnesty 
International and others v. Sudan </i>(1999). Reference should also be made to the case law of 
the European Court of Human Rights: in a number of its decisions the Strasbourg Court has 
emphasized the obligation of States to take adequate measures to trace missing persons and 
satisfy families&#8217; right to know (see, e.g. <i>Aziyev and Aziyeva v.</i> <i>Russia </i>(2008)).  
47. The Human Rights Council has discussed on various occasions the right to the truth, 
although in a broader context. In its resolution 12/12 of 12 October 2009, the Council 
recognized the importance of respecting and ensuring the right to the truth so as to 
contribute to ending impunity and to promote and protect human rights. The Council noted 
that the right to the truth may be characterized differently in some legal systems as the right 
to know or the right to be informed or freedom of information. 
</p>
<p>48. The right to know must be clearly recognized in domestic law and regulations. 
States and parties to an armed conflict are under an obligation to take the necessary 
measures to clarify the fate of the missing person and inform the family thereof. Family 
members must be regularly informed about the progress and results of investigation 
concerning the fate or whereabouts of a missing relative. Effective remedies, including 
adequate compensation, must be provided for any violation of this obligation. The </p>


<p>GE.10-12433 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>systematic and deliberate denial of the right to know the fate of one&#8217;s relative should be 
punished as a criminal offence under domestic law. Moreover, any available information 
must be provided not only to the families, but also to relevant institutions for tracing the 
missing persons. 
</p>
<p>49. In armed conflicts, protected persons must be allowed to inform or require the 
competent authorities to notify their families (or any other person of their choice) of their 
capture/arrest, address and state of health. The systematic and deliberate denial of this right 
should be criminalized under domestic law. The right of protected persons to correspond 
with the members of their family must also be ensured. 
</p>
<p>50. National and international institutions working in the area of human rights and 
humanitarian law, including ICRC, should be granted unhindered access to any place where 
people are being deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p>51. No punishment should be imposed for maintaining private or personal contact with 
relatives, or for seeking information regarding the fate or whereabouts of a relative who is 
detained or interned. The right must be upheld no matter the nature of the act the person is 
suspected of having committed, including criminal acts and against State security.10 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Criminal investigation and prosecution of human rights 
violations linked to missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>52. As it can be seen above, the efficient treatment of missing persons requires thorough 
commitment from all parties concerned and the necessary resources. Unfortunately, a 
number of stumbling blocks can be observed in practice which make the whole process 
very challenging. Information about missing persons can and has been used as pressure 
point in political negotiations, instead of being understood and accepted as a natural 
humanitarian obligation for all conflict parties.11 Cases/statistics of missing persons are 
used for the international political debate among conflict parties to show who the principal 
culprit for the violent conflict is. Thus, they tend to support intransigent positions, such as 
that one conflict party would not want to start the investigation of cases until the other side 
acknowledges guilt and responsibility. Furthermore, leaders who played a major part in 
perpetuating the conflict often remain prominent figures in the subsequent peace process, a 
situation that does not facilitate the resolution of missing person cases. 
</p>
<p>53. One additional challenge is that cases of missing persons can also constitute dormant 
cases of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances or extrajudicial executions. Therefore, 
while focusing on the humanitarian dimension of missing persons in armed conflict, it is 
also necessary to take note of the work of human rights mechanisms in three fields, i.e., 
those of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances and of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, and 
work on impunity (including resolutions by the Human Rights Council on all related 
topics). 
</p><p>54. In the first panel discussion of the Human Rights Council on missing persons on 
7 January 2009, the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Kang, stressed the 
importance of fighting impunity and implementing appropriate domestic law. She stressed 
the importance of criminalizing in national legislation violations of international 
humanitarian and human rights standards. Furthermore, she referred to measures to be

<p><b>12</b> GE.10-12433 
</p>
<p>adopted in order to guarantee the right to the truth, such as effective tracing activities, 
conducting investigations of cases, developing appropriate forensic expertise, treating the 
mortal remains with dignity and respect and ensuring adequate management of 
information.12 
</p>
<p>55. In the light of the above, a delicate balance needs to be struck between putting into 
place effective means of collecting relevant information on missing persons and generally 
recognizing the importance of prosecuting war crimes. As observed by La Rosa and Crettol 
in &#8220;The missing and Transitional Justice: the right to know and the fight against impunity&#8221;, 
&#8220;such mechanisms would need &#8230; to generate greater incentives for those with information 
on the fate of the missing to speak out, rather than to remain silent and be an obstacle to the 
fight against impunity&#8221;.13 
</p>
<p>56. The political and legal challenge then is how to strengthen the political will of 
conflict parties to cooperate in sharing information on missing persons, without however 
neglecting the human rights dimension of such cooperation. Here, clearly, international 
organizations and other relevant actors must take a proactive role. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Legal status of missing persons and support for the families 
of persons unaccounted for 
</b></p>
<p>57. The issue of persons going missing has consequences not only for the victims 
themselves, but also for their families, especially dependent women, elderly persons and 
children, who prove to be more vulnerable in such situations. States are obliged to take 
measures to respond to the material, financial, psychological and legal needs faced by the 
families of persons unaccounted for. In this context, a mechanism for needs assessment and 
processing of requests for assistance should be established, to which the persons concerned 
would have ready access. 
</p>
<p>58. First and foremost, the legal situation of persons reported missing as a result of 
armed conflict and their relatives should be established in domestic legislation. Specifically, 
the law should envisage circumstances and the procedure by which a person can be 
declared absent or missing. Furthermore, legal consequences of a declaration of absence 
and a declaration of death, including in terms of property administration, guardianship and 
parental authority, should be clearly prescribed in law. 
</p>
<p>59. The main principle is that the rights and interests of missing persons, including their 
civil status, property and assets, must be protected at all times until their fate has been 
ascertained or their death recognized. The interests of missing persons should be adequately 
protected through designation of an appropriate representative. 
</p>
<p>60. Missing persons should be presumed to be alive until their fate has been ascertained. 
The foremost right of a missing person is that of search and recovery. A person should not 
be declared dead without sufficient supporting evidence. The death of a missing person 
may be determined through the discovery of human remains or presumed as a result of 
other evidence, events or certain defined situations, or may be presumed after the passage 
of time. Issuance of a death certificate should have all of the effects to a missing person as 
it does with regard to any other person. 
</p>

<p>GE.10-12433 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>61. As concerns the assistance to be provided to the families of persons unaccounted for, 
it is essential to ensure that the dependents of such persons are entitled to the same social or 
financial benefits provided for other victims. States should adopt a gender-sensitive 
approach to ensuring the rights of the relatives. Such matters as the custody of the children 
of the missing person, inheritance rights, re-marriage rights, pension rights and entitlements 
to public assistance should be properly addressed in domestic legislation. In this respect, the 
draft recommendation on principles concerning missing persons and the presumption of 
death14 prepared by the Council of Europe Directorate General of Human Rights and Legal 
Affairs should be noted. According to the draft recommendation, a fair balance must be 
struck between the interests of missing persons and of those with a legitimate interest, 
particularly as regards property and inheritance rights, pension and life insurance rights, 
right to enter a new union (marriage, registered partnership or similar union), legal 
affiliation and parental rights. 
</p>
<p>62. If needed, financial assistance should be provided to all dependents. The interests of 
the child should be given primary importance. Children should receive special support and 
protection. In particular, measures should be taken to reunite unaccompanied children with 
their families. The needs of single heads of families should be given special attention, 
taking into consideration the specific needs faced by women in such situations. States 
should ensure that the families of persons unaccounted for benefit from support 
programmes in order to adapt to their situations and come to terms with events. Community 
and psychological support, including therapeutic when necessary, should also be provided 
to those in need. 
</p>
<p>63. The right of relatives of missing persons to be granted reparation should be ensured. 
</p>
<p>64. States should provide support for civil society initiatives in favour of the families of 
the missing and those linked with solving the issue of the missing. Furthermore, they 
should facilitate contacts, including cross-border contacts, between families of the missing. 
</p>
<p>65. The international community as well as national authorities could play a more 
proactive role in assisting the families of the missing to organize themselves, including 
through the provision of funding, provision of premises, equipment for communication, etc. 
It is important to avoid politicizing this support and to allow the families of the missing to 
run their own independent organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Treatment of the dead and identification of human remains 
</b></p>
<p>66. National legislation should contain provisions governing the situation of the dead 
and human remains. 
</p>
<p>67. The main principle is that the dead should be sought, collected and identified 
without distinction. The exhumation, collection, transportation, temporary storage or burial, 
and repatriation of human remains and corpses should be ensured. The dead should be 
treated with respect and dignity. When identified, they should be buried in individually 
marked graves in sites that are identified and registered. The missing persons&#8217; relatives 
have the right to demand that places of burial and exhumation where the missing persons 
were either buried or exhumed be marked. Adequate training and information on means of 
identification and the treatment of the dead should be provided to members of the armed 
forces and relevant services involved in the collection and management of the dead. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 Document CDCJ (2009) 35 Final. </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-12433 
</p>
<p>68. An important step is identifying, mapping and preserving burial sites. With the 
passing of time, the movement away of persons with knowledge and the death of some of 
those with information, it becomes increasingly important to tackle this aspect of the 
missing. Information needs to be collected from different sources including from high-
ranking officers, combatants and civilians who all may have information concerning burial 
sites. More effort needs to be made to encourage people to come forward with information 
about the missing, for example, using incentives or guarantees of anonymity. 
</p>
<p>69. International humanitarian law prohibits the despoliation and mutilation of the dead. 
All acts of mutilation and despoliation must be criminalized. It must be borne in mind that 
intentional mutilation may also be an element of concealing separate criminal offences 
which resulted in the death. Moreover, the act of mutilating or despoiling the dead can 
constitute the war crime of committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular 
humiliating or degrading treatment as identified in article 8 (2) (b) (xxi) and article 8 (2) (c) 
(ii) of the Statute of the International Criminal Court for both types of armed conflict.  
</p><p>70. Criminal sanctions should also be established for the non-respect of burial sites and 
the desecration of graves. 
</p>
<p>71. Whenever there is a confirmed case of a death, the competent State authorities are 
obliged to undertake all necessary measures to recover the human remains. The remains 
should be returned to the family, if possible. For the families of missing persons, the return 
of the body for burial is often the first step towards achieving justice and for being able to 
start the mourning process. If it is not possible to return the remains, a proper burial should 
be ensured. Also, all necessary measures should be undertaken to ensure proper handling of 
the personal effects of the deceased. 
</p>
<p>72. The main responsibility for the proper handling of all the dead and for providing 
information to the families lies with the authorities and armed groups. 
</p>
<p>73. Thus, the process of revealing the fate of any missing person begins often with the 
exhumation and identification of their mortal remains. The exhumation of human remains 
constitutes part of the right to know the truth and helps establish the whereabouts of the 
disappeared. It also dignifies the victims, as the right to bury the dead and to carry out 
ceremonies for them according to each culture is inalienable for all human beings. 
</p>
<p>74. Exhumation serves several important purposes, including: recovery of the remains 
for physical examination and analysis for their identification; release of remains to relatives 
so as to facilitate funeral arrangements and emotional healing; documentation of injuries 
and other evidence for legal proceedings and to uncover human rights abuses; the search for 
clues that may assist in the historical reconstruction of events and revelations to create 
awareness; and acknowledgement that is necessary for healing and drawing lessons for the 
future of the community. Exhumations should be performed only with the proper 
authorizations and according to the conditions specified in law. 
</p>
<p>75. Authorities must ensure that the examination of human remains and their 
identification are undertaken by qualified and competent people. An authority competent to 
issue and deliver death certificates must be designated. 
</p>
<p>76. According to the ICRC, the procedures of exhumation and post-mortem examination 
should respect the following principles: (a) at all times, the dignity, honour, reputation and 
privacy of the deceased must be respected; (b) the known religious beliefs and opinions of 
the deceased and his or her relatives should be taken into consideration; (c) families should 
be kept informed of the decisions in relation to exhumations and post-mortem 
examinations, and the results of any such examination; (d) after post-mortem examination, 
the remains should be released to the family at the earliest time possible; (e) it is essential </p>


<p>GE.10-12433 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>that all information be collected for the purpose of identification whenever exhumations are 
performed.15 
</p>
<p>77. Cross-border agreements should be established with the neighbouring countries 
where there is reasonable suspicion that grave sites may exist. The discovery of burial sites 
can be important not only in tracing missing persons but also in the identification of the 
commission of crimes and their potential subsequent prosecution. 
</p>
<p>78. While there is a trend of relying heavily on DNA testing for identification of 
remains, there are, however, certain difficulties associated with this process, including the 
cost involved, the facilities and expertise required and the accuracy of the testing, in some 
cases, there is no known DNA from the missing person or there is no living survivor to 
provide DNA for comparison. Identification should not be based on one single method but 
take into account all available information. If available, medical and dental records are 
helpful in the identification of remains of missing persons. 
</p>
<p>79. Any forensic work should be based on certain standards (legal, ethical and technical) 
and conducted with the primary aim of identifying victims and returning their remains to 
their families. Direct contacts should be established between forensic teams and the 
relatives of the missing persons. Domestic legislation should provide for the possibility of 
conducting independent forensic investigations in cases of persons unaccounted for during 
an armed conflict. Such investigations are critically important for investigating violations of 
humanitarian law and human rights law. 
</p>
<p>80. The competent authorities must adopt adequate procedures for providing 
information on identity, location and cause of death to the appropriate authorities and to the 
families. In particular, information on deceased persons as well as the location of human 
remains and graves should be centralized and transmitted to the other party to the conflict. 
</p>
<p>81. The authorities must ensure that the dead, including burials, are recorded as well as 
the particulars of graves and those interred there. This task might be entrusted to the State&#8217;s 
official graves registration service &#8211; if not, it would require the establishment and 
functioning of a complementary system to record the details of the death and internment of 
protected persons. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Information management and legal protection of personal 
data 
</b></p>
<p>82. Information on the fate of missing persons is at times denied by parties either during 
or post conflict, the reason being that information is not disclosed as a means of continuing 
the conflict or because prosecution is feared.  
</p>
<p>83. The principal purpose of collecting data as regards missing persons is to establish 
the identity, location and fate of persons unaccounted for (both living and deceased) and to 
provide information to the families on the whereabouts and fate of their missing relatives. 
</p>
<p>84. Coordination of the activities of all those involved and the sharing of information 
would increase the effectiveness of any action taken to ascertain the fate of persons who 
have not been unaccounted. States should ensure that information collected on persons 
unaccounted for is comprehensive, yet limited to what is necessary for the purpose 
identified. Information should be collected and processed fairly and lawfully. The 
collection and use of information should be subject to the consent of the person to whom 
</p>

</p>
<p>15
 &#8220;Guiding Principles/Model Law on the Missing&#8221;. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-12433 
</p>
<p>that information relates. States should ensure respect for the relevant standards and 
principles on the protection of personal data whenever information, including medical and 
genetic information, is managed and processed. Exchange of information among those 
involved should take place without endangering victims, the persons collecting the 
information or the sources of information. 
</p>
<p>85. The data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for 
which they are processed. Such purposes must be explicit, legitimate and determined at the 
time of collection. The data should be destroyed as soon as the purpose of their collection 
has been fulfilled or when they are no longer needed. They may, however, be retained for a 
given period if required for the benefit of the person to whom they relate or if they are 
essential for the performance of the humanitarian tasks of the organization that collected the 
data. 
</p>
<p>86. Locating missing persons and/or finding information about them requires searches 
of all possible records. The records of local government units, such as the police, are 
important, as is information that can be derived from cemetery and morgue records. 
</p>
<p>87. The issue of data management is also relevant to exhumation projects in the search 
for missing persons. While oral reports may provide information about possible sites of 
graves or mass graves, records of military or other government personnel, who may have 
been assigned to, for example, dig graves or who were involved in transportation to or from 
the site, may also provide or corroborate information. 
</p>
<p>88. State authorities should provide access to pre-war health and dental records to 
facilitate the identification process of mortal remains in more traditional ways. 
</p>
<p>89. States should provide adequate sanctions for destroying or unlawfully withholding 
information on missing persons. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Cooperation 
</b>90. States should cooperate at the international level in order to effectively solve cases 
of missing persons by providing mutual assistance in terms of information-sharing, victim 
assistance, location and identification of missing persons, and exhuming, identifying and 
returning human remains. 
</p>
<p>91. International humanitarian law can only work in practice if belligerents, or former 
belligerents, cooperate with each other. Accordingly, the issue of the missing cannot be 
solved unilaterally by one side to the conflict: close cooperation and coordination is 
necessary between the different sides to the conflict. Parties to an armed conflict should 
refrain from acting on the basis of reciprocity in dealing with the issue of the missing. 
Sharing of information or taking action, for example, should not be conditional on the other 
side doing the same. In other words, cooperation should be unconditional; humanitarian law 
is not subject to any principle of reciprocity. 
</p><p>92. Following an armed conflict, bilateral and multilateral cooperation among States in 
conjunction with humanitarian organizations can lead to more effective assistance to 
families. States should endeavor to address the humanitarian nature of the problem 
independently of other inter-State issues so as to avoid further distress to the families of 
missing persons pending the resolution of political issues. 
</p>
<p>93. Intergovernmental organizations and ICRC, acting in conformity with their 
respective mandates, should be available to support government authorities and armed 
groups in fulfilling their responsibilities.  </p>


<p>GE.10-12433 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>94. International and regional organizations should encourage inter-State cooperation 
and may have an important role to play on their own.  
</p>
<p>95. International and regional organizations involved in solving the problem of missing 
persons should further develop cooperation within their respective mandates while ensuring 
synergies and avoiding duplication. 
</p>
<p>96. There is a pressing need to develop cooperation agreements and partnerships not 
only at intergovernmental level, but also with national Red Cross and Red Crescent 
societies, civil society structures and, in particular, the associations of families of missing 
persons. 
</p>
<p>97. Civil society organizations could play an important role concerning different issues 
such as the provision of psychological rehabilitation for affected family members. They 
should be provided with adequate financial and technical assistance. Working groups or 
committees could be set up comprising of government representatives, relatives of missing 
persons and civil society representatives. 
</p>
<p><b> XII. Conclusions 
</b>98. <b>International obligations to prevent and resolve situations of missing persons in 
connection with armed conflict are based both on international humanitarian law and 
international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Enacting national legislation is highly important when dealing with the issues of 
missing persons, preventing disappearances, ascertaining the fate of missing persons, 
protecting their rights, ensuring the proper management of information and 
supporting the families of missing persons. In this respect, a draft model law on 
missing persons prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is 
of great importance. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>States and parties to an armed conflict are obliged to take all appropriate 
measures to prevent persons from going missing. In particular, members of armed 
forces or armed groups and populations at risk (such as isolated populations, civilians 
in conflict zone, displaced persons, the elderly and children) must be properly 
identified. An information bureau and graves registration service, as provided for 
under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, should be set up. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Respect for the right to exchange family news is essential to preventing 
individuals from becoming unaccounted for. In armed conflicts, when the usual means 
of communication are disrupted, ICRC together with the national Red Cross and Red 
Crescent societies help to maintain and restore contact between family members 
through the worldwide Red Cross and Red Crescent Family Links Network. In order 
to facilitate searches, the parties to an international armed conflict must transmit all 
relevant information concerning people reported missing by an adverse party and 
their requests concerning their own missing persons. This information must be 
transmitted directly to the Central Tracing Agency established by ICRC under the 
1949 Geneva Conventions.  
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> States and parties to an armed conflict should ensure the establishment and 
day-to-day functioning of an independent and impartial national institution that could 
play a crucial role in clarifying the fate of missing persons. Such institutions 
(commissions on missing persons) should deal with the issue of missing on both sides 
to the conflict and not condition their work on the results achieved by any other side. 
They should work closely with governmental and non-governmental entities, family 
associations, and families of the missing. States and parties to an armed conflict </b></p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.10-12433

obligation to take the necessary measures to clarify the fate of the missing person and 
to inform the family thereof. Family members must be regularly informed about the 
progress and results of investigation concerning the fate or whereabouts of a missing 
relative. 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> While focusing on the humanitarian dimension of missing persons in armed

specified in law. Families should be kept informed of the decisions in relation to 
exhumations and of the results of any such examination. After post-mortem 
examination, the remains should be released to the family at the earliest time possible.

<p>110.<b> Domestic legislation should provide for the possibility of conducting 
independent forensic investigations in cases of persons unaccounted for during an 
armed conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> Information on persons unaccounted for should be collected and processed 
fairly and lawfully. States should ensure respect for the relevant standards and 
principles with regard to the protection of personal data whenever information, 
including medical and genetic information, is managed and processed.  
</b></p>
<p>112.<b> Of key importance for solving the issue of missing persons are all justice and 
rule of law mechanisms, including the local judiciary, parliamentary commissions and 
truth-finding mechanisms. </b></p>

<p>113.<b> States should cooperate at the international level in order to effectively solve 
cases of missing persons by providing mutual assistance in terms of information 
sharing, victim assistance, location and identification of missing persons, and 
exhuming, identifying and returning human remains. Parties to an armed conflict 
should refrain from acting on the basis of reciprocity in dealing with the issue of the 
missing.  
</b></p>
<p>114.<b> International and regional organizations involved in solving the problem of 
missing persons should further develop cooperation within their respective mandates 
while ensuring synergies and avoiding duplication. Cooperation agreements and 
partnerships should be developed not only at intergovernmental level, but also with 
national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, civil society structures and 
associations of families of missing persons. </b></p>
