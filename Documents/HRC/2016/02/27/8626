<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 12/17 of 2 October 2009, the Human Rights Council requested the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights &#8220;to prepare a thematic study on 
discrimination against women, in law and practice, and on how the issue is addressed 
throughout the United Nations human rights system&#8221;. The Council requested consultation 
with States, relevant United Nations bodies, mechanism and agencies, including the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the agencies within the 
new United Nations composite entity on gender, and other stakeholders. It requested the 
High Commissioner to take into account efforts made to address discrimination against 
women in law and practice, particularly by the Commission on the Status of Women. The 
Council decided that it would address the thematic study at its fifteenth session, &#8220;in order to 
consider taking further possible action on discrimination against women at that session.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2. In a note verbale of 29 March 2010 the High Commissioner solicited information on the 
issues to be addressed in the study from member and observer States, United Nations 
agencies and programmes, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other stakeholders.  
As at 15 July 2010, 74 replies had been received in total, from 49 States,1 5 United Nations 
agencies and programmes,2 6 national human rights institutions3 and 14 NGOs and other 
organizations.4 These replies are reflected in an addendum to the present document 
(A/HRC/15/40/Add.1). The Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) also had the 
benefit of the plenary panel discussion on &#8220;equality before the law&#8221; held at the eleventh 
session of the Human Rights Council (4 June 2009); the on-line discussion on &#8220;women and 
human rights&#8221; (1-28 February 2010) moderated by OHCHR and contributing to the fifteen-
year review of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action; the  
international conference on equality of women and men in national legislation, Ljubljana, 
12 May 2010; the extraordinary informal meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women in Paris, 20-21 May 2010; and other events, including the 
cross-regional side event to the fourteenth session of the Human Rights Council on equality 
of women and men in national legislation held on 15 June 2010.  
</p>
<p>3. A number of the relevant issues have been previously considered by the 
Commission on the Status of Women in relation to discussions on the advisability of the 
appointment of a special rapporteur on laws that discriminate against women. At its fiftieth

<p>and fifty-first sessions the Commission considered two reports on the subject prepared by 
the Secretary-General (E/CN.6/2006/8 and E/CN.6/2007/8), but did not establish a 
mechanism to address discriminatory laws. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International standards, obligations and commitments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Equality between women and men - elimination of discrimination 
against women 
</b></p>
<p>4. The attainment of equality between women and men, and the elimination of all 
forms of discrimination against women are fundamental United Nations values. Under 
articles 56 of the Charter of the United Nations, all Member States &#8220;pledge themselves to 
take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of 
the purposes set forth in Article 55&#8221;, which includes promotion of &#8220;universal respect for, 
and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to 
race, sex, language, or religion.&#8221;  Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
states that &#8220;Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in [this] Declaration, 
without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion&#8230;&#8221;.  These 
commitments are reflected in instruments that address discrimination against women, 
including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and the 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women. 
</p>
<p>5. The principle of equality and non-discrimination on the grounds of sex is included in 
the principal United Nations human rights treaties, all of which guarantee to women the 
enjoyment of the rights contained in them, without discrimination and on the basis of 
equality. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights both guarantee the enjoyment of the 
rights they elaborate without discrimination or distinction based on sex, and &#8220;the equal right 
of men and women&#8221; to the enjoyment of those rights (article 3). Similar obligations are 
found in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (article 2), the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
(articles 1 and 7), and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (article 6).  
</p>
<p>6. Treaties adopted under the auspices of specialized agencies of the United Nations, in 
particular by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and regional human rights 
treaties, provide further evidence of the extent to which the principle of equality between 
women and men is accepted by the international community.  
</p>
<p>7. Achieving equality of women and men and the elimination of discrimination against 
women have been central goals of major United Nations conferences. The World 
Conference on Human Rights (Vienna, 1993) recognized the importance of the human 
rights of women, as did the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995), as well 
as the subsequent reviews of progress in the implementation of the Beijing Platform for 
Action.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Obligations and commitment of States to eliminate discriminatory laws  
</b></p>
<p>8. In addition to their Charter obligations, most Member States of the United Nations 
are bound by specific treaty obligations to eliminate discrimination against women. As at 
31 July 2010 there were 186 States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, in which they &#8220;condemn discrimination against </p>


<p>women in all its forms&#8221; and &#8220;agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a 
policy of eliminating discrimination against women&#8221; (article 2). The Convention defines 
discrimination against women (article 1), sets out the measures that a State party must take 
to eliminate discrimination and ensure equality, and addresses in a non-exhaustive manner 
areas in which measures need to be taken.  
</p>
<p>9. The Convention defines &#8220;discrimination against women&#8221; as: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which 
has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, 
enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a 
basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>10. The concept of discrimination includes differential treatment explicitly based on sex 
(direct discrimination) and laws, practices and policies that appear neutral but have a 
disproportionate and unjustifiable impact on women&#8217;s enjoyment of human rights (indirect 
discrimination).5  It also covers discrimination on the basis of gender stereotypes,6 and 
multiple discrimination that specific groups of women face because of their sex and other 
characteristics.7 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has 
emphasized that the obligation to eliminate discrimination involves ensuring formal 
equality (the identical treatment of women and men), and also substantive equality, which 
reflects the differences in the social circumstances of women and men, and, in appropriate 
cases, biological differences. While formal legal (de jure) equality is important, the 
Committee has consistently stressed the importance of de facto equality, namely ensuring 
that women actually enjoy the rights guaranteed. It has also stressed the importance of 
systemic and structural transformation of institutions and attitudes that reflect and entrench 
discrimination against women, noting the importance of article 5(a) of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>11. In its general comment No. 25 (2004) on article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention 
(on temporary special measures), the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women specified that States parties have obligations to ensure that there is no direct 
or indirect discrimination in law and that women are protected against discrimination, both 
in the public and private spheres; to develop effective policy measures to improve women&#8217;s 
de facto position; and to address gender relations and stereotypes affecting women. Thus, 
the scope of these three central obligations accepted by States parties to the Convention 
goes beyond a purely formal legal obligation of equal treatment.8 </p>
<p>12. The Convention assigns an important place to law and legal reform, requiring States 
parties to enact or strengthen laws that protect against discrimination or promote the 
enjoyment of equality in other ways. It also requires States parties to ensure that 
discriminatory laws are repealed. Article 2 of the Convention is of particular importance 
here. 
</p>
<p>13. Other treaty bodies have embraced a similar understanding of the concept of 
discrimination and the nature of the obligations States accept to eliminate discrimination 
against women and ensure equality. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>  
 5 See Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women general recommendation No. 25 
</p>
<p>(2004) on article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention (temporary special measures), para 7, footnote 1. 
 6 See also Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 20 (2009) on 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights, para. 20. 
 7 Ibid., para 17, and Human Rights Committee general comment No. 28 (2000) on article 3 (The 
</p>
<p>equality of rights between men and women), para 30. 
 8 Para 7. </p>


<p>Rights has provided a similar overview of the nature of discrimination on the ground of sex 
under article 2 (2) and 3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights.9 The Human Rights Committee has also analysed discrimination on the basis of sex 
and the obligations of States parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights to eliminate discrimination and ensure equality between women and men 
consistently with the approaches of the other two committees mentioned above.10 
</p>
<p>14. In addition to the legal obligations to eliminate discrimination against women in law 
and practice which have been assumed under these and other treaties, Member States 
undertook to pursue related goals at the Fourth World Conference on Women. The Beijing 
Platform for Action expressed concern about the lack of both de jure and de facto equality 
for women:11  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Women&#8217;s full enjoyment of equal rights is undermined by the discrepancies 
between some national legislation and international law and international 
instruments on human rights. &#8230; De facto inequality is also perpetuated by 
the lack of enforcement of... laws or codes, or administrative rules and regulations intended to ensure women&#8217;s full enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>15. The Platform included as a strategic objective &#8220;ensur[ing] equality and non-
discrimination under the law and in practice&#8221;. Governments were called on take a number 
of actions, many corresponding to the obligations in article 2 of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.12 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Session of the General Assembly to review implementation of the 
Beijing Platform for Action in 2000 noted that, while significant progress had been made in 
many areas, &#8220;discriminatory legislation as well as harmful traditional and customary 
practices and negative stereotyping of women and men still persist&#8221; particularly in family, 
civil, penal, labour and commercial laws or codes, or administrative rules and regulations. 
The review referred explicitly to legislative and regulatory gaps, lack of implementation of 
existing legislation and regulations and the introduction of new discriminatory laws, 
perpetuating both de jure and de facto inequality and discrimination.13 
</p>
<p>17. The 2005 and 2010 reviews of the Platform concluded that women everywhere are 
still subject to significant disadvantage as the result of discriminatory laws and practices 
and that de jure and de facto equality has not been achieved in any country in the world.14  
</p>
<p>18. The 2010 review also noted that discriminatory provisions continue, in particular in 
family, divorce and personal laws, penal codes, nationality laws and laws relating to 
inheritance and ownership of land and property, and noted the impact of multiple legal 
systems, with discriminatory customary and religious laws and practice. It also recognized 
that even where legal reforms have taken place, they are often ineffectively implemented.15 
</p>
<p>19. The review equally emphasized that &#8220;lack of legal provisions guaranteeing the 
economic rights of women, coupled with customary laws that discriminate against women

<p>with regard to inheritance, land, property and credit, hinder women&#8217;s economic 
empowerment and their ability to move out of poverty&#8221;.16 In relation to violence against 
women, the review noted that discriminatory provisions continue to exist, such as 
reductions in sentences for perpetrators who marry victims, mitigation for sentences in the 
case of so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; crimes, excessively narrow definitions of rape, ineffective 
enforcement of new laws, and resolution of cases of violence against women outside formal 
justice systems.17 
</p>
<p>20. While there has been progress towards achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals, overall the review notes that &#8220;Progress for women and girls in many areas covered 
by the Millennium Development Goals lags behind overall gains. This outcome is 
indicative of the insufficient attention given to the gender equality dimensions in national 
development policies and strategies related to the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals.&#8221;18 
</p>
<p>21. The reports of the Working Group on Communications of the Commission on the 
Status of Women also confirm that there is a continuing problem with laws and practices 
that discriminate against women. Under the Commission communications procedure, this 
Working Group annually reviews communications submitted to the United Nations and 
brings to the attention of the Commission those which appear to reveal a consistent pattern 
of reliably attested injustice and discriminatory practices against women. In 2005 the 
Working Group expressed concern that a pattern was to be seen in &#8220;the continued existence 
of legislation or practices in many areas either intended to or with the effect of 
discriminating against women, despite the international obligations and commitments of 
States and their constitutional provisions to outlaw such discrimination.&#8221;19  
</p>
<p>22. This language has been reiterated in subsequent years, reflecting a consistent 
pattern.20 The report of the Working Group to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission, 
identified among the categories of cases most frequently submitted to the Commission 
communications involving legislation and practices that discriminate against women in 
civil and political rights; personal status, including marriage and divorce; the right to own 
and inherit property; and employment, including equal pay and other forms of 
discrimination in the workplace.21 
</p>
<p>23. Thus it is clear that, notwithstanding the significant progress that has been made in 
the removal of laws and practices that discriminate against women, such laws and practices 
persist in all parts of the world, and have an impact on the enjoyment by women of their 
human rights and the process of development, including on the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals. The Human Rights Council has noted that despite the 
pledges made by governments &#8220;to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate 
against women and girls, many of those laws are still in force and continue to be applied, 
thereby preventing women and girls from enjoying the full realization of their human 
rights&#8221; and recognized that &#8220;women&#8217;s inequality before the law has resulted in the lack of 
equal opportunities for women in education, access to health, economic participation, 
access to labour and disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political

</p>
<p><b> III. Addressing discrimination against women throughout the 
United Nations human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>24. The United Nations human rights system has made significant progress in giving the 
human rights of women greater prominence.  Calls to give the human rights of women and 
the gender dimension of human rights increased attention preceded the Vienna World 
Conference on Human Rights and the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women, but 
those conferences gave major impetus to efforts to include issues of gender on the so-called 
&#8220;mainstream&#8221; human rights agenda. 
</p>
<p>25. This enhanced attention resulted in the adoption of gender-specific normative 
instruments addressing discrimination against women and encouraged the strengthening of 
procedures to monitor national efforts to ensure the equality of women and consider claims 
of alleged violations of the human rights of women. Of particular importance was the 
establishment in 1994 by the Commission on Human Rights of the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, and the adoption by the General 
Assembly of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women in 1999. 
</p>
<p>26. The Commission on the Status of Women has continued its multifaceted analysis of 
the situation of women in the world and identified policy responses that will promote their 
advancement. The Beijing Platform for Action, and the documents resulting from its 
reviews, have provided the framework for much of its work in the last 15 years. While the 
human rights of women - including the right to equality before and under the law - form an 
important part of that framework, and while the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Declaration on Violence against Women 
are frequently points of reference for its work, a human rights approach forms only part of 
the Commission perspective on addressing women&#8217;s disadvantage. The original proposal in 
1991 for a special rapporteur on discrimination against women, which led ultimately to the 
establishment by the Commission on Human Rights of the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, was that the Commission itself establish the special rapporteur.23  
</p>
<p>27. While the Commission has reviewed its communications procedure on several 
occasions in the last 20 years, there has been no fundamental change to its nature; the 
procedure is primarily a means of providing general information to the Commission to 
enable it to identify trends and formulate policy recommendations for itself and the 
Economic and Social Council. It is not a mechanism intended to provide a remedy for 
individuals who allege that their rights have been violated, or respond directly to allegations 
of systematic denials of the rights of women. 
</p>
<p>28. In 2007, OHCHR commissioned an analytical study on laws that discriminate 
against women and the usefulness of creating a new mechanism to address this issue. The 
study entitled &#8220;Project on a mechanism to address laws that discriminate against women&#8221;, 
prepared by Fareda Banda, addresses the compatibility of a new mandate with existing 
mechanisms and identifies how the existing mechanisms have addressed de jure 
</p>

<p>discrimination against women and the resulting protection gaps.24 It was launched at an 
event on 4 April 2008 to which all Member States were invited. 
</p>
<p><b> A.  Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council have taken up 
discrimination against women within a focused and explicit human rights framework and 
sought to give sex equality a higher priority by the establishment of mechanisms that focus 
on sex-specific or gendered violations of human rights, as well as by calling for integration 
of sex-specific violations and gendered dimensions of rights in all procedures and 
mechanisms. The first major example of this was the establishment of a dedicated Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, but the Commission on Human Rights was 
concerned to strive for integration of violations of women&#8217;s rights throughout its work. In 
1994, the Commission called upon &#8220;all special rapporteurs, experts, working groups, treaty 
bodies, and other mechanisms of the Commission and the Sub-Commission, in the 
discharge of their mandates, regularly and systematically to include in their reports 
available information on human rights violations against women&#8221;.25 The Commission 
subsequently repeated this injunction26 and included in the mandates of individual 
mechanisms a request that the position of women in relation to violations that fall within 
that mandate be taken into account. The Council, in renewing or establishing special 
procedures mandates, has included a standard request that the mandate holders integrate a 
gender perspective or give appropriate attention to the position of women and girls.27 
</p>
<p>30. It is relevant to assess the extent to which special procedures have identified laws 
and practices that discriminate against women within the scope of their mandates, whether 
they have been able to undertake sustained examination of these instances, and whether that 
has led to action to address those problems. The following non-exhaustive examination 
exemplifies instances in which special rapporteurs have examined laws and practices that 
discriminate against women and the extent to which they have been able to follow through 
on these issues. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women has drawn attention on a regular 
basis to the role that discriminatory laws play in perpetuating violence against women or 
standing in the way of some form of redress for women affected by violence, and the need 
for sound laws that are effectively enforced. She has also drawn attention to the impact of 
laws outside the areas of criminal law or domestic violence laws, that place women in 
situations in which they may be more exposed to violence, and has made a number of 
recommendations as to the content of legislation that States should enact in order to prevent 
and punish violence against women.  
</p>
<p>32. A number of other special procedures have also addressed the position of women 
and girls. In his 2007 report to the Council the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment examined the application of the 
prohibition against torture as it related to women, as part of an effort &#8220;to ensure that the 
torture protection framework is applied in a gender-inclusive manner with a view to 
strengthening the protection of women from torture&#8221;.28 Included in that examination was 
consideration of intimate partner violence and the role of law in perpetuating and

<p>addressing that phenomenon. The Special Rapporteur argued that &#8220;States should be held 
accountable for complicity in violence against women, whenever they create and 
implement discriminatory laws&#8221;, and noted that States could be held liable &#8220;if domestic 
laws fail to provide adequate protection against any form of torture and ill-treatment in the 
home&#8221;.29  
</p>
<p>33. At the outset of the mandate on the right to education, the Special Rapporteur paid 
some attention to the role that discriminatory laws might play in denying or restricting 
girls&#8217; enjoyment of the right to education.30 The Special Rapporteur has since undertaken a 
detailed study of girls&#8217; right to education, but his sociocultural and economic analysis did 
not address the role that discriminatory laws may play in impeding girls&#8217; full enjoyment of 
the right to education in any detail.31  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while 
countering terrorism submitted a report to the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly 
which, building on material in his earlier reports, addressed, inter alia, the impact on 
women of counter-terrorism measures, and the impact of both laws and practices, many of 
which appear to be gender-neutral but which may have a disproportionately negative 
impact on women.32 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental<b> </b>health has made consistent references to 
women&#8217;s equality before the law, thus contributing to the recent inclusion by the Human 
Rights Council of the human rights dimensions of maternal mortality and morbidity in its 
agenda. Extensive examination of laws and practices that discriminate against women was 
undertaken by the former Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, 
in a series of reports in the period 2003 to 2006 analysing laws which have an impact on 
women&#8217;s enjoyment of the right to adequate housing.33 His analysis shows the 
interdependence of various rights, and demonstrates that women&#8217;s right to adequate 
housing is affected not only by laws relating to &#8220;housing&#8221; in a narrow sense but by &#8220;land 
ownership laws, acquisition laws, title registration laws, slum clearance laws, matrimonial 
and inheritance laws, laws relating to domestic violence, customary and religious laws, 
environmental laws and urban regulations&#8221;.34 Importantly, the Special Rapporteur also 
noted that it was not just laws that explicitly discriminated against women that affected 
their ability to enjoy the right to adequate housing, but also gender-neutral laws applied to 
the disadvantage of women.35 
</p>
<p>36. Thus, since the mid-1990s the human rights special procedures have paid 
significantly increased attention to violations of women&#8217;s human rights and the relevance of 
gender. All have made some effort to incorporate gender perspectives, although in some 
cases this has been limited in scope, often to interlinkages with violence, or not sustained. 
In many cases in relation to specific countries or more generally, mandate holders have 
found that laws and practices that discriminate against women have impeded their 
enjoyment of the right which is the subject of the mandate. However, with the exception of 
the Special Rapporteurs on violence against women, the right to health, and adequate

<p>housing, those mechanisms that have undertaken a detailed study of the gender dimensions 
of their mandate have not followed up in a sustained and focused manner on issues of 
gender. This is in part due to the fact that gender may be only one dimension of a mandate, 
albeit important one. The effect of calling on special procedures to incorporate gender 
perspectives in their work may have been that they have further highlighted the extent of 
discriminatory laws and practices and their impact on the enjoyment of human rights, but 
also shown that the existing mandates have been able to respond to them only partially. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>37. The United Nations human rights treaty bodies have significantly increased the 
degree of attention paid to the position of women and the gender dimensions of human 
rights, with varying degrees of engagement, reflecting the scope of the treaty in question, 
the priority assigned by committee members to these issues, and the information received 
by the committees from various sources. Attention to these issues can be seen particularly 
in the concluding observations of the committees on the reports of States parties, in general 
comments, cases decided under individual communications procedures, and reports under 
inquiry procedures. 
</p>
<p>38. The 2006 report by the Secretary-General to the Commission on the Status of 
Women surveyed the extent to which laws and practices that discriminate against women 
are addressed by human rights treaty bodies.36 The 2006 assessment is still accurate. The 
survey emphasized that the treaty body which has devoted the most sustained attention to 
the issue of laws and practices that discriminate against women has been the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The Committee has clarified the 
obligation of States parties to ensure there is no discrimination in their laws, and frequently 
addressed issues pertaining to gender-neutral provisions which may perpetuate 
discrimination against women, discriminatory practices and legislative provisions in family 
and/or personal status codes, labour legislation, criminal law and customary law, as well as 
in regard to nationality and citizenship, and property and inheritance rights.37 
</p>
<p>39. In addition to its recommendations to individual reporting States, in its general 
recommendations the Committee has analysed the role of law in perpetuating or eliminating 
discrimination and the obligations of the State, in particular in regard to violence against 
women, equality in marriage and family relations, and temporary special measures which 
analyse the scope of State obligations under the Convention.38 
</p>
<p>40. The Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the Committee on the Rights of the Child consistently raise issues regarding the 
position of women and girls and their enjoyment of the rights guaranteed under the 
respective treaties. These include questions and recommendations relating to the limitations 
of existing laws and the desirability of new or improved laws to eliminate discrimination 
and promote equality.39 
</p>
<p>41. For example, during its ninety-sixth to ninety-eighth sessions, recommendations by 
the Human Rights Committee to States parties in concluding observations included 
recommendations regarding protection against indirect discrimination in anti-discrimination 
</p>
<p>

 37 Ibid., paras. 16 and 17. 
 38 General recommendations No. 19 (1992) on violence against women, No. 21 (1994) on equality in 
</p>
<p>marriage and family relations, and No. 25 (2004) on article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention 
(temporary special measures). 
</p>
<p> 39 See E/CN.6/2006/8, paras. 18-20. </p>


<p>laws; employment targets set by equal opportunities legislation; criminalization of sexual 
harassment in the workplace; discriminatory provisions in civil codes, such as prohibitions 
on women remarrying in the six months following divorce and provisions providing that 
the husband is the head of the conjugal union; restrictive definitions of rape in the criminal 
code and the need to ensure that incest and sexual abuse other than actual sexual intercourse 
are considered serious criminal offences; eliminating the requirement for women to prove 
resistance against an assault in order to establish rape; and the need to prosecute rape and 
other crimes of sexual violence ex officio.40 
</p>
<p>42. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its forty-second and 
forty-third sessions held in 2009, recommended that States parties remedy the absence of 
framework legislation embodying the principle of equal rights of men and women; ensure 
equal remuneration for women and men and include in legislation specific provision on 
equal pay for work of equal value; regulate employment conditions of domestic workers to 
ensure that they enjoy the same legal protection as other workers; remove discrimination in 
laws relating to the transmission of nationality by women to their children; eliminate 
discrimination against women in legislation relating to inheritance of immovable property; 
enact or amend abortion laws to protect women from the effects of clandestine and unsafe 
abortions; and address the refusal of physicians to perform legal abortions.41 
</p>
<p>43. The Committee has also addressed these issues in its general comments, in particular 
in general comment No. 20 (2009) on non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural 
rights, which notes the importance of addressing both direct and indirect discrimination in 
laws, policies and practices; the role of legal rules in perpetuating systemic discrimination, 
and multiple discrimination. It further underlined the importance of adopting specific 
legislation prohibiting discrimination in the field of economic, social and cultural rights and 
regularly reviewing laws &#8220;in order to ensure that they do not discriminate or lead to 
discrimination, whether formally or substantively&#8221; in relation to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights.42  
</p>
<p>44. The Committee on the Rights of the Child consistently addresses the situation of 
girls and frequently draws attention to the role that legislation plays in perpetuating 
discrimination against them. It has expressed concern about the low minimum legal age for 
marriage and its implications for the well-being of girls; the discriminatory nature of 
customary law; and the fact that, particularly in the context of property rights, this may 
reinforce discrimination against girls.43 
</p>
<p>45. The Committee against Torture has increased its attention to the gendered 
dimensions of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regularly 
requesting information to be broken down by gender, and has focused particularly on the 
treatment of women in detention or other forms of custody.44  
</p>
<p>46. The Committee against Torture has also gone beyond situations of detention 
addressed in its general comment No. 2 (2007) on the implementation of article 2 by States 
parties, and brought domestic violence and the absence or lack of enforcement of relevant 
laws into its dialogue with States parties, and addressed violations of women&#8217;s reproductive 
rights.45 The Committee has also drawn attention to legislation that &#8220;severely restricts 
access to voluntary abortion, even in cases of rape, leading to grave consequences,

<p>including the unnecessary deaths of women.&#8221;46 It has expressed concern about allegations 
of &#8220;continued involuntary sterilization of Roma women&#8221; and called for the effective 
enforcement of health legislation.47  
</p>
<p>47. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has devoted less 
attention to gender issues, although it regularly raises the issue of the treatment of migrant 
women, indigenous women and women belonging to minority groups in its concluding 
observations. In 2000 it adopted general recommendation No. 25 on the gender-related 
dimensions of racial discrimination, in which it recognized that racial discrimination may 
affect women and men in different ways and that &#8220;some forms of racial discrimination have 
a unique and specific impact on women&#8221;.48 
</p>
<p>48. The Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families has addressed the impact of both discriminatory and neutral 
laws on women who are migrant workers, or who belong to a family in which there is a 
migrant worker. It has expressed concern that reforms to laws which permit women to 
obtain passports without the permission of a third party are not being given effect to by the 
authorities, and has urged States parties to undertake efforts &#8220;to protect migrant women 
domestic workers, including access to regular migration status and greater and more 
systematic involvement of the labour authorities in monitoring their working conditions&#8221;.49 
</p>
<p>49. Thus, considerable attention is given to the situation of women and girls under the 
major human rights treaties, including the role that laws and their implementation play in 
perpetuating discrimination. The reports of States parties to treaty bodies also provide many 
examples of steps taken to eliminate discriminatory laws and to ensure that gender-neutral 
laws and laws intended to promote equality for women are appropriately implemented. 
Consideration of these issues in the reporting procedure appears to have added momentum 
for reform.  
</p>
<p>50. However, in most cases, the major contribution of the human rights system has been 
to identify and highlight problems and engage governments and civil society in discussion 
of these examples of discrimination, and the steps that should be undertaken to address 
them. The nature of the reporting process &#8211; with periodic reporting and years between 
reports, limited resources for follow-up, and the overall burden of work &#8211; limits the extent 
to which treaty bodies, alone or in combination, can follow up in a sustained and focused 
manner on the many examples of laws and practices that are discriminatory. 
</p>

<p>reform bodies53), academic commentators,54 and women&#8217;s groups and other non-
governmental organizations. The scale of the problem and its persistence is clear. Despite 
significant reforms, the international community has fallen short of its goal of eliminating 
discriminatory laws and practices by 2005. In 2010, in all regions of the world there are still 
many instances of laws that clearly discriminate against women in their terms and 
assumptions, and in all countries there are laws which indirectly discriminate against 
women or which are implemented in a discriminatory manner.  
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Options for action: conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The issue is thus what additional steps the United Nations human rights system 
might take to stimulate further reform of discriminatory laws and enhance domestic 
monitoring processes to identify new laws that discriminate explicitly or that are 
discriminatory in impact or implementation. The contribution by the United Nations 
system through existing mechanisms and practices, and any new steps that might be 
adopted, can only be part of any solution. United Nations bodies can contribute to the 
identification of laws that discriminate (including by providing tools for analysis); 
facilitate the sharing of model laws and best practices in legislation and 
implementation; provide technical assistance; and support the work of national 
governments, parliaments, national human rights institutions and others. However, 
the main impetus for reform must come from the national level. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The steps taken by the Human Rights Council to ensure that women&#8217;s rights 
issues and gender integration are addressed have created a space for discussion on 
topical matters affected by the lack of equality of women and men before the law: one 
example is the attention that was given to maternal mortality and morbidity at its 
fourteenth session. This should be continued, refined and strengthened by ensuring 
follow-up. The identification of &#8220;gender focal points&#8221;, in the form of a group of self-
identified States, has been suggested in plenary panels and merits further 
consideration. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The Human Rights Council may wish to consider requesting regular updates 
on the extent and nature of laws that discriminate against women and good practices 
in eliminating these, drawing upon the findings of the United Nations human rights 
machinery and the broader United Nations system. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>An earlier report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights made a number 
of suggestions as to how gender perspectives could be better integrated into the 
universal periodic review (UPR)  process.55 An evaluation of how the State under 
review has met its obligations to eliminate laws discriminating against women could

standardized set of questions could be produced, as well as contextualized questions 
for each country under review, to give greater prominence to discriminatory laws and 
the steps that States are willing to undertake to address them as part of the UPR 
procedure. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. UN Women 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>The Division for the Advancement of Women and OHCHR have had an annual 
joint workplan, requiring reporting to the Human Rights Council and the 
Commission on the Status of Women. Following the establishment of UN Women, this 
could be replaced by a joint workplan between OHCHR and UN Women. An initial 
focus of the new workplan could be equality before the law. This would build on 
previous work by the constituent entities of UN Women in relation to the 
identification, analysis, and development of appropriate legislative and policy 
responses to discriminatory laws. The</b> <b>judicial colloquia on the human rights of 
women organized by the Division; the work related to the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, carried out by the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women; and publications such as the handbooks on the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women for 
parliamentarians and on legislation relating to violence against women,56 might be 
built on.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C.  Establishment of a new thematic procedure 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>A further possibility is the establishment of a new special procedure of the 
Council that would focus on laws and practices that discriminate against women. 
During the plenary panel discussion on &#8220;equality before the law&#8221; held at the eleventh 
session of the Council, a number of States and other entities considered such a 
mechanism an effective means of advancing efforts to address this problem.57 
However, the question has also been raised as to whether this would contribute 
effectively to the elimination of discriminatory laws, without unnecessarily duplicating 
the work of existing bodies whose mandates cover some aspects of the topic.58 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The issue here is not whether there is formally some substantive overlap of 
coverage, but whether a new mechanism would complement the work of the existing 
human rights machinery. While concerns about duplication have been raised in 
relation to other thematic mandates, such overlap between a proposed thematic 
mechanism and the mandate of a treaty body has not been a bar to its establishment. 
In relation to rights monitored by the Human Rights Committee, there is overlap with

March 2010 soliciting information from stakeholders in relation to the issues to be addressed in the 
present report, are available in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/15/40/Add.1).  </p>


<p><b>at least seven thematic mechanisms of the Council (summary, arbitrary and 
extrajudicial executions; arbitrary detention; disappearances; freedom of expression; 
independence of the judiciary; religious intolerance; terrorism). Similarly in relation 
to the role of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, there are at 
least seven thematic mechanisms that address rights contained in the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (education, health, housing, 
extreme poverty, water, cultural rights, toxic waste). In the case of the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women there is overlap with the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, and some overlap with the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children. The work of 
the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture has effectively complemented that 
of the Committee against Torture. It seems likely that a similar complementarity 
would develop in relation to the work of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women (and other treaty bodies) if a mechanism on 
discriminatory laws were established. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The added value of special thematic procedures that monitor rights contained 
in the human rights covenants and conventions underlines the fact that the treaty 
bodies have many priorities and are not well-placed to provide sustained follow-up to 
each of the specific rights that fall within their mandates. The establishment of a 
thematic procedure can add to the effectiveness of the work of a treaty body by 
building on and following up its findings and recommendations. In addition, some 
thematic special procedures cover issues that may be covered by a number of treaty 
bodies and a mechanism on discriminatory laws could perform a similar function.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Any new mechanism should be flexible and able to perform a range of 
functions. Its guiding principle should be to catalyse efforts, especially at national 
level, to ensure that discriminatory laws are identified and modified or repealed. In 
order for such a mechanism to function effectively, it would need to be able to gather, 
request, receive and exchange information from all relevant sources, including 
governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, national 
human rights institutions and others; identify and make concrete recommendations 
on amending or repealing laws that discriminate against women; facilitate the 
provision of technical assistance; and identify, disseminate and promote best practices 
or models for eliminating discriminatory law and practices. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Any new mechanism should work in close cooperation with other special 
procedures and subsidiary organs of the Human Rights Council, relevant United 
Nations bodies, the treaty bodies and regional human rights mechanisms. Such a 
mechanism would also have a consolidating function, drawing and building upon 
findings by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and 
other treaty bodies in reviewing State reports, recommendations or undertakings 
made under the UPR, or other reliable information about discriminatory legislation. 
It should meet regularly with the Committee, other relevant treaty bodies, and 
international or regional bodies dealing with issues of discriminatory laws and 
practices, as well as report on its work both to the Human Rights Council, and to the 
Commission on the Status of Women. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Given the nature of the theme, such a mechanism would also have to build on 
existing cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, 
in order to encourage the adoption or strengthening of procedures for preventing the 
enactment of laws that are discriminatory; for repealing existing discriminatory laws; 
and for monitoring the implementation of laws to assess their impact on women. 
Similarly, such a mechanism would need to work in close interaction with law reform 
bodies, in particular through international associations of such bodies, to explore ways </b></p>


<p><b>to support their work in terms of promoting the enactment of non-discriminatory 
laws. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The discussion above shows that, notwithstanding the work of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, other human rights treaty 
bodies, the special procedures and other United Nations bodies, further measures are 
required to eliminate discriminatory laws and close the persistent gap between de 
facto and de jure equality. The Human Rights Council has considerable potential to 
advance further the efforts of the international community to eliminate discrimination 
against women in law and practice by adopting the measures outlined above.</b>
