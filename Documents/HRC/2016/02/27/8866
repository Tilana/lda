<p>GE.09-17604 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, which should be read together with the High Commissioner&#8217;s 
report to the General Assembly (A/64/36), constitutes the High Commissioner&#8217;s annual 
report submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102. The report notes a 
number of serious human rights challenges that have predominated during 2009, 
particularly the food, economic and financial crises, and a subsequent deterioration of the 
ability of vulnerable groups to enjoy their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has 
addressed these challenges by reinforcing the work and emphasizing the relevance of the 
international human rights mechanisms and has engaged in dialogue and cooperation with 
Member States and other stakeholders.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Support for the work of the Human Rights Council and the 
effective functioning of its mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>2. With the support of OHCHR, the Human Rights Council held four special sessions 
on the human rights situations in several countries, and two thematic sessions: one on the 
global food crisis and another on the economic crisis. OHCHR continued to support 
country missions including the Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict and a mission to 
Honduras (see section IV below).  
</p><p>3. As the Council begins the process of the review of its work and functioning, it is 
important that it not be diverted from taking up pressing human rights issues that the 
Council has a core responsibility to address. Accordingly, the review established pursuant 
to paragraphs 1 and 16 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 should be carefully framed. 
This is an exercise distinct from the 2006 reform, consisting of layered adjustments rather 
than one major process. It relates to the status of the Council, including its relationship with 
the General Assembly, and its working methods and functioning. The Council is called 
upon to build on the results of the comprehensive reform in 2006 and ensure better 
functioning of the existing human rights machinery. The review process offers an 
opportunity to take stock of the Council&#8217;s achievements objectively, identify areas in which 
adjustment is necessary and analyse challenges. These efforts should take a pragmatic 
approach and be conducted in an inclusive manner, in a spirit of cooperation, aimed at 
reaching consensus at the Council and the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>4. Specific areas to be considered include ways to enhance the transparency and 
predictability of the Council&#8217;s annual programme of work, spreading its work more evenly 
throughout the year; crafting a clearer delineation of the relationship between the Council 
and its subsidiary organs; and measures to stimulate cross-regional initiatives, more 
systematic and active engagement with United Nations departments, funds and 
programmes, and specialized agencies.  
</p>
<p>5. The positive trend of dedicating in-session segments to thematic panel discussions 
has continued. This has allowed the Council to consider a wide range of topics, such as 
climate change and persons with disabilities, and to draw on available expertise. The further 
diversification of discussion formats should be encouraged, but modalities may need to be 
refined to ensure that the Council&#8217;s regular sessions are not overburdened. 
</p>
<p>6. The Council has been innovative in approaching thematic issues. However, in the 
case of the universal periodic review, where country situations are concerned, it still 
operates on the lines of the inflexible framework of the Commission. No country is free of 
human rights challenges and the Council must be in a position to consider all human rights </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.09-17604 
</p>
<p>violations whatever their scope and wherever they occur. Further thought should be given 
to expanding the Council&#8217;s toolbox so it can promptly and effectively deal with urgent or 
chronic human rights issues at the national, subregional or regional levels. This may require 
broadening the possible outcomes of special sessions, the formulation of presidential 
declarations, in addition to resolutions, or in-sessional special sittings.<b> </b>Innovative 
discussion formats, and<b> </b>modalities and new types of action would be required to enhance 
the Council&#8217;s role as the principal intergovernmental body in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. During my interactive dialogues with the Human Rights Council and the Third 
Committee of the General Assembly in March and November respectively, I noted the 
breadth of human rights issues raised by delegations, which provided the context for in-
depth dialogue on the full range of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, as 
well as on all aspects of the High Commissioner&#8217;s mandate. Dialogues with the Council and 
the Assembly are essential to ensure that we remain responsive to the human rights 
concerns of the international community. The Council review should provide a context in 
which these opportunities are rationalized, so as to maximize their impact and take the best 
advantage of the specificity of each organ. The number of informal interactions with the 
international community on various aspects of the High Commissioner&#8217;s mandate with a 
view to upholding transparency and cooperation with all stakeholders also increased during 
the year. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Universal periodic review  
</b></p>
<p>8. The universal periodic review is the most significant innovation of the Council. It 
confirms my own view of human rights: that there is no country free from human rights 
violations. The achievement of a genuinely universal process testifies to the credibility of 
the Council, and positive results have been achieved so far. A number of refinements could 
be considered before the commencement of the second review cycle to prevent it becoming 
routine, and to ensure that it reaches its potential of being a reliable and truthful witness to 
country situations, as well as being a means of providing a road map for the implementation 
of recommendations aimed at filling policy, legal and practical gaps at the national level.  
</p>
<p>9. By the end of December 2009, half of all Member States had been reviewed, with all 
States under review participating, and their peers being fully engaged at the various stages 
of the process. A broad range of recommendations relating to all areas of human rights 
were made during each universal periodic review. These ranged from calls for ratification 
of human rights treaties, enactment of national legislation and deepened cooperation with 
human rights mechanisms, to recommendations for specific action and measures at the 
national level. This shows the interest and seriousness with which States have approached 
the universal periodic review. However, devising practical mechanisms to follow up and 
ensure implementation of these recommendations is an important challenge for the future. 
States should continue to formulate concrete, actionable and tangible recommendations and 
reflect on ways to further rationalize, streamline and cluster recommendations. Where 
follow-up and implementation is concerned, it is imperative that ways and means be found 
to involve States under review, United Nations entities, and all other relevant stakeholders 
in a common effort to identify specific steps to accelerate national implementation of 
recommendations. OHCHR is also establishing a mechanism to support follow-up on the 
basis of the funding provided by the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance 
for implementation of the universal periodic review.  </p>


<p>GE.09-17604 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>10. Strengthening international human rights mechanisms and supporting the 
development of international human rights law is one of the six priorities of OHCHR for 
the next biennium. The work undertaken by the special procedures, their dialogue with 
States, monitoring, public reporting, country visits, outreach, accessibility and direct 
interventions, including through the hundreds of communications they send each year, is 
critical to the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide. The support provided 
by many States to the special procedures is much appreciated, and in line with Council 
resolution 5/2, all should fully cooperate and assist special procedures in the performance 
of their tasks. Two standing invitations to special procedures were issued in 2009, making a 
total of 65 States which maintain such invitations. Informative responses to special 
procedures&#8217; communications should also form part of enhanced cooperation with these 
mechanisms, as should constructive engagement in substantive discussions of their reports, 
facilitating the conduct of missions, and actively ensuring follow-up to recommendations 
and conclusions. States should also provide the space for special procedures to exercise 
their mandates in full independence and with the confidence that honest, constructive and 
even robust dialogue with States about matters of substance will not be couched in terms of 
misconduct. 
</p>
<p>11. A hallmark of the system has been the direct accessibility of special procedures to 
victims and witnesses, and their capacity to work closely with human rights defenders. 
During 2009, there have been several incidents, including killings of persons who had 
engaged with special procedures mandate holders. Free interaction between experts and all 
stakeholders, many of whom are civil society actors, is an important indicator of 
cooperation with international human rights mechanisms and States should ensure that all 
those who are in contact with special procedures are free from reprisal.  
</p>
<p>12. There is now a comprehensive system of special rapporteurs, representatives, 
independent experts and working groups covering all sets of rights and several country 
situations. In all there are 39 mandates &#8212; 31 thematic, including the new mandate in the 
field of cultural rights, and eight country mandates &#8212; with 55 mandate holders. During 
2009, OHCHR facilitated the selection process for new mandate holders and their 
integration into the system through information sessions and briefings, as well as through 
supporting the Special Procedures Coordination Committee&#8217;s orientation sessions. The 
enhanced transparency of the selection process through the Consultative Group&#8217;s provision 
of more detailed public explanations for its recommendations to the Council President is a 
welcome development. Expertise on the substantive issues of the mandate should be the 
primary consideration in the appointment of the 10 new experts who will take up their 
functions in 2010. Approximately one third of mandate holders are women, but as the 
international community conducts the 15-year review of the implementation of the Beijing 
Declaration and Platform for Action, there remains room for improvement so as to achieve 
full gender equality.  
</p>
<p>13. The special procedures complement and add value to other international human 
rights mechanisms, including to other Council and human rights treaty bodies. They have 
an important role in early-warning processes and drawing the international community&#8217;s 
attention to emerging issues and global crises, as recently emphasized during a side event 
convened by OHCHR during the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The 
Council has mandated groups of thematic and country rapporteurs with additional tasks, 
such as reports on specific human rights situations in the context of special sessions, for 
example on the Sudan, the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. As a result of an open invitation extended by the President through their 
Coordination Committee, special procedures&#8217; voices are heard at all Council special 
sessions. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.09-17604 
</p>
<p>14. Special procedures have also worked closely with other Council mechanisms. For 
example, the UPR interactive dialogues with States under review included discussions of 
issues raised by special procedures, and countries have pledged greater cooperation. Special 
procedures have made important contributions to the thematic panels and other discussions 
of the Council. They have been supported by OHCHR in their interaction with subsidiary 
bodies of the Council, including the Forum on Minority Issues, the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Social Forum, and in following the work of the 
Advisory Committee. Special procedures contributed to the successful outcome of the 
Durban Review Conference, and will actively participate in its follow-up.  
</p>
<p>15. Special procedures have continued to be important in the development of 
international human rights law. The Working Group on the use of mercenaries is 
considering elements for a possible draft convention on the activities of private military and 
security companies. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food developed a set of core 
principles and measures to address the human rights challenge posed by large-scale land 
acquisitions and leases. The Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances 
&#8212; which this year commemorates its thirtieth anniversary &#8212; adopted its general comment 
on enforced disappearance as a crime against humanity. Thematic mandate holders have 
also jointly addressed cross-cutting issues through comprehensive analysis and 
recommendations, for example in relation to secret detention in the context of counter-
terrorism and discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Developments in strategic thematic areas 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Combating discrimination and support to victims 
</b></p>
<p>16. Among the priority themes OHCHR has identified for the next biennium is 
countering discrimination, in particular racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance, discrimination on the grounds of sex, disability, against indigenous groups and 
national minorities, and against others who are marginalized. Equality before the law and 
freedom from discrimination constitute basic legal principles that underpin all human 
rights, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights 
treaties containing provisions prohibiting discrimination and establishing State obligations 
to refrain from discriminatory policies and practices and take active steps to eradicate 
discrimination in both the public and private spheres. The roots of most human rights 
abuses, including in situations of conflict, lie in severe violations of these principles. To 
underscore the importance of combating discrimination and related violations, OHCHR 
selected the theme of &#8220;Embrace diversity, stop discrimination&#8221; for the 2009 Human Rights 
Day activities which took place around the world.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous and minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>17. It is essential to translate standards of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples from aspiration to practice. OHCHR, in close cooperation with 
indigenous representatives and other partners, has continued to play a leading role in this 
process, promoting the use of the Declaration by national human rights institutions and 
other key actors. In addition to undertaking country-specific activities to advance the rights 
of indigenous peoples this year, OHCHR has also pursued thematic work on challenging 
issues such as the rights of isolated indigenous peoples. It supported the Expert Mechanism 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and organized an inclusive workshop to contribute to 
the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s first thematic study on the right of indigenous peoples to 
education. OHCHR also contributed to strengthened inter-agency cooperation, the work of </p>


<p>GE.09-17604 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and supported capacity-building among 
indigenous peoples such as through a fellowship programme and a voluntary fund.  
</p>
<p>18. OHCHR has supported activities to enhance the visibility and impact of the 
Minorities Declaration and other key standards. Its minority fellowship programme 
contributed to the development of advocacy skills of minority representatives, who 
subsequently launched concrete initiatives advancing minority rights at the local level. 
Support for the Forum on Minority Issues continued, which highlighted political 
participation at its second session. OHCHR further developed its work on policing and 
minority communities including through a subregional consultation held in Johannesburg in 
October 2009 to collect good practices in this area.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Gender equality and women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>19. The move to create a consolidated United Nations gender entity, the thirtieth 
anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the reiteration by the Security Council 
that rape and other forms of sexual violence against women in conflict are a threat against 
international peace and security, have created increased momentum for action with respect 
to women&#8217;s rights. With the upcoming review of the implementation of the Beijing 
Platform of Action, OHCHR will build on its previous work and step up its efforts towards 
the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>20. OHCHR has facilitated the integration of women&#8217;s rights and a gender perspective 
into the work of the Human Rights Council, and it is significant that maternal mortality and 
equality before the law will be subject to in-depth consideration by the Human Rights 
Council during its fourteenth and fifteenth sessions. Support has been provided to the 
Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to assist in 
its task of examining the implementation of the Convention, and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, and other special procedures. 
OHCHR has continued to be active in inter-agency initiatives such as the United Nations 
Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict and an inter-agency sub-working group 
establishing the team of experts called for in Security Council resolution 1888 (2009) 
relating to rape and other forms of sexual violence as a weapon of war.  
</p>
<p>21. During 2009, gender advisers were recruited to four OHCHR regional offices (Fiji, 
Lebanon, Panama and Senegal), in order to respond better to Government requests for 
guidance on the integration of a gender dimension into national policies and programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Combating impunity and the prevention of genocide  
</b></p>
<p>22. The rule of law forms the foundation of legal protection of human rights and 
combating impunity, and during 2009, OHCHR continued to play a lead role within the 
United Nations system to combat impunity, strengthen accountability and to establish and 
entrench conditions for democracy and the rule of law. Support was provided to the 
independent international fact-finding missions concerning Gaza and Guinea, and OHCHR 
continued to engage with Governments and other national actors to promote principles of 
accountability and rule of law, to provide examples of best practice and technical advice 
and assistance. Briefings to the Security Council were provided, at its request, during the 
Security Council&#8217;s debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, its consultations 
on the application of humanitarian law in conflict situations, during its retreat on protection 
issues, and the meetings of its Counter-Terrorism Committee. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.09-17604 
</p>
<p>23. The lead role of OHCHR on transitional justice within the United Nations system 
provided the Office with the opportunity and the responsibility to explore and develop 
issues related to transitional justice. OHCHR convened an Expert Workshop on Lessons 
Learned and Future Directions on Transitional Justice in May 2009, the results of which 
were provided to the Human Rights Council at its twelfth session. In the area of 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, my Office actively engaged with the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations on the development of guidelines to operationalize 
the role of United Nations agencies in this area. OHCHR also issued a guidance note on 
national human rights institutions (NHRIs) and organized a regional conference in Africa 
on the role of NHRIs in facilitating justice and peace, particularly in the establishment of 
transitional justice mechanisms in post-conflict societies.  
</p><p>24. Impunity is a feature of conflict, and the interaction between human rights law and 
international humanitarian law is critical to OHCHR efforts to combat impunity. At the 
request of the Council, OHCHR, in consultation with the International Committee of the 
Red Cross, organized an expert meeting on the issue of protecting the human rights of 
civilians in armed conflict. The meeting underlined the complementary and mutually 
reinforcing nature of human rights law and international humanitarian law and considered 
appropriate mechanisms to monitor the implementation of human rights in situations of 
armed conflict. As requested by the Council, a second meeting will take place in 2010.  
</p>
<p>25. The primary guardians of accountability at the national level, on behalf of the State, 
are the various components of the formal justice system, including police, judges, military 
courts, prosecutors, lawyers and corrections staff. Throughout 2009, OHCHR continued to 
work with these bodies in order to provide them with the knowledge, capacity and 
willingness to discharge their duties in the context of human rights. Regional colloquia for 
judges, training on the monitoring of legal systems in peace missions, and the expert 
promotion of administrative justice as means of securing human rights were used to engage 
the formal justice system. OHCHR continued to draw particular attention to the rights of 
detainees, particularly pretrial detainees, following the launch of its year-long campaign on 
this issue in December 2008, as well as the rights of those sentenced to death.  
</p>
<p>26. Impunity is facilitated if the rule of law is not underpinned by an appropriate 
constitutional framework. In 2009, OHCHR continued to provide technical assistance to 
States on constitution-making and constitutional reform. OHCHR built on its previous work 
on the prevention of genocide providing technical support to the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and on the Responsibility to Protect, 
respectively, as well as support to initiatives of Member States.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Migration 
</b></p>
<p>27. The plight of migrants, and particularly migrants in irregular situations, is one of the 
most critical human rights challenges. Migration can be positive for migrants and home and 
host societies, but the reality for many migrants is discrimination, exploitation and abuse. 
OHCHR has continued to advocate, including through its active participation in the Global 
Migration Group (GMG), a human rights approach to migration which places human rights 
obligations at the centre and promotes the use of human rights mechanisms to promote and 
protect the rights of migrant women, men and children at all stages of the migration 
process. From July to December 2010, OHCHR will take over the rotating chair of the 
GMG, providing an opportunity to further strengthen its leadership and contribution to 
United Nations system-wide efforts on migration.  
</p>
<p>28. Efforts to promote the ratification of the International Convention on the Rights of 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, including through the coordination of the 
Steering Committee of the Global Campaign for Ratification of the International </p>


<p>GE.09-17604 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families have 
continued. OHCHR field presences have increasingly engaged in migration-related work 
including the promotion of the Convention and other relevant instruments, through training 
activities, advocacy, technical advice and other capacity-building initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Economic, social and cultural rights in the light of the food, energy and 
financial crises 
</b></p>
<p>29. Many individuals and communities who faced the food and energy crises in 2008 
saw their situation worsen in 2009. The global economic crisis has led to massive job 
losses, particularly in the developed world, and the contraction of several areas of the 
global economy. Some sectors such as construction, infrastructure and services have been 
directly affected, but other areas of production such as small-scale farming and small, often 
family-run, enterprises and service providers have also experienced significant difficulties. 
Workers who were already vulnerable have seen their capacity to negotiate salaries or 
protection mechanisms further reduced. In many countries, this has been compounded by 
reductions in public allocations to, and investments in, social services. Despite calls to 
ensure social protection for all in times of crises, some Governments have reduced their 
budget allocation to these areas while lending large amounts to private financial 
institutions.  
</p>
<p>30. Throughout 2009, OHCHR actively and systematically engaged in international 
discussions and policy debates around the financial and economic crisis. It supported the 
Council&#8217;s tenth special session on the impact of the global economic and financial crises on 
the universal realization and effective enjoyment of human rights, held in February 2009. I 
also participated in the General Assembly high-level Conference on the World Financial 
and Economic Crisis, held in June 2009. 
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR is contributing to several ongoing initiatives of the United Nations System 
Chief Executives Board for Coordination, including the initiative on a social protection 
floor. It also supported the 2009 Social Forum of the Human Rights Council, and several 
special procedures mandate holders who highlighted the impact of the crises on human 
rights relevant to their mandates. 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to the global food crisis, OHCHR participated in the High Level Task 
Force for the Global Food Security Crisis and in February 2009 the Deputy High 
Commissioner participated in the World Summit on Food Security stressing the role that 
the right to food should play in the global and national solutions to the crisis. In light of the 
need to study the effects of the crisis on specific groups, OHCHR has worked to 
mainstream the human rights of persons with disabilities into development policies. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Climate change 
</b></p>
<p>33. The adverse effects of climate change impact on economies and ecosystems and 
individuals and communities. In the latter context, the impact of climate change is not only 
related to environmental factors, but also to policies and measures to protect vulnerable 
populations and, accordingly, in their response to the multiple challenges of climate change 
adaptation and mitigation, States must give due regard to international human rights norms 
and standards. 
</p>
<p>34. At its tenth session in March 2009, the Human Rights Council considered the 
OHCHR study on the relationship between climate change and human rights 
(A/HRC/10/61), and adopted resolution 10/4 on human rights and climate change. As 
requested by the Council, OHCHR supported the organization of a panel discussion of the </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.09-17604 
</p>
<p>Council on this issue in June 2009, and prepared a summary of the discussion which was 
made available, together with the OHCHR study, to the fifteenth Conference of Parties to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP15), held in 
Copenhagen in December 2009. OHCHR also participated in high-level planning meetings 
organized on climate change within the United Nations system. The importance of 
considering the human rights implications of climate change-related effects has been 
emphasized through a number of public statements, including a video message on the UN 
&#8220;Seal the Deal&#8221; campaign website and a contribution to the Climate Thinkers Blog on the 
COP15 host county website (http://en.cop15.dk/blogs/climate+thinkers+blog).  
</p>
<p><b> H. The right to development 
</b></p>
<p>35. The effective realization of the right to development is one of the OHCHR priorities. 
It provided substantive and analytical support to the open-ended Working Group on the 
Right to Development, including in the implementation of the 2008&#8211;2010 workplan of its 
expert mechanism, the High-level Task Force on the Implementation of the Right to 
Development. Regarding global partnerships for development identified in Millennium 
Development Goal 8, my Office commissioned independent studies in the areas of trade, 
access to essential medicines, debt relief and transfer of technology, and supported 
technical missions and expert consultations with relevant international entities. OHCHR 
continued to nurture and deepen the dialogue initiated with those institutions and 
partnerships with a view to mainstreaming the right to development in their policies and 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>36. Efforts were also made to strengthen the global partnership for development 
between Member States and other stakeholders. A number of activities were organized 
individually, or in partnership with these actors, including a panel discussion on the 
development and applicability of Human Rights Impact Assessments of trade agreements at 
the 2009 World Trade Organization Public Policy Forum; a parallel event to the sixty-
fourth session of the General Assembly which considered the linkages between human 
rights and financing for development, with a special focus on the right to development 
perspective; an interactive dialogue on the integration of a right-to-development perspective 
in the implementation of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 
Development Agenda; and an expert meeting on improved interaction between the 
universal periodic review and the African Peer Review Mechanism, with increased 
consideration of the right to development. OHCHR also facilitated active, open and multi-
stakeholder dialogue on the issues of poverty eradication and human rights through the 
organization of the 2009 Social Forum of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Human rights mainstreaming 
</b></p>
<p>37. At the request of the Secretary-General, throughout 2009 OHCHR led inter-agency 
consultations to develop a follow-up mechanism to the Action 2 inter-agency initiative to 
strengthening further efforts to mainstream human rights into United Nations operational 
activities for development. In November, the United Nations Development Group 
established a dedicated mechanism on human rights mainstreaming which will be chaired 
by my Office and will further strengthen system-wide coherence, collaboration and support 
for resident coordinators and United Nations country teams in mainstreaming human rights. 
Building upon the achievements of the Action 2 inter-agency programme, OHCHR will 
continue to institutionalize mainstreaming efforts and partnerships with United Nations 
agencies, including on thematic issues, and develop national capacities and follow-up to 
recommendations of United Nations human rights mechanisms at the request of States. </p>


<p>GE.09-17604 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>38. A fundamental component of Action 2 and its follow-up mechanism has been the 
placement, at the request of resident coordinators, of human rights advisers in all regions of 
the world. Eighteen advisers, mandated to support United Nations country teams to 
mainstream and integrate human rights into their programmes and activities have been 
provided by OHCHR. In addition to working with the country team, these advisers have 
provided technical assistance on human rights issues to Government ministries and national 
human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>39. Direct support was also provided during 2009 to several United Nations country 
teams, in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cambodia, China, Georgia, Indonesia, Serbia, the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Uruguay, to assist in integrating human rights into 
preparation of their United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks. OHCHR also 
cooperated with the United Nations System Staff College and the United Nations 
Development Operations Coordination Office to provide training and induction to newly 
appointed resident coordinators and agency country representatives. As a contribution to 
the ongoing United Nations reform efforts on system-wide coherence, in November 2009 
my Office convened a workshop during which &#8220;Delivering as One&#8221; pilot country teams 
shared experiences and identified good practices and lessons learned in mainstreaming 
human rights and supporting national efforts on human rights capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>40. OHCHR has paid increasing attention to supporting efforts to mainstream human 
rights into national policies, particularly in the context of country-led poverty reduction 
strategies and national Millennium Development Goals, in accordance with the Member 
States commitment at the 2005 World Summit. At the request of Governments, OHCHR 
supported country-level piloting efforts in Haiti and Liberia aimed at strengthening human 
rights perspectives in national development planning and monitoring process. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The work and cooperation of the Office of the High 
Commissioner at the country and regional levels 
</b>41. The approach of OHCHR to addressing human rights concerns is through a 
constructive dialogue with all relevant national counterparts, as well as through 
partnerships within the United Nations system and increasingly, with regional 
organizations. The work and cooperation of OHCHR with counterparts at the country level 
is multifaceted, conducted through human rights field presences, support for human rights 
mechanisms and dialogue between the High Commissioner and Member States, including 
through regular bilateral meetings, open or confidential communication, country visits by 
the High Commissioner, and technical cooperation programmes or rapid response 
operations. 
</p>
<p>42. In December 2009 OHCHR had 56 field presences: 12 regional presences,1 11
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Regional presences included the following: the OHCHR Regional Office for Southern Africa 
</p>
<p>(Pretoria, South Africa); the OHCHR Regional Office for East Africa (Addis Ababa); the OHCHR 
Regional Office for West Africa (Dakar); the United Nations Sub-Regional Centre for Human Rights 
and Democracy in Central Africa (Yaound&#233;); the OHCHR Regional Office for Southeast Asia 
(Bangkok); the OHCHR Regional Office for the Pacific (Suva); the OHCHR Regional Office for the 
Middle East (Beirut); the United Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for 
South-West Asia and the Arab Region (Doha); the OHCHR Regional Office for Europe (Brussels); 
the OHCHR Regional Office for Central Asia (Bishkek); the OHCHR Regional Office for Central 
America (Panama City) as well as the OHCHR Regional Office for South America (Santiago). </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.09-17604 
</p>
<p>offices at the country level,2 15 human rights components in United Nations peace 
missions,3 and 18 human rights advisers in United Nations country teams.4 The United 
Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the 
Arab Region in Doha was inaugurated in May 2009 and the Regional Office for Europe in 
Brussels, in October 2009. In September 2009 an agreement was signed with the 
Government of Mauritania on the establishment of an OHCHR country office. The renewal 
of agreements for existing offices is an encouraging sign and, in this context, I would like 
to thank the Governments of Uganda and Nepal for demonstrating their continued trust and 
cooperation through their renewed agreements. The establishment of an OHCHR Regional 
Office for North Africa remains under discussion.  
</p>
<p>43. Since the establishment of a rapid-response unit in 2006, the OHCHR capacity to act 
promptly on the ground in the face of deteriorating human rights situations has been 
steadily strengthened. It has continued to provide support to short-term missions and 
commissions of inquiries aimed at providing technical advice in the aftermath of crises, as 
well as for the implementation of resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council. 
Through its rapid response capacity, OHCHR deployed a human rights officer to Honduras 
to assist the United Nations Country Team to respond to the political crisis; two human 
rights officers to Madagascar in the context of the political crisis, and a team of four human 
rights officers to Gabon to monitor the human rights situation during the presidential 
electoral period. Following the violence of 28 September 2009 in Conakry, OHCHR 
supported the Commission of Inquiry on the events in Guinea, established by the Secretary-
General. 
</p>
<p>44. OHCHR also provided operational and technical support, including through the 
appointment of a secretariat, to the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict established by the President of the Human Rights Council on 3 April 2009 &#8220;to 
investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian 
law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations 
that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 
2009, whether before, during or after&#8221;.5 The final report of the mission was submitted to the 
Human Rights Council on 29 September 2009.  
</p>
<p>45. To reinforce national protection systems, OHCHR continued to support the 
establishment and strengthening of NHRIs, increasingly through engaging human rights 
field offices and United Nations country teams. The Office continued to advise requesting 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 OHCHR country offices are located in Togo, Uganda, Cambodia, Nepal, Bolivia, Colombia, 
</p>
<p>Guatemala and Mexico. In addition, OHCHR has a presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
and in Kosovo. An agreement was signed in September 2009 between the High Commissioner and 
the Government of Mauritania establishing a country office in Mauritania. This office will be 
operational in the course of 2010. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 OHCHR supported the Human Rights Components of the following peace missions: BINUB 
</p>
<p>(Burundi), BONUCA (Central African Republic), MINURCAT (Chad and the Central African 
Republic), MONUC (Democratic Republic of the Congo), UNMIS and UNAMID (Sudan), UNMIL 
(Liberia), UNIPSIL (Sierra Leone), UNPOS (Somalia), UNOCI (C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire), UNOGBIS (Guinea-
Bissau) UNAMA (Afghanistan), UNMIT (Timor-Leste), UNAMI (Iraq) and MINUSTAH (Haiti). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 Human rights advisers were posted or continued their work in the following countries: Burundi 
</p>
<p>(covering the Great Lakes region), Guinea, Niger, Kenya, Rwanda; Indonesia (until 31 January 2010), 
Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka; Ecuador, Nicaragua; Albania, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian 
Federation, Serbia, Georgia (covering the South Caucasus), Tajikistan, and the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia. This number also includes a human rights adviser within UNOWA (West 
Africa).

<p>ninth special session. </p>


<p>GE.09-17604 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>Member States on the establishment, functioning and responsibilities of NHRIs in line with 
international standards. OHCHR promoted NHRI compliance with the Paris Principles, and 
sought to strengthen the capacity of these institutions to address core protection issues such 
as discrimination, torture and violations committed in the context of migration, and to 
generally reinforce the administration of justice and the rule of law. In collaboration with 
United Nations partners and regional networks of NHRIs, OHCHR assisted in the 
establishment or strengthening of 43 NHRIs worldwide. Continued secretarial support was 
provided to the Sub-Committee on Accreditation of the International Coordinating 
Committee of NHRIs which, by December 2009, had reviewed and accredited 64 NHRIs 
with &#8220;A status&#8221;, that is, fully compliant with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>46. OHCHR continued to deepen its cooperation with regional organizations in Africa, 
the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and the Americas. OHCHR organized three regional 
consultations on enhancing cooperation between regional and international mechanisms for 
the promotion and protection of human rights in collaboration with the African Union, the 
Organization of American States and the Council of Europe. These consultations will 
ensure adequate planning for the international workshop on Regional Human Rights 
Mechanisms scheduled for May 2010, as called for in Council resolution 12/15, adopted on 
1 October 2009. 
</p>
<p>47. Reflective of the ongoing United Nations system reform process relating to peace 
missions, OHCHR maintained its focus on the integration of human rights in peace 
missions and continued to work in close cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations, the Department of Political Affairs and the Department of Field Support. 
OHCHR continued to provide substantive and human resources support to human rights 
components of peace missions, including substantive backstopping of human rights 
components and supporting the release of public human rights reports by peace missions.  
</p>
<p>48. OHCHR continued to participate in inter-agency humanitarian mechanisms, 
particularly the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and its subsidiary groups, and the Global 
Protection Cluster Working Group. OHCHR prioritized its operational role in humanitarian 
contexts, namely in empowering human rights field presences to fully participate &#8212; and 
sometimes to lead &#8212; in collaborative efforts. OHCHR currently plays a lead role in 
protection coordination in Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, Fiji (regional), Haiti, Iraq, 
Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, the occupied Palestinian territories, Samoa and Timor-Leste. OHCHR 
was also pleased to assist the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the 
development of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, launched in 
October 2009, the first regional body of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region. 
</p>
<p><b> V. The Durban Review Conference and its follow-up: steps 
towards implementation 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Durban Review Conference was held in Geneva from 20 to 24 April 2009 and 
its Outcome Document was adopted by consensus. A significant accomplishment of the 
Conference was its generation of renewed commitment by States to the anti-racism agenda. 
Taking a rights-based approach, which places the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination at the centre of international efforts to 
combat racism, the Outcome Document urges Member States to do more at the national 
level, and in particular, to elaborate national action plans on racism and intolerance. 
</p>
<p>50. In my report to the Durban Review Conference (A/CONF.211/PC.4/5), I addressed 
contemporary challenges to the fight against racism and critically assessed the strengths and 
shortcomings of the OHCHR anti-discrimination programme, as well as the Durban follow-
up intergovernmental and expert mechanisms. Proposals were put forward to help States </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.09-17604 
</p>
<p>overcome differences in the curtailment of freedom of speech to protect individuals and 
groups from hate speech, and provided a vision to take the struggle against racism, 
discrimination and intolerance forward. I observed that while some progress has been made 
since the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, new challenges to 
the principles of equality and non-discrimination have appeared. These include the 
convergence of the global food crisis and the economic and financial crisis and their 
disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable; the intensification of hate speech against 
racial, ethnic, religious minorities; extreme xenophobic reactions against migrants; the 
political exploitation of real and perceived differences; and some counter-terrorism 
measures. 
</p>
<p>51. Parallel to the Durban Review Conference, 44 side events were organized, 3 of 
which were initiatives of other United Nations entities. These events contributed 
substantively to the discussion of ways to combat racism and will be compiled in an 
OHCHR publication. 
</p>
<p>52. Following the Durban Review Conference, I established an in-house Task Force 
whose primary task is to advise me on the best strategy to implement the recommendations 
of both the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the Outcome Document 
effectively. The Task Force recommended the intensification of focus on: supporting post-
Durban mechanisms; the development of a database and policy tools for the Office; the 
development of a programme of capacity-building focusing on, among others issues, 
supporting Member States, at their request to create adequate anti-discrimination legislation 
and national action plans; and public sensitization and constituency mobilization. 
Additional resources will be required if the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
and the Outcome Document are to be fully implemented.  
</p>
<p>53. Following the Conference, OHCHR conducted a number of activities aimed at the 
implementation of the Durban recommendations. Continued support was given to the 
sessions of the intergovernmental working group and the Ad Hoc Committee for the 
elaboration of complementary standards. Seminars were also convened in francophone 
Africa and Latin America to train stakeholders on strategies for developing national action 
plans and promoting good practices.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Support for human rights treaties 
</b>54. The human rights treaty bodies have become increasingly effective, with their output 
having greater impact. The creation of a tenth treaty body established by the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance is imminent. In 
September 2009 the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights was opened to signature, and more than 30 States have signed this instrument. In 
December 2009, an open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group met to explore the 
possibility of elaborating an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
to provide a communications procedure complementary to the reporting procedure under 
the Convention.  
</p>
<p>55. The growth of the human rights treaty body system provides challenges to OHCHR, 
including in terms of the management of the workload of the treaty bodies and States 
Parties, and in relation to the coherence of the system. OHCHR will further harmonize its 
own working methods to ensure better support to the work of the treaty bodies. However, 
additional human and financial resources will be required to address this increasing 
workload and I encourage Member States to consider providing regular budget support in 
this respect. The treaty bodies have continued to harmonize their working methods, and 
their achievements include the adoption of reporting guidelines for a Common Core </p>


<p>GE.09-17604 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Document and revised harmonized treaty-specific reporting guidelines; streamlining 
approaches to the issue of reservations; the production of &#8220;lists of issues&#8221; by all treaty 
bodies; and the standardization of technical terminology. The Inter-Committee Meetings 
have been of pivotal importance. At its tenth meeting in December 2009, the Inter-
Committee Meeting recommended that it should meet annually in reduced membership, 
while at the same time establishing thematic working groups composed of one expert per 
treaty body to discuss specific matters of common concern directed to harmonization of 
working methods. In recent statements to the Human Rights Council and the General 
Assembly, I have called on all stakeholders to develop proposals which could lead to a 
more rational, coherent, coordinated and effective human rights treaty body system. Treaty 
body experts are best placed to initiate such proposals, which should achieve the required 
balance between the specificity of tasks and coherence of outcome.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. The High Commissioner&#8217;s Strategic Management Plan 2010&#8211;
2011 
</b>56. In January 2010, OHCHR&#8217;s third Strategic Management Plan (SMP), setting out the 
expected accomplishments and operational strategy for the 2010&#8211;2011 biennium, was 
launched. SMP is based on Programme 19 of the Secretary-General&#8217;s Strategic Framework. 
Reviewed and approved every two years by the General Assembly, the Strategic 
Framework establishes the goals and strategic priorities of the United Nations human rights 
programme, including OHCHR&#8217;s mandated tasks, and forms the basis of its request for 
regular budget resources. Complementing this approach, the SMP presents synchronized 
planning, implementation, and evaluation processes, providing OHCHR with the detailed 
operational plan and the management tool required to translate the Strategic Framework 
into action. In November and December 2009, OHCHR provided briefings for Member 
States in Geneva and New York, and civil society organizations, on the 2010&#8211;2011 SMP. 
</p>
<p>57. In an effort to sharpen our operational focus, the SMP identifies six substantive 
human rights priorities, which encompass the work carried out at Headquarters and in the 
field. These are: (a) countering discrimination, in particular racial discrimination, 
discrimination on the grounds of sex and against others who are marginalized; (b) pursuing 
economic, social and cultural rights and combating inequalities and poverty, including in 
the context of the economic, food and climate crises; (c) ensuring the realization of human 
rights in the context of migration; (d) combating impunity and strengthening accountability, 
the rule of law, and democratic societies; (e) protecting human rights in situations of armed 
conflict, violence and insecurity; and (f) strengthening international human rights 
mechanisms and the progressive development of international human rights law. Detailed 
strategies have been developed in respect of each of these priorities, taking into account 
OHCHR&#8217;s expertise, experience and capacity to add value to the work of the United 
Nations system as a whole.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion 
</b>58. <b>During 2009, OHCHR capitalized on the growth and consolidation of previous 
years. With the Human Rights Council and the universal periodic review in full 
operation, a dynamic system of support to special procedures and human rights treaty 
bodies in place, a high quality of expertise on substantive issues available in-house and 
the existence of a stronger field presence, the Office&#8217;s achievements are impressive.</b> 
</p>
<p>59. <b>The entry into force of several new international human rights treaties, 
resulting in the creation of new treaty bodies, as well as further developments in the </b></p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.09-17604 
</p>
<p><b>system of special procedures, have required a reconfiguration of our work. It is 
important we strengthen the treaty body system by accelerating the harmonization of 
their working methods and all stakeholders are encouraged to reflect on this topic. At 
the same time, additional capacity and regular budget resources will be required for 
OHCHR to ensure that new special procedures mandates can be supported and that 
additional mandated activities can be implemented effectively, without negatively 
affecting other mandated areas of work of the experts. In 2009 OHCHR produced a 
very large number of reports to the Human Rights Council and the General 
Assembly, which placed significant demands on both the Office and United Nations 
conference services. Efforts are being made to rationalize submissions required from 
OHCHR and to ensure that there is adequate support to the United Nations 
Secretariat for the effective functioning of the human rights machinery. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Looking forward to 2010, OHCHR will focus its attention on supporting the 
human rights mechanisms, in particular the Council as it begins to review its 
functioning. OHCHR will continue to draw strongly on its field presences in 
developing and implementing capacity-building tools for Member States, United 
Nations entities, civil society and other stakeholders. It will prioritize enhanced and 
coordinated follow-up to the recommendations of the universal periodic review, 
special procedures and treaty bodies, as well as greater coherence and coordination. 
Given the scale of discrimination worldwide, particularly against women, OHCHR 
will continue to strengthen its work to eliminate all forms of discrimination. Follow-up 
to and implementation of the recommendations of the Durban Review Conference will 
be important in this regard. All OHCHR work will take account of the impact of the 
food, economic and financial crises, and will be directed towards crafting strategies 
for ensuring continuing global respect for human rights in the face of these crises. The 
six thematic priorities for 2010&#8211;2011 will provide a context in which OHCHR efforts 
in these important areas will be sharpened and allow it to link the efforts of staff 
working in different divisions of OHCHR headquarters, in New York and in the field 
more effectively.</b>
