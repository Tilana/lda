<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council in its resolutions 7/20 and S-8/1 invited the seven thematic 
special procedures, including the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises, in addition to the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General for children and armed conflict, submitting the present 
report to make recommendations on how best to assist technically the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo in addressing the situation of human rights, with a view to obtaining tangible 
improvements on the ground, taking also into account the needs formulated by the Government. 
The Council also underlined the need to urgently examine the current human rights situation in 
the east of the country, in particular as it regards violence against women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> The seven thematic special procedures find that the general human rights situation in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo remains a cause of serious concern and has further 
deteriorated since the adoption of resolution 7/20 by the Council. In the east of the country in 
particular, systematic and gross violations of the human rights of civilians and grave breaches of 
international humanitarian law are taking place. The authors specifically highlight concerns 
relating to forced and arbitrary displacement, the effect of the humanitarian crisis on economic, 
social and cultural rights, violence against women and girls, the situation of human rights 
defenders and the impact of armed conflict on children in the eastern Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. Impunity, the existence of non-state armed actors, the present state of the security and 
justice sectors, the illegal exploitation of natural resources, the political instrumentalization of 
ethnic cleavages and the lack of equality between men and women are identified as root causes 
of human rights concerns. 
</p>
<p> Based on their assessment of the situation, the seven thematic special procedures formulate 
eight priority objectives and identify technical assistance needs in this regard: 
</p><p> 1. Fighting impunity and strengthening the law enforcement and justice sectors; 
 2. Reforming the security sector; 
</p>
<p>3. Preventing the (re-)recruitment of children by armed groups and socially 
reintegrating children associated with armed groups; 
</p>
<p> 4. Protecting women&#8217;s rights and ensuring gender equality; 
</p>
<p> 5. Addressing economic root causes of human rights violations; 
</p>
<p> 6. Protecting the rights of the displaced and minorities; 
</p>
<p> 7. Providing access to health care, especially for marginalized groups; 
</p>
<p> 8. Strengthening state and civil society structures to protect and promote human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> The seven thematic special procedures urge the Council to continue taking a leadership 
role to ensure that the human rights dimension of the peacebuilding process in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo is duly addressed. They recommend that the Council establish, based on 
resolution 9/9, a special procedure mechanism on the human rights situation in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, in particular areas affected or threatened by armed conflict. The authors 
also recommend that benchmarks to measure human rights progress in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo be developed by the United Nations, in consultation with the Government, civil 
society and donors. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted on behalf of the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, in addition to the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for children and armed conflict in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolutions 7/20 and S-8/1. 
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 7/20, the Human Rights Council invited the above-mentioned thematic 
special procedures to make recommendations, within their respective mandates, on how best to 
assist technically the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in addressing the situation of 
human rights, with a view to obtaining tangible improvements on the ground, taking also into 
account the needs formulated by the Government. 
</p>
<p>3. In resolution S-8/1, the Council invited the same thematic special procedures to also 
urgently examine the current situation in the east of the country with the view to providing a 
comprehensive report to the Council at its tenth session. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report, after describing the working methods of the seven authors, establishes 
a baseline assessment of the human rights situation, in particular the requested urgent 
examination of the situation the east of the country. On this basis, the report sets out detailed 
recommendations on how to best technically assist the Government with a view to achieving 
tangible improvements of the human rights situation on the ground.  
</p>
<p>5. The seven thematic special procedures would like to thank the Council for the trust 
extended in assigning them this mandate. They would also like to thank the Office of the High 
Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR), which served as the Secretariat of their group.  
</p>
<p>6. The authors express their gratitude to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, in particular the Minister of Human Rights, for the good cooperation extended and note 
with appreciation the openness of the Government to continuing a dialogue with the special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council and to inviting country visits of mandate holders, in 
particular the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions. 
</p>
<p><b>I. STEPS TAKEN BY THE SEVEN THEMATIC SPECIAL 
PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p>7. In compiling this report, the seven thematic special procedures were able to draw on 
first-hand information gathered during official fact-finding visits of the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict (March 2007), the Special Rapporteur on </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the independence of judges and lawyers (April 2007), the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences (July 2007) and the Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the human rights of internally displaced persons (February 2008). 
</p>
<p>8. In addition, the authors have relied on detailed reports provided by United Nations 
agencies, the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(MONUC) and Congolese and international non-governmental organizations (NGO). The 
thematic special procedures would like to express their sincere gratitude to the organizations and 
individuals that took the time and initiative to convey information.  
</p>
<p>9. On 22 September 2008, the seven thematic special procedures shared a comprehensive 
seven-page questionnaire with the Government in order to provide it with the opportunity to 
communicate relevant information and formulate needs. A response was received on 
23 January 2009, shortly before this report is finalized. Pertinent information provided has been 
incorporated into this report. 
</p>
<p>10. In the spirit of cooperation, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons who had been appointed as rapporteur of the group carried 
out a visit to the DRC from 17 to 23 January 2009 on behalf of the group of seven thematic 
special procedures. Visiting at the invitation of the Government, he held meetings in Kinshasa 
with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Human Rights, the Minister of Gender, Women and 
Children&#8217;s Affairs, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Mining, and the President of the 
Senate. In addition, the Representative visited Goma (North Kivu), where he held meetings with 
provincial authorities, United Nations officials and NGOs. He also met with internally displaced 
persons and women survivors of sexual violence. On 22 January, the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women held further consultations with the Ministers of Gender and Human 
Rights in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>11. The full text of this report was shared with the Government of the DRC with the invitation 
to providing comments prior to its publication.  
</p>
<p>12. The authors regret that several other thematic mandate holders relevant for the human 
rights situation in the DRC were not invited to participate in the group. They welcome the 
commitment of the President of the Council to making the participation of special procedures in 
special sessions of the Council routine and hope that mandate holders will also have an 
opportunity to be consulted on the outcomes of the special sessions, particularly when action by 
special procedures mandate holders is being considered.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has ratified most of the principal human rights 
instruments at the international and regional levels, although is not yet a party to the African 
Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the Protocol to the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa or the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. In addition, the DRC ratified the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 
and their two Additional Protocols of 1977. It is also a party to the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, and the authors note that it has cooperated with the Court on a 
number of cases.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. The institutional structure to promote and protect human rights remains weak. The DRC 
lacks an independent national human rights institution. The National Human Rights Monitoring 
Centre, which existed under the Transitional Constitution has been abolished and has yet to be 
replaced. When this report was finalized, a bill to establish a new National Human Rights 
Commission had been approved by the Senate, but was still under consideration by the National 
Assembly. 
</p>
<p>15. At the executive branch level, in October 2008, the Government restored the status of the 
Ministry of Human Rights as a separate ministry. However, its effectiveness is limited due to an 
insufficient allocation of resources, in particular field presences in the various provinces.  
</p>
<p>16. On the non-governmental level, there are many individuals and organizations committed to 
actively defending human rights, although a number of Government authorities, and society at 
large, often fail to appreciate the legitimacy and importance of their work.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  General human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>17. The most recent reports of the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the DRC<b>1</b> and numerous non-governmental reports reviewed by the authors reaffirm 
that the overall human rights situation in the DRC remains a cause of serious concern. 
</p>
<p>18. Despite the successful conclusion of the electoral process and the transition to an elected 
Government, serious violations of civil and political rights continue to take place. Members of 
the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) and the National Congolese Police (PNC) continue to 
be responsible for serious human rights violations, including summary executions, rape, torture 
and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Members of the national intelligence services, both 
civil and military, have been implicated in politically motivated human rights violations, mainly 
arbitrary arrests, detention at undisclosed locations and torture and extortion. United Nations 
human rights monitors generally do not have access to detention facilities of the National 
Intelligence Agency (ANR), the Special Police (<i>Kin Mazi&#232;re</i>), the Republican Guard (GR) and 
military intelligence.  
</p>
<p>19. The national security forces and armed groups, as well as political, judicial and 
administrative officials, targeted journalists and human rights defenders, who were stigmatized 
as political opponents and subjected to threats, arbitrary arrest, detention and other forms of 
ill-treatment.<b>2</b> Human rights defenders most at risk include women defenders and defenders 
fighting impunity for the most serious crimes (especially defenders supporting the work of the 
International Criminal Court). Defenders advocating for economic, social and cultural rights also 
face serious risks, in particular if they denounce the damaging effects of the illegal mining and

<p>logging activities of private actors or corruption cases. Finally, human rights defenders encounter 
illegitimate restrictions of the exercise of their rights to freedom of opinion and expression, 
peaceful assembly and association that are not in line with international obligations or the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>20. While the country has a wealth of natural resources and arable land, little progress has been 
made to ensure the enjoyment of economic and social rights, such as the right of everyone to the 
highest attainable standard of health or to education, including free primary education, by the 
large majority of Congolese. The disastrous impact of more than a decade of armed conflicts and 
the burden of the external debt as well as bad governance and pervasive corruption in the public 
and private sectors are among the root causes of this situation. The health system is in a dire state 
and, due to user fees, not accessible to the poorest sectors of society, which results in maternal 
and infant mortality rates that are among the highest in the world. This sector requires the 
sustained support of the international community. The global food price crisis further compounds 
the grave situation. The high rates of severe malnutrition among groups in a vulnerable situation, 
especially the poor, women and children, have made them more susceptible to infectious 
diseases. A particular challenge, also affecting human rights, is the drastic fall in world market 
prices for certain minerals mined in the DRC, which presently affects employment and 
livelihood options for hundreds of thousands in resource-rich provinces such as Katanga. The 
BaTwa (often referred to as &#8220;Pygmies&#8221;) and other forest dependent peoples remain totally 
marginalized. 
</p>
<p>21. Violence against women, rooted in serious gender inequality, is pervasive and an issue of 
particular concern. During her official visit to the DRC in July 2007, the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women noted that women living in areas of conflict continue suffering extreme 
levels of sexual violence, committed by FARDC, PNC, armed groups and increasingly also 
civilians.<b>3</b> Perhaps even more worrying, violence against women remains rampant throughout the 
country even where war has ended.<b>4</b> In Equateur Province for example, PNC and FARDC have 
carried out systematic reprisals against civilians, including mass rape, but most perpetrators 
enjoy impunity. Women survivors of rape have suffered severe physical and psychological 
injuries, but lack sufficient care. Survivors are often socially stigmatized and live in extreme 
poverty.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Review of the human rights situation in the east 
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>22. Those of the seven thematic special procedures, who carried out individual fact-finding 
visits in 2007 and early 2008, all concluded that the situation in the areas affected or threatened 
by armed conflict was particularly grave. Since the outbreak of major hostilities in August and 
September 2008, the situation in the east of the DRC, in particular the Kivus and Province 
Orientale, has further deteriorated. Systematic and gross violations of the human rights of 
civilians and grave breaches of international humanitarian law are taking place.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Forced and arbitrary displacement, including  
due to targeted attacks on civilians 
</b></p>
<p>23. Following his visit in February 2008, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
human rights of internally displaced persons concluded that the east of the DRC had been 
experiencing a situation involving a serious protection and humanitarian crisis, highlighted 
inter alia by the very large numbers of displaced persons.<b>5</b> Information received during the 
course of his visit in January 2009 indicates that the situation has further worsened. In 
December 2008, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimated that 
a total of 1,373,169 Congolese had been displaced in the East. The vast majority have been 
internally displaced - often more than once - while considerable numbers have sought refuge in 
neighbouring countries<b>.</b> In most cases, people have been forced to leave their homes owing to 
clashes between the Congolese armed forces and non-state armed groups or clashes between the 
different armed groups. The widespread insecurity and violence as well as human rights 
violations committed against civilians both by the armed groups and by members of the national 
security forces have also forced many Congolese to flee.  
</p>
<p>24. In early December 2008, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) indicated an estimated 250,000 new cases of displacements in the Kivus 
region as a result of the fighting that began at the end of August 2008 between the rebel group 
<i>Congres National pour la D&#233;fense du Peuple</i> (CNDP) on the one hand and FARDC, PARECO 
(<i>Patriotes r&#233;sistants congolais</i>) and Mayi-Mayi militia forces on the other hand.<b>6</b> The 
displacement has been exacerbated by deliberate attacks on the civilian population. The thematic 
special procedures are particularly concerned about summary executions of civilians suspected to 
be collaborating with the enemy, including the organized massacre of at least 64 persons (mainly 
young men) in Kiwanja by CNDP fighters on 5 November 2008.<b>7</b> The CNDP also appears to 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  See A/HRC/8/6/Add.3. 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  The CNDP is a non-state armed group, which purports to protect the Tutsi and Banyamulenge 
</p>
<p>minority populations in the East of the DRC, in particular against the <i>Forces D&#233;mocratique pour 
la Liberation de Rwanda</i> (FDLR). Among its leaders are Bosco Ntaganda, who has been 
indicted by the ICC for .war crimes, and Laurent Nkunda, who was reportedly arrested 
on 23 January 2009 in Rwanda. 
</p>
<p> The FDLR is a non-state armed group based in the DRC, which is composed mainly of 
Congolese nationals but also a number of Rwandan Hutus implicated in the 1994 genocide in 
Rwanda.  
</p>
<p> PARECO is a non-state armed group, made up of Congolese of Hutu ethnicity and other 
ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p> The term Mayi-Mayi refers to various local militia forces without a centralized leadership, 
who purport to resist foreign interference in the eastern DRC.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>have adopted a policy of forcing internally displaced persons (IDPs) to return to their places of 
origin, despite the lack of security, and is reported to have confiscated and redistributed land left 
behind by displaced persons. In early November 2008, CNDP had several IDP camps in the 
Rutshuru area forcibly emptied, looted and dismantled. Reports indicate a sharp increase in cases 
of sexual violence, summary executions and forced labour committed by all sides in the entire 
Kivus region as well as recruitment of child soldiers by armed groups.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Another 135,000 persons have been forcibly displaced in Irumu, Province Orientale 
(Ituri district), owing to fighting initiated in September and October 2008 by rebels of the <i>Front 
Populaire pour la Justice au Congo </i>(FPJC), a new multi-ethnic rebel movement composed 
largely of demobilized militia fighters and the remnants of other militia groups.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>26. In mid-December 2008, the Congolese, Ugandan and Southern Sudanese armed forces 
launched a joint military offensive in Province Orientale against the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army 
(LRA), following a series of LRA attacks against the civilian population in at least 10 locations 
north of Dungu in September and October 2008.<b>10</b> LRA fighters retreating from the offensive 
carried out new atrocities. By mid-January 2009, over 530 killings, more than 400 abductions 
and numerous rapes by the LRA had been reported. When this report was finalized, an 
estimated 100,000 persons were displaced as a consequence of this violence. 
</p>
<p>27. On 16 January 2009, the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Rwanda and CNDP announced an alliance (the next day joined by PARECO) and declared their 
intention to carry out military operations against FDLR in North and South Kivu. Military 
operations involving FARDC, Rwandan troops and CNDP began several days thereafter. While 
the thematic special procedures welcome political rapprochement between both countries and 
encourage further dialogue, they remain concerned that the military operations, particularly when 
conducted jointly with armed groups like CNDP, lead to violent reprisals against the civilian 
population and a grave humanitarian crisis involving another wave of massive displacement. In 
late January and February 2009, following the launch of the Congolese-Rwandan operations 
against the FDLR, United Nations human rights officers documented several cases of FDLR 
fighters gang raping women and arbitrarily executing civilians. By mid-February, the population 
of more than 20 villages in Masisi and Walikale territories had reportedly fled their 
villages. 3,000 persons had sought refuge in Remeka village (Masisi Territory) alone. 
</p>
<p>28. FARDC has been often unable to protect the civilian population. In numerous cases, 
including at the end of October 2008 in Goma and in mid-November 2008 in the Kanyabayonga 
area, fleeing FARDC soldiers have themselves pillaged civilian settlements, in some cases 
committing atrocities in the process. In violation of international humanitarian law, FARDC has 
also used civilian IDP populations in Kibati and Tongo to shield military operations.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>29. MONUC has deployed troops in a number of high risk areas and, on some occasions it has 
also conducted military operations with the goal to protect the civilian population, including to 
halt the advance of CNDP on Goma at the end of October 2008.<b>11</b> A number of outside observers 
are concerned that MONUC does not have the troop strength and civilian capacity to effectively 
implement its civilian protection responsibility under its expanded Security Council mandate and 
often fails to prioritize the civilian protection aspect of its mandate. Several interlocutors also 
indicated that MONUC should make publicly available the information on human rights 
violations at its disposal in a much more timely fashion. Since 2006, a protection cluster led by 
UNHCR and co-chaired by MONUC has been set up, which has helped draw more attention to 
abuses by armed groups and the state security forces. Its performance in some regions has been 
criticized, not least due to the absence of key actors and shortage of protection staff. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Humanitarian crisis affecting economic, social and  
cultural rights, including the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>30. The displaced population in eastern DRC, as well as those who stay trapped in conflict 
areas, face a dire humanitarian situation often lacking basic food, potable water, shelter or basic 
hygiene and healthcare facilities or basic education. Schools and health posts have been 
destroyed or become non-functional because staff has been displaced. Many IDPs have lost all 
their belongings in the course of repeated displacement or due to pillaging, which further reduces 
their capacity for survival. An estimated two thirds of population displaced in North Kivu and up 
to 97 per cent in other provinces have been taken in by host families in keeping with African 
traditions of hospitality. Despite the fact that the capacities of host communities are often 
overstretched due to the increasing number of IDPs and the length of their stay, they receive very 
little humanitarian assistance.<b>12</b> The remaining IDPs are sheltered in recognized IDP camps or 
have sought protection around MONUC bases or other ad hoc sites. Their living conditions often 
fall short of the minimum humanitarian standards recognized by the international community.  
</p>
<p>31. IDP women met by the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of 
internally displaced persons in camps around Goma highlighted the rape of IDP women 
collecting firewood or water as a primary concern. The proximity of FARDC positions to IDP 
camps, notably the Kibati and Mugunga Camps, undermines the civilian character of the camps 
and exacerbates general insecurity.  
</p>
<p>32. While humanitarian organizations are present in the camps, a large percentage of the 
population is cut off from the humanitarian aid necessary to secure its survival. Despite efforts 
by humanitarian actors to negotiate safe access with conflict parties and MONUC efforts to 
secure humanitarian corridors, humanitarian workers continue to be obstructed and often 
attacked by armed actors from all sides. Logistical difficulties further limit humanitarian access.  
</p>
<p>33. The massive displacement in the east has further affected the health status and access to 
health care of an already highly fragile population. The situation in the Kivus region requires the

<p>immediate action of the international community to curtail the ever rising mortality rate. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 10,000 cholera cases were 
reported between January and November 2008. Even though WHO, M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res 
(MSF), International Medical Corps (IMC) and others have provided medical support to local 
doctors and humanitarian agencies, the epidemic persists.  
</p>
<p>34. The widespread looting of health clinics and the arbitrary obstruction of humanitarian 
convoys intended to replenish medical supplies have aggravated the situation. Dramatic 
fluctuations in population centres due to internal displacement have placed great demands on an 
already weak health system in the eastern region of the DRC, requiring the rapid increase in 
medical capacity. Moreover, Congolese medical workers have been forced to flee, further 
straining the medical capacity in the region. The conflict has caused the collapse of the health 
system, which has limited the distribution of essential vaccines needed for the control of 
diseases.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Violence against women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>35. Sexual violence has been a defining feature of the armed conflicts in the DRC and conflict 
parties have not assumed their responsibilities reaffirmed also by Security Council resolutions 
1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women, peace and security. During her visit in July 2007, the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women found that sexual violence against women was 
particularly dramatic in the Kivus, where non-state armed groups, including foreign militia, 
committed sexual atrocities that were of an unimaginable brutality and aimed at the complete 
physical and psychological destruction of women with implications for the entire society.<b>13</b> The 
Special Rapporteur also documented how women were targeted in the local armed conflict in the 
Ituri District (Province Orientale) and how sexual violence had continued at alarming levels 
despite improvements in the overall security level.<b>14</b> In both areas, the Special Rapporteur 
documented cases of violence against women committed by FARDC members, including rapes 
committed as part of collective reprisals against the civilian population and individual rapes 
perpetrated by commanding officers.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur has continued to receive disturbing reports about a new wave of 
sexual violence against women as well as attacks on women human rights defenders in the 
eastern region, especially in North Kivu. During the regional consultations on violence against 
women in the context of conflict in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa Region, held in Nairobi 
from 3 to 5 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to get first-hand 
information from local Congolese women groups who sounded the alarm that the situation in the 
Kivus and Province Orientale had further deteriorated.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>37. Both the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict have found that while many perpetrators of 
sexual violence are armed actors (FARDC, PNC, and armed groups), a significant and increasing 
number are also civilians not only in zones affected by the conflict but also in other parts of the 
country.<b>16</b> This is explained by the climate of impunity, absence of rule of law and the 
normalization of violence as an additional aspect of women&#8217;s oppression.  
</p>
<p>38. It is also alarming that a significant percentage of the victims are girl-children (and in some 
cases also boys). From June 2007 to the end of June 2008 in Ituri, out of 6,766 cases reported 
and assisted by partners of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), 2,893 were children 
(43 per cent): 2,516 girls and 377 boys. In cases of child rape, 42 per cent of the perpetrators 
were members of the security forces or armed groups and 58 per cent were civilians. In the same 
period in North Kivu, UNICEF partners assisted 4,770 cases of sexual violence, of which 
approximately 38 per cent were against girl-children. For cases of rape of children, 70 per cent of 
the perpetrators were members of the security forces or armed groups and 30 per cent of the 
perpetrators were civilians. In South Kivu, out of 6,242 cases of sexual violence reported and 
assisted by UNICEF partners.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The consequences of violence against women and girls are devastating. Since most rapes 
are collective, carried out with an extraordinary brutality and often accompanied by additional 
atrocities, women and girls often die as a result of the violence. Survivors often suffer vaginal 
fistula (a hole torn between vagina and rectum or vagina and bladder), lose their reproductive 
capacity or are infected with HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.<b>18</b> In view of the 
massive level of reported sexual violence, and of the clear link between mass rapes and the 
transmission of HIV/AIDS, it is particularly important that health services be affordable and 
accessible to those living with the disease. Furthermore, health personnel should assist in the 
collection of evidence to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice and held 
accountable for their actions. The fact that survivors of rape have to pay a fee they often cannot 
afford for the forensic medical evidence certificate needed to open criminal investigations and 
the inconsistent use of a standardized certificate obstructs access to justice and thus contributes 
to impunity.  
</p>
<p>40. Survivors of sexual violence often end up destitute and struggle for their mere survival,<b>19</b> 
because they will often be rejected by their own husbands, families and communities and loose 
their social support networks. Under Congolese law, criminal courts can order perpetrators of 
crimes, including the State, to pay compensation to victims. The Congolese State has been 
sentenced to pay compensation to a number of women raped by State agents. However, none of

</p>
<p>these women ever managed to receive actual compensation payments from the State.<b>20</b> 
International actors providing assistance to survivors of rape often neglect the need to support 
the socio-economic reintegration of women.  
</p>
<p>41. On 20 July 2006, the Government adopted a Law on Sexual Violence, which introduced 
major improvements to the Congolese Penal Code and the Code of Penal Procedure.<b>21</b> The Law 
has been disseminated through a number of advocacy campaigns, including a national campaign 
against rape launched by the First Lady of the Republic in November 2007. These important 
initiatives have yet to lead to real changes on the ground, since they are being undermined by 
widespread impunity for sexual violence and other atrocities.  
</p>
<p>42. In June 2008, the Ministry of Justice adopted a roadmap against impunity for sexual 
violence identifying useful and practical priority actions.<b>22</b> In addition, the Sub-Group on Sexual 
Violence, presided by the Minister of Gender, Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs, is in the process 
of finalizing an action plan on sexual violence. It is positive that donors, such as the 
Governments of Belgium and Canada, but also many others, prioritize violence against women 
in their support strategies. In this regard, the coordination of initiatives and the streamlining of 
referral pathways for victims need to be addressed. Building on existing initiatives by the 
Government, the United Nations and civil society, the United Nations system in the DRC is in 
the process of formulating a comprehensive strategy to address sexual violence focusing on four 
interconnected strategic areas: combating impunity; protection and prevention; security sector 
reform; and multi-sectoral response for survivors. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>43. Human rights defenders engaged in denouncing serious violations of human rights, grave 
breaches of international humanitarian law and rampant impunity in the eastern part of the DRC 
are subject to threats and attacks by all parties to the conflict. They face stigmatization and are 
often accused of collusion with a party to the conflict. Women defenders are at particular risk, 
and several cases of rape of women defenders were reported to the thematic special procedures. 
</p>
<p>44. Despite the opening in November 2008 of a humanitarian corridor allowing aid workers 
and MONUC staff to better circulate in the Kivus region, human rights defenders remain 
vulnerable to attacks and their activities continue to be seriously impeded.  
</p>
<p>45. Human rights defenders based in Goma are reportedly scared to operate because of the 
presence of CNDP elements in town. They fear reprisals for their legitimate activities.  
</p>
<p>46. Human rights defenders based in Rutshuru territory, controlled for the most part by CNDP, 
are reportedly particularly affected. They have notably been active in reporting on the Kiwanja 
massacre and providing medical and psychological assistance to rape victims. According to 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20

</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  Ibid., para. 66.  
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  See S/2008/728, paras. 35 and 36.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reports, at least 25 defenders fled the CNDP offensive and are now living as internally displaced 
persons in North Kivu or asylum-seekers in Uganda. Others are reportedly in hiding in the 
Rutshuru area. They all fear to return. Some of these defenders suffered human rights abuses 
during their flight, and some of their relatives were reportedly executed or abducted because of 
their human rights activities.  
</p>
<p>47. In July 2008, in Kitshanga, Masisi territory, human rights defenders providing medical 
care and rehabilitation of torture and rape victims were accused by CNDP leaders of informing 
the international community on the incidence of rape in their area of control. These leaders 
further attempted to take away confidential medical registers.  
</p>
<p>48. In the Province Orientale, church workers who denounced violations committed by 
LRA troops and sheltered the civilian population were assaulted in the Dungu-Doruma area. 
</p>
<p>49. Following the resumption of fighting in North Kivu and the Province Orientale in 
October 2008, student demonstrations, reportedly instigated by local authorities, took place in 
several cities against the MONUC. Human rights defenders who denounced the manipulation of 
students by local authorities in Kisangani were accused of being &#8220;anti-patriotic&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>50. In South Kivu, a draft bill on the protection of human rights defenders was introduced into 
the Provincial Parliament by Deputy Ngongo and will be examined by the relevant committee of 
the legislative chamber in the course of the next months. With European Union funds, 
MONUC has also operated a protection programme for witnesses and human rights defenders 
in 11 provinces, mainly in the east of the country. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, having received an 
invitation from the Government to carry out a fact-finding mission, expects to undertake such a 
mission in 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>52. Information, verified through the country Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting in the 
framework of Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), showed a general decrease in the number 
of allegations of grave violations against children from June 2007 to September 2008 in the 
DRC.<b>23</b> However, children remained highly vulnerable in areas of ongoing conflict such as Ituri 
and the Kivus. Any modest protection gains that may have been registered through 2007-2008 
are now being obliterated as a result of the renewal of hostilities in the east of the DRC. 
</p>
<p>53. All the parties to the conflict are committing grave violations against children such as the 
killing and maiming of children and as mentioned, rape and other grave sexual violence. 
Perpetrators include armed elements of the remaining Mayi Mayi groups, CNDP, FLDR, LRA, 
and other armed elements, as well as members of the Congolese security forces.<b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>23
</b>  See S/2008/693.  
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  Ibid., para. 16.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>54. In addition, child protection actors indicate that there has been an explosion of child 
recruitment by non-state armed groups in recent months. On the basis of documented cases of 
children released in the past year, Mayi Mayi groups account for the highest number of children 
in their ranks, followed by CNDP. Although FARDC have received orders on 12 May 2005 not 
to recruit children and reportedly have stopped doing so, documented cases show that children 
are still present, especially in the non-integrated brigades as a result of the <i>mixage</i> process in 
early 2007.<b>25</b> Reports indicate that parents in conflict areas often prevent their children from 
going to school (where schools function again), because they fear that armed groups will forcibly 
recruit their children. 
</p>
<p>55. The regional and cross-border dimensions of the conflict also carry significant implications 
for children. This includes attacks by groups such as LRA, the recruitment of children from 
neighbouring countries, and the issue of repatriating children demobilized from fighting groups 
in the DRC to their countries of origin.  
</p>
<p>56. On 10 January 2009, the President of the Republic signed the Law on the Protection of the 
Child, which among other things reaffirms that the recruitment of children for use in armed 
conflict is prohibited and constitutes one of the worst forms of child labour. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Root causes of human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p>57. The unresolved conflicts with their multitude of actors, resulting in the repeated 
resumption of hostilities and violence, and the absence of a process leading to sustainable peace 
are the main causes of human rights violations in the east of the country. There, as well as in the 
rest of the DRC, state institutions necessary to protect and fulfil the human rights of the 
population too often lack the capacity to do so or, as in most rural areas, are totally absent. Many 
governmental actors feel no real commitment to address the human rights challenges affecting 
the country and act accordingly, or are unaware that human rights violations may not only result 
from acts but also omissions, including an unwillingness to investigate, prosecute and punish, to 
protect the civilian population in zones of armed conflict, or to provide basic goods and services 
necessary for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>58. On a more immediate level, the seven thematic special procedures have identified several 
causes of the identified human rights violations, some of which have already been highlighted by 
the Council in resolution S-8/1.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Impunity and the state of the justice and penitentiary systems 
</b>59. The Council in resolution S-8/1 rightfully emphasized the importance of bringing all 
perpetrators to justice since the problem of impunity in the country, in particular in light of the 
serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law in the 
eastern part, is one of the root causes for the continuing deterioration of the situation. Another 
dimension of impunity has been a reported growth in lynching and other illegal acts of vigilante 
justice, which further undermines the rule of law.  
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  Ibid., para. 21.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>60. The Government has cooperated with the International Criminal Court on a number of 
cases. However, operating on their own without international involvement, Congolese authorities 
often prove reluctant to investigate and prosecute military, law enforcement and intelligence 
personnel who perpetrate or bear command responsibility for serious human rights violations.<b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>61. Political interference at all stages of the criminal process is very common. There have also 
been numerous incidents, especially in the east of the DRC, in which military and civilian judges 
and prosecutors were threatened and attacked by armed group members and sometimes even 
members of the armed force to intimidate them, disrupt criminal proceedings and ensure 
impunity. Extremely low salaries in the justice, law enforcement and penitentiary sectors also 
provide numerous entry points for corruption at all levels. The special procedures welcome that 
the President of the Republic, in his second address on the state of the nation of 14 December 
2008 acknowledged the problem of interference in the judicial process and emphasized that such 
interference must not happen and violators will be pursued. 
</p>
<p>62. The impunity problem is also rooted in the capacity of the justice system. Deprived of an 
adequate budget, the justice system remains in a deplorable state and lacks the capacity to handle 
its caseload. The access of the population to justice is extremely limited, not only because of 
high rates of poverty, but also by the utterly insufficient number of judges, magistrates and 
tribunals and their lack of geographic coverage in the East and remote areas generally. In 
January 2008, the Ministry of Justice put forward a Plan of Action for Justice Reform in the 
DRC, focusing among other things on recruitment, training and infrastructure. The tenets of the 
Plan still needed to be approved by the Mixed Committee on Justice Reform Follow-up when 
this report was finalized. 
</p>
<p>63. The disastrous state of the prison system, perhaps the weakest link in the justice chain, 
facilitates escapes of suspects and convicts, including high profile offenders who sometimes 
&#8220;escape&#8221; with the connivance of the authorities. For this reason, but also in light of the generally 
appalling prison conditions, characterized by serious overcrowding, a lack of basic health care, 
and starvation due to the virtual absence of a budget to provide to detainees without family 
support, penitentiary reform is an absolute necessity.<b>27</b> The implementation of a new Strategic 
Plan on Prison Reform and Training, developed by the Ministry of Justice and MONUC, should 
therefore be a priority for the Government and its technical assistance partners.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>64. The new Constitution, in force since 18 February 2006, sets out a good foundation to 
reform the justice sector and establish the rule of law. In August 2008, the President signed a law 
creating the Higher Judicial Council, which is a very important step forward. It is crucial that this 
new Higher Judicial Council be actively involved in the judicial reform process and that it is 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>26
</b>  There are exceptions. In Goma, for instance, FARDC set up an ad hoc Operational Military 
</p>
<p>Court in November 2008. Based on quick trials with uncertain due process guarantees, the Court 
had convicted 18 soldiers, 4 of whom received death sentences, when this report was finalized. 
<b>27
</b></p>
<p>  See A/HRC/7/6/Add.4, paras. 80-85, and A/HRC/4/7, para. 37.  
<b>28
</b></p>
<p>  S/2008/728, para. 38.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>provided with the budget and freedom from political interference to carry out its functions. 
Moreover, the judicial architecture demanded by the Constitution has to be completed. The 
adoption of legislation to establish the Constitutional Court, Court of Cassation and the Council 
State was still pending when this report was finalized.  
</p>
<p>65. While several constitutional rights have been incorporated in the pertinent domestic laws, 
important constitutional provisions still lack implementation at the legislative level. For instance, 
the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of military courts to offences committed by members of 
the armed forces and the national police. However, this important constitutional provision has 
not yet been incorporated into the Military Judicial Code, which provides the military justice 
system with jurisdiction over civilians in a number of constellations. 
</p><p>66. Positively, a draft law to implement the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 
has been placed on the agenda of the National Assembly, which would (among other things) 
transfer jurisdiction over all acts amounting to international crimes to civilian courts, even if the 
perpetrators are members of the military or police. 
</p>
<p>67. Issues of justice and accountability in relation to the massive human rights violations 
committed during the armed conflicts between 1993 and 2003 have hardly been addressed in the 
Global and Inclusive Agreement on the Transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of 
2002 and subsequent peace initiatives such as the Conference on peace, stability and 
development in North and South Kivu held in Goma in January 2008. The United Nations is 
currently mapping the major human rights violations committed between 1993 and 2003; this 
will provide a basis of knowledge on which appropriate transitional justice mechanisms can be 
built. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Role of non-state armed groups and condition of the state security sector 
</b></p>
<p>68. In paragraph 9 (a) of its resolution S-8/1, the Council identified the establishment of militia 
as a root cause of the conflict and the basis of human rights violations and the humanitarian crisis 
in the region. As indicated above, non-state armed groups are responsible for many of the worst 
atrocities committed in the eastern part of the country. To some extent, these groups manipulate 
local grievances over land to recruit fighters from the destitute population, while using the illegal 
exploitation of natural resources to sustain themselves (see paragraphs 73 to 77 below). 
Insufficient reintegration support from earlier disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 
processes also make it easy for armed groups to re-recruit former fighters, including former child 
combatants. 
</p>
<p>69. However, armed non-state groups also receive governmental support, which sustains their 
existence and is a cause of particular concern. In its final report of December 2008, the Group of 
Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo appointed by the Sanctions Committee of the 
Security Council put forward evidence that FARDC collaborated with FDLR, including through 
the provision of military equipment and in joint operations against CNDP.<b>29</b> The Group of 
Experts also found evidence linking FARDC commanders to PARECO and Mayi-Mayi non-state 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>29
</b>  S/2008/773, paras. 102-113.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>armed groups.<b>30</b> Weak chains of command within the Congolese armed forces and insufficient 
civilian, democratic control of the sprawling security apparatus facilitate such illegal acts. At the 
same time, the Group of Experts also presented evidence that the Rwandan authorities have been 
complicit in the recruitment of soldiers, including children, have facilitated the supply of military 
equipment and have sent officers and units from the Rwandan Defence Force to the DRC in 
support of CNDP.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>70. According to the approach under the Global and Inclusive Agreement, militia and soldiers 
were given the choice to either join a unified national army, or to be demobilized and 
reintegrated into civilian life. Those who chose to join the army were generally sent to training 
centres (<i>centres de brassage</i>), where they received only about 45 days of basic training. Some 
militia groups were even directly merged into the regular forces (<i>mixage</i>). The result is an army 
that is very heterogeneous and overall ill-disciplined. 
</p>
<p>71. The rank and file of FARDC are often not paid and do not have adequate supplies, 
reportedly also because funds allocated for this purpose are embezzled by senior officers or 
civilian functionaries. As part of its security sector reform project, the European Union Security 
Sector Reform Mission (EUSEC) directly administers salaries for selected units. While this has 
reportedly decreased abuse of power by individual soldiers to some extent, it is still worrying 
that there have been incidents (e.g. in the Kanyabayonga area at the end of October 2008) where 
units benefitting from such support programme were involved in large-scale pillaging and 
accompanying atrocities. This highlights a need for more profound efforts on the part of the 
Government to push for reform and accountability. 
</p>
<p>72. Moreover, while in theory, perpetrators of human rights violations could have been 
excluded from joining the security forces, this has not happened in practice. As a result, major 
perpetrators of violations, including a number of notorious former armed group commanders, 
have managed to join the national army, police or intelligence services, entrenching a culture of 
impunity and disregard for human rights. The Security Council has repeatedly called on the 
Congolese authorities to establish a vetting mechanism to take into account when they select 
candidates for official positions, including key posts in the armed forces, national police and 
other security services, the candidates&#8217; past actions in terms of respect for international 
humanitarian law and human rights.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Illegal exploitation of natural resources 
</b></p>
<p>73. In resolution S8/1, the Council identified the illicit exploitation of natural resources as a 
further root cause of the conflict and basis of the human rights violations and humanitarian crisis 
</p>
<p>

</b>  See resolutions 1756 (2009), para. 12; 1794 (2007), para 15; 1856 (2008), para. 22. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in the region. The illegal exploitation does not only fund non-state armed groups or rogue 
elements in FARDC,<b>33</b> but it also deprives the State of the resources needed to provide access to 
justice and basic social services in accordance with its human rights obligations. 
74. The eastern DRC is rich in many different and sought after minerals, in particular 
cassiterite (tin ore), coltan (columbite-tantalite, used in a number of electronic goods), gold, and 
wolframite, the major component tungsten, a strong and dense material used for various military 
components. Extractive sites of these raw materials in conflict areas have been a major source of 
finances for non-state armed groups in the region, who either directly control or even operate the 
mines, illegally tax the proceeds or participate in the illegal trade of the raw materials. In a 
number of cases, rogue FARDC commanders or units have become complicit to these illegal 
activities. The extraction and trade of the minerals often involves forced labour, extortion and 
violence against those who resist the demand of armed groups or rogue FARDC. Women groups 
also highlighted that sexual extortion and rape of women working around the illegal mining sites 
is rife. 
</p>
<p>75. Illegally extracted raw materials pass through a long supply chain in the DRC which 
stretches from the mining operations, quite often artisanal mining, through local traders 
(<i>n&#233;gociants</i>) to officially registered export trade firms (<i>comptoirs</i>). Pointing to the involvement 
of the <i>n&#233;gociants</i> as middlemen, <i>comptoirs</i> often claim not to know the origin of minerals 
received, which is implausible since the ore content substantially varies between sites, and 
mining sites for certain minerals such as coltan are almost entirely under the control of non-state 
armed groups. The Group of Experts of the Sanction Committee has identified a number of 
<i>comptoirs</i> who knowingly traded in illegal minerals<b>34</b> and the seven thematic special procedures 
were encouraged to hear from the Minister of Mining that their business licenses would not be 
renewed. 
</p>
<p>76. From the <i>comptoirs </i>and in some cases also directly from the mining sites, the minerals are 
exported to neighbouring countries or others from where they are re-exported and eventually end 
up in Europe, North America, Asia or elsewhere, where it is used in products such as mobile 
phones (coltan) or military munitions (wolframite). According to the principle of corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights, transnational corporations and other business enterprises 
as well as consumers have a crucial role in ensuring that buyers and users of such minerals do 
not knowingly or negligently purchase minerals from conflict areas in the eastern DRC. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Political instrumentalization of ethnic cleavages 
</b></p>
<p>77. The political instrumentalization of ethnic cleavages in the eastern DRC feeds the conflicts 
in the region and exacerbates the human rights violations that precede and accompany them. 
Following his visit to the Eastern DRC and neighbouring countries from 23 November to 
4 December 2008, Mr. Francis Deng, Special Advisor of the Secretary-General on the prevention 
of genocide found that &#8220;massive violations of international human rights and humanitarian law

 <p> 
</p>
<p>were being committed on the basis of ethnicity and national origin in the DRC&#8221;.<b>35</b> This finding is 
in line with the previous periods of violence in the region, in which ethnic antagonism was 
fostered and then manipulated for political ends.  
</p>
<p>78. To some extent, the ethnic divisions in eastern DRC are related to colonial resettlement 
programmes, population displacements into the DRC, including the massive inflow of Tutsi 
refugees fleeing pogroms in Rwanda in the 1960s, the political instrumentalization of minorities 
under the Mobutu regime and the large-scale displacements in the aftermath of the genocide in 
Rwanda. In a region that was historically sparsely populated, the demographic changes in the 
eastern DRC also created tremendous competition over scarce resources, in particular 
agricultural land and grazing areas, thus creating an environment that is prone to the 
manipulation of ethnic cleavages. Many land conflicts result from competing claims based on 
formal titles or customary law; tensions between returnees and those who stayed further 
complicate the situation. Extensive documentation is available showing how armed factions have 
been created along ethnic lines as a consequence of displacement and the manipulation of ethnic 
divisions.<b>36</b>  
</p>
<p>79. Limited progress has been achieved to address this dimension of the crisis in the eastern 
DRC. Yet, it will be impossible to treat the most recent outbreak of violence and the massive 
human rights violations accompanying it without focusing on its underlying causes, among 
which lies the interplay of politics, economics and ethnicity. Particular action is needed at the 
local level in order to bring peace to communities that have yet to recover from the ethnic 
divisions that were fuelled by years of conflict. The success of local reconciliation programmes 
is also contingent on effective policies that address the local distribution of resources, in 
particular land.  
</p>
<p>80. The question of nationality of Kinyarwanda-speaking Congolese, living within the DRC or 
as refugees in neighbouring countries, also needs to be addressed since it often lies at the root of 
ethnic divisions in the eastern DRC. The new nationality law of 12 November 2004 is a positive 
step in granting this group the right to nationality. In practice, as recently pointed out by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Congolese nationality is difficult to 
acquire by the Kinyarwanda-speaking population.<b>37</b>  
</p>
<p>81. Finally, the question of minority rights in the political sphere aggravates tensions. 
Majority-voting systems, the particular tailoring of voting districts as well as the difficulty of 
displaced and some returnees to obtain electoral cards have resulted in a disproportionally low

<p>number of minority candidates being elected to office, which has bred further resentment. 
Ensuring the adequate political representation of minority groups in the democratically 
constituted institutions at the national, provincial and local level will help to stifle political 
manipulation attempts by armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Lack of equality between men and women 
</b></p>
<p>82. Civilians are increasingly among the perpetrators of rape, which indicates a normalization 
of the war-related violence. This intensifies existing inequalities and oppression of women in 
society. Regrettably there is a tendency on the part of some to perceive sexual violence as an 
exclusively war related phenomenon with little or no regard to the serious inequality between 
men and women in the DRC. 
</p>
<p>83. Women face discrimination and violence in places of work and education. Girls are often 
denied access to education, as families privilege boys&#8217; attendance to school. Sexual coercion of 
women and girls, committed by supervisors, professors and teachers, is a long-standing 
phenomenon that existed before the armed conflicts.  
</p>
<p>84. Gender inequality and the oppression of women are not only deeply rooted in society, but 
they continue to be officially sanctioned through discriminatory laws. The Family Code 
recognizes equality between the spouses (art. 330), but effectively renders a married woman a 
minor under the guardianship of her husband. Article 444 stipulates that the wife must obey her 
husband; article 448 requires a woman to obtain her husband&#8217;s authorization to effect any legal 
act for which she must present herself in person. It is encouraging that the Minister of Gender 
has drawn up a law to reform the Family Code. It is also positive that article 14 of the 
Constitution stipulates that women have a right to equitable representation in national, provincial 
and local institutions and mandates the State to guarantee this. However, the process to draft a 
gender parity law to implement the Constitution is still ongoing and women remain grossly 
underrepresented in the newly established democratic institutions as well as within law 
enforcement, armed forces and justice system. 
</p><p>85. The seven thematic special procedures are convinced that if the problem of sexual violence 
in conflict is addressed in isolation of the wider nexus of gender-based discrimination, the very 
serious levels of violence endured by women in &#8220;peace&#8221; will be grossly neglected and the war on 
women reinforced. As noted by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, without 
fundamentally altering gender relations and supporting women&#8217;s empowerment, high levels of 
rape will persist, even if stability, the rule of law and democratic, civilian control over the armed 
forces are established. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>In line with its international human rights commitment, the Government of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo has the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the 
human rights of everybody living in the DRC. This implies duties to refrain from certain 
acts, but the Government has, as the Council stressed in resolution S-8/1, paragraph 6, also 
&#8220;the primary responsibility to make every effort to strengthen the protection of the civilian 
population and to investigate and bring to justice perpetrators of violations of human 
rights and of international humanitarian law.&#8221; More generally, the Congolese authorities </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>have the obligation to protect the population from violence, provide access to justice and 
create conditions in which the basic needs of the population are secured. The Congolese 
State largely abdicated these responsibilities during decades of autocratic rule, followed by 
years of armed conflict that further eroded the institutional capacity of the authorities at 
all levels. In many ways, human rights concerns in the DRC centre around the question 
what the State fails to do for its people, rather than what it does to them. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The seven thematic special procedures welcome the many strategy papers and action 
plans in human rights relevant areas that the Government, often in cooperation with the 
international community, has prepared. Such documents are first steps: they only obtain 
meaning if they are actually implemented by the responsible Government authorities. 
Technical assistance, as the term indicates, can only assist the Government in the 
implementation process, but cannot replace government action.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Armed conflict has ended in most of the country and the elected authorities are now 
in place to implement much needed reforms without delay on the ground. This being said, 
the seven thematic special procedures recognize that considerable parts of the east of the 
DRC still experience armed conflict. The existing armed conflicts exacerbate the extent and 
severity of human rights violations and also pose a challenge to implementing government 
initiatives and accompanying technical assistance measures to address structural human 
rights concerns in key areas such as the justice and security sectors. The resolution of the 
armed conflicts in DRC will require multilateral political processes involving Governments 
of the DRC, neighbouring countries and beyond. However, political settlements achieved 
will only be sustainable, if the authorities seriously and immediately address the human 
rights concerns underlying the conflicts and the international community is prepared to 
dedicate the necessary technical assistance to this crucial element of successful 
peacebuilding. The absence of peace in the entire territory must not be an excuse to delay 
reforms, but makes it ever more urgent to undertake them. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Priority objectives and technical assistance needs in this regard 
</b>89. <b>The baseline assessment carried out by the seven thematic special procedures 
highlights that the human rights problems in the entire territory of the DRC are serious, 
multifaceted and deeply rooted in the political, economic and social dynamics at the local, 
national and regional levels. On the basis of their assessment, the authors have identified 
eight priority objectives for Government action along with technical assistance needs in 
this regard. While several of them are reform areas where human rights actors (e.g. the 
human rights and rule of law components of MONUC) have key roles in assisting the 
Government, other actors will have to take the lead in other areas that are equally 
important from a human rights perspective, with human rights actors only playing a 
complementary role.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>To a large extent the seven thematic special procedures have drawn on existing 
recommendations that are longstanding and have been reiterated many times by the 
United Nations, civil society organizations and experts. These include the sets of 
recommendations formulated by those among the seven mandate holders who visited the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>DRC on prior occasions, which remain overall valid since the authorities have heeded few 
of them. Some of the recommendations call for full implementation or expansion of existing 
programmes and projects undertaken within MONUC or on a bilateral basis while others 
complement existing with new reform activities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Fighting impunity and strengthening the law enforcement and justice sectors 
</b>91. <b>Fighting impunity should be the number one priority as tolerance for killings, rapes 
or arbitrary displacement is a key reason for the continuing prevalence of these and similar 
human rights violations. The fight against impunity requires a strong political will on the 
part of the DRC authorities to take action against identified perpetrators of international 
crimes regardless of their rank or connections. The work of the International Court of 
Justice may supplement, but not replace national efforts. However, the impunity problem 
undeniably also has a capacity dimension. On the basis of the various action plans drawn 
by relevant Ministries, donors should continue to prioritize reform across the entire justice 
chain - police, prosecution, courts and especially also the penitentiary system. In the 
medium- and long-term such efforts will only be useful and sustainable if the Government 
itself shows a willingness to increase the justice portion of the national budget further to an 
acceptable level comparable with other countries (2-6 per cent).  
</b>92. <b>At the national level, donors should emphasize support for the newly established 
Higher Council of Judges. Support for other elements of the judicial architecture set out by 
the Constitution, including the <i>Cour de cassation</i>, the Constitutional Court and the <i>Conseil 
d&#8217;&#201;tat</i>, will also be needed, once the legislation to establish these institutions has been 
passed. Civilian jurisdiction needs to be further strengthened through legislation assigning 
criminal jurisdiction over perpetrators from among the police or civilian population to 
civilian prosecutors and courts. Nevertheless, the military justice system should not be 
neglected in donor efforts. Security sector reform partners should consider providing, at 
least in the conflict affected provinces, experienced military advocates from their militaries 
as advisors to military prosecutors and courts. They would assist in and monitor the daily 
work of these organs without, however, assuming any decision-making authority. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Perhaps even more important is the expansion of the state justice system in the rural 
territories. One state measure worth supporting would be the establishment of a network 
of justices of the peace that are linked up with traditional modes of dispute-settlement as 
well as of mobile higher courts to address more serious cases. Measures to increase 
payment and other support for those officials who are willing to serve in conflict zones, 
remote areas or other hardship posts may help addressing the chronic lack of qualified 
personnel in these areas.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>International law does not only oblige the State to duly punish perpetrators of 
killings, sexual violence and other violent crime, but the State also has to ensure that the 
victim or surviving family receives compensation from the perpetrator&#8217;s side. Moreover, 
ensuring compensation payments will motivate victims to claim justice, rather than 
accepting amicably settlements or staying silent altogether. Consideration should be given 
to establishing a compensation guarantee fund, managed jointly by the Government, 
participating donors and civil society, which would pay out compensation awarded by 
national courts or the International Criminal Court to victims of serious human rights </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>violations. The fund would initially rely on matching government and donor contributions, 
but then seek repayment of disbursed amounts from the State or private individuals cited 
as responsible. In a pilot stage such a fund could cover one or two provinces and focus in 
particular on awards based on sexual violence cases. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Transitional justice for the massive violations that took place between 1993 and 2003 
is another area that should be prioritized. These violations are generally outside the 
jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which can only be seized of cases that 
took place after 1 July 2002. The establishment of joint benches, comprising national and 
international judges and sitting in national courts, might be an appropriate transitional 
justice tool for the DRC that can also be combined with truth seeking initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p><b>2.  Reforming the security sector 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The police, intelligence services and in particular the FARDC all remain in need of 
serious and comprehensive reform. In many ways, the operational weakness of FARDC 
and also the present lack of capacity of the police constitute a human rights concern that 
should rank very high on the list of priorities. Not only does the FARDC often prove 
incapable of protecting the civilian population from attacks by armed groups, but it also 
becomes a perpetrator of violations because it lacks the command and control structures 
and accountability mechanisms to prevent abuses from within its ranks. The minimum 
training provided in the <i>brassage </i>process has proven inadequate. There is a need for more 
comprehensive training programmes. Coordinated training should target officers and 
systematically include international humanitarian law and human rights in the curriculum. 
This will not only require substantial resources, but also willingness among the various 
countries to agree on a curriculum and coordinate their efforts generally on the basis of a 
shared national security reform strategy. As an accompanying measure donors should also 
continue and expand programmes to provide units, particularly in conflict areas, with 
supplies and ensure that they receive their salary. The construction of barracks would 
allow keeping soldiers away from civilian populations. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Government should remove perpetrators of serious human rights violations that 
have already been identified as such from its ranks and files without further delay. In 
addition, the Government and its major partners in security reform should set up a 
comprehensive and adequately resourced secondary screening mechanism, where each 
officer is vetted for his past human rights record and subjected to a determination of his 
ability to command in accordance with principles of international humanitarian law and 
the values embodied in the Constitution of the DRC. Candidates who fail should be 
excluded and blacklisted from joining the military, police and intelligence services, with 
appropriate due process mechanisms and transparent processes. The international 
community should technically assist this process by providing specialized international 
staff as well resources. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Donors should insist that training and support and accountability for human rights 
violations are mutually reinforcing elements and make extension of programmes 
contingent on serious government efforts to clean the ranks of the security forces. 
Similarly, MONUC should not cooperate with FARDC commanders and units implicated 
in human rights violations. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Preventing the (re-) recruitment of children by armed actors and  
socially reintegrating children associated with armed actors 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>All parties to the conflict must cease any new recruitment of children and release 
unconditionally all those currently associated with their forces. They must prepare, in the 
framework of Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), action plans to identify, release and 
ensure effective and sustainable reintegration of all children associated with their forces, to 
prevent further recruitment and to address all other grave violations against children. 
Reintegration strategies should be community-based and in line with the Paris Principles 
and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Forces or Armed Groups. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Demobilization, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) processes need to include 
procedures to recognize and assist women and girls associated with armed groups, in 
particular survivors of sexual violence. To mitigate the re-recruitment of children due in 
part to insufficient reintegration support from earlier DDR processes, all stakeholders, 
including relevant government institutions, United Nations entities, NGOs and donors, 
should ensure the provision of flexible and multi-year funding. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring 
countries should enhance their cooperation to prevent cross-border recruitment and to 
ensure the successful repatriation and reintegration of children formerly associated with 
groups in the DRC to their countries of origin. To help address cross-border dimensions of 
the conflict and implications for children, United Nations country teams and peacekeeping 
operations should develop a joint strategy to monitor and report on grave child rights 
violations by groups such as LRA. 
</b></p>
<p><b>4.  Protecting women&#8217;s rights and ensuring gender equality in law and society 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>There are clear indications that violence against women will remain pervasive even 
once armed conflict ends and relative stability has been established. Building on existing 
initiatives, while enhancing their coordination, donors should therefore continue to address 
violence against women and support to its survivors as a priority. Government initiatives 
with clear and tangible objectives such as the roadmap to fight impunity for sexual violence 
of the Ministry of Justice are worth supporting. The formation of specialized police units is 
another area that deserves donor support. Particular emphasis should lie on the hitherto 
largely neglected and underfunded area of socio-economic reintegration of survivors of 
rape. Programs should not only cover the eastern provinces but also other parts of the 
country with high prevalence of violence against women and involve local women 
organisations. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Ministry of Gender, Family and Children is drawing up essential legislation to 
reform the Family Code and implement the gender parity provision of the Constitution. 
Beyond technical advice, donors should support advocacy and awareness-raising 
programmes to make sure that these draft laws will be passed by parliament and signed 
into law. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>The plans of the Minister of Gender to reconstitute the <i>Conseil national de la femme</i> 
would need to be closely examined. Technical assistance provided to this plan should not 
detract from crucial donor support to local Congolese women non-governmental 
organizations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>5.  Addressing economic root causes of human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The illegal exploitation of natural resources in the eastern DRC benefits armed 
groups and rogue elements in the state security forces; it perpetuates the armed conflicts 
and is often accompanied by serious human rights violations, namely forced labour. 
Seriously addressing the illicit exploitation of natural resources in the DRC will require 
exporters and consumers of Congolese mineral products to step up their due diligence 
efforts and publicly disclose what steps they have taken to prevent the purchase of mineral 
ore or its products mined in conflict areas of the DRC. Similarly, it also requires to develop 
concurrently the same requirement for due diligence at the DRC state level, to build the 
necessary capacity at the national level and to identify what role international technical 
cooperation should play in supporting it. Technical assistance partners can help the 
Government implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, for which the 
DRC was accepted as a candidate country in February 2008, or similar accountability 
mechanisms that will help prevent illegal diversion of state revenues and increase the 
resources available to the State. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>With much of the international discourse focusing on illegal mining, many still fail to 
recognize the important role of local conflicts over land, exacerbated by several waves of 
displacement and returns. Beginning in provinces of particular concern such as North 
Kivu, community-based land commissions should be set up, involving traditional leaders, 
provincial state officials and community representatives, in particular also women, 
returnees and minority groups, to address local disputes over land. The commissions 
should be provided with the resources to offer compensation as a last resort where there 
are competing legitimate claims or where a redistribution of land to marginalized sections 
of society is necessary to resolve conflicts and ensure justice. An alternative would be to 
give this role to the justices of peace as described above. A thorough analysis of existing 
mechanisms of alternative dispute resolution based on customary law would be needed in 
order to set up a system within the framework of the State that is acceptable and supported 
by the population.  
</b></p>
<p><b>6.  Protecting the rights of the displaced and minorities 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Government, in particular the Ministry of Social and Humanitarian Affairs and 
its provincial counterparts in the eastern DRC, has to assume its responsibilities regarding 
protection and assistance for the internally displaced emanating from international and 
regional human rights treaties and the Protocol on Protection and Assistance to Internally 
Displaced Persons adopted at the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region 
which obliges the DRC to incorporate the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2) into its domestic law. As a first step the 
Government, with expert technical advice, should develop a legislative framework, a 
strategy and a plan of action for the implementation of these obligations. Meanwhile, the 
donor community should begin prioritizing support to vulnerable host communities in 
areas of refuge as well as early recovery activities in return areas. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>There is a risk that internally displaced persons cannot exercise their right to vote 
and be elected if the local elections planned for 2009 would take place before they can 
return. The National Election Commission, in cooperation with MONUC and other 
partners, should ensure registration of the displaced as voters and be supported to find 
ways to ensure (e.g. through provisions on absentee voting) that the displaced can in fact 
exercise their political rights. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>In addition, and also to build a more inclusive society generally, the Government 
should launch a campaign in the eastern DRC to provide national identification and 
electoral cards to anyone qualifying for DRC nationality under the new nationality law of 
12 November 2004. Implementation should be guided by a rebuttable presumption that 
those who currently live or prior to the armed conflict have lived in the DRC are 
considered nationals of the DRC. Solving the problem of nationality of 
Kinyarwanda-speaking Congolese would enhance their sense of belonging, their 
participation in social life and contribute to reverse the widespread prejudice that this 
group is composed of &#8220;foreigners&#8221;.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>These initiatives should be complemented by local conflict resolution and ethnic 
reconciliation initiatives involving all sectors of society including women, returnees as well 
as IDPs and refugees awaiting their return. 
</b></p>
<p><b>7.  Providing access to health care, especially for marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>In line with its human rights obligations, the Government has to make efforts to 
progressively re-establish a functioning and accessible health system in the country, while 
ensuring minimum standards right away. It should prioritize immediate action to ensure 
that displaced populations have access to medical services, safe water and sanitation in 
order to avert the growing public health crisis. The specific health needs, especially those of 
particularly vulnerable groups, like women and children, need to be identified to ensure 
provision of adequate medical care and prevention of further health problems. In 
particular, urgent steps must be taken to ensure that fees do not become an obstacle for 
poor and vulnerable populations to access essential health care as such fees often are a key 
reason why persons with illnesses that could easily be treated die. The immediate 
abolishment of fees for forensic medical certificates for victims of sexual and gender-based 
violence should be a first step. The seven thematic special procedures call upon the donor 
community to continue supporting the national health system as a priority, in particular its 
support for groups in a vulnerable situation. In areas of crisis, relevant agencies should 
focus on improving coordination mechanisms to ensure adequate and prioritized response 
to the health crisis. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>8. Strengthening state and civil society structures  
to promote and protect human rights 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>As soon as legislation on an independent national human rights commission is 
adopted, donors should provide adequate technical advice and assistance to establish the 
Commission and integrate it into regional and international networks of national human 
rights institutions. Within the commission, a human rights defenders focal point should be 
established whose tasks would include: investigating human rights violations against 
defenders; raising awareness on international and regional human rights instruments 
pertaining to the work of human rights defenders; ensuring that national legislation is in 
conformity with these instruments; making recommendations to the Government, 
Parliament and other state institutions with regard to the situation of human rights 
defenders, and following up on these recommendations; and offering legal assistance to 
human rights defenders.  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Parallel to that, the Ministry of Human Rights should be empowered to identify 
human rights trends -in consultation with civil society- and ensure that they are taking into 
account in the policy-making process at the national level. Donors should consider assisting 
the Ministry with funding to re-establish small offices in the provinces and enable them to 
deal with complaints of the population against government officials regarding human 
rights issues. Furthermore, the Ministry should be trained by OHCHR on drafting 
methodology to meet in a timely manner its reporting obligations before United Nations 
treaty bodies. The Ministry should also translate the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders in the main local languages and disseminate it within the state apparatus and 
civil society, and deliver awareness-raising training to the police, military and judicial 
officials on the role and activities of human rights defenders, including women defenders, 
with technical advice and assistance from OHCHR and NGOs.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>More generally, the emergence of a confident and coordinated civil society that can 
only prosper in a state of democracy, rule of law and full government commitment to 
individual freedoms and liberties should be fostered and supported. The Government 
should recognize the legitimacy of the work of human rights defenders, including women 
defenders, and acknowledge it as human rights work. It should further remove all obstacles 
that impede their work, protect them from reprisals, and take proactive measures to 
support their work. The adoption of national and provincial laws on the protection of 
human rights defenders, developed in consultation with civil society and on the basis of 
technical advice from relevant international agencies, would be a particularly strong signal. 
OHCHR, MONUC, and the European Union should continue their witness protection 
programme and expand its ambit to human rights defenders in all provinces. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>In addition, illegitimate restrictions on the exercise of the right to freedom of 
association should be lifted: when NGOs applying for registration comply with all 
administrative requirements, legal personality should be immediately granted to them. 
Furthermore, the regime of information governing the exercise of the right to freedom of 
peaceful assembly (article 26 of the Constitution) should be respected without any 
arbitrary interference from the executive. Finally, the draft bill on the organization and </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>functioning of the Superior Council of Audiovisual and Communication, as well as the two 
draft bills contributing to the better exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression (notably by decriminalizing a number of press offences), should be adopted. 
</b>116. <b>Donors can assist these efforts by continuing to fund protection and empowerment 
programmes benefitting the fledgling community of local NGOs, in particular groups 
representing women or marginalized groups such as the BaTwa. Donors should also 
prioritize support for local organizations by earmarking a portion of their budget for 
direct support to such groups.  
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations on follow-up to the present report 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>In the light of the large ambit of human rights challenges in the DRC, the seven 
thematic special procedures have focused on identifying priorities for government action 
and technical assistance within the limitations of their respective mandates, while also 
developing a few exemplary proposals that can be implemented in the short- to 
medium-term with little resources.  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>In conducting their work, the authors noted that despite extensive efforts of the donor 
community to technically assist the Government in improving the human rights situation, 
there are no benchmarks against which to measure progress achieved by the Government. 
Benchmarks, established by the United Nations in consultation with the Government, civil 
society and donors, would be an important accountability measure and also of help in 
steering donor priorities. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The seven thematic special procedures urge the Council to continue taking a 
leadership role in ensuring that the human rights dimension of the peacebuilding process in 
the DRC is duly addressed. The situation in the east of the country is characterized by 
systematic and gross human rights violations, in particular committed by armed groups 
controlling territory and the state security forces. Another military escalation in the 
Kivus - with potentially devastating human rights implications - was underway when this 
report was finalized. The authors therefore recommend devising a dedicated follow-up and 
monitoring mechanism that extends beyond the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism and 
ensures continued direct engagement with the Government and civil society. The Council 
should strongly consider creating a special procedures mandate on the human rights 
situation in the DRC, in particular areas affected or threatened by armed conflict. This 
would build on paragraph 6 of Council resolution 9/9 on the Protection of the Human 
Rights of Civilians in Armed Conflict, in which the Council calls upon States involved in 
such conflicts to facilitate the work of any mechanism that the Council may decide to 
establish, as and where appropriate, in response to such violations.
