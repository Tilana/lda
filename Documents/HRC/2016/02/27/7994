<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the situation of human 
rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Mr. Doudou Di&#232;ne 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report is the outcome of the third visit of the Independent Expert to C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, from 24 September to 12 October 2012, and is intended to reflect the situation of 
human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire from 15 July to 15 December 2012. 
</p>
<p> In a subregional context that is weakened by the situation in northern Mali and the 
Sahel and faced with a tense political climate and an unstable security situation, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire is at a decisive political turning point, despite the remarkable economic and social 
progress that has been achieved. 
</p>
<p> The attacks by assailants, which chiefly took place in August and September 2012 
and were attributed to armed individuals identified by the Government as pro-Gbagbo 
militants, appeared to be designed to plunge the country back into the cycle of aggression 
and repression that has prevailed in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for more than 10 years. The response of 
the State security system to this wave of attacks has at times been disproportionate, leading 
to some recognized human rights violations. 
</p>
<p> It is against this background that the Independent Expert gathered information on 
the increasingly precarious human rights situation, which would appear likely to undermine 
democratic, economic and social gains. With regard to the violations committed by 
assailants in the course of attempts to destabilize the country, some 60 people were killed, 
including Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI) troops and civilians, women and 
children. In certain areas in the west of the country, populations were displaced by the 
attacks, fearing for their lives, and hundreds of people were forced to leave their villages to 
take refuge in neighbouring areas. 
</p>
<p> The FRCI reacted vigorously to attacks by the assailants by strengthening its 
presence in Abidjan and other areas, particularly in sensitive areas such as the west of the 
country and the borders with Liberia and Ghana. FRCI troops set up roadblocks and 
conducted searches and raids in villages. Against this background, violations of the right to 
life, arbitrary arrest and detention, acts of torture, violations of the right to property, 
extortion and racketeering were reported throughout the country, particularly in the west.

</p>
<p> The Independent Expert visited the western region of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, which has 
traditionally been the stage for strong tensions between indigenous and non-indigenous 
communities. The attack on Nahibly camp for displaced persons in Du&#233;kou&#233;, where more 
than 5,000 people were registered, was one of the most violent episodes of these 
intercommunity clashes. The attack caused the death of more than 8 people and injured 60, 
including 1 woman. As the Independent Expert indicated in his most recent report, 
intercommunity tensions persist in the west of the country and require swift steps by the 
Government to facilitate peaceful coexistence among communities and prevent 
intercommunity violence, which often results in serious human rights violations. 
Nevertheless, the Independent Expert observed, on the ground, that there were internally 
generated initiatives to settle local conflicts and collectively reconstruct the fabric of 
intercommunity life. 
</p>
<p> Against this background, the Independent Expert reaffirms the urgent need to 
expedite the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) and of 
security sector reform. In spite of the Government&#8217;s efforts, the delay in this area is 
contributing to the deterioration of the security situation in the country and giving rise to 
human rights violations. These reforms will require significant amounts of funding to be 
deployed that are well beyond the current capacity of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to absorb future 
disarmed and demobilized ex-combatants. 
</p>
<p> The fight against impunity is under way although, to date, it remains a one-way 
process that is neither fair nor swift and is, essentially, directed at the supporters of former 
President Gbagbo. Many political and military figures close to the former president who 
were involved in human rights violations and whose names have appeared in United 
Nations reports on several occasions during the past 10 years have now been charged and 
detained. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert reaffirms that in order for the judicial process to be useful 
to Ivorian society as a whole, to make a real contribution to national reconciliation and to 
drive forward a new dynamic that is more respectful of human life and dignity, the authors 
of human rights violations must be prosecuted regardless of their political, tribal, regional 
or religious affiliation.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 20/19, 
in which the Council renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert for a period of one 
year and requested him to submit his report at its twenty-second session. 
</p>
<p>2. The report is based on the third visit of the Independent Expert [to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire] 
from 24 September to 12 October 2012. It covers the period from 15 July to 15 December 
</p><p>2012. It is based on information gathered from government, traditional and religious 
authorities, United Nations agencies, national and international non-governmental 
organizations and from witnesses and victims of human rights violations. In addition, it is 
based on the recommendations contained in the previous report of the Independent Expert, 
submitted to the Human Rights Council on 21 March 2012. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert would like to thank the Government of the Republic of C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire for facilitating his stay in the country and his meetings with national and local 
authorities. In this context, the Independent Expert met with the Prime Minister, the 
Secretary of State, the Minister of Interior, the Minister of Human Rights and Civil 
Liberties, the Deputy Minister of Defence, the Minister of Ex-combatants and War Victims, 
the Minister of Family, Women and Children, the Minister of Education and the Minister of 
Culture and Francophonie. The Independent Expert held one working session with the 
Director of the Office of the President of the Republic in order to share his initial 
reflections with high-level national authorities. 
</p>
<p>4. Moreover, the Expert met with the Public Prosecutor, the Military Prosecutor, the 
Director of the National Surveillance Directorate, the President of the Dialogue, Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, members of the National Human Rights Commission and the 
President of the National Commission of Inquiry. The Expert had a fruitful working session 
with the representatives of political parties such as the former President of the Republic; 
Henri Konan Bedi&#233;, president of the Parti d&#233;mocratique de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (PDCI); 
Mamadou Koulibaly, president of Libert&#233; et d&#233;mocratie pour la R&#233;publique (LIDER); and 
officials from the Front populaire ivoirien (FPI) and the Congr&#232;s national de la r&#233;sistance 
pour la d&#233;mocratie (CNRD). 
</p><p>5. The Expert went far inside the country, in particular to Bouna, Boundiali, Divo, 
Du&#233;kou&#233;, Katiola, Korhogo and Odienn&#233;, where he met with people who had been arrested 
in the context of the post-electoral crisis and with traditional and religious leaders. In all of 
these areas, the Expert met with the administrative, judicial and security authorities in order 
to gather their views on issues related to human rights, security and the administration of 
justice in their respective regions. In addition, he went to Yamoussoukro, where he 
participated in the 52nd ordinary session of the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The Expert met with representatives of national and international human rights 
organizations, women&#8217;s organizations, representatives of victims and representatives of 
brotherhoods of traditional hunters (Dozo) in Korhogo. The Expert visited the ruins of the 
site at Nahibly, which, until it was tragically destroyed on 20 July 2012, had sheltered 
displaced persons in Du&#233;kou&#233;. He heard from camp survivors, as well as from a number of 
witnesses and victims of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>7. In addition, he held working sessions with representatives of the diplomatic corps 
and with the Special Representative of the African Union for C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. He held 
substantive talks with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations, Albert Gerard Koenders, and his deputy, Arnaud Akodjenou. In addition, he 
participated in a meeting of the United Nations country team in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, headed by </p>


<p>GE.13-10074 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Ndolamb Ngokwey, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident 
Coordinator in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p>8. The Expert welcomes the support given to him by the United Nations Operation in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (UNOCI) and by mission officials, which enabled him to travel far inside the 
country and to meet various actors. In particular, he thanks the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for the Rule of Law, the Director of the Human Rights Division and his staff for 
their support which was crucial for the actual organization of his visit.  
</p>
<p>9. In addition, the Expert conducted a visit to The Hague, in the Netherlands, from 30 
to 31 August 2012, in order to discuss cooperation issues with International Criminal Court 
(ICC) authorities. In particular, he met with Sang-Hyun Song, ICC President; Fatou 
Bensouda, ICC Prosecutor; and Silvana Arbia, ICC Registrar. The Expert wishes to thank 
ICC officials for the fruitful exchanges concerning the complementarity of their mandates, 
the central role and impact of justice in the national reconciliation process in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
and the need for the ICC to lead the Ivorian judicial system by example, in particular with 
regard to fairness and impartiality. Furthermore, the Expert conducted an exchange with 
Stephen Rapp, United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes, on the issue of 
impunity in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Subregional instability 
</b></p>
<p>10. Almost two years after the post-electoral crisis, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is gradually resuming 
its place on the African and international stage. President Alassane Ouattara is also 
Chairperson of the Economic Community of West African States and, in that capacity, is 
coordinating the Community&#8217;s response to the crisis in the Sahel region in general and in 
the north of Mali in particular. 
</p>
<p>11. Located to the north of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Mali is an open door to the Sahara and the 
Sahel, a particularly vast area over which neighbouring States exercise no effective control. 
This factor favours the presence of groups such as Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, the 
Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa and Ansar Dine. The geographical factor 
also explains a central aspect of the crisis in the Sahel region: the strategic alliance between 
drug traffickers who seek means of transporting drugs to the Mediterranean coast and the 
European market, and Islamist groups that need arms and money in order to extend their 
influence in the region. This strategic alliance is a time bomb that will profoundly 
destabilize all countries in the region for quite some time. 
</p>
<p>12. As the Expert indicated in his previous report, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is a microcosm of the 
region; with its ethnic, religious and cultural diversity, it is [also] a microcosm of the 
subregion. The Ivorian conflict cannot, therefore, be contained without taking into account 
the subregional dimension as a whole. Just as the crisis in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has created a risk 
of instability in the subregion that has security, humanitarian, economic and social 
repercussions for neighbouring countries, the crisis in north Mali and the Sahel is likely to 
amplify and exacerbate the political and intercommunity fractures inherited from a decade 
of total crisis and is even likely to eradicate the process of political, economic and social 
change under way in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.13-10074 
</p>
<p><b> B. Central role of political pluralism 
</b></p>
<p>13. There are two clear trends in the political arena: a genuine institutional political 
process, and open challenge in support of a version of political pluralism that favours 
reconciliation. These two factors have a direct impact on the human rights situation as 
much as on security. The institutional political process &#8212; which is fundamental to the 
democratic reconstruction of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire &#8212; is evidenced by the establishment of the main 
political and administrative institutions of the rule of law, a Head of State, a Parliament and 
the restoration by the State of its sovereignty over administrative, judicial and security 
affairs throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>14. Strengthening inclusive political pluralism, which was one of the central 
recommendations of the previous report, is the most urgent and enduring response to the 
two major challenges of the crisis in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, namely, how to transform a society that 
is deeply polarized in political terms into a legal, democratic expression of the political, 
cultural, ethnic and religious diversity of the Ivorian people and how to provide credible 
guarantees of a culture of tolerance in which national reconciliation is possible, with respect 
for the deeply held convictions of all elements of society. 
</p>
<p>15. Significant initiatives towards national reconciliation have been made by the 
political class, as well as by civil society. In this regard, the joint creation by the 
Government and an opposition party, following the Conclave in Grand Bassam in April 
2012, of a permanent framework for dialogue is a major step towards the creation of 
conditions and instruments that would promote reconciliation. One particularly significant 
development was that the Government accepted, following a working session, that a 
working group should be established to make proposals on two important issues raised by 
opposition parties members of the permanent framework for dialogue, namely, the 
reconstitution of the Independent Electoral Commission and the postponement of municipal 
and regional elections. 
</p>
<p>16. However, the dialogue and reconciliation process as a whole faces the following 
obstacles to the achievement of critical mass: full inclusion, including the participation of 
the main opposition party FPI; a strong political initiative to open [access to] power; 
perception of the impartiality of the judiciary; and a stable security environment. The FPI, 
the party of former President Gbagbo, is at a crossroads, torn between those who are 
convinced that dialogue and reconciliation are urgent and necessary, and supporters who 
remain committed to regaining power by force. 
</p>
<p>17.  The Independent Expert observed this internal dynamic through his meetings both 
with current party officials and figures from the former regime who remain in detention. 
The condemnation, in an official communiqu&#233; from the FPI, of the attack in August on 
Akouedo camp in Abidjan is particularly significant in this regard. The indecisiveness of 
the FPI at the Conclave in Grand Bassam on 28 April 2012 (participation in the opening but 
withdrawal from and non-acceptance of the permanent framework for dialogue) is evidence 
of a profound debate within the party. 
</p>
<p>18. The legitimate historical process of political settling that is under way in the FPI and 
whether the party will lean decisively towards reconciliation or a strategy of constant 
tension will depend as much on the balance of power within the party as on the ability of 
the present Government to give decisive momentum and lend credibility to inclusiveness 
and political pluralism, through three strong initiatives. The first [such initiative] is legal in 
nature [and would involve] promoting the legal institutional status of the opposition on the 
basis of its legitimacy, the full exercise of [the right to] freedom of association and 
expression, and guaranteeing the [availability of the] necessary means for democratic 
political activities, by unblocking resources that are untainted by illegality and by providing 
legal funding from Parliament. The second is judicial in nature [and would involve] ending </p>


<p>GE.13-10074 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the detention of opposition officials not directly involved in serious economic crimes or 
murder and similar crimes. The third is political in nature [and would involve] participation 
in a Government of national unity. In the final analysis, only the reality of political 
pluralism and the vitality of democratic debate can counteract and call into question the 
temptation to resort to violence as a means of political expression. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Diminished security environment 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Expert is concerned by the deterioration of the security situation, another 
serious factor that has a negative impact on the situation of human rights. UNOCI has 
identified at least 23 large-scale attacks since the beginning of August 2012 in Abidjan and 
in other parts of the country. These attacks, which are sometimes simultaneous, essentially 
target FRCI positions, gendarmeries and police stations. According to information provided 
by the Government on the situation of internal security from March to September 2012, 
other attacks took place including coup attempts and destabilization operations. 
</p>
<p>20. Some sources consider that these attacks are carried out by unidentified armed 
groups. However, according to the Ivorian authorities, they are planned and organized by 
supporters of former President Gbagbo from Ghana and Liberia, with the involvement of 
Liberian mercenaries. The objective would be to create a sense of insecurity in the country 
in order to discourage investors and cause emotional stress to the population. It should be 
emphasized that the FPI, sensing that it is under increasing pressure from the State security 
system, has condemned some of these attacks and remains concerned about the risks of 
confusion and reprisals faced by party officials, their activists and sympathizers. 
</p>
<p>21. Moreover, the attack of 14&#8211;15 October 2012 on the thermal power station at Azito in 
Yopougon, which provides electricity to Abdijan and the surrounding area, by individuals 
dressed in new gendarme uniforms illustrates the complexity of the current security 
situation. The military authorities have recognized that the recent attacks have benefited 
from complicity at the very core of the FRCI. Some observers recognize that there exists a 
diverse group of some 97,000 armed men in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire who could conduct attacks 
against State system structures and civilian populations. 
</p>
<p>22. In view of these security challenges, the Expert reaffirms the urgent need to expedite 
the DDR process and security sector reform. In spite of the Government&#8217;s efforts, delay in 
this field is contributing to the deterioration of the security situation in the country and 
giving rise to human rights violations. In this regard, the Expert welcomes the creation at 
the end of August of the Authority for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration 
under the authority of the National Security Council, headed by the President of the 
Republic. These reforms will require significant amounts of funding to be deployed that are 
well beyond the current capacity of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to absorb future disarmed and 
demobilized ex-combatants. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Economic and social progress 
</b></p>
<p>23. In economic terms, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire appears to be making solid progress and is 
progressively regaining its former position in the subregion, where it has long been the 
economic engine of the West African Economic and Monetary Union with 40 per cent of 
the Union&#8217;s [regional] gross domestic product (GDP). According to the Government, the 
growth rate for the coming three years should be between 9 per cent in 2013 and 10 per 
cent in 2014&#8211;2015. Moreover, the growth rate of the Ivorian economy has a significant 
impact on the countries of the subregion with which the Government has launched large-
scale regional projects in the infrastructure sector. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.13-10074 
</p>
<p>24. The political dimension of the Ivorian crisis must not be neglected in favour of a 
focus on the economic dimension, since a polarized society contains the seeds of conflicts 
which, should they manifest, could have a negative impact on economic activities. The 
enduring impact of this economic growth on democratic reconstruction and national 
reconciliation is dependent on various elements, namely, the priority given to the effective 
enjoyment of economic and social rights (health, education, employment, housing) by all 
the population and, in particular, the numerous victims of a profound crisis, in addition to 
the attention given to social equality and common prosperity. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of the human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violations committed by assailants during attacks 
</b></p>
<p>25. With regard to the violations committed by assailants in the course of attempts to 
destabilize the country, some 60 people were killed including FRCI troops and civilians, 
women and children. Moreover, a number of others were wounded, including children. In 
certain areas in the west of the country, populations were displaced by the attacks, fearing 
for their lives and hundreds of people were forced to leave their villages to take refuge in 
neighbouring areas. 
</p>
<p>26. The Independent Expert would like to mention the following most significant 
attacks: on the night of 4 to 5 August, armed men opened fire at an FRCI checkpoint and a 
police station in Yopougon in Abidjan, killing at least five persons, of whom three were 
killed at the police station and two at the checkpoint. All of the victims were FRCI troops. 
One FRCI soldier was seriously wounded as a result of this attack. An even more 
significant destabilization operation was conducted on the night of 5 August, targeting 
Aku&#233;do military camp in Abidjan which is one of the most important such camps in the 
country. The assailants killed at least 5 people and injured 18 others, all FRCI troops. The 
FRCI captured eight assailants and seized weapons. 
</p>
<p>27. On 15 August, armed assailants launched a simultaneous attack on an FRCI 
checkpoint, a gendarmerie and a civilian prison in the town of Dabou, near Abidjan. Three 
civilians were killed and some 119 prisoners were released by the assailants following the 
attacks. On 8 August, some 10 assailants targeted an FRCI checkpoint in Agboville, 
injuring a soldier. On 13 August, a control post located in the town of Pehekan Houebli, 
near Toul&#233;pleu and the border with Liberia, came under attack by armed men from Liberia. 
One assailant was killed and three FRCI troops were injured. 
</p><p>28. On 25 August, three assailants, one member of the FRCI and one civilian were 
killed following an attack on an FRCI position at Iroko, 140 kilometres from Abidjan. 
Another large-scale attack was conducted on the night of 20 to 21 September against an 
FRCI base located in the village of No&#233; on the border with Ghana. The attack was led by a 
pastor, exiled in Ghana, by the name of Djaha Aristide, who had previously announced that 
President Ouattara would fall [from power] in 77 days. Eight assailants were killed, 
including the pastor. A further 15 assailants were arrested by the FRCI and transferred to 
the National Surveillance Directorate in Abidjan. Following these attacks, the Ivorian 
Government decided to close its air, land and sea borders with Ghana. The airspace 
between the two countries was reopened on 24 September and the land and sea borders on 8 
October. </p>


<p>GE.13-10074 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Violations related to the response of FRCI to assailants 
</b></p>
<p>29. The FRCI reacted vigorously to attacks by assailants by strengthening its presence in 
Abidjan and other towns, particularly in sensitive regions such as the west of the country 
and the borders with Liberia and Ghana. FRCI troops set up roadblocks and conducted 
searches and raids in villages. 
</p>
<p>30. The Expert deplores the cases of violations of the right to life that were reported to 
him, the victims of which were often members of the State security system and civilians 
suspected of colluding with assailants. For example, on the night of 19 August 2012, the 
FRCI conducted a raid on the village of Dougroulili&#233;, killing a man of 42 years of age 
suspected of hiding assailants and arresting another person of 35 years of age for the same 
reason. In response, the village chief led a four-person delegation to the FRCI camp in 
order to demand the release of the person who had been arrested. Once inside the military 
camp, the entire delegation was arrested and detained. 
</p>
<p>31. Other security incidents, most often attributed largely to the FRCI and which have 
given rise to violations of the right to life among the civilian population, have been 
documented throughout the country; at least 38 people have been killed during armed 
robberies and hold-ups that sometimes involve highway robbers. 
</p>
<p>32. Following the destabilization operations conducted by assailants since August, a 
large number of civilians as well as military personnel have been arrested and detained for 
their alleged participation in these attacks. In August alone, more than 382 people were 
arrested for jeopardizing State security, some of whom were subjected to cruel, inhuman 
and degrading treatment and 2 of whom died as a result of acts of torture. Serious cases of 
torture using electricity have been reported, in particular at San Pedro where the Expert 
received increasingly recurrent allegations of torture committed within the Groupement 
tactique du Sud-Ouest (South West Battle Group) (GTSO). 
</p><p>33. With regard to detention, on 30 October 2012 more than 250 people remained in 
arbitrary detention, more than 132 had been released and 131 had been placed in preventive 
detention in various detention centres around the country. Others, detained incommunicado 
or beyond the statutory custody limits, had not been brought before a judge. It should be 
noted that the majority of those who were arrested are, or were, held not only in regular 
detention centres but also in centres inappropriate for civilians, such as various other FRCI 
camps. The Expert further notes that the statutory custody limits are not always respected 
and that detainees are often held in illegal detention centres, such as [on the premises of] 
the Anti-Riot Squad, the Armed Forces Headquarters, the Republican Guard, the Adjam&#233; 
Military Police Engineering Camp for civilians or [at] private houses occupied by the 
FRCI. 
</p>
<p>34. FPI officials and activists felt that they were the subject of particular attention 
following the attacks by assailants. On 6 August 2012, Mady Bouabr&#233;, a former Member of 
Parliament affiliated to the FPI, was arrested in No&#233;, near the border with Ghana and 
detained at the National Surveillance Directorate. On 12 August 2012, Alphonse Douaty, 
Deputy Secretary-General of the FPI, was arrested in Abidjan and transferred to the 
National Surveillance Directorate. On 26 August 2012, the Secretary-General of the FPI, 
Laurent Akoum, was questioned by police on his way to an FPI meeting in Adzop&#233;, 100 
kilometres from Abidjan. After staying at Agban camp, he was transferred to Abidjan 
Detention and Correction Centre (MACA) where the Expert was able to meet with him. Mr. 
Akoum is charged with disturbing public order for having asserted at a meeting that former 
President Gbagbo had been ill-treated while in detention in Korhogo and, in addition, for 
having contested the results of the presidential elections. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.13-10074 
</p>
<p>35. Other major figures who are members of the FPI have also been arrested in recent 
months in countries of the subregion. These include Justin Kon&#233; Katinan, exiled former 
Minister of Budget and spokesperson for the FPI under Laurent Gbagbo, who was arrested 
on 24 August 2012 in Accra, Ghana following the issuance of an international arrest 
warrant by the Ivorian judicial authorities for economic crimes committed during the post-
electoral crisis. After the extradition of Mo&#239;se Lida Kouassi, former Minister of Defence, 
who was arrested in Lom&#233;, Togo in June 2012, Mr. Katinan is the second FPI figure to be 
arrested in exile abroad. 
</p>
<p>36. The media sector in particular symbolizes the political polarization of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
The media landscape is divided into two radically opposed camps. One camp favours the 
ruling party while the other is close to the FPI of former President Gbagbo. This 
polarization of political life, which has been followed by a deteriorating security situation, 
has had a significant impact on freedom of expression and opinion. The National Press 
Council (CNP), which is the press regulatory body in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, imposed a six-day 
suspension on daily newspaper <i>Notre Voie</i> by its decision No. 14 of 6 September 2012 
following the publication of &#8220;photographs of figures from the former regime&#8221; of Laurent 
Gbagbo in violation of Presidential Order No. 2011-007 of 14 April 2011 annulling all 
regulatory acts introduced and individual decisions taken by the Government of Laurent 
Gbagbo since 4 December 2010. 
</p>
<p>37. The following week, the CNP further suspended six other daily newspapers with 
close links to former President Gbagbo for between one and two weeks for the same 
reasons. The measure was &#8220;lifted&#8221; one week later, after various figures intervened. 
</p>
<p>38. It was in this context that the Expert met with CNP officials, in order to obtain a 
clearer view of the situation of the press in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. According to the CNP, press 
analyses were often distorted and newspapers made numerous assertions but demonstrated 
little. They also published statements, accusations and unsubstantiated denunciations. Some 
newspapers made statements and did not let readers verify the information for themselves, 
providing them with elements that would help them to formulate an opinion. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Intercommunity violence 
</b></p>
<p>39. On the morning of 20 July 2012, the camp for displaced persons at Nahibly in 
Du&#233;kou&#233;, where more than 5,000 people were registered, was attacked by a thousand-
strong mob that arrived at the camp in waves of hundreds of individuals armed with clubs, 
machetes and sticks. Once it had formed, the mob converged on the camp and attacked the 
displaced persons living there, burning and destroying more than 80 per cent of the camp. 
</p>
<p>40. More than 8 people died as a result of this attack and some 60 were injured, 
including 1 woman. Six bodies were found at the camp and two others were found 
approximately 1 kilometre from the camp. According to the medical report issued by the 
hospital at Du&#233;kou&#233;, three of the victims were killed by gunshot wounds and the others died 
of severe burns. Cases of enforced disappearance were also reported. Survivors fled empty-
handed from the looting and destruction perpetrated during the attack. The market opposite 
the Catholic mission in Du&#233;kou&#233; and the parish annex for displaced persons were also set 
alight by the mob. Nevertheless, many displaced persons were able to return to their 
villages of origin, where the Expert was able to interview some of those who had fled the 
camp at Nahibly. 
</p>
<p>41. It should be noted that Nahibly camp housed a large majority of indigenous Gu&#233;r&#233;, 
who generally support the FPI of former President Gbagbo and who were afraid of 
returning to their homes after the post-electoral crisis from which many Ivorians now in 
exile in Liberia or Ghana originated. According to the mob that destroyed Nahibly, the mob </p>


<p>GE.13-10074 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>consisted of residents of Kokoma in Du&#233;kou&#233;, supported by Dozo and by FRCI troops, 
unchecked and determined to do battle with the camp residents who were suspected, 
whether rightly or wrongly, of being behind the wave of insecurity (murder, rape, robbery) 
that has affected Du&#233;kou&#233; in recent weeks. The culminating point of this insecurity was the 
assassination on the night of 19 to 20 July 2012 of four men living in Kokoma, a district 
populated by non-indigenous communities and, in particular, by the Malinke, an ethnic 
group traditionally close to the Rassemblement des r&#233;publicains (RDR), which is the ruling 
party. 
</p>
<p>42. In the days following the attack, the Prosecutor of Man went to Du&#233;kou&#233; and an 
investigation was launched. Six months after the events, no arrests have been made. On 10 
October 2012, a pit containing the remains of six people was discovered at Toguei in 
Du&#233;kou&#233;. Other places that supposedly contained bodies were reported in the same region. 
The Prosecutor of Man went to Du&#233;kou&#233; to verify this information and opened an 
investigation with a view to determining the cause of death of the persons concerned and 
possible links with the attack on Nahibly camp. 
</p>
<p>43. The Expert notes with grave concern that the patterns of alliances observed in the 
past between the security forces and non-State armed groups to defend a community close 
to the ruling party to the detriment of communities seen as supporting the opposition is 
being repeated in the west of the country. At the time of the former regime, the defence and 
security forces allied themselves with pro-Gbagbo militia and self-defence groups in order 
to defend the interests of the indigenous populations close to the FPI and, frequently, to 
violate the rights of the non-indigenous populations that supported the opposition. 
Nowadays, the same dynamic appears to be operating but in reverse; the FRCI and the 
Dozo are increasingly establishing themselves as the defenders of non-indigenous 
communities against indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>44. The Independent Expert has been informed that the attack occurred in the presence 
of the Regional Commissioner, the Dozo Chief in Du&#233;kou&#233; and FRCI officers. It should 
also be noted that since Nahibly camp was established, UNOCI troops have been sent to the 
site to monitor the camp from outside. In this context, six watchtowers were erected along 
the fence around the site. This provision did not prevent the attack on Nahibly camp; the 
fact that the UNOCI contingent took no action is of particular concern. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence against women and children 
</b></p>
<p>45. The situation of women and children also continues to give cause for concern, in 
particular in the Bouak&#233; region and in the west of the country, where a resurgence of acts of 
sexual violence has been noted. At least 90 cases of rape, of which 23 were gang rapes 
committed during armed attacks, have been documented throughout the country. Nineteen 
alleged perpetrators, including four FRCI troops, have been brought to trial. 
</p>
<p>46. The Independent Expert welcomes the efforts of numerous courts in prosecuting the 
perpetrators of sexual violence. Nevertheless, the crime of rape continues to be qualified as 
&#8220;indecent assault&#8221; by some courts, which diminishes the serious nature of the violations 
committed. The Expert deplores the high cost of the medical certificate required for the 
prosecution file in rape cases, which costs 50,000 CFA francs (approximately US$ 100), 
and also deplores the amicable agreements reached between families that prevent victims 
from taking legal action. 
</p>
<p>47. There have been 61 cases in which serious violations of children&#8217;s rights have been 
observed, as follows: 14 cases of violation of the right to life, 39 rapes, 4 abductions, 2 
school occupations and 2 cases in which children were used by Dozos on roadblocks. The 
Expert expresses his profound concern at the high number of cases of pregnancy among </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.13-10074 
</p>
<p>young girls in primary and secondary education, most frequently pregnant by their own 
teachers, in violation of the ethical code and the code of conduct regulating relations 
between teachers and pupils. 
</p>
<p>48. It was in this context that the bill revoking article 53 and amending articles 58, 59, 
60 and 67 of Act No. 64-375 of 7 October 1964 on marriage, as amended by Act No. 83-
800 of 2 August 1993, was adopted by the National Assembly on 21 November 2012. The 
new article 58 provides that: &#8220;The family is managed jointly by the spouses in the interest 
of the household and the children. Together, they provide moral and material guidance.&#8221; 
This represents a significant step forward in the area of equality and non-discrimination that 
will further the situation of human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. In view of the opposition that 
this legislation has aroused among some religious leaders, both Christian and Muslim, and 
among part of the population that remains attached to traditional roles for women, the 
Expert encourages the Government to develop a communication strategy in order to explain 
the scope and meaning of the new legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Independent Expert notes the remarkable progress achieved by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in 
respect of economic and social recovery. The national development programme attaches 
great importance to improving maternal and child health through programmes to increase 
the efficiency and growth of health services, family planning, immunization coverage and 
expanded emergency neonatal obstetrical care. In addition, the Government intends to 
introduce free targeted health care for mothers and for children under 5 years of age and to 
provide primary education for all. 
</p>
<p>50. Cases of violation of the right to property and of extortion and racketeering have 
been reported throughout the country, particularly in the west. Such incidents have mainly 
been committed in the context of FRCI operations supported by Dozos to confront the 
recent waves of attacks by assailants. Some members of the security forces have taken these 
operations as a pretext to enter homes and take objects of value such as computers, portable 
telephones, white goods and money. Numerous cases of extortion at roadblocks set up by 
the FRCI and Dozos throughout the country have also been reported. Such practices 
contribute to further impoverishing populations already traumatized and weakened by more 
than 10 years of crisis. 
</p>
<p>51. Many people who had been arbitrarily arrested were released after paying money to 
the FRCI troops who had detained them. The Expert was also informed of cases in which 
the families of detainees were held to ransom and required to pay money to certain 
authorities before being able to visit detained family members. In other cases, detainees did 
not receive visits because their families were not always able to collect the required 
amount. The bank accounts of many detainees remained blocked and their houses were 
destroyed or occupied by FRCI troops. The Expert considers that the prolonged freezing of 
the assets of some detainees involved in legal proceedings which, in some cases, can 
continue for some two years without their coming to trial, could constitute a violation of 
their economic and social rights and those of their families. It could also have an impact on 
their ability to obtain access to a legal representative of their choosing and, consequently, 
constitute an obstacle to a fair and equitable trial. </p>


<p>GE.13-10074 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Justice and the fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The National Commission of Inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Expert met with Paulette Badjo, President of the National Commission of 
Inquiry, who officially submitted the report of the Commission to the President of the 
Republic during a ceremony held on 8 August 2012 at the Presidential Palace in Abidjan. 
The report covers the period from 31 October 2010 to 15 May 2011 inclusive. 
</p>
<p>53. The report established, with regard to the number of victims and alleged 
perpetrators, that there had been a total of 3,248 deaths, attributed to the following actors: 
1,452 deaths caused by pro-Gbagbo forces; 727 deaths attributable to the FRCI; 200 deaths 
attributed to the Dozo; and 52 deaths attributed to various non-conventional forces. The 
report also noted 8,141 cases of ill-treatment, 345 cases of torture, 194 cases of rape, 265 
cases of enforced disappearance and 260 cases of arbitrary detention. In total, the 
Commission interviewed 15,875 victims and witnesses. 
</p>
<p>54. When he received the Commission&#8217;s report, President Ouattara emphasized the 
importance of the moment &#8220;for Ivorians, for those who live in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and for the 
international community, because this report was highly anticipated&#8221;. He then said that the 
National Commission of Inquiry had been established in order to seek the truth, end the 
impunity that prevailed in the country and promote reconciliation. The President said that 
he was satisfied with the significant work that had been carried out within the established 
deadlines and, in his turn, submitted the report to the then Prime Minister, Minister of 
Justice Jeannot Kouadio-Ahoussou so that he could &#8220;review it most attentively in order to 
take the necessary measures&#8221;. Lastly, the President promised that the report would be 
published and stated that all those who had committed wrongful acts would answer for 
them in court. 
</p>
<p>55. The Expert commends the outstanding high-quality and impartiality of the work 
accomplished by the members of the National Commission of Inquiry and the willingness 
of the Government, reaffirmed by the President of the Republic on this occasion, to combat 
impunity and to bring the alleged perpetrators of such acts to court. In this context, the 
Expert mentioned the follow-up to the recommendations of this important report during his 
meeting with the Public Prosecutor at the Court of Abidjan and the Government 
Commissioner at the Military Tribunal of Abidjan, who had not yet received a copy of the 
Commission&#8217;s report. The Expert expressed the hope that the publication of the report, 
which was the outcome of an internal process that reflected a laudable national desire to 
protect human rights, would give new impetus towards an impartial judiciary in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, which was a prerequisite for any genuine reconciliation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
</b></p>
<p>56. The trauma and emotional impact of 10 years of crisis has left indelible marks in the 
collective consciousness of the country. The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission could serve to promote catharsis at the national level, contribute to identifying 
traumatic stress points in the country&#8217;s imaginary landscape and, by giving them visibility 
through public hearings, contribute to promoting collective memory and shared emotions, 
which are the foundation of lasting reconciliation in the national consciousness. 
</p>
<p>57. In spite of the deficiencies and financial difficulties that the Commission 
encountered during its start-up phase and the delay in the implementation of its activities, it 
has developed a vision that integrates a certain number of elements not taken sufficiently 
into consideration when it was established, as a matter of urgency, by the President of the </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.13-10074 
</p>
<p>Republic on 13 July 2011. In this regard, the Expert notes with appreciation that the 
Commission has accepted the need for a national consultation process, based on broad 
participation at both the central and the local levels in order to establish the legitimacy of 
the Commission and to strengthen its legal framework, that takes into consideration the 
demands and expectations of Ivorians. The Expert also welcomes the forthcoming start of 
national consultations and the enhanced cooperation between the Commission and non-
governmental organizations. The Expert was able to visit one of the Commission&#8217;s local 
platforms in Du&#233;kou&#233;, run by a local non-governmental organization without adequate 
means, which reflects the gradual, although slow, progress of the Commission through the 
preparatory phase and towards the operational phase. 
</p>
<p>58. It should also be noted that the political, social and security environment in which 
the Commission functions has an impact on its activities and can make its task more 
complicated, given the recurrent tension in Ivorian society which can radicalize some 
political actors. In this context, the Commission is obliged to allocate more resources to the 
dialogue aspect of its work, which is not traditionally a part of the work of such 
commissions in other parts of the world; this means that the Commission&#8217;s mandate must 
be able to adapt to the political processes at work in society. This situation creates an 
inherent tension between the dialogue aspect [of the Commission&#8217;s work], which focuses 
chiefly on the present, and the truth-seeking dimension, which is more oriented to the past.  
</p>
<p>59. In spite of these constraints, the President of the Commission initiated dialogue with 
social pressure groups and political parties, including the FPI, after the attack on FRCI 
positions, in order to reduce tensions in the country and explore the possibility of genuinely 
reviving the reconciliation process. The political parties, including the FPI, welcomed this 
initiative, the findings and conclusions of which were submitted to the President of the 
Republic. 
</p>
<p>60. The Expert notes with concern that the missing link remains the concept of justice, 
which does not figure in the mandate, let alone the name, of the Commission. The concept 
of justice is crucial; there can be no peace and no reconciliation without justice, and efforts 
to achieve peace and reconciliation can not take the place of the demand for justice. The 
Expert further notes the absence of a coherent strategic vision at the State level with regard 
to the relationship between non-judicial and judicial mechanisms of transitional justice. 
Bridges need to be created between these different mechanisms so that they can cooperate 
more effectively on the basis of their complementary mandates. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National prosecutions 
</b></p>
<p>61. According to the Public Prosecutor at the Court of Abidjan, 8,500 people were 
interrogated in the context of preliminary investigations into murder and similar crimes, 
economic offences committed against a number of community organizations and financial 
organizations and threats to State security and public order. Some 115 persons were 
charged and detained for threats to State security and public order and 55 others, all 
associated with former President Gbagbo&#8217;s regime, were detained on charges of murder and 
similar crimes. 
</p>
<p>62. Investigations into the murder of former President of the Republic General Robert 
Gu&#233;&#239;, his wife and bodyguards &#8212; a case that is emblematic of the Ivorian crisis &#8212; also 
seem to have made significant progress. On 1 October 2012, the Military Procurator 
announced that Commander S&#233;ka Yapo Anselme had been charged with abduction and 
murder and that General Dogbo Bl&#233;, Lieutenant Colonel Katet Gnatoa and Captain 
Sakanoko Mory had been charged with abetting abduction and murder. </p>


<p>GE.13-10074 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Expert welcomes the fact that trials before the military court have begun. On 2 
October 2012, he attended the opening of the first hearing in the case of <i>The Prosecution v. 
General Dogbo Bl&#233; Brunot and four others</i>, the first major trial involving high-level 
military figures in respect of acts committed during the post-electoral crisis. The Expert 
deplores the slow pace of proceedings before the civil courts and the fact that the preventive 
detention of persons charged in the context of that crisis is being extended indefinitely. 
Preventive detention should be an exceptional measure and its abuse raises real human 
rights problems. Persons who have been arrested and detained on criminal charges must be 
brought promptly before a judge and tried within a reasonable period, or released. 
64. The Expert is concerned about the lack of impartiality in the current strategy for the 
pursuit of justice in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. No serious proceedings have yet been brought against 
members of the FRCI and their associates. The Expert raised this question when he met 
with the Public Prosecutor of Abidjan; the Public Prosecutor replied that the magistrate of 
the ninth investigations office in charge of crimes committed in Du&#233;kou&#233; during the post-
electoral crisis had initiated proceedings, but was not able to go to the west of the country 
for security reasons. He said that the slow pace of justice was more dependent on the 
investigations offices, but that the civil proceedings should have started last November, 
although they had not done so. 
</p>
<p>65. The Expert takes note of the charges of genocide against 48 persons including seven 
figures such as Simone Gbagbo; former Prime Minister Pascal Affi N&#8217;Guessan; Genevi&#232;ve 
Bro Gr&#233;b&#233;, the President of Femmes patriotes; former Deputy Chairperson of FPI, 
Aboudrahamane Sangar&#233;; former Minister of Finance D&#233;sir&#233; Noel Laurent Dallo; Alcide 
Dj&#233;dj&#233;, Minister for Foreign Affairs in the last, unrecognized Government of former 
President Gbagbo; Professor Gilbert Ak&#233; N&#8217;gbo, Prime Minister in the last, unrecognized 
Government of former President Gbagbo; and former Commander of the Presidential 
Guard, General Bruno Dogbo Bl&#233;. The other charges of genocide are against 41 Ivorian 
nationals extradited from Liberia in June 2012 following an attack on UNOCI 
peacekeepers.  
</p>
<p>66. The Expert notes with concern the gaps in the definition of the crime of genocide in 
the Ivorian Criminal Code, which does not meet the international standards set out in 
international instruments, in particular the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of 
the Crime of Genocide of 9 December 1946 and the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court. The definition of genocide contained in article 137 of the Criminal Code is 
ambivalent and inexact; it is broader than that contained in international instruments, 
particularly as it applies the term &#8220;genocide&#8221; to political groups, while at the same time it is 
more restrictive, failing to apply the term to racial groups and ignoring the concept of &#8220;as 
such&#8221; associated with victim groups. 
</p>
<p>67. In view of these shortcomings, observers rightly wonder whether the genocide 
charges are relevant in the Ivorian context and whether the national justice system might be 
discredited if it were perceived to have recourse to legal precepts of the utmost gravity 
without the necessary rigour. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Prosecutions before the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>68. On 26 September 2012, the Council of Ministers adopted two bills in preparation for 
the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. One was a bill 
amending the Constitution, with a view to enabling C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to ratify the Rome 
Statute, while the other was a bill authorizing the Head of State to ratify the Rome Statute. 
The National Assembly adopted Act No. 2012-1134 of 13 December 2012 concerning the 
ICC, introducing article 85 bis under title VI of the Constitution, according to which: &#8220;The 
Republic may recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court as provided for </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.13-10074 
</p>
<p>under the Treaty signed on 17 July 1998.&#8221; The President of the Republic promulgated the 
said Act by decree No. 2012-1135 of 13 December 2012. 
</p>
<p>69. On 22 November 2012, Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC unsealed the warrant of 
arrest issued against Simone Gbagbo for four charges of crimes against humanity. 
According to the arrest warrant, initially issued under seal on 29 February 2012, Ms. 
Gbagbo is criminally liable under article 25 (3) (a) of the Rome Statute for the crimes 
against humanity of murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, other inhumane acts 
and acts of persecution committed in the territory of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire during the period 
between 16 December 2010 and 12 April 2011. 
</p>
<p>70. On 5 December 2012, Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Civil Liberties 
Gn&#233;n&#233;ma Mamadou Coulibaly stated in reply to questions from the press concerning the 
reaction of the Government to the arrest warrant issued against the former First Lady that 
the Ivorian authorities had already taken note of the request and reserved the right to make 
an official statement in a timely manner. This position, reiterated by the new Prime 
Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, raised legitimate questions about his motives and about 
the implications for the scope of the ratification of the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Prison conditions 
</b></p>
<p>71.  The national authorities, supported by UNOCI and partner countries, set to work to 
bring prisons, which are an important link in the chain of criminal justice, back into service. 
At present, 32 out of 33 prisons accommodating some 7,365 detainees have been brought 
back into service. Despite the efforts of national authorities and partners, the results are 
mixed; although prisons have come back into service, it is a struggle to resume normal 
operation, particularly with regard to the detention and custody of persons in preventive 
detention. More than 410 detainees have escaped, sometimes with the use of force, which 
has led to the death of 8 detainees. 
</p>
<p>72. Following the attacks in August and repeated prison escapes by detainees, the 
National Security Council, headed by the President of the Republic, deemed it necessary to 
strengthen prison oversight by recruiting 2,000 prison guards. This is a timely decision that 
could considerably improve prison administration. However, in order for this measure to be 
effective, the capacity of the personnel recruited to receive and assimilate training on the 
one hand and, on the other hand, their capacity to prove their professionalism must be taken 
into account. Consequently, the recruitment process should be rigorous in order to exclude, 
for example, persons in conflict with the law or even former detainees. 
</p>
<p>73.  The Expert was able to visit places of detention in Bouna, Boundiali, Katiola, 
Korhogo, Odienn&#233; and Abidjan. In general terms, the detainees with whom he met 
appeared to be in reasonable physical condition. They were in contact with their lawyers 
and many received visits from family members. All complained in strong terms about the 
length of their detention without trial. Simone Gbagbo showed some signs of physical 
weakness. She was moved from Odi&#233;nn&#233; for security reasons some time ago, which has had 
an impact on her health. Although she receives regular treatment, she complains that the 
physicians she sees are not of her choosing. She also complains that she does not receive 
visits from her family members and only receives news of them through her lawyers. In 
Katiola and Boundiali, some detainees complained that they shared space with persons 
detained for common crimes, with the attendant security risks. 
</p>
<p>74. On his first visit to Bouna, the Expert met with 21 detainees, including former Prime 
Minister Pascal Affi N&#8217;Guessan, former Minister of Defence Mo&#239;se Lida Kouassi, recently 
extradited from Togo, and Michel Gbagbo, son of former President Gbagbo. No ill-
treatment was reported. Michel Gbagbo has not received a visit from his family since his </p>


<p>GE.13-10074 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>arrest. He was evacuated to Abidjan, where he stayed for three months for medical 
treatment. The most difficult detention conditions were encountered at the Compagnie 
territoriale de Korhogo (CTK) in Korhogo where former senior Forces de d&#233;fense et de

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The democratic, economic and social reconstruction of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire forms 
part of a process the scope and significance of which must be measured against the 
long crisis that caused a culture of violence to predominate in society and profoundly 
disrupted the country&#8217;s political, economic and social institutions. Two existential 
issues continue to trouble the collective consciousness, namely, the root causes of the 
crisis and anxiety about the possibility of reconciliation. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The three fundamental aspects of the crisis &#8212; its moral depths, its political 
source and its social impact &#8212; must be considered together and in terms of the 
following major challenges: democratic, economic and social reconstruction; the 
promotion of a national political ethic; the restoration of community life; and the 
eradication of the culture of violence. The democratic reconstruction taking place at 
the institutional level is being held back by entrenched political polarization and the 
lack of progress in establishing genuine political pluralism, in particular by the non-
participation of the main opposition party, the FPI, in the permanent framework for 
dialogue. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The urgency of the need for political reconciliation and for democratic, 
economic and social reconstruction is made stronger by the crisis in Mali, the political, 
military, religious and economic implications of which could destabilize all countries 
in the region profoundly and in the long term. A multicultural, democratic, 
egalitarian society that respects human rights is the best defence against this new peril 
that is fuelled by violence, intolerance and discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Independent Expert recommends that the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
should give the highest priority to boosting the democratic process, promoting human 
rights and consolidating the economic and social reconstruction [process]. The 
Government must sustain its momentum despite the current attempts to destabilize 
the security situation, the objective of which is precisely to derail the process. </b></p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.13-10074 
</p>
<p>80. <b>Democratic reconstruction is a key factor in national reconciliation and should 
be based on the effective achievement of inclusive political pluralism and the vigorous 
and vigilant promotion of human rights. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Independent Expert therefore reiterates his recommendation that ethnic, 
cultural and religious pluralism should be enshrined in the Ivorian Constitution as a 
basic value of the Ivorian people. Significant political initiatives should be made in 
order to ensure that the permanent framework for dialogue, which is a positive step, 
fully reflects the political diversity of Ivorian society. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire must consolidate democracy, consensus and peace at the national 
level, in view of the increasing instability and division inherent in the crisis in Mali 
and the Sahel. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Urgent and credible measures must be taken to ensure effective respect for 
human rights, for which a robust institutional and legal framework exists, in 
particular by State security forces; such measures should be based on training, the 
punishment of established human rights violations and more rigorous filtering under 
the DDR process. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The scope of the progress being made in the promotion and realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights must be enhanced by laying emphasis, through 
education, on the inseparability of those rights from civil and political rights, within 
the responsible Government bodies as much as among the population. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Women and children, who are the main victims of the crisis but are also a 
fundamental element of reconciliation, must be priority beneficiaries of the economic 
and social recovery and fully exercise the right to education. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The mandate, composition, organization and functioning of the National 
Human Rights Commission, which plays a fundamental role in promoting and 
[ensuring] respect for human rights, must be in conformity with the Paris Principles 
and in particular with regard to its independence and resources. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Two significant steps should be taken to implement the report of the National 
Commission of Inquiry, which is a balanced document that favours reconciliation: the 
report should be published (respecting the confidentiality of sources and witnesses), 
and an independent structure with the appropriate means to follow up on the 
implementation of the report&#8217;s recommendations should be established. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>It would also be appropriate to establish a platform for cooperation between 
the State institutions responsible for transitional justice. The necessary resources must 
be made available to the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the 
mandate of which is more appropriate than ever. The formal absence of the concept of 
justice from the Commission&#8217;s mandate should be mitigated by taking a holistic, 
proactive and three-dimensional view of the truth that would involve looking 
objectively at the facts, identifying those responsible and identifying the root causes. 
</b>89. <b>Measures taken to try detainees and provisionally release a significant number 
of figures from the former regime must be made more credible through greater 
impartiality on the part of the judiciary towards those recognized as being responsible 
for massive violations of human rights of all political persuasions, including those seen 
as being close to the ruling power. Conditions of detention must be subject to more 
systematic scrutiny.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The positive ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court must be followed by firm, unreserved cooperation with the ICC to ensure that 
its ratification is seen as credible by the international community. </b></p>

</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Independent Expert reiterates his recommendation with regard to the 
active promotion of traditional values, practices and mechanisms in order to foster 
coexistence and the mobilization of religious and traditional leaders for that purpose. 
The cultural and artistic creativity of the Ivorian people, particularly Ivorian youth, 
must be systematically encouraged and promoted in order to further reconciliation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Recommendations to the international community 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Independent Expert recommends that the international community should 
maintain and strengthen its support to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in order not only to sustain the 
democratic process and the current process of economic and social reconstruction but 
also to further pluralism and national reconciliation, the progress of which is 
jeopardized by political polarization.  
</b>93. <b>The fact that the security situation is weakened by the rise of a culture of 
violence and by repeated attempts to destabilize State security is justification for 
lifting the embargo and providing technical reinforcement to State security agencies 
on an urgent basis. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The challenge of consolidating the democratic, economic and social situation in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire needs to be addressed by the international community in view of the 
inherent risks of the crisis in Mali, which could destabilize the region in which C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire is a lead actor, with profound and lasting effect. One of the major challenges 
for national reconciliation is convincing the population of the impartiality of the 
national judiciary, as much as of the International Criminal Court.
