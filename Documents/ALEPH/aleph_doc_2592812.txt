Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
This  Quarterly  Report  and  the  exhibits  attached  hereto  (the  “Quarterly  Report”)  contain  “forward-looking
statements”  within  the  meaning  of  applicable  US  and  Canadian  securities  laws.  Such  forward-looking
statements  concern  Energy  Fuels  Inc.’s  (the  “Company’s”  or  “Energy  Fuels’”)  anticipated  results  and
progress of the Company’s operations in future periods, planned exploration, and, if warranted, development
of  its  properties,  plans  related  to  its  business,  and  other  matters  that  may  occur  in  the  future.  These
statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results, estimates of
amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.
Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans,
projections, objectives, schedules, assumptions, future events, or performance (often, but not always, using
words  or  phrases  such  as  “expects”  or  “does  not  expect”,  “is  expected”,  “anticipates”  or  “does  not
anticipate”, “plans”, “estimates” or “intends”, or stating that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”,
“would”, “might” or “will” be “taken, occur or be achieved”) are not statements of historical fact and may be
forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  the  opinions  and  estimates  of  management  as  of  the  date  such
statements are made. Energy Fuels believes that the expectations reflected in this forward-looking information
are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct,  and  such
forward-looking information included in, or incorporated by reference into, this Quarterly Report should not be
unduly relied upon. This information speaks only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.
Readers  are  cautioned  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to  rely  on  any  such  forward-looking  statements  and
information as creating any legal rights, and that the statements and information are not guarantees and may
involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and that actual results are likely to differ (and may differ
materially) and objectives and strategies may differ or change from those expressed or implied in the forward-
looking statements or information as a result of various factors. Such risks and uncertainties include risks
generally  encountered  in  the  exploration,  development,  operation,  and  closure  of  mineral  properties  and
processing  facilities.  Forward-looking  statements  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  known  and  unknown  risks,
uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation:

expected mineral extraction and recovery levels and costs;
actions taken by regulatory authorities with respect to mineral extraction and recovery activities;
risks associated with the Company’s dependence on third parties in the provision of transportation and other
critical services;

risks  posed  by  fluctuations  in  share  price  levels, exchange  rates  and  interest  rates,  and  general  economic
conditions;
risks inherent in the Company’s and industry analysts’ forecasts or predictions of future uranium and vanadium
price levels;
fluctuations in the market prices of uranium and vanadium, which are cyclical and subject to substantial price
fluctuations;
failure to obtain suitable uranium sales terms, including spot and term sale contracts;
risks associated with asset impairment as a result of market conditions;
risks associated with lack of access to markets and the ability to access capital;
the market price of Energy Fuels’ securities;
public resistance to nuclear energy or uranium extraction and recovery;
uranium industry competition and international trade restrictions;

risks related to our ability to maintain our inclusion in various stock indices;

risks related to recent market events;
risks related to our issuance of additional common shares;
risks related to acquisition and integration issues;
risks related to defects in title to our mineral properties;
risks related to our outstanding debt; and
risks related to our securities.
Although we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as
anticipated, estimated or intended. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, believed,
estimated,  or  expected.  We  caution  readers  not  to  place  undue  reliance  on  any  such  forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to
subsequently revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such
statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Statements relating to “Mineral
Reserves” or “Mineral Resources” are deemed to be forward-looking information, as they involve the implied
assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions that the Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources
described may be profitably extracted in the future.
We qualify all the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report by the foregoing cautionary
statements.
Cautionary Note to United States Investors Concerning Disclosure of Mineral Resources
5
This Quarterly Report contains certain disclosure that has been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of  Canadian  securities  laws,  which  differ  from  the  requirements  of  United  States’  securities  laws.  Unless
otherwise  indicated,  all  reserve  and  resource  estimates  included  in  this  Quarterly  Report,  and  in  the
documents  incorporated  by  reference  herein,  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Canadian  National
Instrument  43-101  - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) classification system. NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian
Securities Administrators (the “CSA”) which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes
of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. As a company incorporated in Canada, we
estimate and report our resources and our current reserves according to the definitions set forth in NI 43-101.
Canadian  standards,  including  NI  43-101,  differ  significantly  from  the  requirements  of  the  United  States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and reserve and resource information contained herein, or
incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report, and in the documents incorporated by reference herein,
may  not  be  comparable  to  similar  information  disclosed  by  companies  reporting  under  only  United  States
standards.  In  particular,  and  without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  the  term  “resource”  does  not
equate to the term “reserve” under SEC Industry Guide 7. Under United States standards, mineralization may
not  be  classified  as  a  “reserve”  unless  the  determination  has  been  made  that  the  mineralization  could  be
economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. Under SEC
Industry Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report reserves; the three-
year historical average price, to the extent possible, is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate
reserves; and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental
authority.
The SEC’s disclosure standards under Industry Guide 7 normally do not permit the inclusion of information
concerning “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” or “inferred mineral resources” or
other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute “reserves” by
United States standards in documents filed with the SEC. United States investors should also understand that
“inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to their economic
and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an “inferred mineral resource” will ever be
upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimated “inferred mineral resources” may not form
the basis of feasibility or prefeasibility studies. United States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or
any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves. Investors
are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an “inferred mineral resource” exists or is economically or
legally mineable.
Disclosure  of  “contained  pounds”  or  “contained  ounces”  in  a  resource  estimate  is  permitted  disclosure
under  Canadian  regulations;  however,  the  SEC  normally  only  permits  issuers  to  report  mineralization  that
does not constitute “reserves” by SEC standards as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit
measures. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of “reserves” are also not the same as those of the
SEC,  and  reserves  reported  by  the  Company  in  compliance  with  NI  43-101  may  not  qualify  as  “reserves”
under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein
may not be comparable to information made public by companies that report in accordance with United States
standards.

ENERGY FUELS INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016
(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars except share and per share amounts)
1.
THE COMPANY AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Energy Fuels Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the Province of Alberta and was continued under the
Business Corporations Act (Ontario, Canada).
Energy Fuels Inc. and its subsidiary companies (collectively “the Company” or “EFI”) are engaged in uranium
extraction,  recovery  and  sales  of  uranium  from  mineral  properties  and  the  recycling  of  uranium  bearing
materials  generated  by  third  parties.  As  a  part  of  these  activities  the  Company  also  acquires,  explores,
evaluates and, if warranted, permits uranium properties. The Company’s final uranium product, uranium oxide
concentrates (“U3O8”  or  “uranium  concentrates”),  is  sold  to  customers  for  further  processing  into  fuel  for
nuclear reactors.
The Company is an exploration stage mining company as defined by the United States (“US”) Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7 (the “SEC Industry Guide 7”) as it has not established the
existence of proven or probable reserves on any of our properties.
2.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”) and are presented in thousands of US dollars (“USD”)
except per share amounts. Certain footnote disclosures have share prices which are presented in Canadian
dollars (“Cdn$”).
The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without
audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and note disclosures normally
included  in  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  US  GAAP  have  been  condensed  or  omitted
pursuant  to  such  rules  and  regulations,  although  the  Company  believes  that  the  disclosures  included  are
adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
In  management’s  opinion,  these  unaudited  interim  financial  statements  reflect  all  adjustments,  consisting
solely  of  normal  recurring  items,  which  are  necessary  for  the  fair  presentation  of  the  Company’s  financial
position, results of operations and cash flows on a basis consistent with that of the Company’s prior audited
consolidated  financial  statements.  However,  the  results  of  operations  for  the  interim  periods  may  not  be
indicative  of  results  to  be  expected  for  the  full  fiscal  year.  Therefore  these  unaudited  interim  financial
statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  audited  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  and
summary of significant accounting policies included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-
company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Fair value measurement
In  May  2015,  ASU  No.  2015-07  was  issued  related  to  investments  for  which  fair  value  is  measured,  or  are
eligible  to  be  measured,  using  the  net  asset  value  per  share  practical  expedient.  This  update  removes  the
requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using
the  net  asset  value  per  share  practical  expedient.  The  amendment  also  removes  certain  disclosure
requirements  for  these  investments.  This  update  will  impact  the  annual  disclosure  related  to  pension  plan
assets measured at fair value. This update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after
December 15, 2015. Adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016 had no impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Debt issuance costs
In  April  2015,  ASU  No.  2015-03  was  issued  related  to  debt  issuance  costs.  This  update  simplifies  the
presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the
corresponding debt liability. The update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after
December 15, 2015. Adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016 had no impact on the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Consolidations
In February 2015, ASU No. 2015-02 was issued related to consolidations. This update makes some targeted
changes  to  current  consolidation  guidance  and  impacts  both  the  voting  and  the  variable  interest
consolidation  models.  In  particular,  the  update  changes  how  companies  determine  whether  limited
partnerships or similar entities are variable interest entities. The update is effective in fiscal years, including
interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016
had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements not yet adopted
The FASB issued the following new and revised standards and amendments, which are not yet effective which
may have future applicability to the Company:
Investments
In January 2016, ASU No. 2016-01 was issued related to financial instruments. The new guidance requires
entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the
equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. This new guidance also
updates  certain  disclosure  requirements  for  these  investments.  This  update  is  effective  in  fiscal  years,
including  interim  periods,  beginning  after  December  15,  2017,  and  early  adoption  is  not  permitted.  The
Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on the financial statements.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 which core principle is that a lessee should recognize the
assets and the liabilities that arise from leases, including operating leases. Under the new requirements, a
lessee will recognize in the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and the right-of-
use asset representing the right to the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of twelve
months or less, the lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not
to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses
and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from the previous GAAP. The
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within such
fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires a modified retrospective transition method with
the option to elect a package of practical expedients. The Company is evaluating the effect of this amendment
and the impact it will have on the Company’s financial statements.
12
Going Concern
In  August  2014,  ASU  2014-15  guidance  was  issued  which  provides  guidance  about  management’s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern  and  to  provide  related  footnote  disclosures.  The  amendments  require  management  to  assess  an
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are
currently  in  US  auditing  standards.  Specifically,  the  amendments  (1)  provide  a  definition  of  the  term
substantial  doubt,  (2)  require  an  evaluation  every  reporting  period  including  interim  periods,  (3)  provide
principles for considering the mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when
substantial  doubt  is  alleviated  as  a  result  of  consideration  of  management’s  plans,  (5)  require  an  express
statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a
period  of  one  year  after  the  date  that  the  financial  statements  are  issued  (or  available  to  be  issued).  The
amendments in this update shall be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods  within  annual  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2016,  with  early  application  permitted.  The
Company is currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Financial instruments
In January 2016, ASU 2016-01 was issued related to financial instruments. The update intends to enhance the
reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial instruments with more decision-useful
information and addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of
financial instruments. The update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods beginning on or after
December  15,  2017.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  this  guidance  and  the  impact  it  will  have  on  the
financial statements.
3.
ACQUISITION OF THE ALTA MESA ISR PROJECT
On  June  16,  2016,  the  Company  acquired  100%  of  the  membership  interests  of  EFR  Alta  Mesa  LLC  (“Alta
Mesa”)  (formerly  named  “Mesteña  Uranium,  LLC”)  and  its  related  companies,  together  referred  to  as  “Alta
Mesa”. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the sellers of Alta Mesa received 4,551,824 common
shares of the Company.
Alta  Mesa’s  primary asset is the Alta Mesa ISR Project (the “Alta Mesa Project”) located in Texas. The Alta
Mesa  Project  is  a fully-permitted  and  licensed  production  facility  that  is  not  currently  operating. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of assets as Alta Mesa does not meet the definition of a business
under  ASC  Topic  805,  Business  Combinations because  the  assets  in  Alta  Mesa  do  not  have  developed
wellfields  which  are  a key  process  for  extraction  of  uranium.  The  development  can  only  commence  once
uranium prices improve and economic feasibility of the Alta Mesa Project is established. The measurement of
the purchase consideration was based on the market price of the Company's common stock on June 16, 2016
of  $2.50  per  share. The total transaction costs incurred through June 30, 2016 by the Company were $1.29
million which were capitalized as part of the purchase consideration.
The aggregate fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows on the acquisition date:

Issuance of 4,551,824 common shares

The purchase price was allocated as follows:

The  Property,  plant  and  equipment  includes  the  value ascribed to the processing plant and equipment.
The mineral properties acquired as part of the acquisition of Alta Mesa in 2016 do not have proven and
probable reserves under SEC Industry Guide 7. Accordingly, all subsequent expenditures at the Alta Mesa
Project and equipment, which do not have any alternative use, and expenditures on mineral properties are
expensed as incurred.

On  May  27,  2016,  the  Company  issued  1,212,173  shares  to acquire the remaining 40% interest of the Roca
Honda project for consideration of $2.68 million as well as an additional $4.5 million in cash payable upon first
commencement of commercial mineral extraction. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of assets as
Roca Honda does not meet the definition of a business under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations because
the Company does not currently have the resources, both inputs and processes, to apply to the Roca Honda
property in order to extract uranium.

Revision of estimates is as a result of a change in estimates of the amount or timing of cash flows to settle
asset retirement obligations. Changes to the asset retirement obligations are recorded in profit and loss.
The asset retirement obligations of the Company are subject to legal and regulatory requirements. Estimates
of  the  costs  of  reclamation  are  reviewed  periodically  by  the  applicable  regulatory  authorities.  The  above
provision  represents  the  Company’s  best  estimate  of  the  present  value  of  future  reclamation  costs,
discounted using credit adjusted risk-free interest rates ranging from 9.5% to 11.5% and an inflation rate of
2.0% (December 31, 2015 – 2.0%). The total undiscounted decommissioning liability at June 30, 2016 is $41.23
million (December 31, 2015 - $32.30 million). Reclamation costs are expected to be incurred between 2016 and
2038  in  the  following  manner:  2016  –  2020  -  $4.67  million,  2021  –  2025  -  $9.41  million,  2026  –  2030  -  $2.69
million, 2031 – 2035 - $8.78 million, 2036 – 2038 - $15.67 million.

in favor of the State of Utah, the State of Wyoming, the applicable state regulatory agencies in Colorado and
Arizona and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for estimated reclamation costs associated with the White
Mesa  mill  and  mining  properties.  Cash  equivalents  are  short-term  highly  liquid  investments  with  original
maturities of three months or less. The restricted cash will be released when the Company has reclaimed a
mineral property or restructured the surety and collateral arrangements. See Note 12 for a discussion of the
Company’s surety bond commitments.

(a) On July 24, 2012, the Company completed a bought deal public offering of 22,000 floating-rate convertible
unsecured  subordinated debentures originally maturing June 30, 2017 (the “Debentures”), but amended
August 4, 2016 to mature on December 31, 2020. The Debentures were issued at a price of Cdn$1,000
per  Debenture  for  gross  proceeds  of  $21.55 million  (the  “Offering”).  The  Debentures  were  originally
convertible into common shares at the option of the holder at a conversion price of Cdn$15.00 per common
share, but was amended on August 4, 2016 to be a conversion price of Cdn$4.15 per common share.
Interest  is  paid  in  cash  and  in  addition,  unless  an  event  of default  has  occurred  and  is  continuing,  the
Company may elect, from time to time, subject to applicable regulatory approval, to satisfy its obligation to
pay interest on the Debentures, on the date it is payable under the indenture (i) in cash; (ii) by delivering
sufficient common shares to the debenture trustee, for sale, to satisfy the interest obligations in accordance
with the indenture in which event holders of the Debentures will be entitled to receive a cash payment
equal to the proceeds of the sale of such common shares; or (iii) any combination of (i) and (ii).
 
The Debentures accrue interest, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each
year at a fluctuating rate, of not less than 8.5% and not more than 13.5%, indexed to the simple average
spot  price  of  uranium  as  reported  on  the  UxC  Weekly  Indicator  Price. Interest  can  be  paid  in  cash  or
issuance of the Company’s common shares. The Debentures may be redeemed in whole or part, at par
plus  accrued interest  and  unpaid  interest  by  the  Company  between  June  30,  2015  and  June 30,  2017
subject  to  certain  terms  and  conditions,  provided  the  volume weighted  average  trading  price  of  the
common  shares  of  the  Company  on  the TSX  during  the  20  consecutive  trading  days  ending  five  days
preceding  the date on which the notice of redemption is given is not less than 125% of the  conversion
price.
 
Upon redemption or at maturity, the Company will repay the indebtedness represented by the Debentures
by paying to the debenture trustee in Canadian dollars an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Debentures which are to be redeemed or which have matured, as applicable, together
with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
 
Subject  to  any  required  regulatory  approval  and  provided no  event  of  default  has  occurred  and  is
continuing, the Company has the option to satisfy its obligation to repay the Cdn$1,000 principal amount of
the Debentures, in whole or in part, due at redemption or maturity, upon at least 40 days’ and not more
than  60  days’  prior  notice,  by delivering  that  number  of  common  shares  obtained  by  dividing  the
Cdn$1,000 principal amount of the Debentures maturing or to be redeemed as applicable, by 95% of the
volume-weighted  average  trading  price  of  the common  shares  on  the  TSX  during  the  20  consecutive
trading days ending five trading days preceding the date fixed for redemption or the maturity date, as the
case may be.
 
On August 4, 2016, the Company, by a vote of the Debentureholders, extended the maturity date of the
Debentures from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2020, reduced the conversion price of the Debentures
from Cdn$15.00 to Cdn$4.15 per Common Share of the Company. In addition, a redemption provision was
added that will enable the Company, upon giving not less than 30 days notice to Debentureholders,  to
redeem the Debentures, for cash, in whole or in part at any time after June 30, 2019, but prior to maturity, at
a price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest (less any
tax required by law to be deducted) on such Debentures up to but excluding the redemption date. A right
(in favor of each Debentureholder) was also added to give the Debentureholders the option to require the
Company  to  purchase,  for cash,  on  the  previous  maturity  date  of  June  30,  2017,  up  to  20%  of  the
Debentures held by the Debentureholders at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount purchased plus
accrued  and  unpaid  interest  (less  any  tax required  by  law  to  be  deducted).  In  addition,  certain  other
amendments  were made  to  the  Indenture,  as  required  by  the  U.S.  Trust  Indenture  Act  of  1939,  as
amended, and with respect to the addition of a U.S. Trustee in compliance therewith, as well as to remove
provisions of the Indenture that no longer apply, such as U.S. securities law restrictions that are no longer
relevant.
In accordance with the revised terms approved on August 4, 2016, the Company has classified 20% of the
principal amount of the debenture as a current liability.
The debentures are classified as fair value through profit or loss where the debentures are measured at fair
(b)
(c)
value  based  on the  closing  price  on  the  TSX  (a  level  1  measurement)  and  changes  are recognized  in
earnings.  For  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  the  Company recorded  a  loss  on  revaluation  of
convertible debentures of $0.99 million (June 30, 2015 – $0.89 million).
 
In February 2015 the Company issued a secured note in the amount of $0.45 million for a 50% interest in a
joint venture with an effective interest rate of 7%. In February 2016 the Company amended the terms of the
note to include a onetime payment of $0.05 million on February 13, 2016 and a payment of $0.45 million
due on the date on which ore from the Wate Project is successfully processed through a mill into uranium
concentrates.
 
The  Company  through  its  acquisition  of  Uranerz  assumed  a loan  through  the  Wyoming  Industrial
Development Revenue Bond program (the "Loan"). The Loan has an annual interest rate of 5.75% and is
repayable over seven years, maturing on October 15, 2020. The Loan originated on December 3, 2013
and required the payment of interest only for the first year, with the amortization of principal plus interest
over  the  remaining six  years.  The  Loan  can  be  repaid  earlier  than  its  maturity  date  if  the Company  so
chooses without penalty or premium. The Loan is secured by most of the assets of the Company’s wholly
owned subsidiary, Uranerz, including mineral properties, the processing facility, and equipment as well as
a n assignment  of  all  of  Uranerz’  rights,  title  and  interest  in  and  to  its product  sales  contracts  and  other
agreements. Uranerz is also subject to dividend restrictions. Principal and interest are paid on a quarterly
basis on the first day of January, April, July and October. At June 30, 2016 the loan had an outstanding
balance of $15.62 million of which the current portion of the note was $3.13 million.

purchase  warrant,  or  a  total  of  5,031,250  Shares and  2,515,625  Warrants.  Each  warrant  is  exercisable  until
March  14,  2019 and  entitles  the  holder  thereof  to  acquire  one  Share  upon  exercise  at  an exercise  price  of
US$3.20 per share. These warrants are accounted for as a derivative liability, as the functional currency of the
entity issuing the warrant is Cdn$.
The  following  weighted  average  assumptions  were  used  for  the  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model  to
calculate the $2.09 million of fair value for the 2,515,625 warrants issued in connection with the public offering
in March 2016.

warrants, respectively, and the potential conversion of the uranium debentures have been excluded from the

10. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The  Company,  under  the  2015  Omnibus  Equity  Incentive  Compensation  Plan  (the  “Compensation  Plan”),
maintains a stock incentive plan for directors, executives, eligible employees and consultants. Stock incentive
awards include employee stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). The Company issues new shares
of common stock to satisfy exercises and vesting under all of its stock incentive awards. At June 30, 2016, a
total of 5,765,387 shares were authorized for stock incentive plan awards.
19
Employee Stock Options
The  Company,  under  the  Compensation  Plan  may  grant  options  to  directors,  executives,  employees  and
consultants  to  purchase  common  shares  of  the  Company.  The  exercise  price  of  the  options  is  set  as  the
higher of the Company’s closing share price on the day before the grant date or the five-day volume weighted
average price. Stock options granted under the Compensation Plan generally vest over a period of two years
or more and are generally exercisable over a period of five years from the grant date not to exceed 10 years.
The value of each option award is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes Option Valuation Model.
There were 0.42 million options granted in the six months ended June 30, 2016 (six months ended June 30,
2015 – 0.13 million). At June 30, 2016, there were 2.21 million options outstanding with 1.96 million options
exercisable, at a weighted average exercise price of $6.54, with a weighted average remaining contractual life
of 4.27 years. The aggregate intrinsic value of the fully vested shares was $0.03 million.
The fair value of the options granted under the Compensation Plan for the six months ended June 30, 2016
was  estimated  at  the  date  of  grant,  using  the  Black-Scholes  Option  Valuation  Model,  with  the  following
weighted-average assumptions:

The  Company  grants  RSUs  to  executives  and  eligible  employees.  Awards  are  determined  as  a  target
percentage of base salary and vest over periods of three years. Prior to vesting, holders of restricted stock
units do not have the right to vote the underlying shares. The restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture
risk  and  other  restrictions.  Upon  vesting,  the  employee  is  entitled  to  receive  one  share  of  the  Company’s
common stock for each restricted stock unit for no additional payment. During the three months ended June
30, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the issuance of 948,047 RSUs under the Compensation
Plan (2015 – 153,850).

In November, 2012, the Company was served with a Plaintiff’s Original Petition and Jury Demand in the District
Court  of  Harris  County,  Texas,  claiming  unspecified  damages  from  the  disease  and  injuries  resulting  from
mesothelioma  from  exposure  to  asbestos,  which  the  Plaintiff  claims  was  contributed  by  being  exposed  to
asbestos products and dust while working at the White Mesa Mill. The Company does not consider this claim
to  have  any  merit,  and  therefore  does  not  believe  it  will  materially  affect  its  financial  position,  results  of
operations or cash flows. In January, 2013, the Company filed a Special Appearance challenging jurisdiction
and certain other procedural matters relating to this claim. No other activity involving the Company on this
matter has occurred since that date.
In  January,  2013,  the  Ute  Mountain  Ute  tribe  filed  a  Petition  to  Intervene  and  Request  for  Agency  Action
challenging the Corrective Action Plan approved by the State of Utah Department of Environmental Quality
(“UDEQ”) relating to nitrate contamination in the shallow aquifer at the White Mesa Mill site. This challenge is
currently being evaluated, and may involve the appointment of an administrative law judge to hear the matter.
The Company does not consider this action to have any merit. If the petition is successful, the likely outcome
would be a requirement to modify or replace the existing Corrective Action Plan. At this time, the Company
does not believe any such modification or replacement would materially affect our financial position, results of
operations  or  cash  flows.  However,  the  scope  and  costs  of  remediation  under  a  revised  or  replacement
Corrective Action Plan have not yet been determined and could be significant.
In April 2014, the Grand Canyon Trust filed a citizen suit in federal district court for alleged violations of the
Clean Air Act at the White Mesa Mill. In October 2014, the plaintiffs were granted leave by the court to add
further purported violations to their April 2014 suit. The Complaint, as amended, alleges that radon from one of
the Mill’s tailings impoundments exceeded the standard; that the mill is in violation of a requirement that only
two tailings impoundments may be in operation at any one time; and that certain other violations related to the
manner of measuring and reporting radon results from one of the tailings impoundments occurred in 2013.
The Complaint asks the court to impose injunctive relief, civil penalties of up to $38,000 per day per violation,
costs of litigation including attorneys’ fees, and other relief. The Company believes the issues raised in the
Complaint are being addressed through the proper regulatory channels and is currently in compliance with all
applicable  regulatory  requirements  relating  to  those  matters.  The  Company  intends  to  defend  against  all
issues raised in the Complaint. Cross motions for summary judgement have been fully briefed, and a hearing
is set for November 17, 2016.
Canyon Project
In March, 2013, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sierra Club and the Havasupai
Tribe (the “Canyon Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (the “District
Court”) against the Forest Supervisor for the Kaibab National Forest and the United States Forest Service
(“USFS”) seeking an order (a) declaring that the USFS failed to comply with environmental, mining, public
land,  and  historic  preservation  laws  in  relation  to  our  Canyon  Project,  (b)  setting  aside  any  approvals
regarding exploration and mining operations at the Canyon Project, and (c) directing operations to cease at
the Project and enjoining the USFS from allowing any further exploration or mining-related activities at the
Canyon Project until the USFS fully complies with all applicable laws. In April 2013, the Plaintiffs filed a Motion
for Preliminary Injunction, which was denied by the District Court in September, 2013. On April 7, 2015, the
District Court issued its final ruling on the merits in favor of the Defendants and the Company and against the
Canyon Plaintiffs on all counts. The Canyon Plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s ruling on the merits to the
Ninth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals,  and  filed  motions  for  an  injunction  pending  appeal  with  the  District  Court.
Those motions for an injunction pending appeal were denied by the District Court on May 26, 2015. Thereafter,
Plaintiffs filed urgent motions for an injunction pending appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which
were  denied  on  June  30,  2015.  Briefing  on  the  appeal  on  the  merits  is  now  complete,  and  the  parties  are
waiting for a hearing to be scheduled. If the Canyon Plaintiffs are successful on their appeal on the merits, the
Company may be required to maintain the Canyon Project on standby pending resolution of the matter. Such
a required prolonged stoppage of shaft sinking and mining activities could have a significant impact on our
future operations.

Surety bonds
The Company has indemnified third-party companies to provide surety bonds as collateral for the Company’s
ARO. The Company is obligated to replace this collateral in the event of a default, and is obligated to repay
any  reclamation  or  closure  costs  due.  The  Company  currently  has  $19.61  million  posted  against  an
undiscounted ARO of $41.23 million (June 2015 - $12.98 million posted against undiscounted asset retirement
obligation of $31.27 million). One of the Company’s surety bond holders has requested additional collateral to
be posted at the following intervals: $1.76 million to be funded by July 31, 2016, $1.76 million to be funded by
November 30, 2016, $1.76 million to be funded by February 28, 2017.
13. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company Is engaged in uranium extraction, recovery and sales of uranium from mineral properties and
the  recycling  of  uranium  bearing  materials  generated  by  third  parties.  As  a  part  of  these  activities  the
Company also acquires, explores, evaluates and, if warranted, permits uranium properties. The Company’s
primary mining activities are in the United States.
The reportable segments are those operations whose operating results are reviewed by the Chief Executive
Officer  to  make  decisions  about  resources  to  be  allocated  to  the  segment  and  assess  its  performance
provided  those  operations  pass  certain  quantitative  thresholds.  Operations  whose  revenues,  earnings  or
losses or assets exceed 10% of the total consolidated revenue, earnings or losses or assets are reportable
segments.  Information  about  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  segment  has  not  been  provided  because  the
information is not used to assess performance.
In  order  to  determine  reportable  operating  segments,  management  reviewed  various  factors,  including
geographical location and managerial structure. It was determined by management that a reportable operating
segment generally consists of an individual property managed by a single general manager and management
team. Finance income (expense), other income (expenses) are managed on a consolidated basis and are not
allocated to operating segments.
Non-mining activities and other operations are reported in Corporate and other.
The Company has two operating segments, the conventional uranium recovery segment (the “Conventional
Uranium Segment”) and the in-situ uranium recovery segment (“ISR Uranium Segment”).
The Conventional Uranium Segment
The  Conventional  Uranium  Segment  consists  of  a  standalone  conventional  uranium  recovery  facility  (the
“White Mesa Mill”), conventional mining projects in the vicinity of the White Mesa Mill located in the Colorado
Plateau, Henry Mountains, Arizona Strip, and the Roca Honda Project (“Roca Honda”) in New Mexico, and the
Sheep Mountain Project (“Sheep Mountain”) in Wyoming. At June 30, 2016 the conventional mining projects
in the vicinity of the White Mesa Mill are on standby, being evaluated for continued mining activities and/or in
process  of  being  permitted.  The  White  Mesa  Mill  also  processes  third  party  uranium  bearing  mineralized
materials from mining and recycling activities.
The ISR Uranium Segment
The ISR Uranium Segment consists of an operating uranium recovery facility to recover concentrated uranium
from wellfields of the Nichols Ranch Project located in Wyoming and a uranium recovery facility and wellfields
maintained on standby as part of the Alta Mesa Project in Texas. The Nichols Ranch Project also includes the
Jane Dough property and the Hank Project. Additionally, the segment includes other mineral properties in the
vicinity on the Nichols Ranch Project and the Alta Mesa Project. The Nichols Ranch Project and surrounding
assets were acquired as part of the Company’s 2015 acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation and the Alta
Mesa Project was acquired in June of 2016.

Overview
Prior  to  June  2012,  Energy  Fuels  was  primarily  a  uranium  and  vanadium  exploration,  permitting,  and
evaluation company with no revenue or operating properties. In June 2012, Energy Fuels acquired the US
Mining Division of Denison Mines Corp. and began revenue producing activities from these properties. The
activities of Energy Fuels, including support staff and expenditures, increased dramatically upon completion
of  the  acquisition.  All  activities  of  the  Company  prior  to  the  June  18,  2015  acquisition  of  Uranerz  Energy
Corporation (“Uranerz”) concerned the Conventional Uranium Segment.
On June 18, 2015, Energy Fuels acquired all of the outstanding shares of Uranerz which had, among other
properties, an active in situ (“ISR”) uranium extraction and recovery facility. These operations acquired from
Uranerz are included in the consolidated financial statements as of June 18, 2015.
On June 16, 2016, Energy Fuels acquired all the outstanding shares of Mesteña Uranium, LLC (“Mesteña”),
and on July 8, 2016 changed the name of Mesteña to “EFR Alta Mesa LLC” (“Alta Mesa”). Alta Mesa’s primary
asset is the Alta Mesa Project (the “Alta Mesa Project”), a fully-licensed ISR uranium production facility located
in South Texas. In order for the Alta Mesa Project to be capable of uranium production, the Company will need
to incur capital expenditures to develop wellfields. A decision to commence development will be made once
uranium prices improve to a point where economic feasibility of the Alta Mesa Project is established.
26
The  operations  of  Uranerz  and  assets  acquired  in  the  Alta  Mesa  acquisition  represent  the  Company’s  ISR
Uranium Segment.
While the Company has uranium extraction and recovery activities and generates revenue, it is considered to
be in the Exploration Stage (as defined by SEC Industry Guide 7) as it has no Proven or Probable Reserves
within the meaning of SEC Industry Guide 7. Under US GAAP, for a property that has no Proven or Probable
Reserves, the Company capitalizes the cost of acquiring the property (including mineral properties and rights)
and  expenses  all  costs  related  to  the  property  incurred  subsequent  to  the  acquisition  of  such  property.
Acquisition costs of a property are depreciated over its estimated useful life for a revenue generating property
or expensed if the property is sold or abandoned. Acquisition costs are subject to impairment if so indicated.
Outlook
Uranium Market Update
According to price data from TradeTech LLC (“TradeTech”), uranium spot prices are down from $34.20 per
pound on December 31, 2015 to $25.90 per pound on July 28, 2016, or 24% for the year-to-date. Weekly spot
prices reported by TradeTech reached a low of $25.00 per pound on July 15, 2016, which was the lowest value
observed by TradeTech since April 22, 2005. TradeTech price data also indicate that long-term  U3O8
  prices,
which began 2016 at $44.00 per pound, dropped to $38.00 per pound by July 31, 2016.
The  drop  in  uranium  prices  is  believed  to  be  caused  by  weaker  than  expected  demand  by  utilities  and
persistent  over-supply.  Most  transactions  on  the  spot  market  in  2016  have  involved  traders  and
intermediaries, though certain utilities have entered the market to opportunistically buy inexpensive material.
The  Company  continues  to  believe  the  weak  uranium  markets  are  the  result  of  excess  uranium  supplies
caused by large quantities of secondary uranium extraction, excess inventories and insufficient production
cut-backs. The oversupply situation is further exacerbated by reduced demand due to the continued delays in
the restart of Japanese reactors, premature reactor closures in the US, and general weakness in the global
economy and energy sector. However, since the beginning of the year, certain announcements have been
made which may lessen some of the oversupply now burdening the market, including Cameco Corporation’s
April  21,  2016  announcement  that  it  is  reducing  production  by  approximately  4  million  pounds  per  year  in
2016, with further production cuts going forward.
As  a  result  of  the  expected  growth  of  nuclear  energy,  the  Company  continues  to  believe  the  long-term
fundamentals of the uranium industry are positive. The Company believes prices must rise to higher levels to
support new primary production that will be required to meet the increasing demand we expect to see as more
nuclear  units  are  constructed  around  the  world.  According  to  TradeTech,  world  uranium  requirements
continue to exceed primary mine production, with the gap being bridged by secondary supplies and excess
uranium inventories in various forms that have already been mined. As excess inventories are drawn down
and  as  production  from  existing  mines  declines,  the  Company  believes  primary  mine  production  will  be
required to meet demand over the long-term.
Despite current market uncertainty and recently falling prices, the Company continues to believe it has begun
to see certain events which must occur for a market recovery to materialize, as previously described in the
Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Of note, China finalized its 13th Five-Year
Plan, including a commitment to install 58 GW of nuclear capacity by 2020 (versus today’s 27 GW in installed
capacity).  In  addition,  China  connected  eight  reactors  to  the  grid  in  2015  (World  Nuclear  News,  January  4,
2016).  Japanese  utilities  are  also  making  slow  progress  in  restarting  their  nuclear  fleet.  Two  reactors  have
restarted  (Sendai  1  and  2),  two  more  units  are  approved  to  restart  pending  resolution  of  an  injunction
(Takahama 3 and 4), and one more reactor has completed the final regulatory step needed prior to approval
for restart (Ikata 3). It is worth noting that 42 reactors in Japan are operable according to the World Nuclear
Association, and, in addition to the five mentioned above, 19 have applied for approvals to restart. And, the
Company expects to see certain utilities come to the market later in 2016 to take advantage of today’s low
prices  through  spot  and  mid-term  purchases.  However,  these  positive  developments  have  not  yet  been
sufficient to offset the downward pressure currently being observed in uranium markets.
27
Operations and Sales Outlook
With the June 2015 acquisition of Uranerz, which includes the Nichols Ranch ISR Project, Energy Fuels has
increased its flexibility to adjust its uranium production levels to respond to market conditions and to meet the
requirements of its sales contracts. This allows the Company to efficiently fulfill its existing commitments and
commit to new spot and term sales that will be sourced from uranium recovered from the Company’s facilities.
The Company plans to extract and/or recover uranium from the following sources in 2016 (each of which is
more fully described below):
1)
2)
3)
Nichols Ranch ISR Project;
Alternate feed materials; and
Pinenut Project material available for milling.
In response to continued uranium price weakness and market uncertainty, the Company expects to continue
cash  conservation  efforts  until  such  time  that  sustained  improvement  in  uranium  market  conditions  is
observed.  In  addition,  the  Company  is  continuing  to  manage  its  activities  and  assets  conservatively,
maintaining  its  substantial  uranium  resource  base  and  its  ISR  and  conventional  uranium  extraction  and
recovery capabilities, and only scheduling recovery at the White Mesa Mill and the Nichols Ranch Project as
market conditions, availability of mill feed, cash needs, and/or contract delivery requirements may warrant.
Acquisition of Alta Mesa
On June 16, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Alta Mesa (previously named “Mesteña Uranium,
LLC”) which included the Alta Mesa Project. The Alta Mesa Project has a fully-licensed and constructed ISR
uranium recovery plant, with a design capacity of 1.5 million pounds of uranium concentrate per year. In order
for Alta Mesa to be capable of uranium production, the Company will need to incur capital expenditures to
develop wellfields. A decision to commence development will be made once uranium prices improve to a point
where economic feasibility of the Alta Mesa Project is established. The consideration paid by the Company for
Alta Mesa was 4,551,284 common shares, which were issued at the closing of the transaction. The Alta Mesa
properties are subject to a royalty equal to 3.125% of the value of the recovered U3O8 from the properties sold
at  a  uranium  price  of  $65.00  or  less  per  pound  U3O8,  6.25%  of  the  value  of  the  recovered  U3O8  from  the
properties sold at a uranium price greater than $65.00 and up to and including $95.00 per pound U3O8, and
7.5% of the value of the recovered U3O8  from the properties sold at a uranium price greater than $95.00 per
pound U3O8.
The Company will continue to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities that may arise.
Extraction and Recovery Activities – Overview
The Company expects to recover approximately 950,000 pounds of U3O8 for the year ending December 31,
2016, as further described below.
The Company currently has finished goods inventory and uranium extraction and recovery capabilities that
exceed  the  commitments  contained  in  its  existing  sales  contracts.  As  a  result,  both  ISR  and  conventional
uranium extraction and/or recovery have been, and are expected to continue to be, maintained at conservative
levels until such time as market conditions improve sufficiently and/or the Company requires cash to meet its
business needs.
Extraction and Recovery – ISR Uranium Segment
We currently plan to extract and recover approximately 300,000 pounds of U3O8 from our ISR segment for the
year ending December 31, 2016.
28
At June 30, 2016, the Nichols Ranch wellfields had eight header houses extracting uranium. The Company
plans  to  complete  a  ninth  header  house  by  the  end  of  2016.  Further  header  houses  will  be  completed  as
production needs and market conditions warrant.
In February 2016, the Company completed construction of the elution circuit and began the elution process at
the Nichols Ranch Plant. Yellowcake slurry from this circuit is being shipped to our White Mesa Mill for final
yellowcake drying, packaging, and shipment to a conversion facility.
Permitting of the adjacent Jane Dough Property is continuing and is expected to be completed in advance of
our  need  to  begin  wellfield  construction.  Also,  the  Hank  Project  is  fully  permitted  to  be  constructed  as  a
satellite facility to the Nichols Ranch Plant.
Extraction and Recovery – Conventional Uranium Segment
The  Company  expects  the  White  Mesa  Mill  to  recover  approximately  650,000  pounds  of  U3O8  for  the  year
ending December 31, 2016.
The  Company  is  planning  to  recover  approximately  425,000  pounds  of  U3O8  extracted  from  its  Pinenut
Project. Shipment of this material to the Mill was completed in March 2016. The Pinenut Project is now fully
depleted, and the Company has commenced reclamation activities.
During 2016, the Company also expects to recover approximately 225,000 pounds of U3O8 from alternate feed
materials.
The White Mesa Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis, whereby uranium recovery is scheduled
as mill feed, cash needs, contract requirements, and/or market conditions may warrant. Once the Pinenut ore
processing for 2016 concludes (expected to be in late 2016), the Company expects to recover uranium from
certain  alternate  feed  sources  and  process  certain  uranium  bearing  solutions  into  mid-2017.  Once  these
processes are completed the Company expects to place uranium recovery activities at the Mill on standby
until additional mill feed becomes available. The Mill will dry and package material from the Nichols Ranch
Plant and continue to receive and stockpile alternate feed materials for future milling campaigns. Each future
milling campaign will be subject to receipt of sufficient mill feed that would allow the Company to operate the
Mill on a profitable basis and/or recover a portion of its standby costs.
The Company is continuing shaft sinking activities at the Canyon Project and has completed the installation
of new equipment and infrastructure to optimize shaft sinking rates and realize construction cost savings. The
Company has also commenced additional underground drilling to further evaluate the deposit. The timing of
The  Company’s  plans  to  extract  and  process  mineralized  materials  from  this  project  will  be  based  on  the
results  of  this  additional  evaluation  work,  along  with  market  conditions,  available  financing,  and  sales
requirements.
The  Company  expects  to  continue  to  pursue  permitting  activities  at  certain  of  its  conventional  projects,
including  the  Roca  Honda  Project  and  the  Sheep  Mountain  Project.  The  Company  will  also  continue  to
evaluate the Bullfrog Property at its Henry Mountains Project. Expenditures for certain of these projects have
been adjusted to coincide with expected dates of price recoveries based on our forecasts.
Finally,  the  Company  plans  to  continue  to  maintain,  and  update  as  necessary,  all  permits  on  its  standby
properties. These properties will remain on standby until market conditions improve such that the material can
be  sold  at  prices  that  support  extraction.  The  Company  also  plans  to  continue  to  evaluate  its  non-core
properties for sale or abandonment in order to reduce costs and/or receive value for these properties. The
Company is continuing to monitor corporate and field overhead to reflect the lower levels of activity.
29
Sales
For 2016, the Company forecasts sales under its existing long-term contracts to total approximately 550,000
pounds of U3O8. Of this total, 400,000 pounds were delivered in the first half of the year with the remaining
amount to be delivered in the third quarter of the year. The prices for material sold under the existing long-
term contracts are either fixed or at floors. The average sales price under the Company’s long-term contracts
is expected to be higher in 2016 than 2015 levels. The Company expects to complete these sales from U3O8
already in inventory or expected to be recovered from its planned activities discussed above.
The Company also sold 50,000 pounds of U3O8 to a utility based on spot prices at the time of the contract. The
Company is currently monitoring market conditions for additional sales opportunities. The Company expects
to sell an additional 200,000 pounds of U3O8 at spot prices in the second half of the year. Selective additional
spot sales may be made as necessary to generate cash for operations and development activities.
In  2017,  the  Company  expects  to  have  existing  inventory  or  expected  production  to  meet  all  of  its
commitments to sell 620,000 pounds of uranium under its existing long-term contracts at average sales prices
higher than 2016 levels.
The Company also continues to pursue new sources of revenue, including expansion of its alternate feed
business.

For the three months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded a net loss of $10.44 million or $0.20 per
share compared with a loss of $4.06 million or $0.18 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2015. For
the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded a net loss of $19.31 million or $0.38 per share
compared with a loss of $5.26 million or $0.25 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Revenues
The Company’s revenues from uranium are largely based on delivery schedules under long-term contracts,
and selective spot sales, which can vary from quarter to quarter.
Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $7.01 million compared with $23.71 million in the
three months ended June 30, 2015. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $25.00 million
compared with $31.31 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $7.01 million, of which $7.00 million were sales
related  to  the  ISR  segment,  of  100,000  pounds  of  U3O8,  pursuant  to  term  contracts  at  an  average  price  of
$70.00 per pound.
Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $23.71 million, of which $23.64 million were sales
of 416,667 pounds of uranium concentrates, all of which were pursuant to term contracts at an average price
of $56.74 per pound.
Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $25.00 million, of which $24.98 million were sales of
450,000 pounds of U3O8. The 450,000 pounds of U3O8 included the sale of 300,000 pounds of U3O8 pursuant
to term contracts at an average price of $54.19 per pound, the sale of 100,000 pounds of U3O8  pursuant to
term contracts at an average price of $70.00 per pound and the sale of 50,000 pounds of U3O8 on the spot
market  at  a  price  of  $34.40  per  pound.  For  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  sales  related  to  the
Conventional Uranium Segment were $18.00 million while sales related to the ISR segment were $7.00 million.
Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $31.31 million, of which $30.64 million were sales of
533,334 pounds of uranium concentrates, all of which were pursuant to term contracts at an average price of
$57.44 per pound.
Operating Expenses
Uranium recovered and costs and expenses applicable to revenue
In  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  recovered  80,000  pounds  of  U3O8  from  its  ISR
Uranium  Segment  and  108,000  pounds  of  U3O8  from  the  Company’s  conventional  operations.  In  the  three
months ended June 30, 2015, there was no production from the Company’s conventional operations and only
12 days of production from the acquired ISR operations.
Costs and expenses applicable to revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $4.10 million,
compared with $13.38 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the cost of sales was
primarily attributable to the decrease in the quantity of U3O8 sold year over year as discussed above. Costs of
goods sold averaged $40.99 per pound and $32.12 per pound for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Additionally, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1.62 million in profit and loss
related to concentrates and work in progress inventories in the ISR segment during the three months ended
June 30, 2016.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recovered 165,000 pounds of U3O8 from its ISR Uranium
Segment and 108,000 pounds of U3O8 from the Company’s conventional operations. In the six months ended
June 30, 2015, the Company recovered approximately 200,000 pounds of U3O8, of which 110,000 pounds were
from  alternate  feed  materials  and  other  processing  and  30,000  pounds  were  from  the  Company’s  Arizona
mines, and 60,000 pounds of U3O8  were  processed  under  a  tolling  arrangement  for  the  account  of  a  third
party.
31
Costs  and  expenses  applicable  to  revenue  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  totaled  $16.24  million,
compared with $17.23 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the cost of sales was
primarily attributable to the decrease in the quantity of U3O8 sold year over year as discussed above. Costs of
goods sold averaged $36.09 per pound and $32.30 per pound for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
Other operating costs and expenses
Development, permitting and land holding
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company spent $3.48 million for development, permitting, and
land  holding  primarily  related  to  wellfield  construction  and  shaft  sinking  at  the  Canyon  Project.  While  we
expect the amounts expensed will add value to the Company, we expense these amounts as we do not have
proven or probable reserves at the Nichols Ranch Project or the White Mesa asset group under SEC Industry
Guide 7. For the three months ended June 30, 2015, we spent $0.50 million primarily on permitting and land
holding for our conventional assets.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company spent $10.92 million for development, permitting, and
land  holding  primarily  related  to  wellfield  construction  and  completion  of  the  elution  circuit  at  the  Nichols
Ranch Project, shaft sinking at the Canyon Project and for the replacement of five leach tanks at the White
Mesa  Mill  in  preparation  for  the  campaign.  While  we  expect  the  amounts  expensed  will  add  value  to  the
Company, we expense these amounts as we do not have proven or probable reserves at the Nichols Ranch
Project or the White Mesa asset group under SEC Industry Guide 7. For the six months ended June 30, 2015,
we spent $0.70 million primarily on permitting and land holding for our conventional assets.
Standby expense
The Company’s La Sal and Daneros Projects were placed on standby in the last quarter of calendar year 2012,
as a result of market conditions. In February 2014, the Company placed its Arizona 1 Project on standby. In
2015, the White Mesa Mill was operated at lower levels of uranium recovery, including prolonged periods of
standby. Costs related to the care and maintenance of the standby mines, along with standby costs incurred
while the White Mesa Mill was operating at low levels of uranium recovery or on standby, are expensed.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, standby costs totaled $1.37 million compared with $1.78 million in
2015.  The  decrease  is  primarily  related  to  decreased  standby  costs  at  the  White  Mesa  Mill,  due  to  higher
uranium recovery levels resulting from a decreased amount of time the Mill was on standby.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, standby costs totaled $3.53 million compared with $3.32 million in
2015. The standby costs remained approximately the same for each period.
Accretion
Accretion  related  to  the  asset  retirement  obligation  for  the  Company’s  properties  increased  for  the  three
months ended June 30, 2016 ($0.18 million) compared with 2015 ($0.10 million) primarily due to the increase in
the amount of the asset retirement obligation added in connection with the Uranerz acquisition.
32
Accretion related to the asset retirement obligation for the Company’s properties increased for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 ($0.35 million) compared with the 2015 ($0.21 million) primarily due to the increase in the
amount of the asset retirement obligation added in connection with the Uranerz acquisition.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expense includes costs associated with marketing uranium, corporate general and
administrative costs. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses
for personnel, contract and professional services, stock-based compensation expense and other overhead
expenditures. General and administrative expenses totaled $4.29 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $2.63 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is due to additional
general and administrative expenses of $0.8 million related to the acquired ISR uranium segment which was
completed in June 2015 and increase in stock-based compensation of $0.6 million and one time payments
totaling $0.53 million.
General and administrative expenses totaled $8.11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to  $5.34  million  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2015.  This  increase  is  due  to  additional  general  and
administrative expenses of $0.8 million related to the acquired ISR uranium segment which was completed in
June 2015, and increase in stock-based compensation of $0.6 million and one-time expenses totaling $0.53
million.
Intangible asset amortization
Intangible  asset  amortization  are  non-cash  costs  of  amortization  of  above-market  sales  contract  value
associated with the acquisition of Denison’s US Mining Division in June 2012 and the Uranerz acquisition in
June 2015. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 intangible asset amortization totaled $2.22 million
compared with $1.26 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was due to the contract
sale of 100,000 pounds related to Uranerz as discussed above, causing additional contract amortization to be
recorded.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 intangible asset amortization totaled $2.44 million compared with
$1.80 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was due to the contract sale of 100,000
pounds related to Uranerz as discussed above, causing additional contract amortization to be recorded.
Interest Expense and Other Income and Expenses
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.59 million compared with $0.39 million in
the prior year. The increase is primarily due to interest on the $18.81 million in debt assumed from the June
2015 Uranerz acquisition.
Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.16 million compared with $0.77 million in the
prior year. The increase is primarily due to interest on the $18.81 million in debt assumed from the June 2015
Uranerz acquisition.
Other income and expense
33
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, other income and expense totaled $0.47 million of income. These
amounts  primarily  consist  of  a  gain  on  warrant  liabilities  of  $0.45  million  and  $0.50  million  of  gains  in
miscellaneous  items  offset  by  a  loss  on  the  change  in  the  mark-to-market  values  of  the  Company's
Convertible Debentures (the “Debentures”) of $0.43 million.
Other income and expense for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $1.52 million of expense and
mainly consisted of a change in the mark-to-market values of the Company’s Debentures totaling $1.60 million
offset by other miscellaneous items.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, other income and expense totaled $0.23 million of income. These
amounts mainly consist of a gain on warrant liabilities of $0.70 million and gains in other miscellaneous items
of  $0.48  million,  partially  offset  by  a  loss  on  the  change  in  the  mark-to-market  values  of  the  Company's
Debentures of $0.99 million.
Other  income  and  expense  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2015  totaled  $0.47  million  of  expense  and
mainly consisted of a change in the mark-to-market values of the Company’s Debentures totaling $0.89 million
of expense partially offset by income from other miscellaneous items of $0.42 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Funding of major business and property acquisitions
Over  the  past  four  years  the  Company  has  funded  major  business  and  property  acquisitions  with  capital
provided by issuance of its common shares. In 2012 Titan Uranium Inc. and the US Mining Division of Denison
were acquired, in 2013 Strathmore Minerals Corp. was acquired and in 2015 Uranerz was acquired, each in
exchange  for  newly  issued  shares.  The  Company  intends  to  continue  to  acquire  assets  utilizing  common
shares when it can be done under attractive terms.
On May 27, 2016, the Company completed the purchase of the 40% interest in Roca Honda from Sumitomo
through the issuance of 1.21 million shares as well as an additional $4.5 million of cash payable upon first
commencement of commercial mining extraction.
Additionally, on June 16, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Alta Mesa through the issuance of
4,155,824  shares.  The  total  transaction  costs  incurred  through  June  30,  2016  by  the  Company  were  $1.29
million, which were capitalized as part of the purchase consideration.
Cash proceeds received for shares and warrants
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 0.20 million shares for net proceeds of $0.53
million under the Company’s ATM Offering.
Additionally, on March 14, 2016 an equity offering of 5,031,250 units (each unit consisting of one common
share and one half of one common share purchase warrant) was closed for net proceeds of $10.98 million
after commissions and estimated expenses of the offering.
Working capital at June 30, 2016 and future requirements for funds
At June 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $24.60 million, including $14.42 million in cash and cash
equivalents and 360,373 pounds of finished goods inventory. The Company believes it has sufficient cash
and resources to carry out its base business plan beyond Q2 2017.
The  Company  is  actively  focused  on  its  forward  looking  liquidity  needs,  especially  in  light  of  the  current
depressed uranium markets. The Company is evaluating its ongoing fixed cost structure as well as decisions
related to project retention, advancement and development. Significant development activities, if warranted,
will  require  that  we  arrange  for  financing  in  advance  of  planned  expenditures.  We  expect  to  augment  our
current financial resources with external financing as our long term business needs require.
34
The Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure.
Additional Collateral to be Deposited as Collateral for Surety Bonds
During  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2016,  one  of  the  Company’s  surety  bond  holders  requested
additional collateral to support surety bonds held in favor of our White Mesa Mill totaling $5.28 million to be
deposited $1.76 million by July 31, 2016 (which was deposited on July 29, 2016), $1.76 million by November 30,
2016 and $1.76 million by February 28, 2017.
Debenture Maturity
The  Company  currently  has  22,000  floating-rate  convertible  unsecured  subordinated  debentures  originally
maturing  June  30,  2017  (the  “Debentures”)  (each  Debenture  having  a  principal  amount  of  Cdn$1,000).  On
August 4, 2016, the following amendments were made to the Debentures:
•
•
•
•
•
the maturity date of the Debentures was extended from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2020;
the conversion price of the Debentures was reduced from Cdn$15.00 to Cdn$4.15 per common share of
the Company;
a redemption provision was added that enables the Company to redeem the Debentures, in cash, in whole
or in part, at any time after June 30, 2019, but prior to maturity, at a price of 101% of the aggregate principal
amount redeemed;
a  right  in  favor  of  each Debentureholder  was  added  to  enable  the  Debentureholder  to  require  the
Company to purchase, for cash, on June 30, 2017 (the original maturity date) up to 20% of the Debentures
held by the Debentureholder at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount tendered; and
certain other amendments were made to the Debenture Indenture as required by the U.S. Trust Indenture
Act of 1939, along with certain other amendments to remove provisions of the Indenture that no longer
apply.
At maturity, the Company can repay the indebtedness represented by the remaining Debentures by paying to
the  Debenture  trustee  in  Canadian  dollars  an  amount  equal  to  the  principal  amount  of  the  outstanding
Debentures remaining at maturity together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
Subject to any required regulatory approval and provided no event of default has occurred and is continuing,
the Company has the option to satisfy its obligation to repay the Debentures, in whole or in part, at maturity,
upon at least 40 days and not more than 60 days prior notice, by delivering that number of common shares
obtained by dividing the principal amount of the Debentures maturing by 95% of the volume-weighted average
trading price of the common shares on the TSX during the 20 consecutive trading days ending five trading
days preceding the maturity date.
Cash and cash flow
Six months ended June 30, 2016
Cash and cash equivalents were $14.42 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $12.97 million at December 31,
2015. The increase of $1.45 million was due primarily to cash provided by financing activities of $9.90 million
partially  offset  by  cash  used  by  investing  activities  of  $2.53  million  and  cash  used  in  operations  of  $6.20
million and gain on foreign exchange on cash held in foreign currencies of $0.29 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $9.90 million consisting primarily of $11.50 million proceeds
from the issuance of stock in the March 2016 public offering and the ATM Offering partially offset by $1.61
million to repay loans and borrowings.
Net cash used by investing activities was $2.53 million, which was primarily related to expenditures for the Alta
Mesa  acquisition  transaction  costs  of  $1.23  million  and  cash  expenditures  related  to  additional  cash
deposited with regulatory agencies for asset retirement obligations related to the acquisition of Alta Mesa of
$2.15 million and related reclamation costs offset by cash received from the sale of mineral properties held for
sale of $0.85 million.
Net  cash  used  in  operating  activities  of  $6.20  million  is  comprised  of  the  net  loss  of  $19.31  million  for  the
period adjusted for non-cash items and for changes in working capital items. Significant items not involving
cash  were  $2.59  million  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  $1.62  million
impairment  on  inventory,  a  $7.68  million  decrease  in  inventories,  $2.21  million  decrease  in  trade  and  other
receivables offset by a $2.72 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a $1.17 million
miscellaneous non-cash income.
35
Six months ended June 30, 2015
Cash and cash equivalents were $20.76 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $10.41 million at December 31,
2014. The increase of $10.35 million was due primarily to cash from investing activities of $6.41 million, cash
from operations of $3.97 million, cash from financing activities of $0.08 million and loss on foreign exchange
on cash held of $0.10 million.
Net  cash  from  investing  activities  was  $6.41  million,  which  was  primarily  related  to  the  release  of  cash
deposited  with  regulatory  agencies  of  $5.27  million,  the  $2.46  million  cash  acquired  in  the  acquisition  of
Uranerz offset by expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $1.32 million.
Net  cash  from  financing  activities  was  $0.08  million,  which  primarily  consisted  of  payments  on  loans  and
borrowings  of  $0.03  million offset  with  $0.10  million  of  proceeds  from  the  issue  of  shares  for  options  and
warrant exercised.
Net cash from operating activities of $3.97 million is comprised of the net loss of $5.26 million for the period
adjusted for non-cash items and for changes in working capital items. Significant items not involving cash
were  $1.85  million  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  $3.96  million
miscellaneous non-cash expenses primarily related to the Uranerz acquisition completed in 2015, $4.13 million
decrease in inventories, offset by a $2.91 million increase in trade and other receivables.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires the use of
certain  critical  accounting  estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  the  amounts  reported.  It  also  requires
management  to  exercise  judgment  in  applying  the  Company’s  accounting  policies.  These  judgments  and
estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances taking into
account previous experience. Although the Company regularly reviews the estimates and judgments made
that affect these financial statements, actual results may be materially different.
Significant estimates made by management include:
a.
Exploration stage
SEC Industry Guide 7 defines a reserve as “that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and
legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination”. The classification of a reserve must be
evidenced by a bankable feasibility study using the latest three-year price average. While the Company has
established  the  existence  of  mineral  resources  and  has  successfully  extracted  and  recovered  saleable
uranium from certain of these resources, the Company has not established proven or probable reserves, as
defined  under  SEC  Industry  Guide  7,  for  these  operations  or  any  of  its  uranium  projects.  As  a  result,  the
Company is in the Exploration Stage as defined under Industry Guide 7. Furthermore, the Company has no
plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of its uranium projects.
While  in  the  Exploration  Stage,  among  other  things,  the  Company  must  expense  all  amounts  that  would
normally  be  capitalized  and  subsequently  depreciated  or  depleted  over  the  life  of  the  mining  operation  on
properties that have proven or probable reserves. Items such as the construction of wellfields and related
header houses, additions to our recovery facilities and advancement of properties will all be expensed in the
period incurred. As a result, the Company’s consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable
to the financial statements of mining companies in the development or production stages.
36
b.
Resource estimates
The  Company  utilizes  estimates  of  its  mineral  resources  based  on  information  compiled  by  appropriately
qualified persons. The information relating to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the ore body
requires complex geological judgments to interpret the data. The estimation of future cash flows related to
resources  is  based  upon  factors  such  as  estimates  of  future  uranium  prices,  future  construction  and
operating costs along with geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade of
the  resource.  Changes  in  the  mineral  resource  estimates  may  impact  the  carrying  value  of  mining  and
recovery assets, goodwill, reclamation and remediation obligations and depreciation and impairment.
c.
Valuation of mining and recovery assets in a business combination
We  value  assets  in  a  business  combination  based  on  our  estimates  of  the  fair  value  of  the  mining  and
recovery assets acquired.
For mining and recovery assets actively extracting and recovering uranium as well as those assets that we
expect to extract uranium from, we value the assets based on the income approach. As we have not acquired
proven or probable reserves in our business combinations the value ascribed to these assets is based on our
estimates of value beyond proven and probable reserves. The value is calculated based, in part, on technical
reports prepared under NI 43-101. Our estimates of extraction and recovery activities and related timing of
extraction and recovery as well as the costs involved are demonstrated by at least a preliminary economic
assessment.  We  then  adjust  the  results  of  the  technical  reports  to  include  the  effects  of  anticipated
fluctuations in the future market price of uranium consistent with what we believe to be the expectations of
other market participants as well as any expected operational or cost changes that we expect in the future
operations of these mining assets. These cash flow estimates include the estimated cash outflows to develop,
extract and recover the estimated saleable U3O8 from these operations.
For  mining  assets  that  will  be  held  for  further  evaluation  or  for  sale,  we  use  the  market  approach  utilizing
implied transaction multiples from historical uranium transactions.
d.
Valuation of mining assets acquired other than in a business combination
The  costs  of  mining  assets  that  are  acquired  in  an  asset  purchase  transaction  are  recorded  as  plant  and
equipment on the date of purchase based on the consideration given up for the assets. If multiple assets are
involved  in  a  transaction,  the  consideration  is  allocated  based  on  the  relative  values  of  the  properties
acquired.
e.
Depreciation of mining and recovery assets acquired
For  mining  and  recovery  assets  actively  extracting  and  recovering  uranium  we  depreciate  the  acquisition
costs of the mining and recovery assets on a straight line basis over our estimated lives of the mining and
recovery  assets.  The  process  of  estimating  the  useful  life  of  the  mining  and  recovery  assets  requires
significant  judgment  in  evaluating  and  assessing  available  geological,  geophysical,  engineering  and
economic  data,  projected  rates  of  extraction  and  recovery,  estimated  commodity  price  forecasts  and  the
timing of future expenditures, all of which are, by their very nature, subject to interpretation and uncertainty.
Changes in these estimates may materially impact the carrying value of the Company’s mining and recovery
assets and the recorded amount of depreciation.
f.
Business combinations
Management uses judgment in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and
in determining fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The value placed on the acquired
assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets, will have an effect on the amount of goodwill or
bargain  purchase  gain  that  the  Company  may  record  on  an  acquisition.  Changes  in  economic  conditions,
commodity prices and other factors between the date that an acquisition is announced and when it finally is
consummated can have a material difference on the allocation used to record a preliminary purchase price
allocation  versus  the  final  purchase  price  allocation  which  can  take  up  to  one  year  after  acquisition  to
complete. See b. above for information related to the valuation of mining and recovery assets in this process.
37
g.
Impairment testing of mining and recovery assets
The Company undertakes a review of the carrying values of its mining and recovery assets whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may exceed their estimated net recoverable
amounts determined by reference to estimated future operating results and net cash flows. An impairment
loss is recognized when the carrying value of a mining or recovery asset is not recoverable based on this
analysis.  In  undertaking  this  review,  the  management  of  the  Company  is  required  to  make  significant
estimates  of,  among  other  things,  future  production  and  sale  volumes,  forecast  commodity  prices,  future
operating and capital costs and reclamation costs to the end of the mining asset’s life. These estimates are
subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may ultimately have an effect on the expected recoverability
of the carrying values of mining and recovery assets.
h.
Asset retirement obligations
Asset  retirement  obligations  are  recorded  as  a  liability  when  an  asset  that  will  require  reclamation  and
remediation  is  initially  acquired.  For  disturbances  created  on  a  property  owned  that  will  require  future
reclamation and remediation the Company records asset retirement obligations for such disturbance when
occurred. The Company has accrued its best estimate of its share of the cost to decommission its mining and
milling properties in accordance with existing laws, contracts and other policies. The estimate of future costs
involves a number of estimates relating to timing, type of costs, mine closure plans, and review of potential
methods  and  technical  advancements.  Furthermore,  due  to  uncertainties  concerning  environmental
remediation,  the  ultimate  cost  of  the  Company’s  decommissioning  liability  could  differ  from  amounts
provided. The estimate of the Company’s obligation is subject to change due to amendments to applicable
laws and regulations and as new information concerning the Company’s operations becomes available. The
Company  is  not  able  to  determine  the  impact  on  its  financial  position,  if  any,  of  environmental  laws  and
regulations  that  may  be  enacted  in  the  future.  Additionally,  the  expected  cash  flows  in  the  future  are
discounted  at  the  Company’s  estimated  cost  of  capital  based  on  the  periods  the  Company  expects  to
complete the reclamation and remediation activities. Differences in the expected periods of reclamation or in
the discount rates used could have a material difference in the actual settlement of the obligations compared
with the amounts provided.
i.
Determination whether an acquisition represents a business combination or asset purchase
Management  determines  whether  an  acquisition  represent  a  business  combination  or  asset  purchase  by
considering the stage of exploration and development and status of an acquired operation. Consideration is
given  to  whether  the  acquired  properties  include  mineral  reserves  or  mineral  resources,  in  addition  to  the
permitting required and results of economic assessments.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
The  Company  is  exposed  to  risks  associated  with  commodity  prices,  interest  rates,  foreign  currency
exchange rates and credit. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result
of changes in the market value of uranium. Interest rate risk results from our debt and equity instruments that
we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business. The foreign currency exchange risk relates to the
risk that the value of financial commitments, recognized assets or liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in
foreign currency rates. Credit risk arises from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business.
Industry-wide risks can also affect our general ability to finance exploration, and development of exploitable
resources; such effects are not predictable or quantifiable. Market risk is the risk to the Company of adverse
financial impact due to change in the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments as a result of
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
38
Commodity Price Risk
The Company is subject to market risk related to the market price of U3O8. Our four supply contracts contain
favorable  pricing  above  current  spot  prices;  however,  these  long  term  prices  cover  only  a  portion  of  our
planned uranium recovery. Revenue beyond our current contracts will be affected by both spot and long-term
U3O8 price fluctuations which are affected by factors beyond our control, including: the demand for nuclear
power;  political  and  economic  conditions;  governmental  legislation  in  uranium  producing  and  consuming
countries;  and  production  levels  and  costs  of  production  of  other  producing  companies.  The  Company
continuously monitors the market to determine its level of extraction and recovery of uranium in the future.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash equivalents, deposits, restricted cash, and debt. Our
interest  earned  is  not  material;  thus  not  subject  to  significant  risk.  Our  Wyoming  Industrial  Development
Revenue Bond has a fixed interest rate over its remaining five-year life, removing variability. The Company is
exposed to an interest rate risk associated with its convertible debentures (the “Debentures”), which is based
on the spot market price of U3O8. These Debentures mature in December 2020. The Company does not expect
the spot market price of U3O8 to exceed $54.99 prior to the Debentures’ maturity and, accordingly, does not
believe  there  is  any  significant  interest  rate  risk  related  to  these  Debentures.  The  Company  does  not  use
derivatives  to  manage  interest  rate  risk.  The  following  chart  displays  the  interest  rate  applicable  to  our
Debentures at various U3O8 price levels.

Currency Risk
The foreign exchange risk relates to the risk that the value of financial commitments, recognized assets or
liabilities will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency rates. The Company does not use any derivative
instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As the US Dollar is the
functional  currency  of  our  U.S.  operations,  the  currency  risk  has  been  reduced.  We  maintain  a  nominal
balance in foreign currency, resulting in a low currency risk relative to our cash balances. Our Debentures are
denominated in Canadian Dollars and, accordingly, are exposed to currency risk.

Credit risk relates to cash and cash equivalents, trade, and other receivables that arise from the possibility
that  any  counterparty  to  an  instrument  fails  to  perform.  The  Company  only  transacts  with  highly-rated
counterparties and a limit on contingent exposure has been established for any counterparty based on that
counterparty’s credit rating. The Company’s sales are attributable mainly to multinational utilities. As at June
30,  2016,  the  Company’s  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  was  the  carrying  value  of  cash  and  cash
equivalents, trade receivables and taxes recoverable.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
At the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2016, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of our
management,  including  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (“CEO”)  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  (“CFO”),  of  the
effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-
15(e)  and  Rule  15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange  Act).  Based  on  that  evaluation,  the  CEO  and  the  CFO  have
concluded  that  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report,  our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures were effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file
or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in
our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30,
2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.
On August 4, 2016, Energy Fuels Inc. (the “Company”), Energy Fuels Resources (USA) Inc., and Stephen P.
Antony  entered  into  an  Amended  and  Restated  Employment  Agreement  (the  “Amended  Employment
Agreement”)  which  amends  and  restates  the  employment  agreement  entered  into  by  the  parties  effective
October 1, 2015 (the “Original Employment Agreement”). The Amended Employment Agreement permits Mr.
Antony to elect to receive the succession bonus on the appointment of a Chief Operating Officer, a President
and a Chief Executive Officer, in restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or cash or a combination thereof, rather than
all in cash as set out in the Original Employment Agreement, and the number of RSUs shall be based on 125%
of the cash amount that would have been paid had the RSUs not been issued (the “RSU Value”). The number
of RSUs to be issued will be equal to the RSU Value divided by the greater of (a) the value weighted average
price of the Company’s common shares on the NYSE MKT for the five trading days ending on the last trading
day prior to the date the payment is due (the “Payment Date”); and (b) the closing price of the Company’s
common shares on the NYSE MKT on the last trading day prior to the Payment Date, and all RSUs issued will
vest on the next regular vesting day for outstanding RSUs previously granted to Mr. Antony.
The foregoing summary of the changes made to the Original Employment Agreement is subject to the full
terms of the Amended Employment Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.12.
