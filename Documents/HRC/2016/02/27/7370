<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</b>*<b>

<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 26/31, 
</p>
<p>in which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>to monitor the human rights situation in South Sudan and to report thereon to the Council at 
</p>
<p>its twenty-eighth session, with recommendations on technical assistance and capacity-
</p>
<p>building measures, including on human rights education to overcome challenges in the area 
</p>
<p>of security, and on accountability and transitional justice. 
</p>
<p>The present report was prepared in cooperation with the United Nations Mission in 
</p>
<p>South Sudan (UNMISS) and covers the period from 15 August to 15 December 2014. At 
</p>
<p>the Council&#8217;s twenty-seventh session, in September 2014, the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>submitted a report on the situation of human rights in South Sudan covering the period 
</p>
<p>from 8 May to 8 August 2014 (A/27/69). 
</p>
<p>The situation of human rights in South Sudan remained of serious concern during 
</p>
<p>the reporting period. Civilians continued to bear the brunt of the ongoing armed conflict 
</p>
<p>and of their leaders&#8217; failure to stop the fighting. While the scale and severity of the conflict 
</p>
<p>declined, the number of civilians displaced across the country continued to rise, with no 
</p>
<p>likelihood that people would be able to return to their homes in the near future. UNMISS 
</p>
<p>continued to receive reports of human rights violations and abuses, as well as violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, including the killing and wounding of civilians by all 
</p>
<p>parties to the armed conflict. Incidents of conflict-related sexual violence also continued to 
</p>
<p>be reported, not only in the context of the hostilities between the main belligerents, but also 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission. 
</p>

<p>of cyclical intercommunal clashes. Reports were further received of the large-scale 
</p>
<p>recruitment of children, the military use and occupation of schools and hospitals, and other 
</p>
<p>grave violations and abuses perpetrated against children.  
</p>
<p>Restrictions on freedom of expression also characterized the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>Incidents of harassment of members of civil society, detention of journalists, confiscation 
</p>
<p>of newspapers and closure of radio stations by government officials continued to be 
</p>
<p>reported regularly. 
</p>
<p>The administration of justice remained problematic, characterized by a large number 
</p>
<p>of arbitrary arrests, detentions without charge or trial, and a lack of fair-trial guarantees. 
</p>
<p>Those challenges, resulting from capacity deficits, lack of resources and lack of political 
</p>
<p>will, have been exacerbated by the conflict. UNMISS also continued to receive allegations 
</p>
<p>of torture and ill-treatment in custody. In some cases a strong security response to incidents 
</p>
<p>of intercommunal violence has led to violations of the rights of suspects and civilians. 
</p>
<p>Lack of accountability for human rights violations and abuses committed during the 
</p>
<p>conflict remains of serious concern. With regard to numerous allegations of serious 
</p>
<p>violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law committed since the outbreak 
</p>
<p>of violence in December 2013, accountability measures taken by national actors have been 
</p>
<p>few and inadequate. While the Government has acknowledged that violations have been 
</p>
<p>committed and has established several accountability measures, there are serious concerns 
</p>
<p>as to whether such measures meet international standards, including of due process, 
</p>
<p>independence and transparency.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 26/31, the Human Rights Council expressed its deep concern at the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation in South Sudan and at reports of atrocities committed since the 
</p>
<p>outbreak of violence on 15 December 2013, including direct targeting of civilians and mass 
</p>
<p>displacements, and allegations of recruitment and use of child soldiers, widespread 
</p>
<p>incidents of arbitrary arrests and detention, and sexual violence. The Council thereafter 
</p>
<p>requested the High Commissioner, as a matter of urgency, to monitor the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in South Sudan and to report to it during its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>2. This report presents an overview of the human rights situation in South Sudan since 
</p>
<p>the High Commissioner&#8217;s last report to the Human Rights Council, in September 2014. It 
</p>
<p>outlines some of the allegations of human rights violations and abuses and serious 
</p>
<p>violations of international humanitarian law received by the UNMISS Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Division between August and December 2014, and provides an analysis of the human rights 
</p>
<p>trends in that period. Some specific allegations are highlighted, with a focus on 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial killings, conflict-related sexual violence, children and armed conflict, the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice and freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>3. UNMISS has been monitoring the human rights situation in South Sudan, as 
</p>
<p>mandated by the Security Council. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights works with UNMISS pursuant to a joint policy with the Department of 
</p>
<p>Peacekeeping Operations of the United Nations on human rights in peace operations, 
</p>
<p>providing guidance and technical support on human rights monitoring and investigations 
</p>
<p>methodology. The UNMISS Human Rights Division continues to encounter security and 
</p>
<p>logistical challenges that prevent the full verification of all the allegations it receives. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context and developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Security developments 
</b></p>
<p>4. Despite the agreements on cessation of hostilities signed in January and May 2014, 
</p>
<p>the two parties to the conflict continued to engage in sporadic military confrontations. 
</p>
<p>Fighting persisted throughout the reporting period, particularly in the three Upper Nile 
</p>
<p>states of Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity. Overall, the military positions of both sides 
</p>
<p>remained the same, with government forces maintaining control of all the state capitals and 
</p>
<p>strategic towns while opposition forces have been in control of outlying areas in parts of 
</p>
<p>Upper Nile and Unity States, and northern Jonglei.  
</p>
<p>5. Unity State remained the most affected by the conflict. The overall security situation 
</p>
<p>in the State remained volatile due to the close proximity of the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation 
</p>
<p>Army (SPLA) and the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) in 
</p>
<p>Opposition forces. While SPLA remained in control of the State capital, Bentiu, and most 
</p>
<p>of the Unity oilfields, that control remained tenuous. The Government has little control over 
</p>
<p>the southern counties in Unity State and there have been frequent skirmishes in areas 
</p>
<p>outside Bentiu.  
</p>
<p>6. Next to Unity State, Upper Nile State, with its oil resources, also remained affected 
</p>
<p>by the conflict. While Malakal remained under government control, the security situation 
</p>
<p>has remained volatile amid repeated clashes between SPLA and SPLM/A in Opposition 
</p>
<p>forces, particularly in Nassir and Renk counties. Recurring opposition attacks on 
</p>
<p>government forces have continued near the Paloch oilfield, which remained under the 
</p>
<p>control of government forces. There have also been confrontations in Maban county </p>


<p>between SPLA and the Maban Defence Force, a local pro-SPLA armed group, reportedly 
</p>
<p>due to the local armed group&#8217;s reluctance to be integrated into SPLA. The situation in 
</p>
<p>Malakal has remained tense, amid fears that opposition forces might advance towards the 
</p>
<p>town from northern Jonglei, and there were also reports of internal tension within the 
</p>
<p>government forces in Malakal.  
</p>
<p>7. In Jonglei, while the situation in Bor, the capital, remained calm, the security 
</p>
<p>situation has deteriorated in the northern section of Ayod and Duk counties. There have 
</p>
<p>been reports of heavy fighting between SPLA and SPLM/A in Opposition in Ayod, which 
</p>
<p>remains under SPLA control. SPLA and SPLM/A in Opposition also reportedly clashed in 
</p>
<p>Fangak and Pigi counties in the north-western part of the state between the end of 
</p>
<p>November and early December 2014, resulting in the displacement of thousands of 
</p>
<p>civilians.  
</p>
<p>8. While the conflict has been largely contained within the north-eastern part of the 
</p>
<p>country in Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei, there are worrying signs that violence may be 
</p>
<p>spreading to other parts of the country, including the Greater Bahr el Ghazal and the 
</p>
<p>Greater Equatoria regions. In Western Bahr el Ghazal, reports of aerial bombardments in 
</p>
<p>Raga county in November 2014 raised concerns regarding the increasing regional 
</p>
<p>dimensions of the conflict. Reports also indicate that the Justice and Equality Movement, 
</p>
<p>the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-North) and other non-South 
</p>
<p>Sudanese militia groups have been involved in fighting in the region. In Eastern Equatoria, 
</p>
<p>following the killing of an SPLA soldier, SPLA soldiers attacked the village of Chukudum 
</p>
<p>in Budi county, from 6 to 7 October, resulting in the displacement of more than 200 people. 
</p>
<p>In central Equatoria, internal SPLA fighting in Juba and Yei around the end of September 
</p>
<p>reportedly resulted in the death of seven SPLA soldiers. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>9. While the scale and severity of the fighting have decreased, the conflict continues to 
</p>
<p>take a heavy toll on civilians, with targeted attacks based on ethnicity and large-scale 
</p>
<p>displacements. Reports of gross human rights violations and abuses and violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law against civilians by all sides remain widespread. They form 
</p>
<p>part of a now familiar and disturbing pattern in which civilians are targeted and killed 
</p>
<p>during hostilities for perceived or actual affiliation with a group different to the armed 
</p>
<p>element in control. While this targeting has often been on the basis of ethnicity, the abuses 
</p>
<p>described in the present report demonstrate that the animosity has reached deeper into 
</p>
<p>communities, with a growing expectation that everyone must choose sides. 
</p>
<p>10. By December 2014, more than 1.4 million South Sudanese had been displaced 
</p>
<p>internally, and approximately 467,000 people had fled to surrounding countries. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, roughly 4 million people in the country faced serious food insecurity. 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian access continued to be hampered by fighting and violence perpetrated by 
</p>
<p>both parties to the conflict against aid workers, equipment and infrastructure. In Unity and 
</p>
<p>Upper Nile States, active hostilities and insecurity continued to disrupt humanitarian 
</p>
<p>assistance as well as road and air access.  
</p>
<p>11. By mid-December 2014, more than 100,000 civilians had been housed in UNMISS 
</p>
<p>compounds &#8212; designated &#8220;protection of civilians sites&#8221;  &#8212; because they were too afraid to 
</p>
<p>return home, fearing potential violence. The bulk of those internally displaced persons were 
</p>
<p>in Bentiu (43,000 people), Juba (32,000) and Malakal (17,000). Some of the protection of 
</p>
<p>civilians sites in low-lying flood-prone areas had already experienced flooding during the 
</p>
<p>rainy season, with a significant impact on residents&#8217; living conditions, health and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>UNMISS expanded the camps to accommodate the influx of more civilians and  enhanced </p>


<p>security in and around those sites. New facilities were built in Juba, Malakal and Bor to 
</p>
<p>address overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in the camps.  
</p>
<p>12. Incidents of violence in and around the UNMISS protection of civilians sites 
</p>
<p>remained of serious concern. Very often violence was perpetrated against internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons and humanitarian and UNMISS personnel; it stemmed from 
</p>
<p>intercommunal tensions, increasing community leadership struggles, youth radicalization 
</p>
<p>and the use of drugs and alcohol. In some areas, SPLA activities around the sites created an 
</p>
<p>extremely intimidating atmosphere for civilians and posed serious restrictions on the 
</p>
<p>freedom of movement of the internally displaced. For example, in Bentiu, SPLA soldiers 
</p>
<p>took aggressive postures towards civilians in the protection of civilians site. On 30 
</p>
<p>September 2014, UNMISS witnessed approximately 20 SPLA soldiers in uniform, 
</p>
<p>including child soldiers, wielding their weapons outside the entrance of the site. They also 
</p>
<p>had a vehicle mounted machine gun. 
</p>
<p>13. UNMISS continued to face challenges in maintaining the civilian character of the 
</p>
<p>sites, with both sides accusing the mission of supporting the opposite side and harbouring 
</p>
<p>deserters inside its compounds. In Juba, UNMISS received reports that Nuer civilians had 
</p>
<p>been arrested and detained by the SPLA forces on suspicion of being deserters, with some 
</p>
<p>civilians alleging torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Intercommunal violence 
</b></p>
<p>14. The conflict also seems to have aggravated intercommunal violence, with a 
</p>
<p>devastating impact on the human rights situation, particularly in Lakes, Eastern and 
</p>
<p>Western Equatoria States, and within the UNMISS protection of civilians sites. In Lakes 
</p>
<p>State, intercommunal conflict among different Dinka clans has continued despite efforts by 
</p>
<p>the Government and State authorities to defuse tensions. Revenge attacks, including acts of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence, continued in relation to the killing of a paramount chief in Cuei-Chok 
</p>
<p>Payam on 5 August 2014. In response to the violence, the Government has increased its 
</p>
<p>security presence in the State. However, this has given rise to further violations as a result 
</p>
<p>of the heavy-handed measures sometimes adopted by the security forces.  
</p>
<p>15. Eastern Equatoria has also witnessed major incidents of intercommunal violence, 
</p>
<p>including on 6 December 2014, in Loronyo, Torit county, where several civilians, including 
</p>
<p>women and children, were killed. Reports received indicated that human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>including sexual violence and looting of property, were committed by security forces sent 
</p>
<p>to the area in response to the violence. Likewise, the deterioration in the security situation 
</p>
<p>in Chukudum in Budi county, Eastern Equatoria, in September and October, led to 
</p>
<p>allegations of human rights violations by SPLA, including arbitrary detention, torture and 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial killings.  
</p>
<p>16. In Western Equatoria, the influx of armed Dinka pastoralists from Lakes and Jonglei 
</p>
<p>with their large numbers of cattle has caused an increase in tension with host communities, 
</p>
<p>particularly in areas in Mundri West county. In Central Equatoria State, UNMISS 
</p>
<p>monitored developments in clashes between the Kuku and Madi communities spanning the 
</p>
<p>border between Kajo Keji county in South Sudan and Moyo district in Uganda, resulting in 
</p>
<p>several deaths in both communities and the displacement of between 8,000 and 10,000 
</p>
<p>civilians from the Ugandan side to the South Sudanese side of the border.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Peace process 
</b></p>
<p>17. Despite intense international pressure, very little progress was made towards a 
</p>
<p>political resolution of the conflict. The sixth round of the Intergovernmental Authority on </p>


<p>Development (IGAD)-mediated negotiations in Ethiopia concluded on 5 October 2014 after 
</p>
<p>exhaustive discussions between the parties on the form of the proposed transitional 
</p>
<p>government of national unity and the roles and responsibilities of participants in such a 
</p>
<p>government. While the President, Salva Kiir, and the rebel leader, Riek Machar, agreed to 
</p>
<p>form a transitional government of national unity in their 9 May cessation of hostilities 
</p>
<p>agreement, both have yet to make the compromises necessary for this to happen. Following 
</p>
<p>an IGAD Heads of State and Government summit in Addis Ababa in November, the parties 
</p>
<p>were granted 15 days to consult with their constituents on the structure of the transitional 
</p>
<p>government.  
</p>
<p>18. On 24 November 2014, the Government organized a national delegates&#8217; conference 
</p>
<p>in Juba to discuss the IGAD negotiations. The delegates concluded that executive power 
</p>
<p>during the transition period should consist of an executive president, a vice-president and a 
</p>
<p>non-executive prime minister. In early December, SPLM/A in Opposition organized its 
</p>
<p>consultative conference in Upper Nile State and affirmed that the transitional government 
</p>
<p>should have a president as the ceremonial head of State, and an executive prime minister. 
</p>
<p>As at December, there was still no agreement between the two parties on the composition 
</p>
<p>of a transitional government. The Government has affirmed its intention to proceed with 
</p>
<p>elections scheduled for June 2015 if there was a failure to reach a peace agreement.  
</p>
<p>19. The parties opened a parallel negotiating track in Arusha, United Republic of 
</p>
<p>Tanzania, where an intra-SPLM dialogue was held from 12 to 18 October 2014. The 
</p>
<p>negotiations involved representatives of SPLM, SPLM/A in Opposition and SPLM former 
</p>
<p>detainees (high-level SPLM officials who had been detained by the Government, but had 
</p>
<p>subsequently been released). On 20 October, the various SPLM factions signed a 
</p>
<p>framework agreement committing themselves to intra-party democracy, reconciliation and 
</p>
<p>healing. In an accompanying communiqu&#233;, the parties acknowledged a collective 
</p>
<p>responsibility for the crisis in South Sudan and said that the crisis must be urgently brought 
</p>
<p>to an end by the SPLM leadership through genuine and honest dialogue. The framework 
</p>
<p>document made it clear that the Arusha process was separate and distinct from the IGAD 
</p>
<p>mediation, but recognized that the two processes were mutually reinforcing. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Legislative developments 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the reporting period, several steps were taken towards the development of a 
</p>
<p>legal framework supporting the promotion and protection of human rights. The National 
</p>
<p>Legislative Assembly passed a bill for the ratification of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and 
</p>
<p>Governance. On 3 September 2014, the Assembly ratified the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and on 1 October it ratified the 
</p>
<p>African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. However, the instruments of 
</p>
<p>ratification have not been deposited with the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>21. On 8 October 2014, the National Legislative Assembly approved the national 
</p>
<p>security bill which, if enacted into law, would give security forces wide-ranging authority 
</p>
<p>to detain and arrest people without safeguards of due process. The bill was pending review 
</p>
<p>and awaiting presidential assent amidst concerns regarding its compatibility with the 
</p>
<p>Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan, 2011. Three media laws adopted 
</p>
<p>by the Assembly in November 2013, reportedly to shield media practitioners from 
</p>
<p>harassment, censorship and intimidation, were signed into law in November 2014.  </p>


<p><b> III. Overview of alleged human rights violations and abuses and 
violations of international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Extrajudicial killings  
</b></p>
<p>22. During the reporting period, while the intensity of fighting decreased, UNMISS 
</p>
<p>continued to receive reports of human rights violations and abuses, including killings of 
</p>
<p>civilians by parties to the conflict. Reports of killings of civilians by SPLM/A in 
</p>
<p>Opposition in Renk county, Upper Nile State, in September 2014, and in Bentiu, Unity 
</p>
<p>State, in October, were particularly alarming. Intercommunal violence has also escalated as 
</p>
<p>a result of the conflict, with serious incidents resulting in the killing of civilians. Besides 
</p>
<p>the tension between SPLA and the opposition forces, the proliferation of armed groups, 
</p>
<p>such as the Maban Defence Force, and the reported resurrection of the White Army, posed 
</p>
<p>additional threats to civilians.  
</p>
<p>23. In Renk county, Upper Nile State, reports indicated that civilians were allegedly 
</p>
<p>killed by opposition forces in connection with hostilities that took place in September 2014. 
</p>
<p>UNMISS received allegations that up to 83 individuals might have been killed during the 
</p>
<p>attacks, but was unable to confirm the reports owing to security constraints in the area.  
</p>
<p>24. In Bentiu, Unity State, at least 11 civilians were reportedly killed by opposition 
</p>
<p>forces when they tried to retake control of the city from the Government on 29 October 
</p>
<p>2014. Reports also indicated that civilians were deliberately targeted because of a perceived 
</p>
<p>association with government forces. In one instance, 14 men were taken from a church, 
</p>
<p>where they had sought sanctuary, and walked to a nearby cemetery, where at least eight of 
</p>
<p>them were shot and killed, two were wounded, while four remained unharmed. In another 
</p>
<p>incident during the attack, two women and a baby were killed in their homes.  
</p>
<p>25. On 12 December 2014, a group of traders were reportedly attacked by SPLA in 
</p>
<p>Tharwangiyel, Unity State, and several civilians were killed. Preliminary investigations by 
</p>
<p>UNMISS indicated that at least 53 civilians, including women and children, who were 
</p>
<p>travelling along a trade route from the Sudan to villages south of Bentiu, in an SPLA-
</p>
<p>controlled area, were attacked during the evening; up to eight civilians were killed, 
</p>
<p>including a woman and a girl, nine were wounded and 15 were detained by SPLA. 
</p>
<p>UNMISS has not been able to verify whether the traders were all civilians or whether there 
</p>
<p>were SPLM/A in Opposition fighters among them.  
</p>
<p>26. The conflict also appears to have fuelled intercommunal violence, which has 
</p>
<p>resulted in a large number of killings. In Lakes State, the killing of a paramount chief in 
</p>
<p>August 2014 provoked retaliation attacks between Dinka groups that degenerated into a 
</p>
<p>cycle of revenge killings and rape. For example, tensions increased in Cueibet county on 
</p>
<p>12 September following the ambush and killing of five Dinka Agar persons, reportedly by a 
</p>
<p>rival Dinka Gok clan.  
</p>
<p>27. In neighbouring Jonglei, two incidents of age-set fighting among the Murle in 
</p>
<p>Gumuruk and Likuangole counties reportedly resulted in the killing of at least four persons 
</p>
<p>in attacks and reprisals. An SPLA presence intended to contain tensions between the Buya 
</p>
<p>and Didinga communities also reportedly caused conflict. UNMISS received reports that on 
</p>
<p>7 October 2014 in Chukudum, Budi county, in Eastern Equatoria, SPLA soldiers killed at 
</p>
<p>least two civilians and reportedly burned down 47 homes. And in Rumbek Central county, 
</p>
<p>intermittent clashes between a Dinka Agar subclan and security forces which started on 
</p>
<p>23 October reportedly resulted in approximately 100 deaths. In an incident in Eastern 
</p>
<p>Equatoria on 6 December, 28 people from Lafon county were reportedly killed, including 
</p>
<p>women and children, by unknown armed men from Torit county.  </p>


<p><b> B. Conflict-related sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>28. During the reporting period, incidents of conflict-related sexual violence were 
</p>
<p>reported throughout the country, especially in places where there was a heavy presence of 
</p>
<p>armed actors. UNMISS continued to document incidents of conflict-related sexual violence 
</p>
<p>in the context of large-scale hostilities and cyclical intercommunal clashes. 
</p>
<p>29. An initial UNMISS investigation into the SPLM/A in Opposition attack on Bentiu, 
</p>
<p>Unity State, on 29 October 2014 revealed that women had been abducted by the opposition 
</p>
<p>and several of them were reportedly raped during the attack. State officials alleged that at 
</p>
<p>least 20 women were abducted from Souq sabi, Dere and Lich University and taken to Guit 
</p>
<p>and Nhialdiu. Allegations have also been made that SPLM/A in Opposition used rape as a 
</p>
<p>punishment for suspected government sympathizers.  
</p>
<p>30. In another incident, in December 2014, three out of a group of 30 women were 
</p>
<p>reportedly raped by SPLA soldiers while proceeding to a village located near the protection 
</p>
<p>of civilians site in Bentiu, after soldiers who had allegedly asked them to join them, then 
</p>
<p>shot at the group. UNMISS is also concerned about persisting challenges in protecting 
</p>
<p>women in protection of civilians sites. At several locations, attacks on women, including 
</p>
<p>rape, were reported to have taken place inside the sites, or as the women attempted to leave 
</p>
<p>or re-enter them. 
</p>
<p>31. Incidents of sexual violence have also been reported in the context of intercommunal 
</p>
<p>violence. In Lakes State, women and children have reportedly been used as proxies for 
</p>
<p>revenge, including through rape. In Rumbek East, the allegation that the paramount chief of 
</p>
<p>the Guony clan had been murdered by the Thuyic clan reportedly ignited a wave of 
</p>
<p>retaliatory attacks, including the reported rape of women and children. Reports received by 
</p>
<p>UNMISS also indicated that security forces responding to an incident of intercommunal 
</p>
<p>violence in Torit county, on 6 December 2014, had committed human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>including sexual violence against women.  
</p>
<p>32. In October 2014, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual 
</p>
<p>Violence in Conflict and the President of South Sudan signed a joint communiqu&#233;, which 
</p>
<p>outlined steps the Government will take to prevent and address sexual violence. The 
</p>
<p>agreement, which provides for technical support from the United Nations Team of Experts 
</p>
<p>on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, contains priority areas for action, 
</p>
<p>including ensuring medical, psychosocial and legal assistance to victims, addressing 
</p>
<p>impunity, security and justice sector reform, and ensuring that crimes of sexual violence are 
</p>
<p>explicitly addressed in the peace process and as an aspect of the 23 January 2014 Cessation 
</p>
<p>of Hostilities Agreement. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>33. Children continued to bear the brunt of the violence in South Sudan through large-
</p>
<p>scale displacements and lack of access to services such as health care and education. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, UNMISS continued to receive reports of the recruitment of children, the 
</p>
<p>military use and occupation of schools and hospitals and other grave violations and abuses 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by parties to the conflict. Child soldiers have been observed in Bentiu, Malakal 
</p>
<p>and Kuajok. Between September and November 2014, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
</p>
<p>(UNICEF) documented more than 70 incidents of grave violations against children, 
</p>
<p>affecting more than 2,000 children.  
</p>
<p>34. During the reporting period, SPLA issued new orders prohibiting the recruitment 
</p>
<p>and use of children by SPLA as well as the occupation of schools. On 8 October 2014, 
</p>
<p>UNICEF submitted to the Government and SPLA a list of 20 schools reportedly used by </p>


<p>SPLA for military purposes. On 29 October, the Government, assisted by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, launched a campaign entitled &#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221;, aimed at addressing the 
</p>
<p>recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. On 5 December, the United Nations, led 
</p>
<p>by UNICEF, signed a memorandum of understanding with a rebel group, the South Sudan 
</p>
<p>Democratic Movement/South Sudan Defence Army (SSDM/SSDA)-Cobra faction, based 
</p>
<p>largely in Jonglei, on the release and reintegration of approximately 3,000 children 
</p>
<p>associated with the group.  
</p>
<p>35. On a positive note, the National Legislative Assembly passed a bill for the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, with no 
</p>
<p>reservations.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p>36. South Sudan continued to face persistent challenges in the administration of justice 
</p>
<p>in accordance with international human rights standards. The conflict has undermined the 
</p>
<p>rule of law across the country, resulting in a marked absence of prosecutors and judges not 
</p>
<p>only in conflict-affected states but also in states not affected by fighting, such as in the 
</p>
<p>Greater Equatoria and Greater Bahr el Ghazal regions. As a result, serious cases, including 
</p>
<p>murders, continued to be addressed through traditional customary courts which are ill-
</p>
<p>equipped and do not meet international human rights standards. Customary courts often 
</p>
<p>impose unlawful detention or other sentences, without proper procedural safeguards. 
</p>
<p>Detention imposed by customary courts, beyond their jurisdiction, was observed, 
</p>
<p>particularly in Eastern Equatoria, Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Western Equatoria. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>37. Arrests and detention by security agencies, especially by the National Security 
</p>
<p>Services (NSS) and SPLA, continued to be a problem. Numerous cases were reported to 
</p>
<p>UNMISS of NSS arbitrarily arresting and detaining individuals &#8220;on grounds of national 
</p>
<p>security&#8221;. Besides going beyond the scope of their legal and constitutional authority, NSS 
</p>
<p>were found to have engaged in other violations involving arbitrary arrest, notably the arrest 
</p>
<p>and detention of individuals without informing them of the reason, or the detention of 
</p>
<p>individuals in non-gazetted places, where their family and lawyers were unable to gain 
</p>
<p>access to them. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. UNMISS regularly monitored detention facilities across the country and its reports 
</p>
<p>indicated that conditions of detention have not changed since the previous reporting period, 
</p>
<p>still falling short of international standards. Proxy detentions, arbitrary detentions, detention 
</p>
<p>for acts not amounting to crimes, and prolonged detentions, as well the detention of 
</p>
<p>juveniles with adults, remained of deep concern. UNMISS has also observed incidents 
</p>
<p>where executives at low levels of government interfere with the law enforcement process 
</p>
<p>by ordering arrests and detention.  
</p>
<p>39. On 9 September 2014, a 14-year-old boy was allegedly taken into custody by SPLA 
</p>
<p>soldiers in front of the UNMISS protection of civilians site in Bentiu, Unity State. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, in August, several women were reportedly arbitrarily detained by SPLA in Juba 
</p>
<p>and physically assaulted while in custody. The women were released the same day, after 
</p>
<p>intervention from a high-level SPLA officer.  
</p>
<p>40. Prolonged pretrial detention remained widespread in South Sudan owing to lack of 
</p>
<p>capacity and resources, and sometimes because the detention was politically motivated. For 
</p>
<p>example, two members of the State Legislative Assembly in Lakes State have remained in 
</p>
<p>detention since 24 October 2014, allegedly for having assisted armed youth groups to resist 
</p>
<p>government efforts to separate two communities, in order to reduce violence. The detainees 
</p>
<p>have not been charged with a crime nor have they had access to legal counsel. On a positive 
</p>
<p>note, in Aweil East county in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, following UNMISS advocacy, </p>


<p>25 persons who had been arbitrarily detained, including three women, were released by the 
</p>
<p>county court judge on 11 December. Many of them had been in custody serving sentences 
</p>
<p>issued by customary courts, despite the fact that those courts do not have legal authority to 
</p>
<p>pass such sentences.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of expression  
</b></p>
<p>41. Respect for freedom of expression further deteriorated, with continuing acts of 
</p>
<p>intimidation, harassment and threats against the media and journalists, mostly by NSS 
</p>
<p>agents, being reported.  Several editions of newspapers have been temporarily confiscated 
</p>
<p>and the newspaper offices ordered to close down, radio stations have been closed, and 
</p>
<p>journalists have been arrested and interrogated or harassed. This has resulted in an 
</p>
<p>atmosphere of self-censorship and has increasingly undermined the exercise of freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression.  
</p>
<p>42. On 16 August 2014, NSS closed Radio Bakhita, run by the Roman Catholic Church, 
</p>
<p>arrested and detained its news editor, reportedly following a report, aired on 15 August, on 
</p>
<p>fresh fighting in Unity State, including views from SLPM/A in Opposition sources that had 
</p>
<p>been quoted in the <i>Sudan Tribune</i>. The editor was released on 19 August following pressure 
</p>
<p>from national and international media associations, and the station reopened on 
</p>
<p>5 November. 
</p>
<p>43. On 10 October 2014, an SLPA spokesperson reportedly warned journalists to obtain 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;correct facts&#8221; from military command before reporting on any military or security-
</p>
<p>related issues. On the same day, NSS arrested and detained a foreign journalist, who was 
</p>
<p>released without charge on 15 October. On 31 October, NSS detained a photojournalist for 
</p>
<p>coverage at a petrol station during a fuel crisis. On 31 October, the editor of a major daily 
</p>
<p>newspaper was summoned by the police and kept in custody for several hours after a 
</p>
<p>complaint had been received about one of his opinion pieces. 
</p>
<p>44. On 9 September 2014, the Office of the President reported that three media bills had 
</p>
<p>been signed into law: the Media Authority Act, the Right of Access to Information Act and 
</p>
<p>the Broadcasting Cooperation Act. While some portions of the laws promote human rights, 
</p>
<p>the Media Authority Act retains the criminalization of defamation from the South Sudan 
</p>
<p>Penal Code of 2008, making the offence punishable by a fine or up to two years in prison. 
</p>
<p>With the powers to appoint and remove members of the bodies established by those laws 
</p>
<p>given to the executive, the protection for journalists and media practitioners envisaged by 
</p>
<p>the laws appears to be nominal.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Accountability  
</b></p>
<p>45. There were very few significant developments in the area of accountability for 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and abuses, particularly those committed since the outbreak of 
</p>
<p>violence in December 2013. While some accountability measures in specific individual 
</p>
<p>cases were noted, including arrests and investigations in relation to the alleged killings of 
</p>
<p>civilians by police in Central Equatoria and Northern Bahr el Ghazal in November 2014, in 
</p>
<p>general there appeared to have been no meaningful efforts by national actors to hold 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of gross violations of human rights accountable.  
</p>
<p>46. On 5 December 2014, senior officials of the Presidential Committee on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Abuses, established in January 2014 to investigate human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>abuses committed by security agents and opposition forces, informed UNMISS that its 
</p>
<p>report had been finalized and submitted to the President. At the same time, the Inspector 
</p>
<p>General of Police of South Sudan informed UNMISS that investigations conducted by the </p>


<p>National Police Service into the events of December 2013 had been unable to link any 
</p>
<p>police officer to human rights violations. The Inspector General indicated that the police 
</p>
<p>findings had been submitted to the Presidential Committee. 
</p>
<p>47. On 8 December 2014, in Lakes State, one individual was convicted and sentenced to 
</p>
<p>death by the Rumbek Central High Court for the murder of a paramount chief in Cuei-Chok 
</p>
<p>Payam on 5 August, which sparked intercommunal violence in the state. Four others were 
</p>
<p>acquitted of conspiracy and harbouring the offender in relation to the same incident. Unlike 
</p>
<p>in the large majority of cases in the country, including death penalty cases, the defendants 
</p>
<p>in those cases were represented by legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>48. While various local media houses reported other developments regarding national 
</p>
<p>accountability measures, UNMISS has not been able to verify those accounts. For example, 
</p>
<p>on 15 October 2014, one newspaper reported that SPLA had court-martialled, sentenced to 
</p>
<p>prison and dismissed three soldiers for &#8220;indiscipline&#8221; for killing a civilian and a soldier in 
</p>
<p>Juba in early 2014, which UNMISS could not confirm. Similarly, UNMISS was not able to 
</p>
<p>verify a South Sudan television report on 11 October, indicating that the Presidential 
</p>
<p>Committee on Human Rights had carried out additional investigations into human rights 
</p>
<p>violations and abuses committed in Juba in December 2013. UNMISS noted that, even 
</p>
<p>when such investigations involved violations against civilians, SPLA has been reluctant to 
</p>
<p>remit the accused persons to civilian courts, in accordance with national law.  
</p>
<p>49. UNMISS also engaged with leaders of SPLM/A in Opposition to monitor and 
</p>
<p>advocate accountability. On 24 November 2014, UNMISS human rights officers met with 
</p>
<p>the leadership of SPLM/A in Opposition in Unity State to inquire about allegations of 
</p>
<p>killings of civilians and the abduction of women during the rebel attack on Bentiu on 
</p>
<p>29 October. The leaders denied targeting civilians and claimed that the women who had 
</p>
<p>reportedly been abducted had been taken to their husbands in opposition-controlled areas. 
</p>
<p>50. With respect to international accountability measures, UNMISS facilitated field 
</p>
<p>visits by the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan, including to Bor and 
</p>
<p>Malakal. The Commission of Inquiry finalized its report and presented it to the Chairperson 
</p>
<p>of the African Union Commission, who disclosed that the report would be discussed by the 
</p>
<p>Peace and Security Council of the African Union.  
</p>
<p>51. On 18 September 2014, the Government of the United States of America imposed 
</p>
<p>sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, on two military commanders &#8212; Major 
</p>
<p>General Santino Deng Wol of the SPLA Third Division, and former Fourth Division 
</p>
<p>commander Major General James Koang Chol, who had defected to SPLM/A in Opposition 
</p>
<p>in December 2013. On 30 October, the Government of Canada also imposed sanctions on 
</p>
<p>SPLM/A in Opposition commander Major General Peter Gadet and the head of the 
</p>
<p>Presidential Guard, Major General Marial Chanuong. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Technical assistance 
</b></p>
<p>52. In May 2014, the Security Council, by its resolution 2155 (2014), brought an end to 
</p>
<p>the functions of UNMISS that related to supporting the Government of South Sudan in 
</p>
<p>capacity-building, and refocused the Mission&#8217;s tasks on four major priorities: the protection 
</p>
<p>of civilians; monitoring and investigating human rights; contributing to the conditions for 
</p>
<p>the delivery of humanitarian assistance; and supporting the implementation of the Cessation 
</p>
<p>of Hostilities Agreement signed in January 2014. 
</p>
<p>53. While focusing on monitoring, investigation, verification and reporting on human 
</p>
<p>rights violations and abuses, UNMISS continued to take action to address violations where 
</p>
<p>possible, including by conducting human rights sensitization with non-State partners, in </p>


<p>particular in Unity, Lakes, Jonglei and Western Equatoria States. Those sensitization 
</p>
<p>initiatives included training for journalists, women&#8217;s groups, religious and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, hospital social workers, returnees and primary and secondary school 
</p>
<p>students. UNMISS also engaged in human rights awareness-raising activities and dispute 
</p>
<p>resolution mechanisms with community leaders and displaced persons in its protection of 
</p>
<p>civilians sites. In accordance with Security Council resolution 2155 (2014), emphasis was 
</p>
<p>placed on women&#8217;s right to participate fully in decision-making and the prevention and 
</p>
<p>resolution of conflict.  
</p>
<p>54. On 25 November 2014, as part of efforts to address gender-based violence, 
</p>
<p>including conflict-related sexual violence, UNMISS and its partners launched the annual 
</p>
<p>16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign, including radio talk shows 
</p>
<p>and awareness-raising activities throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>55. On 11 December 2014, UNMISS, in collaboration with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, trained 15 media observers in Juba on 
</p>
<p>information-gathering and human rights investigation methodology. Similar training 
</p>
<p>focusing on investigating, reporting and advocacy has been carried out for civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>One year into the conflict in South Sudan, the human rights situation there 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains grave. Though the scale and severity of the conflict have recently declined, 
</b></p>
<p><b>there has been persistent fighting, notably in Unity, Upper Nile and Jonglei States, 
</b></p>
<p><b>accompanied by gross human rights violations and abuses, including killings, conflict-
</b></p>
<p><b>related sexual violence and large-scale displacements of civilians. With very little 
</b></p>
<p><b>meaningful progress having been made towards a political resolution of the crisis, 
</b></p>
<p><b>there is a risk that the armed conflict may intensify, with a further devastating impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>on civilians. In addition to the conflict, intercommunal violence continues to be of 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious concern. There also continues to be a notable deterioration in the exercise of 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of expression, with incidents of threats and intimidation of civil society, 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention of journalists and censorship of the media. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>While both forces engaged in the fighting have continued to commit serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations and abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>neither side has taken any concrete steps to date to hold perpetrators to account or to 
</b></p>
<p><b>seriously pursue justice and redress for the victims. In the light of the marked failure 
</b></p>
<p><b>by both parties to the conflict to hold perpetrators accountable, it is hoped that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan, established to investigate 
</b></p>
<p><b>ongoing crimes and human rights violations and abuses, will publish its findings soon 
</b></p>
<p><b>as a step towards ensuring meaningful accountability for human rights violations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuse and ending the cycle of violence and impunity in the country.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The recommendations the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights made in his report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session  
</b></p>
<p><b>remain largely unimplemented and continue to apply. The High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p><b>reiterates those recommendations, broadening their scope, and adds new ones.  </b></p>


<p><b>  To the Government of South Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Immediately cease fighting and all forms of violence, and refrain from 
</b></p>
<p><b>committing human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including those amounting to international crimes, such as extrajudicial killings, 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnically targeted violence, conflict-related sexual violence, including rape, as well as 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender-based violence, recruitment and use of children, enforced disappearances and 
</b></p>
<p><b>arbitrary arrests and detention. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Comply with all agreements signed under the auspices of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), including the January 2014 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and the Agreement to Resolve the Crisis in South 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan (9 May 2014), and fully commit itself to the Addis Ababa negotiation process, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by allowing the deployment and strengthening of the IGAD Monitoring and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Verification Mechanism across all conflict-affected areas. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Ensure prompt, credible, transparent, independent, impartial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive investigations into allegations of violations of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian and human rights law, including alleged international crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed in Juba in the initial stages of the conflict in mid-December 2013 and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>April 2014 attacks on civilians in Bentiu and Bor. Ensure accountability for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators of such violations in accordance with international standards and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide adequate remedies and redress for the victims.  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Cease activities impeding the right to freedom of expression, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>harassment and censorship of the media and civil society, the summoning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention of journalists, and the issuing of orders to suspend publications or seize 
</b></p>
<p><b>newspapers. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  To the Sudan People</b>&#8217;<b>s Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition and 
other armed actors 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Immediately cease fighting and all forms of violence, and ensure that its forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>do not commit human rights violations and abuses and violations of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law, including those amounting to international crimes, such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>extrajudicial killings, ethnically targeted violence, conflict-related sexual violence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including rape, as well as gender-based violence, recruitment and use of children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests and detention. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Comply with all agreements signed under the auspices of IGAD, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>January 2014 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and the Agreement to Resolve the

</b></p>
<p><b>negotiation process, including by allowing the deployment and strengthening of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>IGAD Monitoring and Verification Mechanism in areas under their control.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Commit themselves to abiding by international humanitarian law, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>desisting from attacks on civilians, civilian objects and humanitarian facilities, ceasing 
</b></p>
<p><b>indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks and ensuring the facilitation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian access to territories under their control. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>Facilitate the conduct of prompt investigations into allegations of serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of international humanitarian law and human rights violations and abuses 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed by commanders, fighters and affiliated militia forces, including the

<p><b>unlawful killings of civilians in Bentiu in mid-April 2014.  </b></p>


<p><b>  To the African Union Peace and Security Council 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Ensure that the findings of the African Union Commission of Inquiry on South 
</b></p>
<p><b>Sudan, established to investigate human rights violations and abuses committed 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations are implemented.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  To the Intergovernmental Authority on Development  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Ensure that any final peace agreement includes a commitment to address past 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations and abuses, combat impunity and ensure accountability in accordance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international standards, and to promote human rights, and that it precludes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>granting of amnesties for alleged perpetrators of international crimes and gross 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations and abuses.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  To the United Nations Mission in South Sudan
