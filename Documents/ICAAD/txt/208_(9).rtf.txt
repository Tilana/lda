5] You are 27 years old, married with 2 kids, employed as taxi driver. The accused is remanded in custody. Your wife has moved with another man and your children with your elderly mother. You asked court's leniency and forgiveness. You sought non custodial sentence. 

6] Considering value of property, I select 2 year imprisonment as starting point in respect of first offence. In respect of larceny, second count, I select 1 year imprisonment.

7] For you mitigating factors I reduce 1 year for count 1 and 4 months for count 2. Now your sentence is 1 year for count 1 and 8 months for count 2. (Altogether 1 year 8 months). You have been granted bail for this case but you were remanded in custody for another pending case. Therefore I do not deduct your period in remand for this case.

8] There is no compelling reason for suspend your sentence. You have 16 previous convictions ranging 2001 to 2009 and most of them are similar in nature. You have not learnt a lesson. Therefore you serve;

Count 1: 1 year and 
Count 2: 8 months imprisonment 
Both sentences are to be run concurrently with effect from today. 

9]. 28 days to appeal.
