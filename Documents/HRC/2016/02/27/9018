</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 8/14, mainly 
covers human rights developments in Myanmar since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interim report 
submitted to the General Assembly (A/63/341). 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur has travelled twice to Myanmar and has established constructive 
working relations with its Government. He would like to thank the Government for its hospitality 
and cooperation during the missions and also in discharging his mandate. 
</p>
<p> In the report, the Special Rapporteur elaborates on issues relating to the protection of 
human rights. In particular, he concentrates on the situation of prisoners of conscience, their right 
to a fair trial and due process of law and conditions of their detention, as well as freedom of 
expression, assembly and association in the context of the upcoming elections in 2010. He 
reviews internal conflicts with regard to international humanitarian law and protection of 
civilians and issues of discrimination and the need for humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur reiterates his recommendation of four core human rights elements: 
a review of national legislation in accordance with the new Constitution and international 
obligations; the progressive release of prisoners of conscience; training for the armed forces to 
ensure respect for international human rights and humanitarian law; and the establishment of an 
independent and impartial judiciary. Since Myanmar is party to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
only, the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that it accede to the other core international 
human rights instruments. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 8/14 and 
covers the human rights developments in Myanmar since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports 
submitted to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/7/24) and the General Assembly (A/63/341). 
</p>
<p>2. On 23 September 2008, seven prisoners of conscience were released, one of whom was 
rearrested a day later. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the release, hoping that it would be the 
first in a series of releases of other prisoners of conscience. On 21 February 2009, 29 more 
prisoners of conscience were released. 
</p>
<p>3. From September to December 2008, some 300 prisoners of conscience were given harsh 
sentences, including a dozen detainees who were given 65-year prison sentences. The Special 
Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief condemned publicly the severe convictions and 
unfair trials. On 14 January 2009, a 20-year-old student was sentenced to 104 years of 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report focuses on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s findings during his visit to 
Myanmar from 14 to 19 February 2009. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the 
Government of Myanmar for its hospitality and the cooperation he received during his mission to 
the country. The objectives of the mission were to assess the development of the human rights 
situation since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit in August 2008 and to discuss with the relevant 
authorities the implementation of the four core human rights elements. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur met with the Secretary-General in October 2008 and is in constant 
contact with his Special Adviser on Myanmar, Professor Ibrahim Gambari. The Special 
Rapporteur would finally like to thank the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), in particular at Geneva, Bangkok and New York for assisting him in 
discharging his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  METHODOLOGY AND ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur was appointed in March 2008 and officially assumed his functions 
on 1 May 2008. He presented his first report to the Council in June 2008 (A/HRC/7/24), wherein 
he announced that his primary task was to cooperate with and assist the Government of 
Myanmar in its efforts in the field of promotion and protection of human rights. He reiterated his 
cooperation with the Government to assist in the realization of human rights of the people of 
Myanmar in his statements to the Council and in his report (A/63/341) and statement to the 
General Assembly. In the latter report, the Special Rapporteur mentioned that, if after some time, 
there was no sign of any result on the horizon, he would consider changing his strategy. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s two requests to visit Myanmar were met by the Government. He 
conducted missions to the country from 3 to 7 August 2008, and from 14 to 19 February 2009. 
He considers that both missions were constructive since the identified objectives were achieved, 
namely, the establishment of a cooperative relationship with the Government and other </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>stakeholders during his first mission, and the discussions with relevant authorities on the process 
of implementation of the four core human rights elements recommended by the Special 
Rapporteur, to be completed before the elections of 2010. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur had three constructive meetings with the Government human 
rights group. Initially, he presented the four core human rights elements to the group. In 
February, he requested the group to assist the Government in the implementation of the 
elements. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur had substantive and fruitful discussions with relevant authorities 
on the implementation of the four core human rights elements. With regard to the first core 
element, the Attorney General informed the Special Rapporteur that 380 domestic laws had been 
sent to the concerned ministries for review, to check compliance with the human rights 
provisions of the Constitution. On the second core element and the progressive release of 
prisoners of conscience, the Minister for Home Affairs assured the Special Rapporteur that he 
would consider his recommendation. Regarding the third core element, the Special Rapporteur 
discussed with the Head of Police and the Judge Advocate General at the Ministry of Defence 
the possibility of training sessions on international human rights law and humanitarian law for 
the armed forces and the police. Since sessions had already been conducted for both forces, it 
was agreed that they share their curricula with the Special Rapporteur to ensure compliance with 
international standards and cooperation in future sessions. On the fourth core element, even 
though the Chief Justice mentioned that the judiciary was independent in Myanmar, he accepted 
to engage and receive the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. 
</p><p>10. The Special Rapporteur also met with the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs, the Chairperson of the Tripartite Core Group, members of the Bar Council, the Myanmar 
Woman Affairs Federation and the Union Solidarity and Central Development Association. His 
request to meet with the leaders of various political parties was not met since all the leaders were 
held in detention, either under house arrest or in prisons in remote areas. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur visited the areas affected by Cyclone Nargis in August 2008 and 
his findings were included in his report submitted to the General Assembly. He travelled to 
Kayin State in February 2009, where he met with two factions of the Karen National Union 
(KNU) that had concluded a ceasefire with the Government. He noted that the Karen National 
Union/Karen National Liberation Army (KNU/KNLA) Peace Council had maintained its own 
armed forces and had its own Constitution, laws, jail and judges; the Democratic Buddhist Karen 
Army informed the Special Rapporteur that it maintained an armed force of 5,000 fighters. 
Both factions denied recruiting minors as soldiers and agreed to allow the United Nations 
Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism task force verification of their troops, as required by the 
Security Council in its resolution 1612 (2005) on children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur also met with the Phayagone Region Peace Group/Phado Aung 
San group, which has surrendered. He was unable to go to the KNU-controlled areas. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur intends to return to Myanmar before finalizing his report for the 
General Assembly. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p>14. Myanmar is party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child only. However, as a State 
Member of the United Nations, it is bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
subsequent declarations adopted by the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government of Myanmar for submitting its report 
to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and its appearance before 
the Committee in November 2008. He encourages the Government&#8217;s implementation of the 
Committee&#8217;s concluding observations to ensure improvement of gender balance and the situation 
of women in Myanmar, including in North Rakhine State. 
</p>
<p>16. The third and fourth reports of Myanmar under the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
were due on 13 August 2008. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to abide by its 
reporting obligations and to submit its reports as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>17. The human rights situation in Myanmar remains challenging and needs to be addressed 
quickly and effectively. These challenges include economic, social and cultural rights. For this 
reason, the Special Rapporteur has promoted the idea of the expansion of the Tripartite Core 
Group&#8217;s mandate beyond the areas affected by Cyclone Nargis to address humanitarian needs in 
other states, such as Kachin, Rakhine and Chin. 
</p>
<p>18. As in any other least developed country, poverty is the main reason for a range of problems 
and a hindrance to the realization of human rights for everyone. While visiting Insein prison in 
Yangon, and speaking at random with the inmates, the Special Rapporteur spoke with a young 
girl who claimed to be 17 years old (prison authorities claimed that she was 19) who had been 
sentenced to two years of imprisonment for having stolen the equivalent of $10. When she was 
asked to write her name, she responded that she was illiterate. To the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
comment that he had heard from all relevant authorities that education was free and compulsory, 
the authorities&#8217; response was that she was an exception, since she had a poor financial 
background and had had to work from an early age to support her family. There are many others 
like her, who are exploited as children and do not receive any education to ensure a better future. 
</p>
<p>19. During his latest mission to Myanmar, the Special Rapporteur visited the Hpa-An and 
Insein prisons. These were announced visits. He took a tour of the kitchen and the medical 
facilities. In both prisons, he spoke at random with the inmates to check their ages, the reason for 
which they were detained, if they had been brought before a court, if they had had access to legal 
counsel, and so on. In both prisons, the Special Rapporteur interviewed inmates who had been 
porters, without remuneration, for the military in Kayin State and had tried to run away because 
of the harshness of the work. One was a porter of ammunition, the other of food. The probability 
that there are many other victims of forced labour in prison is high. Also, the probability of those 
who have not tried to run away is also high. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the one-year 
extension of the supplementary understanding between the Government of Myanmar and the 
International Labour Organization (ILO). He strongly recommends that the Government and ILO 
continue their close cooperation with a view to eradicating forced labour in Myanmar, and in 
particular to review the domestic policy and the jail manual regarding the use of prisoners by the 
military and prison labour. In Insein prison, the victim of forced labour was shackled. The </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>official explanation was that, since he had tried to run away from the military compound, he had 
been shackled in prison. The authorities also recognized that some 30 to 40 prisoners were 
shackled in Insein prison. According to article 33 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners,<b>1</b> instruments of restraint, such as handcuffs, chains, irons and 
straitjackets, should never be applied as punishment, and chains and irons should not be used as 
restraints. 
</p>
<p>20. None of the prisoners with whom the Special Rapporteur spoke had been represented in the 
court by legal counsel. Many did not even know the definition of the word &#8220;lawyer&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Situation of prisoners of conscience, the right to fair trial  
and due process of law:  conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>21. There are currently more than 2,100 prisoners of conscience in Myanmar. During the 
period under review, a range of events related to prisoners of conscience. 
</p>
<p>22. On 23 September 2008, U Win Tin (whom the Special Rapporteur had met in Insein prison 
in August 2008), Dr. May Win Myint, U Aung Soe Myint, U Khin Maung Swe, Win Htain, 
Dr. Than Nyein and U Thein Naing were released. The Special Rapporteur publicly welcomed 
this initiative by the Government of Myanmar and expressed hope that it would be the first in a 
series of releases of other prisoners of conscience. It was reported, however, that Win Htain was 
rearrested shortly after his release. The Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government on 
26 September 2008 enquiring about the rearrest. The Government replied that Win Htain&#8217;s 
release from prison had been an error. 
</p>
<p>23. From October to December 2008, some 400 prisoners of conscience were brought before 
prison courts and given very harsh, long sentences. On 11 November 2008, 23 members of 
the 88 Generation Students, including 5 women, were given terms of imprisonment of 65 years 
by a court in Insein prison. The comedian Zarganar was sentenced to a total of 59 years, which 
was reduced in February 2009 to 35 years. More than 25 people, including 5 monks, were 
sentenced to 24 years of imprisonment. U Gambira, whom the Special Rapporteur had met in 
Insein prison in August 2008, was sentenced to 68 years in prison; in December 2008, he was 
transferred to Mandalay prison and, according to the latest information, transferred again in 
January 2009 to Hkamti prison in Sagaing Division. In August 2008, the Special Rapporteur also 
met with Su Su Nway, who was sentenced on 11 November 2008 to 12 years and 6 months. 
Subsequently, she was transferred to Mandalay prison; on 18 November 2008, she was 
transferred to Kale prison in Sagaing Division, some 680 miles north of Yangon. Owing to her 
heart condition, she relied on medication brought by her family. The Special Rapporteur has 
since learned that, on 20 February 2009, Yangon Division Court reduced Su Su Nway&#8217;s sentence 
by four years. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that the prosecutors during the 
above-mentioned trials were all police sergeants. Police officers were called by the court as 
witnesses. Prisoners of conscience were charged with unrelated offences, mainly under the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  Economic and Social Council resolutions 663 C (XXIV) and 2076 (LXII). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>provisions of the Penal Code; the Emergency Provision Act (1950); the State Protection 
Act (1975); the Video Act and the State Law and Order Restoration Council Law No. 8/96 
(29 July 1996); the Law Protecting the Peaceful and Systematic Transfer of State Responsibility 
and the Successful Performance of the Functions of the National Convention against 
Disturbances and Oppositions; the State Law and Order Restoration Council Law No. 5/96 
(7 June 1996); the Unlawful Association Act (1908); the Electronic Transactions Law; the Public 
Property Protection Act (1947); the Law Amending the Myanmar Immigration (Emergency 
Provisions); and the Official Secrets Act (1948). 
</p>
<p>25. The process leading to the above-mentioned sentences illustrates the serious flaws in the 
current administration of justice system and calls for serious reform efforts. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that the Constitution, in chapter 1, paragraph 19, establishes important judicial 
principles: (a) to administer justice independently according to the law; (b) to dispense justice in 
open court unless otherwise prohibited by the law; and (c) to guarantee in all cases the right to a 
defence and the right of appeal under the law. However, in reality, many prisoners of conscience 
have been sentenced in closed-door hearings within prison compounds, without legal 
representations, without the presence or knowledge of their family members, and without proof 
of evidence or with flawed evidence. In fact, defence lawyers face great difficulties ranging from 
not being informed of the dates and venues of trials to not having the possibility of meeting 
detainees in private before trial. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur has also received disturbing information from various reliable 
sources on the conviction of defence lawyers for contempt of court during the wave of 
sentencing of prisoners of conscience in November 2008. He discussed this matter with the 
Bar Council and was informed about the Contempt of Court Act (1926), which provides for a 
duration of imprisonment of up to six months, but does not specify what actually constitutes 
contempt of court, leaving it open to any interpretation or decision by higher instances. The 
senior lawyers Aung Thein and Khin Maung Shein representing U Gambira were sentenced to 
four months of imprisonment for contempt of court on 7 November 2008, charged under 
section 3 of the Contempt of Court Act. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that, according to the Basic Principles on 
the Role of Lawyers, Governments should ensure that lawyers (a) are able to perform all of their 
professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference; 
(b) are able to travel and to consult with their clients freely both within their own country and 
abroad; and (c) should not suffer, or be threatened with, prosecution or administrative, economic 
or other sanctions for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, 
standards and ethics (art. 16). Furthermore, lawyers should enjoy civil and penal immunity for 
relevant statements made in good faith in written or oral pleadings or in their professional 
appearances before a court, tribunal or other legal or administrative authority (art. 20). 
</p>
<p>28. In Myanmar, the right to legal counsel is not fully respected and, if a suspect cannot afford 
a lawyer, the Government is not obliged to provide one. 
</p>
<p>29. Over 600 sentenced prisoners have been transferred to prisons far from their hometowns, 
in isolated areas around the country, making it difficult for their families to visit regularly. Visits </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>become more costly and time-consuming for families. The fact that family members are unable 
to see each other on a regular basis can have a psychological impact on both the prisoners and 
their families. Moreover, prisoners very often rely on food and medication provided by their 
families. 
</p>
<p>30. It has been reported that a number of prisoners have been regularly transferred to other 
prisons without notification of their families, who lose track of the prisoner&#8217;s whereabouts. 
</p>
<p>31. On 3 January 2009, Bo Min Yu Ko,<b> </b>a<b> </b>member of the Mandalay branch of the All Burma 
Federation of Student Unions in his early twenties, who was arrested on 16 September 2008, was 
sentenced to 104 years of imprisonment at Obo Prison Court in Mandalay Division. He was 
charged under 40 different sections of law and was not allowed a defence lawyer. He faced six 
charges under section 13/1 of the Immigration Act alone. 
</p>
<p>32. It is also reported that prisoners of conscience during the interrogation period carried out 
by the Special Security Force of Military Intelligence are subject to physical ill-treatment. Some 
are asked to remain in the same position for long hours every day. There are also reports of 
prisoners having been beaten during interrogation. The Special Rapporteur was informed that a 
large number of prisoners of conscience are kept in solitary confinement. He therefore reiterates 
the need for human rights training for the military and prison staff to raise their awareness of 
international standards and rules for the treatment of prisoners. 
</p>
<p>33. During his mission to Myanmar in February 2009, the Special Rapporteur met in private 
with five prisoners of his choice. He met with Dr. Tin Min Htut and Nyi Pu, both National 
League for Democracy candidates elected in 1990 to Parliament. They were co-signatories of a 
letter addressed to the Secretary-General to express concern about the new Constitution of 
Myanmar, after which they were arrested on 12 August 2008. On 13 February 2009, they were 
sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that any citizen 
of a State Member of the United Nations should be able to write to and contact the 
Secretary-General without fear of reprisal. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur also met with Kyaw Ko Ko, leader of the All Burma Federation of 
Student Unions, arrested on 17 March 2008 and sentenced to three years of imprisonment in 
early February 2009. The Special Rapporteur was informed that Kyaw Ko Ko had been 
transferred to another prison, and his whereabouts have still not been disclosed to his family. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur met with Nyi Nyi Htwe, a lawyer defending prisoners of 
conscience, who has been charged under section 228 of the Penal Code and sentenced to six 
months of imprisonment; his release is due in April 2009. He also met with Daw Pone Na Mee 
(dae Mya Nyunt), 84 years old and a nun since the age of 45. She was arrested, together with a 
number of other nuns and elderly monks, in a monastery in October 2007, and did not know the 
reason for her arrest. She was frail and had difficulty in standing and walking. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur received reports about the dire health conditions of a large number 
of prisoners of conscience, some of whom do not even receive basic medication. In 
January 2009, he received reports regarding Kay Thi Aung&#8217;s miscarriage owing to lack of 
adequate medical care in O Bo prison in Mandalay Division. He has unfortunately also received 
reports regarding the death of prisoners who died owing to lack of medical care. The most recent </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>case was on 28 December 2008 and concerned Htay Lwin Oo, 46, who was suffering from 
tuberculosis in Mandalay prison. A teacher and member of the National League for Democracy 
from Amarapura Township in Mandalay, he was arrested on 21 December 2003 and sentenced to 
seven years of imprisonment under section 5 (J) of the Emergency Provisions Act. He was due 
for release in December 2009. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur received reports regarding the situation of Zaw Naing Htwe, 
according to which his life is in danger at the Four-Mile Labour Camp near Taungoo Town in 
Pegu Division. It is said that he is shackled while being forced to perform hard labour by the 
authorities. He is not being given enough food and water. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call for the termination of Daw Aung Sa Suu Kyi&#8217;s 
detention under house arrest, which is in contravention of articles 9, 10 and 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, according to which no one should be subjected to arbitrary arrest 
or detention, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial 
tribunal, and everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Moreover, according 
to the 1975 State Protection Act, used to justify her detention, a person judged to be &#8220;a threat to 
the sovereignty and security of the State and the peace of the people&#8221; can only be detained for up 
to five years. The five-year limit has now passed. In his meeting with the Chief Justice, the 
Special Rapporteur enquired about Aung Sa Suu Kyi&#8217;s legal case against her house arrest and 
conditions of detention, which was submitted to the authorities on 8 October. The response to the 
enquiry was that, since the detention was an administrative order, the legal case had not been 
sent to the Supreme Court. Furthermore, the Deputy Attorney General asserted that she was 
under &#8220;quasi-judicial&#8221; detention. Subsequently, the Special Rapporteur raised the issue with the 
Minister for Home Affairs, who explained that the case had been received by the Prime Minister, 
who had instructed both the Chief Justice and Ministry of Home Affairs to look into the matter. 
The Special Rapporteur calls for an urgent, impartial and independent review of this case. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur regrets that, despite his request, he could not meet with any of the 
leaders of political parties (including Daw Aung Sa Suu Kyi, Min Ko Naing, leader of the 
88 Generation Students, Hkun Htun Oo, leader of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, 
and U Myint Aye, leader of Human Rights Defenders and Promoters Group) because they were 
all either under house arrest or in remote prisons. Hkun Htun Oo was sentenced to 93 years of 
imprisonment in November 2005. He is in Puta-O prison in Kachin State, where conditions are 
said to be very harsh, especially for him since he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and 
prostate problems. Min Ko Naing was sentenced to 65 years of imprisonment in November 2008 
and, according to the latest information, is in Keng Tung prison in Shan State, where he is 
reported to be in solitary confinement and suffering from severe eye problems. U Myint Aye was 
transferred from Insein prison to Loikaw prison in Kayah State on 16 December 2008. On 
28 November 2008, he was convicted under the Explosives Act, the Immigration Act and the 
Unlawful Association Act, and received a life sentence and eight years. 
</p>
<p>40. In order for the seven-step road map to democracy to comply with international standards 
and the requirements of a democratic society, the leaders of these political parties and other 
prisoners of conscience should be released to participate freely in the completion of the road 
map. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>41. On 21 February 2009, the Government released some 6,313 prisoners, 
including 29 prisoners of conscience. The release, although welcome, lacks proportionality when 
compared with the total number of prisoners of conscience, of whom there are more than 2,100. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Myanmar authorities to the existence of 
a body of internationally accepted standards and principles in the area of human rights in the 
administration of justice, including the treatment of prisoners, the role of lawyers, the role of 
prosecutors, the independence of the judiciary and the conduct of law enforcement officials, 
which must guide the authorities to ensure free trials and due process of law. He underlines the 
necessity of legal reform to review legislation and procedures to ensure conformity with human 
rights standards and respect for the basic principles of the presumption of innocence, due process 
of the law and the independence of the judiciary. 
</p><p>43. The State has the responsibility of ensuring the protection and proper treatment of persons 
in detention, including by providing adequate food and medical care in accordance with 
universally accepted standards and the principles contained in international human rights 
instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Standard Minimum Rules 
for the Treatment of Prisoners, the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, the Body of 
Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to 
the Role of Health Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and 
Detainees against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur notes the importance of financial support provided by the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to families to visit their detained relatives. He 
invites the authorities to re-engage with ICRC and allow it to conduct prison visits, which have 
been suspended since December 2005, in accordance with its established mandate. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for the moratorium on the use of the 
death penalty, in place since 1998. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Freedom of expression, assembly and association 
and the road towards the elections of 2010 
</b></p>
<p>46. Freedom of opinion and expression, as well as of assembly and association, are essential 
elements for the achievement of the road map to 2010 and are enshrined in the new Constitution 
of Myanmar. Paragraph 8 of the preamble provides for justice, liberty and equality. 
Paragraph (d) of article 6 declares that the basic principles of the State are the flourishing of a 
genuine, disciplined multiparty democratic system. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of article 406 state 
that a political party should have the right to organize freely and to participate and compete in 
elections. Lastly, article 354 states that every citizen should be at liberty to express and publish 
their convictions and opinions freely, to assemble peacefully without arms and to form 
associations and organizations. Nonetheless, some 16 journalists and bloggers are currently in 
prison. 
</p>
<p>47. In its resolution 63/245, the General Assembly expressed its grave concern about the 
continuing imposition of severe restrictions on the exercise of fundamental freedoms, notably the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, association and assembly. In his report submitted to the 
General Assembly (A/63/341), the Special Rapporteur indicated several domestic laws that 
restrict the principles of freedom of association and assembly, most importantly the Unlawful 
Association Act, the State Protection Act, and sections 143, 145, 152, 505, 505 (b) and 295 (A) 
of the Penal Code. These laws continue to be used to restrict freedom of expression and 
association, most notably during the sentencing of hundreds of political activists since 
August 2008 for their participation in the peaceful demonstrations of 2007. With regard to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Television and Video Law (1985), the Motion Picture 
Law (1996), the Computer Science Development Law (1996), the Electronic Communication 
Law and the Printers and Publishers Registration Act (1962) are invoked to censor the media. 
</p>
<p>48. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur received information that restrictions continue to be 
imposed on the right to form trade unions. Several individuals who were associated with trade 
unions, including the banned Federation of Trade Unions of Burma, have been detained, 
convicted and sentenced to long terms in prison. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur has also received information that several journalists have been 
convicted on the basis of the Electronic Act and the Video Act. He moreover remains concerned 
about restrictions on the media, including censorship of newspapers, the Internet and other 
sources of information, and the threatening of journalists with heavy prison sentences under the 
above-mentioned laws. 
</p>
<p>50. It is important to note that these laws are in contravention of international law, inter alia, 
articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, articles 13 and 15 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as the ILO Convention concerning Freedom of 
Association and Protection of the Right to Organise (Convention No. 87) to which Myanmar is a 
party, and which explicitly calls upon Governments to ensure the full enjoyment of freedom of 
expression and association. As a State party to these conventions and a State Member of the 
United Nations, the Government of Myanmar should ensure compliance of domestic laws with 
its international obligations. 
</p>
<p>51. On the basis of a discussion held with the Attorney General regarding the implementation 
of the first core human rights element, the Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the 
Government to complete the process of reviewing and amending the domestic laws that do not 
comply with international standards and provisions relative to human rights of the new 
Constitution, in order to allow for the full enjoyment of the freedom of opinion and expression, 
as well as of association and assembly, including assuring a free and independent media. 
</p>
<p>52. In the context of the elections in 2010, fundamental rights also include freedom to hold 
opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any 
media, regardless of frontiers. Genuine multiparty elections imply informed and educated voters, 
the forming and proper registration of political parties, the ability of political parties to carry out 
campaign activities, including through all available means of media and the opening of offices in 
localities across the country, and the existence of independent media and non-governmental 
groups. None of this would be possible without the fundamental rights of freedom of opinion and 
expression, assembly and association. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>53. In this regard, it is of utmost importance that the election law be introduced publicly as 
soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>54. In order for the seven-step road map to democracy to comply with democratic values, the 
right to assembly (such as public demonstrations and political meetings) should be fully 
respected. Following the crackdown on the peaceful demonstrations of September 2007, 
31 deaths, of which 15 were confirmed by the Government, and 74 cases of disappearance were 
reported. Crackdowns on peaceful demonstrations and assemblies demonstrate the vulnerability 
of the freedom of assembly and the democratic process. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  International humanitarian law protection of civilian discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>55. In its resolution 63/245, the General Assembly strongly called upon the Government of 
Myanmar to, inter alia, intensify measures to ensure the protection of children from armed 
conflict. Children continue to be recruited and used in large numbers as soldiers despite the 
existing laws and policies prohibiting the recruitment of persons below the age of 18. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to intensify efforts to address the 
problem of the recruitment of child soldiers in its armed forces. He welcomes the efforts of the 
Government committee for the prevention of military recruitment of underage children in 
November 2008 to raise awareness among military officers and other ranks in the Northern 
Command. He also notes the cooperation of the Government with the Working Group on 
Children in Armed Conflict. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to continue 
implementing the plan of action of the committee, and urges that those who continue to recruit 
child soldiers be brought to justice. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
adhere to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement 
of children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the unfolding armed conflict in Kayin 
State between the Union of Myanmar Army and the KNU, which severely affects the civilian 
population. It is said that both parties are responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, enforced 
disappearances and arbitrary arrests, forcible displacement, the use of anti-personnel mines and 
the destruction of villages. 
</p>
<p>57. In August 2008, villagers were allegedly shot dead by soldiers in their paddy fields west of 
Papuan township. Incidents of forced labour are also reported, including in the construction and 
maintenance of eight roads and the portering of supplies to new military outposts. The Special 
Rapporteur, during his latest visit, met in prison with two victims of forced labour for the 
military in Kayin State. According to the information received, in<b> </b>Central Kayin State<b> </b>military<b> 
</b>patrols continue to restrict the free movement of villagers. 
</p>
<p>58. In the townships of Laikha, Nam Zarng and Mong Kung in Southern Shan State, human 
rights abuses have allegedly been committed by a splinter group of the Shan State Army South 
Battalion 758. Forced labour, land confiscations, the forced construction of agricultural 
plantations and sharp rises in commodity prices have also been reported. 
</p>
<p>59. In Kaya State,<b> </b>despite a decrease in the number of troops, fighting between the military 
and the Karenni National Progressive Party continued. The confiscation of land and work 
without remuneration in the agriculture sector have been reported. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>60. In Mon State, fighting between the Monland Resistance Party and the military continued. 
During a three-month offensive by the army from June to August 2008 in southern Ye 
Township, civilians were allegedly tortured and forcibly conscripted into local militia forces. It is 
reported that, in Thanbyuzayat township, land was confiscated for the construction of rubber and 
castor oil plantations and farmers were arbitrarily taxed. Furthermore, civilians were allegedly 
forced to guard the Kanbauk-Myaingkalay gas pipeline in Mudon. In Thanbyuzayat and 
Kyaikmayaw townships, it is said that civilians were forced to construct security outposts 
every 500 metres. 
</p>
<p>61. In November 2008, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
expressed deep concern at the high prevalence of sexual and other forms of violence, including 
rape, perpetrated against rural women from the Shan, Mon, Karen, Palaung and Chin ethnic 
groups by members of the armed forces. The Committee also expressed concern at the apparent 
impunity of the perpetrators of such violence (although a few cases have been prosecuted) and at 
reports of threats against and intimidation and punishment of the victims. On 27 December 2008, 
the body of a 7-year-old girl was found raped and shot dead, near her house in Ma Oo Bin 
village, Kyauk Township, Nyaunglebin District, in northern Kayin State. No action has yet been 
taken against the perpetrator of the crime, allegedly from the Light Infantry 350, which has since 
moved away from the area. As in all other such previous cases, justice must be done. The family 
of the victim and other community members must be protected from any retaliation for seeking 
justice. Some 450,000 people are said to be internally displaced in Myanmar because of armed 
conflicts around the country. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government and all armed groups to ensure the 
protection of civilians, in particular children and women, during armed conflict. He calls upon 
the Government to abide by international humanitarian law, especially the four Geneva 
Conventions, to which Myanmar is a party. In particular, article 3 of the Geneva Conventions 
provides for the protection of civilians from inhumane treatment and violence to life and person. 
</p>
<p>63. The use of anti-personnel mines along the border areas of Myanmar, particularly near the 
eastern border, poses a serious threat to the lives of villagers. Both the military and non-State 
armed groups use anti-personnel mines. It is reported that landmines are commonly used for 
purposes such as restricting the movement of people, hindering the movement of troops, or for 
marking concession parameters. Particularly worrying is the reported practice of human 
minesweepers, whereby civilians are forced by the military to clear brush in suspected mined 
areas or to serve as porters for the military in areas where there is a mine hazard. According to 
reports, civilians have been requested to remove mines without training or protective equipment, 
or to repair fences in mined areas; serious casualties have been reported. The Special Rapporteur 
calls for the implementation of a moratorium on the use of landmines and for accession to the 
Mine Ban Treaty. He encourages the authorities to seek effective international cooperation and 
support in order to begin efforts for mine clearance and to provide support to victims of 
landmines. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned over the practice of forced labour without 
compensation or payment and various forms of extortion and arbitrary taxations. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligations to fully implement 
Legislative Order No. 1/1999 on the Eradication of Forced Labour. There have been numerous </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and frequent reports on civilians being forced to serve as porters and guides for the military, to 
build and maintain roads, to construct military camps and to work on infrastructure projects. The 
Special Rapporteur has received reports on human rights abuses in relation to extractive projects, 
which bring in an increased military presence to oversee preparations, such as the building of 
roads and for setting up infrastructures, relying on forced labour and land confiscation. He calls 
upon all those involved in such extractive projects to carry out human rights impact assessments 
in order to avoid this kind of human rights abuse. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned over the continued discrimination against the 
Muslim population of Rakhine State. Ongoing human rights violations, such as restrictions on 
the exercise of religion, forced relocation, land seizures and restrictions on freedom of 
movement, have been reported. In November 2008, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women urged the Government of Myanmar to review the 1982 
citizenship law that places unreasonable restrictions on the Muslim population of Rakhine State 
in the enjoyment of their fundamental rights, and denies them citizenship. They are subject to 
multiple restrictions and forms of discrimination, require official permission to marry and have 
children, and are criminalized for non-compliance. They have an illiteracy rate of 80 per cent, 
and their movements are restricted. Since 1994, the authorities have stopped issuing birth 
certificates, leaving thousands of children unregistered. As non-citizens, women are barred from 
serving as schoolteachers or as nurses. They are vulnerable to sexual violence. The presence of 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the region, 
established after the 1992 refugee influx into Bangladesh, has had a stabilizing effect. The 
continued presence of UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations is most important. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure that ethnic minorities are 
granted fundamental rights, as enshrined in the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging 
to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities and article 30 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child. In the light of the seven-step road map to democracy and the new 
Constitution, especially articles 34 (freedom of religion), 347 (equal rights of all persons before 
the law) and 348 (prohibition of discrimination based on race, birth, religion, official position, 
status, culture, sex and wealth), he urges the Government to continue and complete the 
amendment of domestic laws to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights without 
discrimination for all people in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Living conditions, sustenance and humanitarian assistance 
</b></p>
<p>68. In August 2008, the Special Rapporteur travelled to the cyclone-affected areas, including 
Labutta in Ayeyawady Division, and Kyaukkalat, Khongyi, Pyinsalu and Kyatshar villages 
(A/63/341, para. 67). 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the achievements of the Tripartite Core Group, 
established in May 2008 by the Government of Myanmar, the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations and the United Nations, in its relief efforts in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis. Its 
post-Nargis periodic review of 19 December 2008 indicated that progress had been made, 
notwithstanding initial problems, and that most of the affected population had received some 
form of support and assistance. It has been reported, however, that living conditions for a large 
proportion of the population remain difficult. Some 15 per cent of children still suffer from 
malnutrition, and many households remain in inadequate shelters. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call for the respect of the fundamental rights of the 
victims and survivors of the cyclone, in particular children who have lost their parents, women 
and the elderly. Titles should be returned to owners of land, and identity certificates, such as 
birth certificates and citizenship cards, should be reissued if they have been lost. Communities 
should not be relocated without their consent. 
</p>
<p>71. With regard to the health sector, the Special Rapporteur notes that the right to health is at 
risk for many in the cyclone-affected areas. Vulnerable groups, including widows and orphans, 
need special attention and protection as laid down by the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and the Convention against All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It has been estimated 
that 1 million people in the Irrawaddy Delta are in need of food aid. 
</p>
<p>72. It is commonly acknowledged that Myanmar receives one of the lowest levels of 
international aid. The social development indicators of the country call for concerted action and 
support. Urgent measures are required to ensure the most basic human rights of the most 
vulnerable people, especially of ethnic communities residing in remote border areas. According 
to the Human Development Report 2007, Myanmar is one of the least developed countries, 
ranking 132nd of 177 States on the human development index. Under-5 mortality ranks 
number 36, meaning that the probability of a child dying before the age of 5 years is roughly 1 
in 10. Maternal mortality is among the highest in South-east Asia. Only 43 per cent of children 
enrolled at school complete five years of primary education. Inside the country, the poorest of 
the poor live in border areas populated by ethnic minorities; for example, according to the 
Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey for 2007 of the United Nations Development 
Programme, while the figure for people below the official food poverty line is 10 per cent 
countrywide, it is 40 per cent in Chin, 21 per cent in northern Shan State and 20 per cent in 
eastern Shan State. 
</p>
<p>73. Serious investment in the public service sector is urgently needed in order to make 
affordable and accessible heath care, education and social security coverage available. 
</p>
<p>74. In Chin State, the evolving food crisis remains of great concern. According to information 
received, up to 100,000 people in more than 200 villages are in need of food aid, most urgently 
in the southern townships of Matupi and Paletwa. 
</p>
<p>75. Scarcity of food is also reported in Northern Rakhine State, Kayin State, North and 
East Shan State and the cyclone-affected areas. According to reliable sources, nearly 5 million 
people are in need of food aid. 
</p>
<p>76. In Rakhine State, it is said that only 13 per cent of households are able to meet their food 
needs for the entire year, and 26 per cent of the population suffers from malnutrition. In a study 
of 760 children in December 2007, 26 per cent suffered from acute malnutrition and 1.8 per cent 
from severe malnutrition. Food prices increased by over 30 per cent over the past year. Between 
70 and 90 per cent of household income is allocated to food purchase. The price of rice, the main 
food for the people of Myanmar, increased by 75 per cent over the past year. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports of restrictions by the authorities on 
farmers to plant and harvest in different areas. The food crisis has been exacerbated by arbitrary </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>land confiscation for the purpose of growing cash crops, such as tea and biofuels. Moreover, 
peasants have been forced to purchase tea and jathroba seeds under the threat of having their 
land confiscated. In addition, food aid has been redirected by members of the military. 
</p>
<p>78. In Rakhine State, only 30 per cent of the population is said to receive public health care; a 
third has no access to clean water. The main causes of mortality are malaria, diarrhoea, 
respiratory and skin infections, intestinal parasites and cholera. The maternal mortality rate is 
much higher than in the rest of Myanmar (380 women per 100,000 births). In the state, there are 
three doctors per 430,000 people in Maungdaw, two for every 280,000 in Buthidaunga, and an 
average of one nurse for 60,000 people. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recently announced new grants to grass-roots 
non-governmental organizations by the Three Diseases Fund, established by a consortium of 
international donors to address tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS in close cooperation with all 
key actors in the country. The Special Rapporteur welcomes in particular the Fund&#8217;s approach in 
supporting activities targeting vulnerable and underserved population groups, especially those 
living in remote and inaccessible areas and most at risk of the three diseases. 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur continues to receive reliable information according to which 
members of the military in Kayin State and Chin State arbitrarily tax villagers, confiscate crops 
and livestock and force villagers to construct roads, work as porters and fulfil other duties. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Developing cooperation in the context of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recent meeting between the United Nations country 
team and the Government human rights group. He encourages both parties to meet on a regular 
basis to establish working cooperation to improve the human rights of the people of Myanmar. In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur encourages the States Members of the United Nations and 
the donor community to provide adequate resources and the necessary environment to the 
United Nations and financial institutions to assist the Government of Myanmar to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals. Children, women and all people of Myanmar should be given 
the same opportunity as those in any other Member State to achieve their economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the one-year extension of the supplementary 
understanding between the Government and ILO signed on 26 February 2009. In agreement with 
the Government of Myanmar, ILO operates a forced labour complaints mechanism, which 
includes complaints of underage recruitment into the military and the inappropriate use of prison 
labour. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Myanmar and ILO to strengthen 
its application, particularly with regard to ensuring that all citizens are aware of the law, the 
existence of the complaints mechanism and their associated rights. It is critical that people 
exercising their right to complain can do so without fear of recrimination or reprisal. He also 
recommends that the Government review its policy on forced labour used by the military and on 
prison labour. He requests ILO to provide all technical assistance needed in this regard. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur once again commends the achievements of the Tripartite Core 
Group and calls for the expansion of its mandate beyond the Delta, to cover all regions in 
Myanmar where the need for humanitarian aid is acute. The Special Rapporteur touched upon </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>this proposal in his address to the General Assembly in October 2008, mentioned it to the 
chairperson of the Tripartite Core Group and the Secretary-General of ASEAN, as well as to the 
diplomatic community in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the future ASEAN human rights mechanism will have 
an oversight mandate that ensures respect for human rights in Member States, including in 
Myanmar. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>In less than one year, the new Special Rapporteur has already travelled twice to 
Myanmar. A very small number of prisoners of conscience were released during that 
period, which the Special Rapporteur hopes is the beginning of the progressive release of 
more than 2,100 others. The Special Rapporteur engaged in constructive dialogue with the 
authorities in Myanmar with a view to achieving the minimum requirements to ensure that 
the elections in 2010 and its aftermath will comply with the international standards of a 
democratic society and the expectations of the international community. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The situation of human rights in Myanmar remains challenging. In his report to the 
General Assembly (A/63/341), the Special Rapporteur recommended four core human 
rights elements to be completed before the elections in 2010. Until they are completely 
implemented, the Special Rapporteur will continue to recommend their full 
implementation. In the meantime, he will follow closely the Government&#8217;s implementation 
process for each core element, and will constantly check with the Government for updates 
on the progress of the implementation process. He stands ready to provide any assistance 
and expertise in this process. He also calls on the donor community to provide any 
assistance required to build a society based on respect for fundamental human rights and 
democratic institutions for the people of Myanmar. 
</b></p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>In his report submitted to the General Assembly (A/63/341), the Special Rapporteur 
recommended that the Government implement the four core human rights elements before 
the elections in 2010. During his mission to Myanmar in February 2009, the Government 
expressed its readiness to implement the four core elements, but their effective 
implementation and completion has yet to be seen. Therefore, the four core human rights 
elements are again included as recommendations, taking into account the developments 
witnessed during the mission. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Myanmar: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Sign and ratify the remaining core international human rights instruments; 
 (b) Expand the mandate of the Tripartite Core Group to include all other regions in 
</b></p>
<p><b> Myanmar in need of humanitarian aid; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Complete the four core human rights elements indicated below before the 
 elections in 2010. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>(i) First core human rights element:  review of national legislation in accordance 
with the new Constitution and international obligations 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur has recommended that the Government of Myanmar start 
reviewing and amending domestic laws that limit fundamental rights and contravene the 
new Constitution and international human rights standards. Myanmar, as a State Member 
of the United Nations that signed the Charter of the United Nations soon after the country 
gained independence in 1948, must honour its international human rights obligations, and 
cannot invoke provisions of its domestic law as justification for its failure to comply with 
them (article 27 of the Vienna Convention). 
</b>90. <b>Any domestic law that limits the enjoyment of human rights should (a) be defined by 
law; (b) be imposed for one or more specific legitimate purposes; and (c) be necessary for 
one or more of these purposes in a democratic society, including proportionality. Any 
limitation that does not follow these requirements and jeopardizes the essence of the right 
with vague, broad and/or sweeping formulae would contravene the principle of legality and 
international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>In his report submitted to the General Assembly (A/63/341), the Special Rapporteur 
identified a number of legal provisions that do not fulfil the above-mentioned 
requirements, and recommended that the Government start a process of review and, at 
the same time, stop arrests and convictions under those legal provisions, namely, the 
State Protection Act (1975); the Emergency Provision Act (1950); the Printers and 
Publishers Act (1962); the Law Protecting the Peaceful and Systematic Transfer of State 
Responsibility and the Successful Performance of the Functions of the National Convention 
against Disturbance and Oppositions (No. 5) (1996); the Law Relating to the Forming of 
Organizations (1988); the Television and Video Law (1985); the Motion Pictures Law 
(1996); the Computer Science and Development Law (1996); the Unlawful Association 
Law; the Electronic Communication Law; and sections 143, 145, 152, 505, 505 (b) 
and 295 (A) of the Penal Code. 
</b>92. <b>During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to Myanmar in February 2009, the 
Attorney General informed him that 380 domestic laws had been sent to the concerned 
ministries for review, to check compliance with international human rights standards and 
the provisions of the new Constitution. In the meantime, many people are still detained in 
Myanmar and many harsh sentences against prisoners of conscience have been issued 
under the above-mentioned domestic laws. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to give priority to the legal provisions listed above (see paragraph 91) when reviewing 
the 380 domestic laws to check compliance with the human rights provisions of the 
Constitution. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Second core human rights element:  progressive release of prisoners of conscience 
</b>93. <b>At present, there are more than 2,100 prisoners of conscience detained in different 
prisons around Myanmar. A prisoner of conscience is a person who (a) is charged with or 
has been convicted for the infringement of national legislation, which impedes enjoyment of 
freedom of expression, opinion, peaceful assembly, association or any other human right; 
and (b) does not have access to a court, or is being tried by courts that lack independence </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>and impartiality, and/or due process of law is denied. These two circumstances are against 
the basic human rights recognized in the new Constitution and the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. Therefore, prisoners of conscience are basically individuals whose human 
rights are systematically denied. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Given the fact that fundamental rights such as liberty and personal integrity are 
being affected in detention, the release of prisoners of conscience, even progressive, should 
start as soon as possible. Release must be without any conditions that may result in new 
ways of diminishing the enjoyment of human rights, such as written statements renouncing 
the right to political participation or campaign. On the other hand, parallel to release, 
immediate measures should be taken to avoid any cruel treatment, improve conditions of 
detention and ensure urgent medical treatment. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In his report (A/63/341), the Special Rapporteur recommended that the prisoners be 
released in the following order of priority: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Elderly prisoners; 
 (b) Prisoners with health problems; 
 (c) Prominent members of political organizations and ethnic leaders; 
 (d) Long-standing prisoners; 
 (e) Members of religious orders; 
 (f) Women who have children; 
 (g) Prisoners transferred to forced labour camps; 
 (h) Unconvicted prisoners; 
 (i) Prisoners without a criminal record; 
 (j) Prisoners held in jails remote from their homes. 
</b>96. <b>In September 2008, the Government released 9,000 prisoners, although only 7 were 
prisoners of conscience, of whom one was rearrested a day later. In February 2009, the 
Government released 6,313 prisoners, but only 29 were prisoners of conscience. These 
releases, although encouraging, lack any proportionality with the total number of prisoners 
of conscience. Therefore, these measures cannot be seen as progressive. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Third core human rights element:  armed forces 
</b>97. <b>In his report (A/63/341), the Special Rapporteur recommended that a number of 
measures be adopted by the military and the police in order to improve the human rights 
situation in the country. These recommendations relate to very serious issues that should 
be stressed again. In this regard, the military should: </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Repeal discriminatory legislation and avoid discriminatory practices, 
particularly in Northern Rakhine State, where a large part of the Muslim community has 
been deprived of citizenship, movement and other fundamental rights for many years; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Refrain from the recruitment of child soldiers, and continue its policy to avoid 
such a practice; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Forbid the use of anti-personnel landmines. In this respect, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends again that the Government ratify the Convention on the 
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and 
on Their Destruction. The Government has reportedly justified its failure to ratify the 
Convention by stating that rebels still use anti-personnel landmines. However, violations of 
international humanitarian law by one party to a conflict is no justification for 
non-compliance by other parties; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Respect international human rights and humanitarian law in areas affected by 
armed conflict, particularly in Kayin State. It is prohibited to direct attacks against 
civilians not directly participating in the hostilities or to launch indiscriminate attacks 
against military objectives and civilians or civilian objects. Every precaution must be taken 
to spare civilians and their property of the effects of the hostilities. Medical and 
humanitarian staff, hospitals and clinics must be respected. This includes ensuring efficient 
working of health providers in the conflict areas; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Refrain from the use of forced labour of civilians (portering), particularly in 
Kayin State. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
engage with ILO representatives to ensure compliance of prison labour policy with the 
obligations of the Convention concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour (Convention 
No. 29); 
 (f) Refrain from detaining individuals for alleged infringement of national laws 
that are under review according to the first core human rights element, and refrain from 
ill-treatment of detainees; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Establish a permanent and meaningful training programme on human rights 
for members of the armed forces, police and prison forces, with international cooperation. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends that technical assistance be requested 
from OHCHR. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Fourth core human rights element:  the judiciary 
</b>98. <b>In his report submitted to the General Assembly (A/63/341), the Special Rapporteur 
stressed the lack of independency and impartiality of the judiciary in Myanmar, and 
recommended that a series of measures be taken. Subsequently, the judiciary delivered 
hundreds of harsh sentences against prisoners of conscience, applying national legislation 
that might be contradictory to human rights standards, with disregard for judicial 
guarantees. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>Independency and impartiality of the judiciary remains an outstanding issue in 
Myanmar. Members of the Supreme Court are appointed by the Head of State, due process 
of law is not fully respected, and the right to appeal, if granted, is handled by judges with 
similar constraints and lack of independence. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates his recommendations that the judiciary: 
 (a) Exercise full independence and impartiality, particularly in cases of prisoners of 
conscience; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Guarantee due process of law, including public hearings, in trials against 
prisoners of conscience; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Refrain from charging and convicting individuals for alleged infringement of 
national laws that are under review, in compliance with the first core human rights 
element. The Special Rapporteur urges the judiciary to refrain from conducting trials 
against prisoners of conscience, if independency is not assured, due process of law is not 
guaranteed and national law is not properly reviewed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Establish effective judicial mechanisms to investigate human rights abuses in 
order to fight impunity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Seek international technical assistance with a view to establishing an 
independent and impartial judiciary that is consistent with international standards and 
principles. In this respect, the Chief Justice accepted the recommendation to engage with 
the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, a decision that was 
welcomed.
