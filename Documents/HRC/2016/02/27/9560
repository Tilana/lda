<p><b>II.  COMMUNICATIONS TO AND FROM GOVERNMENTS 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Bangladesh 
Letter of allegation 
</b>8. On 21 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
gang-rape of 15-year old girl in Khidirpur Union-Basaudia-Lohajang within the Munshiganj 
District.  
 
9. According to the information received, on 1 November 2005, the victim, K.R.S. was 
gang-raped when she was walking home from school in Khidirpur Union-Basaudia-Lohajang 
within the Munshiganj District. After reporting the incident and indicating the names of the 
perpetrators to the police, she was arrested and imprisoned until 11 November 2005 without 
being provided with the reasons of her detention. It is also alleged that after the rape, several 
members of the girl&#8217;s community questioned one of the alleged perpetrators, who reportedly 
named all the other perpetrators, and recorded what was said. The recorded tape was then given 
to the police. It is reported that the police did not take the information on the tape into 
consideration in their investigations. One person was being prosecuted.  
 
10. The Special Rapporteurs have expressed concerns at the arrest and detention of K.R.S. In 
addition, while welcoming the immediate action taken by the authorities to investigate the 
incident and bring charges against the above-mentioned alleged perpetrator, the Special 
Rapporteurs have called on the authorities to ensure that investigations and proceedings against 
the alleged perpetrators are thorough. 
<b> 
Urgent Appeal 
 
</b>11. On 20 January 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief concerning T.G., a 14 year old Hindu girl 
from the town of Thakurgaon. 
 
12. According to allegation received, on 10 November 2005 at aound 4 p.m., T.G. was 
abducted at gunpoint on her way home from Thakurgaon Government Girls School by two 
abductors allegedly neighbours of the victim. There were concerns that the purpose of the 
abduction was in order to force her to convert to Islam.  
 
13. On 11 November 2005, the parents of of the victim lodged a formal complaint at 
Thakurgaon Sadar Police Station and appealed to the Home Minister. However, the police 
reportedly did not act upon the complaint, arrest the abductors or attempt to recover the girl.  
 
14. Twenty three days after the abduction, T.G. called her parents from a mobile phone and 
informed them that she was under the custody of a police officer from Dinajpur named G. R. 
This information was transmitted to Thakurgaon Sadar Police Station but no action was 
reportedly taken to apprehend the alleged perpetrators.

<b>Urgent appeal 
 
</b>15. On 20 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living 
and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences sent an 
urgent appeal regarding information received that since mid 2005, there had been an ongoing 
conflict between the Bengali settlers and the Marma indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill 
Tracts, in the Southeastern part of Bangladesh.  
 
16. According to the information received, Bengali settlers have, with the support of the 
army, illegally and forcibly occupied titled indigenous peoples land. On 5 March Bengali 
settlers, with the support of the military, occupied land belonging to the Shishughar Buddhist 
Orphanage. On 3 April 2006 Bengali settlers, attacked the Marma indigenous peoples in the 
villages of Sa Prue Para, Joy Sen Para, Sapru Karbabipara and Nuapara. The attacks left more 
than 30 casualties. 
 
17. It is reported that when the Marma women opposed the incident, Bengali settlers ill-
treated four Marma women. The incident was witnessed by a person who was consequently 
beaten to silence. It was reported that some Bengali settlers also raped two women and gang-
raped a minor girl, T.M., aged 16, and A.K.M. aged 20, at Sa Prue Karbari. The four raped 
victims are hospitalized at the Khagrachari Sadar Hospital.  Furthermore, it is also alleged that 
thirteen of the indigenous wounded in the said attacks were hospitalized in the Khagrachari 
Sadar Hospital, and three seriously wounded in the Chittagong Medical College Hospital.  
<b> 
Government responses 
 
</b>18. By letter dated 20 June 2006, the Governement responded to the urgent appeal sent on 20 
January 2006 and indicated that the abduction of the 14 year old girl named Ms T. G., by faith 
Hindu, by Mr. S. and Mr. U. has been investigated. It is revealed that Ms. G. had voluntarily left 
her father&#8217;s place with Mr. H. I. U., her fianc&#233;, on 10 November 2005. On that same day, by an 
affidavit before the learned Notary Public, it is said that Ms. G. converted to Islam and declared 
her marriage with Mr. U. As per affidavit, her adopted name is now Ms. F. Y. T., and her age 
was claimed to be 21 years. Even if the medical board certified that her age was about 18 years, 
she is yet not a minor. The Governement also indicated that Ms. T.&#8217;s father had lodged a case 
accusing Mr. U. and others of abducting her daughter. The case is pending before the learned 
Court who will decide whether there was any abduction. For the time being, Ms. T. is currently 
staying at her husband&#8217;s residence. 
<b> 
</b>19. By letter dated 23 March 2006, the Government acknowledged the receipt of the letter of 
allegation sent by the Special Rapporteur on 21 March 2006, and indicated that the 
communication had been forwarded to the concerned authorities in Bangladesh for necessary 
inquiry and action.  
 
20. By letter dated 21 April 2006, the Government of Bangladesh acknowledged the receipt 
of the letter of allegation sent by the Special Rapporteur on 20 April 2006 and indicated that the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 6 
 
communication had been forwarded to the concerned authorities in Bangladesh for necessary 
inquiry and action.  
<b> 
Observations 
 
</b>21. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Bangladesh for its 
continuing disposition to respond to allegations transmitted by him and looks forward in 
receiving a substantive reply to his communications sent on 21 March and 20 April 2006.  
 
</p>
<p><b>Benin 
Appel urgent 
 
</b>22. Le 16 mars 2006, le rapporteur special, conjointement avec la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la 
traite des personnes, en particulier les femmes et les enfants a envoy&#233; un appel urgent concernant 
la situation d&#8217;enfants b&#233;ninois qui continueraient d&#8217;&#234;tre trafiqu&#233;s aux fins d&#8217;exploitation dans les 
carri&#232;res de gravier et dans les plantations du Nig&#233;ria malgr&#233; la signature d&#8217;un accord en juin 
2005 entre le B&#233;nin et le Nig&#233;ria. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, des centaines d&#8217;enfants b&#233;ninois 
&#226;g&#233;s de 6 ans pour les plus jeunes travailleraient toujours &#224; l&#8217;heure actuelle dans les carri&#232;res de 
pierres d&#8217;Abeokuta et dans ses environs ainsi que dans de nombreuses plantations agricoles du 
Sud-ouest nig&#233;rian. 
 
23. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations soumises aux Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux, les carri&#232;res dans lesquelles 
travaillent ces enfants seraient essentiellement des carri&#232;res de gravier, c'est-&#224;-dire de petits 
gisements prenant les apparences de &#171; trous &#187; dans lesquels des groupes de deux &#224; trois enfants, 
appel&#233;s &#171;gangs&#187;, travaillent durant plusieurs semaines avant de se d&#233;placer vers un autre 
gisement. Les propri&#233;taires des carri&#232;res, g&#233;n&#233;ralement des notables locaux, s&#8217;adresseraient &#224; des 
interm&#233;diaires, souvent des femmes Yoruba, pour g&#233;rer l&#8217;exploitation des carri&#232;res. Ces 
interm&#233;diaires feraient appel &#224; des trafiquants b&#233;ninois pour leur fournir la main d&#8217;&#339;uvre 
enfantine. Il est aussi mentionn&#233; que les enfants travaillent entre cinq et sept jours par semaine 
sur les carri&#232;res. La dur&#233;e de leur &#171; contrat &#187; est normalement de six ans (3 cycles de deux ans), 
ann&#233;es durant lesquelles ils ne per&#231;oivent pas &#224; proprement parler de salaire. En revanche, ils 
peuvent gagner en fin de cycle une bicyclette et/ou une radio. Une modique somme d&#8217;argent est 
remise &#224; leurs parents &#224; des dates pr&#233;cises et p&#233;riodiques au cours de ces six ann&#233;es.  
 
24. Cette activit&#233; physique est intense et dangereuse, particuli&#232;rement &#233;prouvante pour les 
genoux et les mains, avec de nombreux risques d&#8217;accident. Les journ&#233;es de travail sont  de 8 &#224; 10 
heures. Les enfants sont sous-nourris et ne peuvent compter que sur eux-m&#234;mes pour trouver de 
quoi se laver, se v&#234;tir et se soigner. Ils passent les nuits sous des abris de fortune. La violence 
entre enfants est permanente, et il arrive aussi que les adultes les maltraitent et leur infligent 
coups, brimades et injures. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, ce serait une guerre entre les 
trafiquants en septembre 2003 qui aurait port&#233; au grand jour la situation d&#8217;exploitation de ces 
enfants. La reconnaissance de ce trafic aurait &#233;t&#233; suivie d&#8217;une action d&#8217;urgence visant au retrait, 
au rapatriement, &#224; la protection et &#224; la r&#233;int&#233;gration des enfants sous le contr&#244;le des pouvoirs 
publics b&#233;ninois et nig&#233;rians, avec l&#8217;assistance d&#8217;organisations internationales et non 
gouvernementales sp&#233;cialis&#233;es dans la protection de l&#8217;enfance.

25. Officiellement 261 enfants, dont la grande majorit&#233; provenaient de la commune de 
Zakpota dans le D&#233;partement du Zou auraient pu &#234;tre retir&#233;s des carri&#232;res et rapatri&#233;s. Ils avaient 
pour la plupart entre 10 et 15 ans. Plus de 50 % d&#8217;entre eux venaient de passer entre 1 et 2 ans 
dans les carri&#232;res, 35 % entre 3 et 4 ans et le reste entre 4 et 7 ans, ce qui atteste de l&#8217;ampleur et 
de l&#8217;anciennet&#233; du trafic. En plus de ces 261 enfants rapatri&#233;s, un millier d&#8217;autres enfants (au 
moins) seraient revenus dans le Zou sans aucune aide ni protection institutionnelle (enfants dits 
de &#171;retour non formel&#187;). Des dizaines voire des centaines d&#8217;autres enfants b&#233;ninois exploit&#233;s &#224; 
Abeokuta seraient rest&#233;s cach&#233;s plusieurs semaines ou plusieurs mois dans la brousse avant 
d&#8217;&#234;tre achemin&#233;s vers d&#8217;autres sites d&#8217;exploitation dans le Sud-ouest du Nigeria (Etats d&#8217;Ogun, 
d&#8217;Osun et d&#8217;Oyo) o&#249; ils auraient probablement rejoint d&#8217;autres enfants b&#233;ninois d&#233;j&#224; exploit&#233;s 
dans des carri&#232;res ou des plantations agricoles. 
 
26. Seuls sept trafiquants auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s, et ceux-ci auraient &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;s &#224; la fin de l&#8217;ann&#233;e 
2004, apr&#232;s une p&#233;riode de d&#233;tention provisoire et des condamnations allant de quelques mois &#224; 
un an de prison. Rien n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;vu pour faciliter leur r&#233;insertion &#233;conomique ni pour les 
encourager &#224; ne pas reprendre leurs activit&#233;s illicites. En cons&#233;quence, aujourd&#8217;hui encore les 
fili&#232;res et les routes du trafic entre le B&#233;nin et Abeokuta demeurent en place.  
 
<b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
 
</b>27. Par lettre datant du 4 juillet 2006, le Gouvernement du B&#233;nin r&#233;pond qu&#8217;il a &#233;t&#233; le 
premier pays &#224; reconna&#238;tre l&#8217;existence du ph&#233;nom&#232;ne de la traite d&#8217;enfants &#224; Libreville, au 
Gabon et que de maintes actions ont depuis &#233;t&#233; entreprises par le Gouvernement dans le but de 
contrer le fl&#233;au. Parmi celles-ci, figurent les accords multilat&#233;raux et bilat&#233;raux de coop&#233;ration, 
notamment celui pass&#233; avec le Nig&#233;ria.  
 
28. Le Gouvernement du B&#233;nin rappelle &#233;galement qu&#8217;il est indispensable que le processus 
de rapatriement, les actions de r&#233;insertion professionnelle soient clairement d&#233;finies, et ce, dans 
l&#8217;int&#233;r&#234;t sup&#233;rieur des enfants. Les strat&#233;gies &#224; mettre en place doivent &#234;tre de nature 
multidimensionnelle et devront impliquer des ressources humaines et financi&#232;res importantes. 
 
29. Selon les informations recueillies par le Gouvernement, aucune plainte explicite n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; 
depos&#233;e de fa&#231;on sp&#233;cifique par les victimes mais les trafiquants ont toutefois &#233;t&#233; identifi&#233;s, 
arr&#234;t&#233;s et d&#233;f&#233;r&#233;s. Le Gouvernement informe &#233;galement le Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial que d&#232;s le 1er mars 
2006, une agence contre la traite au Nig&#233;ria (le NAPTIP) a proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; Lagos &#224; la remise de vingt 
enfants victime de traite d&#8217;enfants et dont les &#226;ges variaient entre 8 et 20 ans. Il mentionne 
toutefois qu&#8217;&#233;tant donn&#233; qu&#8217;un enfant est d&#233;fini comme &#171; tout &#234;tre &#226;g&#233; de 0 &#224; 18 ans &#187;, il se cr&#233;e 
en l&#8217;esp&#232;ce, une confusion entre le ph&#233;nom&#232;ne de traite et de migration. Qui plus est, et &#224; la 
demande de la partie b&#233;ninoise du comit&#233; conjoint (BENIN-NIGERIA), le NAPTIP effectue 
actuellement une &#233;tude dans la r&#233;gion d&#8217;Abeokuta pour voir d&#8217;une part si les enfants r&#233;ins&#233;r&#233;s en 
2003 ne sont pas retourn&#233;s sur d&#8217;autres sites et d&#8217;autre part, si de nouveaux sites de carri&#232;res de 
gravier n&#8217;ont pas &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;es. Les r&#233;sultats seront prochainement partag&#233;s par le comit&#233; conjoint. 
Enfin, depuis 2003, selon les statistiques de la Brigade de Protection des Mineurs, soixante dix 
huit trafiquants ont &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233;s au Procureur de la R&#233;publique et d&#233;f&#233;r&#233;s en prison.

contre la traite des enfants entre le B&#233;nin et le Nig&#233;ria dont un accord bilat&#233;ral, l&#8217;adoption d&#8217;un </p>

<p><b>Letter of allegation 
 
</b>32. On 25 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences sent a letter of allegation concerning the trafficking 
of newborn infants from Bulgaria to Greece. 
 
33. According to the information received, it is alleged that pregnant women, most of them 
from the Roma community in the region of Burgas in eastern Bulgaria, and many of them 
unemployed and living in harsh conditions, are induced by members of organized crime to come 
to work to Greece, being promised employment and good salaries. It is reported that instead, these 
pregnant women end up in small cities throughout Greece, where they are held together in 
apartments for the remainder of their pregnancy, before delivering at local hospitals, where, with 
the complicity of doctors, midwives and other hospital staff, their newborn babies are taken away 
from them and sold by organised crime members with the assistance of lawyers for up to 
30 000 euros. It is alleged that after having given birth in Greece, the women are sent back to 
their hometowns in Bulgaria and receive 1.000 euros per child.  
 
34. Reports also alleged that little progress has been made by Greek and Bulgarian 
authorities in investigating the trafficking and sale of children taking place between the two 
countries.  
<b> 
Observations 
 
</b>35. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to his communication of 25 July 2006 was 
received. The issue relating to the trafficking of children, particularly when involving minority 
groups such as the Roma communities, had already been raised by the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child with regard to its January 1997 review of the initial report of Bulgaria under the 
International Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Committee was particularly concerned 
at) the insufficient policies, measures and programmes for the protection of the rights of the most 
vulnerable children, especially children living in poverty, children born out of wedlock, </p>

Carta de alegaciones 
 
</b>36. El 24 de marzo de 2006, el Relator especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
violencia contra la mujer, con inclusi&#243;n de sus causas y consecuencias y el Relator Especial 
sobre ejecuciones, extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias, envio una carta de alegaciones en 
relaci&#243;n al asesinato de la ni&#241;a S.P.G.G. as&#237; como de la violaci&#243;n sexual de otra ni&#241;a de 14 a&#241;os 
cometidas en la zona rural del municipio de Argelia, oriente del Departamento de Antioquia, y 
presuntamente perpetradas por miembros del ejercito regular.  
 
37. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 15 de febrero de 2006 un grupo de soldados 
del batall&#243;n &#8220;Juan del Corral&#8221;, adscrito a la Cuarta Brigada del ej&#233;rcito regular colombiano con 
sede en Medell&#237;n, se habr&#237;an presentado en la vereda &#8220;El Plan&#8221; del antemencionado municipio e 
iniciado la persecuci&#243;n contra un presunto miembro de la guerrilla. Posteriormente los soldados 
habr&#237;an entrado en la vivienda de la familia G.G., ubicada en la misma vereda donde se 
encontraban solas dos menores de edad: una de 14 a&#241;os, cuyo nombre se desconoce hasta el 
momento, y S.P., de 17 a&#241;os. Se alega que los soldados habr&#237;an procedido a disparar contra esta 
&#250;ltima caus&#225;ndole la muerte. Seg&#250;n las denuncias, los soldados habr&#237;an tratado de convencer a la 
familia que el disparo que acab&#243; con la vida de S.P. lo hab&#237;a hecho el antemencionado supuesto 
miembro de la guerrilla y habr&#237;an exhortado a los familiares de la victima a informar a las 
autoridades &#8220;que a la joven la hab&#237;a matado el guerrillero&#8221;.  
 
38. Se informa tambi&#233;n que los militares habr&#237;an presionado a diferentes integrantes de la 
familia, con el fin de evitar que estos denunciasen la verdad sobre la forma en que sucedieron los 
hechos. Se alega tambi&#233;n que el cad&#225;ver de S.P. habr&#237;a sido dejado en el potrero de la finca hasta 
el d&#237;a siguiente cuando, otros miembros del ej&#233;rcito lo habr&#237;an trasladado hasta el municipio de 
Sons&#243;n con el fin de efectuar las correspondientes diligencias judiciales, pese a que la 
jurisdicci&#243;n de la vereda &#171; El Plan &#187; corresponde al municipio de Argelia, alegando que la 
fiscal&#237;a los habr&#237;a autorizado a efectuar dicho traslado. Los Relatores Especiales expresaron su 
preocupaci&#243;n por los miembros de la familia de S.P. quienes, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, se 
habian encontrado muy atemorizados y temian sufrir agresiones contra su vida e integridad 
personal por haber denunciado los citados hechos. 
 
39. El 12 de febrero de 2006 en la vereda de nombre &#8220;Gitana&#8221;, un soldado habr&#237;a llegado a la 
vivienda de una familia campesina, y habr&#237;a exigido que le entregaran a su hija, una ni&#241;a de 14 
a&#241;os ante lo cual los padres se negaron. El soldado habr&#237;a procedido a llevarse a la menor 
procediendo a violarla. La ni&#241;a regres&#243; posteriormente al domicilio de sus padres. Se alega que 
los padres de la menor tambi&#233;n habr&#237;an sido agredidos f&#237;sicamente cuando intentaron evitar que 
el soldado agrediera a la ni&#241;a.

<b>Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b> 
40. El Gobierno contesta por cartas de fechas del 28 de abril de 2006, 29 y 31de mayo de 
2006. Por carta del 28 de abril de 2006, el Gobierno informa que ante las discrepancias

la presunta violaci&#243;n (nombre completo, fecha y lugar de los hechos y ubicaci&#243;n geografica de 
los mismos), se  permite solicitar mayor claridad y precision en los datos suministrados, con el 
fin de esclarecer los hechos y poder brindar un respuesta veridica y oportuna, ya que resulta 
imposible para el Gobierno solicitar informaci&#243;n a las autoridades competentes, cuando no hay

de 14 a&#241;os de edad en zona rural del municipio de Argelia, por parte de miembros del ejercito 
pertenecientes al batallon &#8220;Juan del Corral&#8221; adscrito a la IV Brigada con sede en Medell&#237;n, la 
Direccion General de Fiscalias de Antioquia, mediante carta del 6 de abril de 2006, informo que 
por el presunto abuso sexual de que fuera victima la menor J.A.T. se conocio que la personera de 
Argelia estaba adelantado la investigaci&#243;n de los hechos. 
 
43. Por fecha de 31 de mayo de 2006, el Gobierno informa sobre el asesinato de la ni&#241;a 
S.P.G.G. que la Fiscalia General de la Nacion, Seccional de Sonson (Antioquia), ha iniciado la 
averigacion por el Juzgado 24 de Instrucci&#243;n Penal Militar, con sede en el municipio de Bello

<b>Comentarios 
 
</b>44. El Relator Especial quisiera agradecer al Gobierno de Colombia por su respuesta

<b>Urgent Appeal 
 
</b>45. On 24 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Special Rapporteur 
on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, sent an urgent appeal concerning forced repatriation of a female 
national of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea<b> </b>(DPRK) by the People&#8217;s Republic of 
China (PRC) on 28 February 2006.  
 
46. According to the information received, six years before, the woman referred and her one-
year-old daughter, were sold for 3,000 RMB to a Chinese man, whom she was forced to marry. 
The woman became pregnant soon thereafter and gave birth to a second daughter named K. Y.S. 
It is reported that the mother was arrested by a Chinese police raid squad at 11.30 p.m. on 25 
February 2006 and handed over to the DPRK security police three days later. Concern was 
expressed that the woman may face harsh punishment since she had already been deported on 
two previous occasions, but managed each time to return to her children in the PRC. 
</p>
<p> 
47. It was further reported that this situation was not a singular incident. In cities near the 
border, including Yanji and Longjin, an intensified information exchange on defectors between 
DPRK and Chinese authorities had reportedly led to an increase in deportations of DPRK 
nationals. In this context, the Special Rapporteurs referred to their previous communication of 20 
December 2005, in which they had expressed their concern about the cruel and inhuman 
punishment facing nationals of this country upon their forced return to the DPRK. 
 
<b>Government response 
 
</b>48. By letter dated 19 April 2006, the Government returned the letter sent on 24 March 2006 
stating that it represented a product of conspiracy undertaken in pursuit of the ill-minded aim of 
spreading fabricated information while following the attempts of those hostile forces to defame, 
disintegrate and overthrow the state and social system of the DPRK on the pretext of human 
rights. Therefore, the Government rejected the joint letter. Furthermore, the Government neither 
recognizes the appointment of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, nor the mandates of the three other rapporteurs since it 
considers that they have been suspended with the conclusion of the work of the Commission on 
Human Rights.  </p>

<b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation

charg&#233;e de la question de la violence contre les femmes, y compris ses causes et ses 
cons&#233;quences a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations concernant le viol de deux mineures, L.S.K. &#226;g&#233;e 
de 13 ans, et de C.L.N. &#226;g&#233;e de 17 ans. 
 
50. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, le 15 janvier 2006 aux environs de 19 heures, de retour 
de chez le tailleur dans la commune de Makala, la victime L.S.K., domicili&#233;e Avenue Jardin, 
N&#176;1, Quartier Tchad, Commune de Lemba &#224; Kinshasa, aurait &#233;t&#233; abord&#233;e par un jeune homme 
d&#8217;une vingtaine d&#8217;ann&#233;es qui avait d&#233;j&#224; tent&#233; de l&#8217;approcher sur le chemin de l&#8217;&#233;cole. Au niveau 
du carrefour s&#233;parant la route de Kimwenza et By-pass (un endroit inhabit&#233;), ils auraient &#233;t&#233; 
rejoints par six amis du jeune homme. Apr&#232;s avoir b&#226;illonn&#233; la jeune fille avec un foulard pour 
l&#8217;emp&#234;cher de crier, les sept hommes auraient viol&#233; la jeune fille, et ce, de 19 heures &#224; 5 heures 
du matin. Ce n&#8217;est que le lendemain qu&#8217;elle aurait &#233;t&#233; retrouv&#233;e par des passants, baignant dans 
son sang. Apr&#232;s avoir retrouv&#233; leur fille, les parents de la victime auraient alert&#233; les officiers de 
police judiciaire du rond point de Ngaba du district de Mont Amba. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations 
re&#231;ues, les officiers de police conna&#238;traient l&#8217;identit&#233; des auteurs du viol mais auraient indiqu&#233; 
aux parents de la jeune fille ne pas disposer des moyens n&#233;cessaires pour mener des actions 
contre les auteurs de ces viols. Actuellement soign&#233;e dans un centre de sant&#233;, la victime 
souffrirait de dommages physiques et psychologiques graves, ne pourrait plus marcher 
correctement et risquerait, selon les m&#233;decins de ne plus pouvoir avoir d&#8217;enfants. 
 
51. Les Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; inform&#233;s du fait que le 18 f&#233;vrier 2006, une 
autre victime, C.L.N., domicili&#233;e au 7 Avenue Kimuenza, Quartier Ngunza Elengesa, Commune 
de Ngiri Ngiri, aurait &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; victime d&#8217;un viol collectif. Aux environs de 20 heures dans la 
Commune de Kalamu, elle aurait &#233;t&#233; abord&#233;e par cinq hommes, alors qu&#8217;elle se rendait &#224; une 
veill&#233;e de pri&#232;re avec une amie dont le nom n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; communiqu&#233; aux Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux. 
Alors qu&#8217;elle tentait de se d&#233;faire de l&#8217;emprise des hommes, un pr&#233;nomm&#233; &#171; Dunga &#187;, qui 
semblerait &#234;tre le chef du groupe aurait ordonn&#233; &#224; l&#8217;un de ses complices de la br&#251;ler avec une 
cigarette pendant que trois hommes du groupe emmenaient son amie. Malgr&#233; leurs appels au 
secours, personne ne serait venu en aide aux jeunes filles. Alors que deux des membres du groupe 
tra&#238;naient &#224; terre leur victime, deux policiers en civil habitant le quartier auraient interpell&#233; les 
deux hommes mais les auraient finalement laiss&#233;s poursuivre leur m&#233;fait. Conduite de force dans 
une chambrette derri&#232;re un d&#233;bit de boisson, la jeune fille aurait &#233;t&#233; immobilis&#233;e et viol&#233;e par les 
deux hommes, et au moyen d&#8217;une bouteille de soda. Par la suite, pendant que les deux hommes se 
disputaient, la jeune fille aurait r&#233;ussi &#224; s&#8217;enfuir et &#224; obtenir le secours d&#8217;un passant pour 
rejoindre son domicile. Un des pr&#233;sum&#233;s auteurs de ce viol aurait &#233;t&#233; appr&#233;hend&#233; deux jours 
apr&#232;s les faits par la police suite &#224; la plainte d&#233;pos&#233;e par la victime &#224; l&#8217;Etat major du District de la 
Funa. Pendant son interrogatoire, l&#8217;officier de police judiciaire instructeur se serait rendu compte 
qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agissait d&#8217;une bande organis&#233;e commettant r&#233;guli&#232;rement de telles actions. Cette personne 
aurait ensuite &#233;t&#233; transf&#233;r&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;Inspection Provinciale puis au Centre p&#233;nitentiaire et de 
r&#233;&#233;ducation de Kinshasa et l&#8217;instruction poursuivie afin de d&#233;manteler le r&#233;seau. La jeune fille, 
manifestant des tendances suicidaires, serait soign&#233;e dans un centre de sant&#233; et suivie par un </p>

<p><b>Dominican Republic 
 
Seguimiento de comunicaciones trasmitidas previamente 
 
</b>54. Por carta con fecha del 9 de febrero de 2006, el Gobierno de la Republica Dominicana 
transmitio la siguiente informacion en respuesta a la comunicacion del 13 de diciembre de 2005 
relativa a alegaciones seg&#250;n cuales 25 000 menores estarian explotados a trav&#233;s de la 
prostitucion, pornografia, pedofilia y turismo sexual asi como unos 45 000 menores estarian 
explotados en el servicio domestico, incluyendo menores dominicanos asi que menores de Haiti.  
 
55. El Gobierno menciona que la legislaci&#243;n laboral dominicana prohibe el trabajo a 
personas menores de 14 a&#241;os de edad, concediendo dos excepciones: cuando se trata de una 
labor que sea beneficiosa para el arte, la cultura, la ciencia o la ense&#241;anza y cuando el menor de 
edad utilizado en el campo en trabajos ligeros de recoleccion. En ambos casos el Secretario de 
Estado de Trabajo es el que tiene la competencia para autorizar a dichos menores siguiendo lo 
establecido en la legislaci&#243;n. En cuanto a la explotacion sexual de menores, el Gobierno informa 
que en el Codigo para el Sistema de Proteccion y los Derechos Fundamentales de Ni&#241;os, Ni&#241;as y 
Adolescentes, que constituye una normativa que crea garantias y derechos hacia los menores, 
considerandolos sujetos de pleno de derecho y mediante otra ley relacionada, se resalta la 
penalizacion establecida contra el proxenetismo respecto de un menor de cualquier sexo.  
 
56. Por medio del Consejo Nacional para la Ni&#241;ez y la Adolescencia (CONANI), el 
Gobierno informe que se ha realizado un informe para responder a las alegaciones enviadas 
sobre explotacion sexual, trafico y trata de la ni&#241;ez y adolescencia, asi como detalles del proceso 
seguido para elaborar esa dicha respuesta. Sobre el proceso seguido para la formulacion de la 
respuesta del pais, el Gobierno informa que el 23 de enero de 2006 la Presidenta Ejecutiva del 
CONANI convoco a las instituciones Estatales  involucradas en la lucha y prevencion de esta 
problem&#225;tica. El 26 de enero del 2006 se realizo una reunion entre la Secretaria de Estado de </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 14 
 
relaciones Exteriores y el CONANI con fin de discutir de la comunicaci&#243;n enviada por el 
Relator Especial. El CONANI desarrollo las siguientes acciones: coordinaci&#243;n interinstitucional 
con las instituciones Estatales que directa, o indirectamente, por caracteristicas de la situaci&#243;n 
denunciada en la referida comunicaci&#243;n, estan involucradas en la lucha y prevencion de esta 
problem&#225;tica; analisis de documentaci&#243;n e infomacion sobre este tema y reuniones de trabajo.  
</p><p> 
57. El Gobierno informa de las diferentes acciones desarrolladas para la prevencion del 
abuso y la violencia contra los ni&#241;os, ni&#241;as y adolescentes: cama&#241;as de sensibilizacion de los 
derechos de la ni&#241;ez y prevencion del abuso; jornadas de vigilancia y persecuci&#243;n de los delitos 
contra la dignidad de los ni&#241;os, ni&#241;as y adolescentes y implementacion de programas a favor de 
las victimas de maltratos y abuso infantil, entre otras.  
 
58. Por otra parte, la Procuradoria General de la Republica ha realizado diferentes operativos 
en prost&#237;bulos de zonas vulnerables, algunas por sus caracteristicas turisticas y otras por sus 
caracteristicas urbanas. Tambien la Procuradoria General de la Republica creo el Departamento 
contra el Trafico Ilicito de Migrantes y la Trata de Personas para realizar actividades destinadas 
a la investigaci&#243;n, campa&#241;as de difusi&#243;n e iniciativas economicas y sociales con miras de 
prevenir y combatir la trata de personas. Ese Departamento, a traves de la Unidad de Educaci&#243;n 
y Prevencion, ha continuado desarrolando acciones en distintas comuniades con el objetivo de 
sensibilizar a los agentes comunitarios sobre la problem&#225;tica. Ese Departamento tambien cuenta 
con una Unidad de Explotacion Sexual Comercial que se encarga de investigar, monitorear y 
rastrear todo tipo de recurso informatico que sea utilizado para la exposici&#243;n de un ni&#241;o, ni&#241;a o 
adolescente en el Internet.  
 
59. El Gobierno informa de las acciones llevadas a cabo, entre otras, por la Secretaria de 
Estado de Trabajo y el Comit&#233; Directivo Nacional de Lucha contra en Trabajo Infantil para 
prevenir el trabajo infantil. La Republica Dominicana, como miembro de la OIT, aprobo y 
ratifico el Convenio 138 sobre la edad minima para el empleo, conjuntamente con el Convenio 
182 sobre la eliminaci&#243;n de las peores formas del trabajo infantil. La formulacion de estas 
politicas ha creado un movimiento social de sensibilizacion y toma de conciencia que ha 
permitido hasta el momento que 25 200 ni&#241;os, ni&#241;as y adolescentes trabajadores o en riesgo de 
explotacion hayan sido beneficiados con los programas de accion, asi como 2 850 familias a 
traves de las medias de proteccion social, educaci&#243;n, salud, formaci&#243;n t&#233;cnico laboral y apoyo a 
la generacion alternativos de ingresos.  
 
60. El Gobierno menciona las acciones llevadas a cabo por la Secretaria de Relaciones 
Exteriores para prevenir la trata y trafico de ni&#241;o, ni&#241;as y adolescentes. En el a&#241;o 2000 se creo la 
Seccion de Asuntos de la Mujer, Ni&#241;o, Ni&#241;a, Adolescentes y Envejecientes, cuyo objectivo 
principal es la asesoria t&#233;cnica a las instituciones del Estado y de las ONG an los temas 
relacionados con las areas que les conciernen en los compromisos del Estado en la redaccion de 
informes, capacitacion y sensibilizacion a los funcionarios en funciones y nombrados en el 
exterior. Esa seccion tambien esta involucrado en capacitation de de personal diplomatico y 
consular en el exterior en los temas de trafico y trata, explotacion sexual comercial de ni&#241;os, 
ni&#241;as y adolescentes, manutenci&#243;n y secuestro.  
61. El Gobierno informa que la Comision contra la Explotacion Sexual y Comercial, 
intergrando mas de 20 instituciones gubernamentales, ONG y organismos internacionales 
reformulo en el 2002 el Plan de Accion para Enfrentar el el Abuso y la Explotacion Sexual </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1

Comercial. Dicho Plan contempla los suiguientes objectivos: fortalecimiento de la familia como 
n&#250;cleo fundamental para el desarrollo, fortaleciemiento de la responsabilidad social y ciudadana, 
la denuncia y conocimiento general sobre el problema del abuso y la explotacion sexual de 
menores, revision y mejoramiento de las leyes, politicas, programas y servicios basicos y de 
proteccion, y fortalecimiento de las leyes y del sistema de administraci&#243;n de justicia para la 
efectiva persecution y procesamiento judicial de los prepetradores de abusos y explotacion contra 
menores.  
 
62. El Gobirno a&#241;ada qu tambien se realizo y implemento a nivel internacional el 
entrenamiento de los consules dominicanos y de las oficinas de turismo en Europa, atraves de 
dos seminarios y a nivel nacional se desarrollaron acciones como una campa&#241;a de medios 
incluyendo un spot de televisi&#243;n, con el apoyo del programa IPEC de la OIT financiada por el 
Departamiento de Trabajo de los Estados Unidos. Finalmente, el Gobirno incluye en su respuesta 
todos procedimientos y resoluciones judiciales procediendo, entre otros,  de la Procuradoria 
General, de la Policia Nacional, de la Secretaria de Estado de las Fuerzas Armadas. Tambien se 
anexa amplia documentaci&#243;n sobre estudios y procesos institucionales muestrando los avances 
de la Republica Dominicana en materia de lucha contra la explotacion sexual comercial y el 
tr&#225;fico y trata de ni&#241;os, ni&#241;as y adolescentes.

respuesta detallada y la informacion proporcionada.

<p><b>Ecuador 
 
Carta de alegaciones 
 
</b>64. El 10 de agosto de 2006, el Relator Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre los 
derechos humanos de los migrantes, la Relatora Especial sobre la trata de personas, 
especialmente las mujeres y los ni&#241;os y la Relatora Especial sobre la violencia contra la mujer, 
con inclusi&#243;n de sus causas y consecuencias mando una carta de alegaciones en relaci&#243;n con la 
situaci&#243;n de los<b> </b>colombianos en riesgo de ser objeto de la Trata de personas en Ecuador. 
 
65. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, en el a&#241;o 2004, el n&#250;mero de ciudadanos colombianos 
refugiados, solicitantes de asilo en Ecuador, ascender&#237;a aproximadamente a 44.800 personas. En 
a&#241;os recientes, el gobierno ecuatoriano habr&#237;a implementado nuevas restricciones para los 
colombianos que desean ingresar al pa&#237;s, as&#237; como para aqu&#233;llos que desean permanecer en &#233;l. 
 
66. Los retos que enfrentar&#237;an los refugiados colombianos, los solicitantes de asilo y los 
migrantes, les podr&#237;an poner en riesgo de ser objeto de tr&#225;fico hacia Ecuador. Los factores que 
aumentar&#237;an el peligro de ser objeto de trata incluyen un aumento en las medidas de control en 
las fronteras recientemente implementadas por el gobierno ecuatoriano, incluyendo la exigencia 
del <i>pasado judicial</i> para cruzar la frontera. El <i>pasado judicial</i> es un registro oficial de no tener 
historia criminal, emitido por las autoridades colombianas. Este documento ser&#237;a muy dif&#237;cil de 
obtener por las personas que viven en las zonas rurales de Colombia, ya que s&#243;lo se puede 
obtener en las grandes zonas urbanas, a donde les es dif&#237;cil y peligroso llegar. Adem&#225;s, ser&#237;a </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1

excesivamente costoso para los campesinos colombianos sin recursos, lo cual lo volver&#237;a 
inaccesible para ellos. 
 
67. En este sentido, el hecho de que los colombianos reaccionen ante este nuevo 
requerimiento cruzando la frontera en &#225;reas remotas en lugar de hacerlo en los sitios oficiales de 
cruce, aumenta la preocupaci&#243;n de que se extienda la trata de personas. La presunta corrupci&#243;n 
entre las autoridades ecuatorianas, incluyendo oficiales de frontera, tambi&#233;n crear&#237;a un ambiente 
conducente a la trata de personas.  
 
68. Se informa del hecho de que los colombianos que ingresan indocumentados a Ecuador, 
generalmente evitar&#237;an registrarse para solicitar asilo. De todas maneras, incluso si cruzan la 
frontera con los documentos requeridos, muchos escoger&#237;an permanecer no registrados por el 
temor de que al hacer notoria su presencia en Ecuador, ello atraer&#237;a represalias por parte de la 
guerrilla colombiana o de ciertos elementos paramilitares. 
 
69. Asimismo, si bien el permanecer indocumentados puede que les proteja de ser objeto de 
abusos por parte de los insurgentes, ir&#243;nicamente ello podr&#237;a volverles m&#225;s vulnerables a la 
explotaci&#243;n, incluyendo la trata de personas. La falta de estatus legal les dificultar&#237;a el poder 
denunciar a las autoridades ecuatorianas explotaciones o abusos de los cuales hayan sido objeto. 
Ello tambi&#233;n convertir&#237;a a los colombianos en un blanco para la trata de personas, ya que ser&#237;an 
controlados m&#225;s f&#225;cilmente por los traficantes. La reciente disminuci&#243;n del &#237;ndice de 
concesiones de asilo podr&#237;a exacerbar este problema, ya que los individuos a los que se les 
deniega el asilo pasan a vivir en la sombra de la sociedad ecuatoriana, con la esperanza de no ser 
detectados por las autoridades. Ellos tambi&#233;n se tornar&#237;an presa f&#225;cil para los traficantes. 
 
70. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, los colombianos, especialmente las mujeres, se 
enfrentar&#237;an a una significativa discriminaci&#243;n dentro de Ecuador. Ello les obligar&#237;a a ingresar en 
la econom&#237;a informal, incluyendo el trabajo sexual. En muchas ocasiones, se ver&#237;an obligadas a 
buscar protecci&#243;n de hombres ecuatorianos, quienes a su vez frecuentemente las explotar&#237;an. 
Pueblos fronterizos, como Lago Agrio, tienen ya de por s&#237; un alto nivel de delincuencia y 
prostituci&#243;n, por lo que las mujeres y ni&#241;os colombianos frecuentemente terminar&#237;an como 
trabajadores sexuales. 
 
71. Precisamente en Lago Agrio se constata un elevado n&#250;mero de ni&#241;os no acompa&#241;ados. 
Se informa de que existe un orfanato en ese lugar, pero solamente pueden ingresar los ni&#241;os 
menores de 12 a&#241;os. Los ni&#241;os mayores ser&#237;an entregados a familias de la zona y se volver&#237;an 
vulnerables a abusos. Se informa del hecho que los ni&#241;os colombianos tendr&#237;an dificultades para 
recibir educaci&#243;n a causa de la discriminaci&#243;n o por los costos prohibitivos de la educaci&#243;n. 
Como resultado, frecuentemente dejar&#237;an de estudiar y se pondr&#237;an a trabajar para ayudar a 
mantener a sus familias. Ello tambi&#233;n les tornar&#237;a vulnerables a la trata de personas. 
 
<b>Respuesta Del Gobierno 
 
</b>72. Con carta por fecha del 10 de octubre de 2006, el Gobierno informa que quisiera hacer 
algunas precisiones a la comunicaci&#243;n enviada por los Relatores Especiales. El Gobierno 
considera que la parte preambular del cuestionario de la comunicaci&#243;n adolece de errores 
conceptuales de car&#225;cter juridico, asi como plantea una serie de hip&#243;tesis no verifiables y </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 17 
 
presunciones que llevan a una relacion de causa y efecto carente vinculacion real y objectiva 
entre la presencia de migraci&#243;n colombiana en el Ecuador y una especial incidencia en delitos de 
trata en contra de personas originarias de ese pais como resultado de politicas relativas al refugio 
y a omisiones en el combate a los delitos de trata de personas en el Ecuador. El Gobierno 
menciona que desde el a&#241;o 2000 y hasta el mes de septiembre 2006, 41.820 personas han 
solicitado refugio en el Ecuador, de las cuales se ha reconocido como refugiados a 12. 346. En 
alrededor de un 98% de las personas tanto solicitantes como refugiados reconocidos, son de 
origen colombiano. Estas personas han solicitado refugio y no asilo como se afirma en la 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada.  
</p><p> 
73. El Gobierno tambien se&#241;ala que no existe una tendencia declinante en los ultimos a&#241;os 
para el reconocimiento de refugio en el Ecuador. Por lo tanto, el Gobierno rechaza esa 
afirmacion  mencionada en la comunicaci&#243;n enviada y a&#241;ada que no se ve una relacion entre una 
supuesta disminuci&#243;n en la concesion de refugios, que no responde a la realidad, y la supuesta 
exacerbaci&#243;n del problema de la trata derivado de un inexistente incremento de personas 
colombianas no reconocidas como refugiados.  
 
74. Por otra parte, el Gobierno quisiera hacer referencia al enorme flujo migratorio de 
personas de origen colombiano al Ecuador, que solamente desde el a&#241;o 2000 y seg&#250;n estadisticas 
de la Direccion Nacional de Migraci&#243;n del Ecuador, han ingresado a ese pais 924 412 personas 
de nacionalidad colombiana, han salido 501 698 personas, y por lo tanto permanecen 432 213 
colombianos, en un alto porcentaje en condicion migratoria irregular. La exigencia del pasado 
judicial fue la respuesta al insistente calmor en detener el ingreso de delicuentes de origen 
colombiano, que si bien representan una minoria entre la migraci&#243;n proveniente de ese pais, han 
ocasionado en los ultimos a&#241;os graves secuelas sociales al liderar e integrar poderosas bandas 
delincuentes que han atentado contra derechos y bienes juridicos como la vida, integridad 
personal, libertad sexual y propiedad de numerosas personas en el Ecuador. Desde la puesta en 
vigencia del requisito del requisito del pasado judicial, no han disminuido las solicitudes de 
refugio de personas de nacionalidad colombiana.  
 
75. El Gobierno precisa que Ecuador ha sido calificado por ACNUR como uno de los paises 
del mundo con mejores practicas de refugio. En los ultimos a&#241;os, Ecuador es el pais de America 
del Sur que mayor inmigraci&#243;n extranjera ha recibido en proporcion a su poblaci&#243;n. El Gobierno 
esta en proceso de elaboraci&#243;n de una estrategia nacional de inserci&#243;n social de la poblaci&#243;n 
refugiada, liderada por la Canciller&#237;a, con la participaci&#243;n de instituciones del gobierno central, 
de los gobiernos seccionales y locales y ONGs vinculadas a la tematica. Esta estrategia se 
combina con esfuerzos institucionales de integraci&#243;n de la poblaci&#243;n migrante en general. 
Tambien el Ministerio de Trabajo se encuentra ejecutando una estrategia de regularizacion 
progresiva de trabajadores colombianos y peruanos en el Ecuador que pretende en un plazo 
prudencial posibilitar a trabajadores de estos dos paises laborar de manera legal en el Ecuador.  
76. El Gobierno se&#241;ala que Ecuador es victima de la accion de poderosas organizaciones 
delictivas que utilizan a personas con el proposito de explotarlas sexual y/o laboralmente. En el 
a&#241;o 2004 fue creada por parte de la Presidencia de la Republica una Comision Interinstitucional 
integrada por varios Ministerios con el proposito de elaborar un Plan Nacional contra los delitos 
de Trata, Plagio de Menores, Explotacion Laboral y delitos conexos. Este Plan, que ha 
comenzado su fase de ejecuci&#243;n, contiene una serie de politicas p&#250;blicas que de manera integral 
enfocan la problem&#225;tica de la trata de personas desde tres ejes: prevencion, investigaci&#243;n, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 18 
 
sancion y protecci&#243;n y restitucion de los derechos de las victimas. En el a&#241;o 2005 entraron en 
vigencia las reformas al Codigo Penal que tipifican varias conductas de trata de personas, abuso 
sexual, utilizaci&#243;n de personas para pornografia, turismo sexual, utilizaci&#243;n de personas para 
pornografia, turismo sexual en territorio ecuatoriano, con la inclusi&#243;n de penas muy severas en el 
contexto juridico ecuatoriano. 
 
77. El Gobierno a&#241;ada en su respuesta que se permite refutar las presunciones no 
fundamentadas en hechos reales contenidas en la comunicaci&#243;n enviada, de que el Ecuador 
estaria impidiendo o dificultando el acceso de refugiados colombianos y que no aplicaria 
politicas de proteccion de la poblaci&#243;n frente a la incidencia de delitos de trata de personas. El 
Gobierno concluye su respueta y afirma en respuesta al cuestionario que no son exactos los 
hechos a que se refieren las alegaciones contenidas en la comunicaci&#243;n enviada. Esas 
alegaciones contienen una serie de hip&#243;tesis no comprobadas por ningun medio objectivo y 
verifiable y apreciaciones inexactas que les lleva a efectuar presunciones con ninguna relacion 
entre las supuestas causas de responsabilidad del Gobierno con los supuestos efectos de colocar 
a la poblaci&#243;n colombiana en especial situaci&#243;n de vulnerabilidad frente a los delitos de trata de 
personas. El Gobierno precisa que no se realizaran investigaciones policiales ni indagatorias pre-
procesales relativas a delitos de trata de personas espec&#237;ficamente en funcion de la poblaci&#243;n 
colombiana. La policia especializada (DINAPEN) realiza permanentes operativos de control a 
nivel nacional. En estos operativos no se verifican una especial incidencia de victimas de trata de 
personas de origen colombiano. El Gobierno a&#241;ada que por la reciente tipificacion penal de las 
condutas de trata de personas, resulta que por el momento ninguna causa ha llegado al estado de 
sentencia, aun que ya existan algunas causas penales y procesamiento a responsables  de esos 
delitos. De esas investigaciones policiales y procesales sobre delitos de trata no se encuentra 
implicada hasta el momento ninguna autoridad del Gobierno. 
 
<b>Comentarios 
 
</b>78. El Relator Especial quisiera agradecer al Gobierno del Ecuador por su respuesta detallada 
y la informacion proporcionada. El Relator Especial exhorta al Gobierno de Ecuador a redoblar 
sus esfuerzos en pois de prevenir la trata de personas y las diversas formas de explotacion que se 
esconden detr&#224;s de ella, con nuevas pol&#236;ticas de prevenci&#242;n social, apoyo educativo y de amparo a 
los sectores sociales mas carenciados y vulnerables.

<p><b>Greece 
Letter of allegation 
 
</b>79. On 25 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences sent a setter of allegation concerning the trafficking 
of newborn infants from Bulgaria to Greece. 
 
80. According to the information received, it is alleged that pregnant women, most of them 
from the Roma community in the region of Burgas in eastern Bulgaria, and many of them 
unemployed and living in harsh conditions, are induced by members of organised crime to come 
to work to Greece, being promised employment and good salaries. It is reported that instead, 
these pregnant women end up in small cities throughout Greece, where they are held together in </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 19 
 
apartments for the reminder of their pregnancy, before delivering at local hospitals, where, with 
the complicity of doctors, midwives and other hospital staff, their newborn babies are taken away 
from them and sold by organised crime members with the assistance of lawyers for up to 30 000 
euros. It is alleged that after having given birth in Greece, the women are sent back to their 
hometowns in Bulgaria and receive 1.000 euros per child.  
 
81. Reports also alleged that little progress has been made by Greek and Bulgarian 
authorities in investigating the trafficking and sale of children taking place between the two 
countries. 
 
<b>Government response 
 
</b>82. By letter dated 14 September 2006, the Governement of Greece responded to the letter of 
allegation and provided informations pertaining to the legal provisions on adoption in Greece. 
Adoptions are actually governed by Law 2447/1990 as well as articles 1542 to 1588 of the Civil 
Code. Furthermore, the provisions of paragraphs. 2 and 3 of article 10 of Law 2447/96 carry a 
criminal consequence and therefore have a police interest. The said provisions stipulate 
imprisonment or incarceration penalties depending on the regularity of perpetration against the 
person who gives away his/her child for adoption, or any intermediate person who acts with the 
aim of gaining unfair benefits. By virtue of such provisions, police authorities have been 
assigned with the task of combating illegal adoptions and certifying the related crimes. 
 
83. The Government also provided a brief overview of the different stages of  legal adoption 
in Greece. It also noted, thanks to statistics on illegal adoptions kept by the Directorate of 
Public Safety, Hellenic Police Headquarters, all the cases of trafficking in new born infants 
involving Bulgarian nationals, both as offenders and victims, and that the police is aware of the 
places of Bulgarian pregnant women&#8217;s recruitment, the <i>modus operandi, </i>the routes followed in 
order to enter Greece. In an effort to combat such criminal activities, the Hellenic Police 
Headquarters is cooperating with its Bulgarian counterpart and several significant results have 
therefore yielded during the last two years, such as mechanisms for the exchange of 
informations, the cooperation with the police authorities with liaison officers of the two sides 
and in cases of large-scale investigation, the meeting of operation officers of both sides in order 
to eradicate criminal groups.  
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>84. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Greece for its informative 
reply and wishes to reiterate his conclusions and recommendations (E/CN.4/2006/67/Add.3) to 
his mission to Greece in November 2005, particulary that over the past 15 years, Greece has 
become a pole of attraction for immigrants due toits geographical position and its rapid economic 
growth, and that child exploitation reached unprecedented proportions. Although there have been 
several achievements in combating child trafficking and exploitation, some challenges still 
remain to make a child protection system functioning reality and the institutional capacity to 
respond to the needs should be further improved.

<p><b>India 
</b> 
<b>Letter of allegations 
 
</b>85. On 13 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences sent a letter of allegation concerning the trafficking 
and sexual exploitation of Nepalese girls in brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai, India.  
 
86. According to the information received, it is alleged that Nepalese girls, at an average age 
of 14 to 16 years, are trafficked from Nepal to brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai where they are 
required to work as prostitutes in slavery. The girls are trafficked against their will and without 
knowledge of their destination. The traffickers are reported to be Nepalese men and women, who 
sell the girls to (Nepalese) brothel owners in Calcutta and Mumbai, at a price of approximately 
60,000 to 70,000 Indian rupees ($US  1360 to 1590) in Calcutta and 100,000 to 120,000 Indian 
Rupees ($US  2270to 2720) in Mumbai. There is no evidence of extensive networks of 
traffickers of Nepalese women and girls and trafficking seems to take place through an informal 
network with the collaboration of community members, employers, local officials, border 
officials and others such as those who operate &#8216;safe houses&#8217;  where trafficked girls are kept prior 
to their sale.  
 
87. It is reported that initially the girls are not taken to the brothels directly, but given some 
time to adjust to their new situation, in outside homes, sometimes owned by the brothel owner. 
After being told the work that is required of them, how to dress and behave and after being 
convinced that they themselves, or their families, have incurred a debt which they will have to 
pay off by working as a prostitute after which they are &#8216;free&#8217; to leave, the girls are put to work as 
&#8216;tsukri&#8217; (the Bengali word for child in slavery or debt bondage). When they start to work as 
<i>tsukris</i>, the girls are usually aged between 15 to 18 years. They often work in brothels that are 
referred to as &#8216;bungalows&#8217;: brothels that occupy a flat, usually on the first or higher floors of a 
building, often with a shop on the ground floor. The bungalow is distinguished by a channel gate 
(a sliding iron accordion gate) at the entrance to the brothel. When locked, the channel gate is 
virtually impenetrable; making escape from the brothel impossible for the tsukris kept inside. 
The area within Calcutta that contains most bungalow-type brothels with <i>tsukris</i> is Sonagachi; 
whereas in Mumbai brothels with <i>tsukris</i> can be found mainly in Kamathipura, although due to 
police raids these types of brothels are said to have moved to other cities in India or areas 
outside the known brothel areas.  
 
88. It is further reported that while clients of the brothels do not have a specific preference 
for <i>tsukris</i>, they do have a preference for girls between 15 and 20, which in turn creates a 
demand for children. Under the<i> tsukri</i> system the brothel owner retains all of the fees paid by 
clients for the services provided to them by the<i> tsukris</i>. Considerable profits accrue from the use 
of <i>tsukri </i>system: brothel owners are said to earn four to twenty times the purchase price of the 
<i>tsukri</i> over the period of her servitude. The money that the trafficker earns is relatively 
insignificant compared to the large amount that the purchaser (brothel owner) earns. The initial 
purchase price is recovered by the brothel owner, on average, in little over five and a half 
months. A Nepalese <i>tsukri</i> is also said to cost less than an Indian <i>tsukri</i> and because of continued 
client demand for Nepalese girls, the returns are higher. On occasion the brothel owner may also </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 21 
 
offer &#8216;special services&#8217; such as a <i>tsukri&#8217;s</i> virginity or oral or anal sex as well as sex without a 
condom, at a special price. The total period the girls spend in confinement as <i>tsukris</i> varies from 
two to ten years.  
 
89. It is finally alleged that after being released from slavery, it is often very difficult for<i> 
tsukris</i> to go back to Nepal. They fear isolation and repraisals from family and community 
members. Many of them take up work as free-agent sex workers, earning their own fees by 
doing street prostitution or paying tenancy to brothel owners. Escape prior to being released is 
not only very difficult because the girls are kept in confinement; there is also fear of being 
brought back to the brothels, either by police or other community members followed by severe 
physical punishment, as well as a more general fear of &#8216;India outside&#8217; since few <i>tsukris</i> had a 
clear idea of where they were and could not speak the language and were easily recognized as 
foreigners.  
 
<b>Letter of allegation 
 
</b>90. On 15 May 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
sale of children in Talwara migrant camp in Jammu and Kashmir.  
 
91. According to the allegations received, children in the Talwara migrant camp in Jammu 
and Kashmir are sold to work as labourers and domestic workers by their parents who are living 
under circumstances of extreme poverty. Even if both parents work, there is not enough money 
within the family to feed all family members so that these children are sold, sometimes for a 
fixed period of time. Allegedly, over 200 children have already been sold or mortgaged in this 
manner for a few thousand Indian rupees. The reported asking price for children aged nine years 
old is 8,000 Indian rupees, 10,000 Indian rupees for a thirteen year old, and 15,000 Indian rupees 
for an older teenager.  
 
92. It is also reported that one of the residents of the camp, Ms. K. D., has been forced to 
sell her three daughters for 20,000 Indian rupees, in order to feed her other two daughters. 
Another camp resident, Ms. T. D., agreed to sell her son for 8,000 Indian rupees but never 
received the money and a month and a week later her son&#8217;s dead body was found. Mr. Pyar 
Singh claimed that he had mortgaged three daughters at the end of 2005 for 3,000 Indian rupees 
each and was forced to sell a fourth in March because of acute poverty.  
 
93. It is further reported that the issue of children being sold was brought to the Jammu and 
Kashmir State Government attention after a demonstration by several hundred migrant workers. 
A four member Committee, headed by Lal Singh Congress Member of Parliament, was 
delegated on 29 March 2006 to investigate the allegations. Apparently, testifying before the 
panel, the children claimed to have been working as domestic help or in stores of their &#8216;buyers&#8217; 
voluntarily. The &#8216;buyers&#8217; claimed to pay the children&#8217;s parents 1,500 to 2000 Indian rupees per 
month, apart from expenses incurred by them for education, food and clothes of these children.  
 
94. It is finally mentioned that entry into the Talwara camp was allegedly obstructed for the 
duration of the committee investigation. Following the investigations Jammu and Kashmir 
Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad denied that children were being sold. It is alleged that the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 22 
 
President of the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party, Bhim Singh, had offered to buy 
back the sold children and to return them to their parents.  
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>95. The Special Rapporteur regrets that none of his communications have received a reply 
from the Government. The Special Rapporteur considers it appropriate to draw attention to the 
reports of trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, particularly pertaining to young girls, 
and urges the Government to address as a matter of priority. 
He also considers it appropriate to reiterate the conclusions and recommendations of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child with regard to its Febuary 2004 review of the second 
periodic report of India under the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 
Committee  expressed its concern at the increasing number of child victims of 
sexual exploitation, including prostitution and pornography. Concern was also expressed at the 
insufficient programmes for the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of 
child victims of such abuse and exploitation (CRC/C/15/Add.228, paras. 74-75).

<p><b>Islamic Republic of Iran 
</b> 
<b>Response to previously sent communications 
</b> 
96. By letter dated 2 June 2006, the Government responded to the urgent appeal sent on 24 
August 2005 and indicated that Ms. R. T. had been charged with &#8220;coordination and participation 
in illegal demonstrations&#8221;, &#8220;dissemination of false information to internet sites and other media&#8221; 
and &#8220;inciting separatist movements&#8221;. She was thus indicted and released on bail. Mr. U.G. was 
charged with &#8220;dissemination of false information to internet sites and other media&#8221; and 
&#8220;cooperation with terrorist group of Pezhvak&#8221; and was also indicted and released on bail. As for 
Mr. M.S., he was charged with &#8220;measures against security of the state&#8221; and sentenced to five 
years of imprisonment and three years of residence in Qorveh (a town in Western Iran). The said 
detainee has appealed and his case is currently under consideration in the Local Judiciary of 
Kurdestan Province. Mr. M. S. K. was charged with &#8220;incitement of Hatred among Iranian Ethnic 
groups&#8221; and sentenced to imprisonment and five years of respite in his media carrier. Finally, the 
Governement added that pertaining to the case of Mr. A. Z., he has been the main instigator of 
the unrest in July 2005 in Kurdestan Province and that he was a fugitive.  
 
</p>
<p><b>Israel 
Urgent appeal 
</b> 
97. On 11 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, regarding M.J., a 
minor of between 11 and 15 years of age, of Guinean nationality, who was reportedly trafficked 
to Israel and who has been detained in a detention facility run by the Immigration Police in 
Hadera since May 2006. 
 
98. According to information received, M. J. is a victim of trafficking who, together with 
other Guinean citizens, was brought to Israel by Mr. B. B. The trafficked victims had paid Mr. 
B. a considerable amount of money to take them to Israel and to ensure their legal entry, as well </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 23 
 
as a permit to stay and work in Israel. It is reported that some of the victims were arrested at the 
border while others, including M.J., managed to cross the border and enter Israel. Those who did 
manage to enter, however, were then forced into exploitative labour conditions and threatened to 
remain without food or money for their work if they did not do as they were told. Some were 
also threatened that they would be reported to the police who would then detain them for not 
having the necessary legal papers. M.J. was forced to work by Mr. B. and was not paid for his 
work.  
</p><p> 
99. Israeli authorities, upon receipt of information on Mr. B&#8217;s activities in this regard, 
arrested him and had him prosecuted for several trafficking-related offences. Mr. B. was 
convicted on 11 July 2006 and sentenced to two years in prison by the Magistrate Court in Tel 
Aviv. No steps were, however, taken to assist the trafficking victims concerned.  
 
100. M. J. was arrested by the Immigration Police on 11 May 2006, and detention and 
deportation orders were issued against him. However, since he is an unaccompanied minor and 
since Israel has no diplomatic relations with Guinea, it is alleged that he cannot be deported, as 
travelling documents cannot be arranged for him. Reportedly, neither the IOM nor the Red Cross 
managed to obtain documentation for him.  
 
101. According to the source, M.J. is being held in a detention facility in Hadera run by the 
Immigration Police. In this facility minors are held separately from adult detainees. The only 
personnel in the detention center, however, are Immigration Police officers. There are no 
psychologists, welfare workers or other professionals who are trained to deal with the special 
needs of children. Many of the children are reportedly trafficking victims, and some of them are 
refugees or asylum seekers. M.J. is being held with other unaccompanied minors and is locked in 
his cell most hours of the day. He is only allowed four hours a day to go out. No education 
services are available at the detention centre. An English teacher gave the children lessons in 
English. However, after two months the teacher stopped working and lessons were terminated.  
 
102. Sources further report that a non-governmental organization has sought to provide M.J. 
with an alternative arrangement and managed to find an adult who was willing to accommodate 
him. A request to release him in the care of this person was filed on 3 September 2006. The 
Detention Administrative Tribunal denied this request arguing that there was no reason to 
release M.J., since he was being detained in a facility intended for the detention for minors.  
 
103. It was further alleged that on 23 October 2006, the Administrative Tribunal again denied 
an appeal to release him and confirmed that that there was still no progress concerning the 
possibility to send him back to his country. The Tribunal decided to send M. J. for psychiatric 
evaluation after he started crying and threatened to hurt himself if he was sent again to the 
detention facility. The psychiatrist who examined him found that there was no reason to have 
him committed to a psychiatric facility. M.J. was then sent back to the detention facility in 
Hadera, where he remains in detention.  
 
104. Whilst commending the Government for prosecuting Mr. B. for charges of trafficking 
related offences, concern is expressed for the welfare of M. J.t as a victim of trafficking and 
especially since he is believed to be a minor. Concern is further expressed that the authorities 
have not provided M. J., and other trafficking victims, with the assistance required by </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 24 
 
internationally accepted norms and standards for victims of trafficking which could include 
medical, psychological and legal assistance including the facilitation of safe repatriation or 
alternatively, proper reintegration into Israeli society.

Israel.

<b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations 
</b> 
106. Le 17 mars 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur les 
droits de l'homme des migrants a address&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant la situation 
d&#8217;enfants &#233;trangers dans ce pays. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, les principales pr&#233;occupations 
exprim&#233;es quant &#224; la situation de ces enfants concerneraient l&#8217;absence de statistiques sur le 
nombre d&#8217;enfants en d&#233;tention, le manque d&#8217;acc&#232;s par les organisations non gouvernementales 
aux lieux o&#249; ces enfants sont d&#233;tenus, la d&#233;tention de mineurs dans des conditions inappropri&#233;es, 
notamment quand ils ne sont pas s&#233;par&#233;s des adultes autres que les membres de leur famille et 
quand les conditions de leurs d&#233;tention elles-m&#234;mes ne sont pas satisfaisantes, la d&#233;tention de 
mineurs non accompagn&#233;s en contravention avec la l&#233;gislation nationale et les standards 
internationaux, notamment ceux concernant la prise en compte de l&#8217;int&#233;r&#234;t sup&#233;rieur de l&#8217;enfant, 
la non-observation de l&#8217;obligation de ne consid&#233;rer la d&#233;tention des mineurs non accompagn&#233;s 
qu&#8217;en dernier recours et de pr&#233;voir des alternatives &#224; la d&#233;tention, l&#8217;insuffisance des mesures de 
protection, les traitements auxquels ces enfants peuvent &#234;tre soumis durant leur transfert 
(ignorance quant &#224; la destination, manque d&#8217;eau et de nourriture pendant des trajets pouvant 
durer jusqu&#8217;&#224; 12 heures), la d&#233;tention g&#233;n&#233;ralis&#233;e des familles, et les risques encourus par les 
mineurs dont l&#8217;&#226;ge n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; correctement &#233;valu&#233; et qui, de ce fait  se retrouvent en d&#233;tention 
avec des adultes.  
 
107. Il est all&#233;gu&#233; que 588 enfants seraient entr&#233;s sur le territoire italien avec des membres de 
leur famille entre janvier 2002 et ao&#251;t 2005 et auraient &#233;t&#233; plac&#233;s en d&#233;tention. La d&#233;cision du 
placement en d&#233;tention n&#8217;aurait pas &#233;t&#233; prise suite &#224; un examen au cas par cas des situations, et 
les familles n&#8217;auraient pas &#233;t&#233; inform&#233;es des raisons de leur d&#233;tention et de la possibilit&#233; d&#8217;en 
contester la l&#233;galit&#233; devant une cour. De plus, 28 mineurs non accompagn&#233;s, parmi lesquels de 
nombreux requ&#233;rants d&#8217;asile venant de pays d&#8217;Afrique sub-saharienne dans lesquels la situation 
des droits de l&#8217;homme est souvent pr&#233;caire, auraient &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenus entre janvier 2002 et 
ao&#251;t 2005.   
 
108. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les mineurs eux-m&#234;mes et les professionnels notamment les travailleurs sociaux 
ayant &#233;t&#233; en contact avec eux, ces enfants auraient &#233;t&#233; confront&#233;s &#224; des fouilles corporelles et 
confiscations de leurs biens, des obstacles quant &#224; l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux proc&#233;dures d&#8217;asile, l&#8217;insuffisance 
de l&#8217;aide juridictionnelle r&#233;sultant en une m&#233;connaissance de leurs droits en Italie,  l&#8217;absence de

Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations 
 
</b>109. Le 13 avril 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur les 
droits de l'homme des migrants et la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la traite des personnes, en 
particulier les femmes et les enfants, a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations concernant le nombre 
croissant d&#8217;enfants roumains victimes d&#8217;exploitation sexuelle en Italie, et notamment dans la 
ville de Rome. 
 
110. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, au cours des six premiers mois de l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2005, les 
services de la ville de Rome auraient enregistr&#233;s 497 mineurs non accompagn&#233;s, soit autant que 
pour l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2004. La plupart d&#8217;entre ceux seraient des adolescents victimes de trafic ou qui 
auraient migr&#233; de leur propre chef en Italie depuis Bucarest, Calarasi, Craiova, Galati et Iasi, 
Craiova &#233;tant le principal lieu de provenance de ces mineurs. S&#8217;ils certains d&#8217;entre eux sont 
impliqu&#233;s dans des vols, des trafics de drogue ou sont contraints de mendier, la majorit&#233; se 
prostituent sur les principales avenues de la p&#233;riph&#233;rie de Rome et notamment dans le quartier 
Cristoforo et Salaria aux c&#244;t&#233;s de mineurs non accompagn&#233;s issus d&#8217;autres pays.  
 
111. Dans ce contexte, de vives pr&#233;occupations ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es s&#8217;agissant des moyens 
limit&#233;s mis en &#339;uvre jusqu&#8217;ici pour combattre l&#8217;exploitation sexuelle de ces mineurs. Il n&#8217;y aurait 
pas de contacts entre les deux pays en vue de r&#233;soudre ce probl&#232;me. A ce jour, ni la Roumanie ni 
l&#8217;Italie n&#8217;aurait mis en place un syst&#232;me permettant d&#8217;&#233;valuer le nombre d&#8217;enfants victimes de 
trafic, et une base de donn&#233;es au niveau national concernant les enfants victimes ayant &#233;t&#233; 
rapatri&#233;s vers leur pays d&#8217;origine. En outre, bien que la l&#233;gislation italienne comporte de 
nombreuses dispositions sur les droits et protections accord&#233;es aux enfants &#233;trangers, faute de 
ressources financi&#232;res suffisantes et de personnel sp&#233;cialis&#233;, les services sociaux n&#8217;auraient pas la 
capacit&#233; de fournir &#224; ces adolescents le soutien et la protection auxquels ils ont pourtant droit. 
 
<b>Government responses 
 
</b>112. By letter dated 18 May 2006, the Government of Italy responded to the letter of 
allegation dated 17 March 2006 relating to the legal provision adopted to overdraw the problem 
of unaccompanied immigrant children. A comprehensive policy on immigration with 
administrative procedures for the entry and stay of foreigners in Italy, the &#8220;Bossi-Fini&#8221; Law 
proposing a pattern of social integration for the foreigner, and ensuring the implementation of ad 
hoc measures for the protection and the support for children, while respecting their dignity and 
rights in both cases of foreign parents and children awarded to foreign adults have been 
developed.  
 
113. The Government provided information on the Committee on Foreign Children, 
established by Legislative Decree No. 286/98. Composed of nine representatives from various 
relevant Ministries, it focuses on two specific categories of children, namely those involved in 
assistance programmes when temporarily authorized to stay in the Italian territory, and the 
unaccompanied Non-EU children. The latter are those children who have not applied for asylum, 
and are within the Italian borders for any reason without a parent or a legal representative.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 26 
</p><p> 
 
114. The Government also noted that the Juvenile Justice Department issued the Memo 
No.1/2001, with the aim to drawing the attention of the Juvenile Justice Centres&#8217; Directorates to 
several provisions related to the above mentioned Committee, such as the obligation to swiftly 
inform the Committee on the entry and the stay of an unaccompanied foreign child in the Italian 
territory, the faculty for the juvenile assistance services to request the Committee to adopt urgent 
measures when facing cases of foreign children without parents, and the necessity to inform the 
juvenile courts on cases of foreign children leaving the Juvenile Prisons and who are under 
economic and moral abandonment, so that the juvenile courts may release a care order while an 
assisted repatriation measure is expected to be enforced. It additionnaly indicated that alternative 
measures (&#8220;stay in community&#8221; or &#8220;stay at home&#8221;) to detention for foreign children were 
available as in the case of Italian children.  
 
115. Relevant statistics from the Ministry of Justice were also provided. As to the statistics on 
foreign children hosted in the Italian Centres of Immigrants, Article 19, para. 2 of the Unified 
Text No.286/98 sets forth the general prohibition of the expulsion measures vis-&#224;-vis foreign 
children, unless they have to follow their expelled parent or legal representative. The stay of the 
foreign children in any of the existing centres for illegal immigration is therefore prohibited. 
However, when massive disembarkations of illegal immigrants occur, particularly at Lampedusa 
Island, it could happen that some children stay for a few hours at the local reception centres. In 
this specific context, medical care services and food are supplied. The procedures to apply for 
asylum in Italy were also described. Foreign children are hosted in the &#8220;homely&#8221; centres, and 
may attend school, vocational courses, and carry out leisure activities. According to the statistics 
made of the Ministry of Justice, there is no data on foreign children at the Temporary Stay and 
Assistance Centres (CFTA). Finally, the Government indicated that pursuant to the Ministerial 
Directive dated 30 August 2000, it is permitted, at any time, for the representative of the UNHCR 
in Italy, by authority received, to access the CFTA. But due to a serious overcrowding of the 
Centres, the access can be exceptionally restricted for a few hours.  
 
116. Within this framework, the Government added that the Ministry of Interior signed in 
March 2006 with IOM, Red Cross and UNHCR, a MoU, the terms of reference which include the 
activities to be carried out by each organization and to be supplied to the Non EU citizens landing 
to Lampedusa Island. The short term results of this initiative are positive, and the Gouvernment 
believes that it should be considered as a pilot-project for eventually similar initiatives because 
thanks to it, a meaningful cooperation has emerged with the migrants landed in Lampedusa 
Island.  
 
117. By letter dated 26 June 2006, the Government of Italy responded to the letter of allegation 
dated 13 April 2006 and reiterated the relevant legal provisions. Responding to the second 
question relating to illegal foreign minors, victims of sexual exploitation, the Government 
indicated that about 1200 minors arrived in Italy in 2004, 900 of which were received in 
Reception Centres. In 2005, the number of minors received was about 1000 from different 
nationalities and from this data, the Government recorded an increase in unauthorized removals 
of these minors from the first assistance centres and an increase in episodes of abuse in the 
municipality of Rome.  
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 27 
</p><p> 
118. One of the issues involving children is begging. According to the Italian Government, the 
vast majority of those children are from communities of Slav origin, to which to add the flow of 
illegal minor immigrants from Morocco, Romania, and Albania who are generally based in 
Northern Italy. Another issue of these illegal activities is sexual exploitation, for which the action 
to prevent the exploiters are, for the Government, uneffective, especially when adding other 
difficulties such as, the hostility of the families of the children, their lack of stability, of houses 
for the children in case of measure of &#8220;stay at home&#8221; and the great number of escape of the 
minors from the Centres. Several preventive and repressive measures have been elaborated in 
order to eradicate begging related activities such as the Memo on cooperation among police and 
social service providers and the adoption of the ad hoc Protocol between the Romania 
Government, the Local Council of Bucarest and the Prefecture of Turin in order to facilitate the 
repatriation of Romanian children victims of exploitation. 
 
119. Information on the intervention carried out by the Rome crime squad was also provided. 
The operation &#8220;Flowers in the mud&#8221; was launched and since then several detention measures 
have been adopted, especially against paedophiles caught in the act. The investigation also 
showed that approx. 200 Roma children had been directed in the channel first of begging and 
then to prostitution. As a result, the responsible judicial authorities released on 31 January 2006 
20 decrees for pre-trial detention and 18 measures for the search of persons and of premises. In 
May 2006, the pre-trial detention was in due course and the children victims of abuse are 
currently hosted in the Rome Centre against begging, the only centre that provides ad hoc 
psychological care services.  
 
120. The third question dealt with the different intiatives devoted to foreign children, 
particularly Roma and Romanian children, victims of sexual exploitation. The Government of 
Italy noted that during the first semester of 2005, 497 non-accompagnied minors coming from 
Bucarest, Calarasi, Craiova, Galasi and Iasi were registered and related to the crimes of theft, 
drug trafficking, begging and prostitution. The Council Office for Social Policies, 5th 
Department and the Juvenile Department at the Municipality of Rome undertook several 
initiatives such as the establishment of a Working Group on the Issue of Foreign Non-
accompanied Minors, the PALMS project focusing on the implementation of pre-reception and 
reception services, an educational project aiming at the integration into second-reception 
structures, an initiative targeting young girls victims of sexual exploitation and which has, to 
date, provided assistance to 1212 victims of both Romanian and Moldovian nationality and the 
main steps of the reception and assistance procedures for non accompanied minors who have 
been in Italy for two months on average at the First Aid Centres for Minors. The Local 
Authorities have also according to the Government engaged in several initiatives or proposals 
devoted to the integration of minors. In this context, the Government also mentionned the 
different relevant NGO&#8217;s operating in Rome.  
 
121. Replying to the fourth question on the Roma children in Italy, the Government mentioned 
that it had taken legislative measures pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution which 
assert the equality of all citizens. Along these lines, several projects have been promoted, and a 
large amount of financial resources allocated, at the regional and local levels, to foster mutual 
understanding, tolerance and respect for diversities, but also to increase the quality of life of 
migrants and minority groups. Moreover, the National Program for the Immigration Politics for </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 28 
 
2004-2006 approved by the Council of Ministers devoted an entire chapter to integration 
policies.  
 
122. In a wider framework, the Government considered that it did not seem appropriate to 
define the nomadic peoples in Italy as a community detached from the rest of the population. 
Italian legislation envisages specific measures aimed at strengthening their protection. In this 
regard, the Italian authorities have recently started some initiatives in order to regularize from a 
legal point of view the situation of about 130,000 individuals, 50 per cent of which is considered 
by illegal foreigners. According to the Government&#8217;s information, the local authorities in many 
regions have been, since 1984, issuing ad hoc provisions for the protection of Roma and Sinti 
populations and their culture. In this context, some interventions were also carried out to allow 
the Roma people in Italy to enjoy some fundamental rights such as the registration of births, free 
movement, working licences and education, and the creation of ad hoc camps equipped with 
basic facilities. Furthermore, several bills have been presented such as &#8220;the protection of the 
right to nomadism and the acknowledgment of the nomadic population as linguistic minorities&#8221;. 
On 28 April 2006, a bill concerning &#8220;Dispositions to recognize and protect Roma and Sinti 
populations and to safeguard their cultural identity&#8221; which aims to promote political 
interventions to face major issues like education, housing, work and language protection, and to 
create a Permanent National Observatory for Roma and Sinti populations. As regards to minors, 
the bill envisages for example their integration in schools, providing their teaching of <i>romanesh 
</i>language, cultural traditions and history of Roma population in classes composed of at least 20 
Roma pupils. Among the other propositions is an institution of a National Fund for Roma and 
Sinti children, within the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies. Finally, the Italian Government 
explained that to facilitate access to school for Roma children, the Ministry of Education 
allocates financial resources to schools so as to fund educational supplementary activities to 
promote a better integration. Furthermore, in cooperation with authorities and representative 
associations, NGO&#8217;s and local bodies, the cited schools organize activities which are relevant to 
the increase in the attendance of Roma children. One of them is the project of compulsory 
education for Roma children promoted by the municipality of Rome from 2005 through 2008.  
 
123. The fifth list of issues concerned the specific attention to foreign children with the 
juvenile justive system. The Law Decree No. 286/98 allows illegal minors to enjoy fundamental 
rights such as the right to education and access to health care services. There is therefore no 
discrimination in the juvenile justice system to the detriment of foreign and Roma minors. 
Foreign minors are under the supervision of the Department for Juvenile Justice and they take 
part in educational, training, sport and leisure activities. The Government indicated as well a 
Memorendum containing the guidelines on the activity of cultural mediation within juvenile 
facilities, issued by the Department for Juvenile Justice on 23 March 2002. This memorendum 
provides that the cultural mediator cooperated with juvenile justice services to carry out 
interventions to be aimed at raising awareness and promoting respect for different cultures, 
improving the dialogue between operators and foreign minors, supporting school and training 
teachers in the elaboration of educational proposals targeted to the specific requirements of 
foreign minors, and facilitating religious assistance and favouring the integration of these 
minors. Futhermore, the Department of Juvenile Justice gave detailed instructions to the juvenile 
justice centres regarding the protection of the children on their food schedule, menu, religious or 
cultural precepts. Statistics pertaining to the flows withing the First Aid Centres were also </p>

<b>Urgent Appeal 
 
</b>125. On 16 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women concerning the alleged trafficking of over 60 women and 
girls from various Central Asian countries. 
 
126. According to the information received, on 14 February 2006, Kyrgyz security forces 
reportedly removed more than 60 women and girls from a plane in the southern city of Osh, 
which was set to transport them to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), allegedly for the purpose of 
sexual exploitation. It is alleged that the women and girls, aged between 17 and 38 - including 58 
Uzbek nationals, one Tajik, one Kyrgyz and one Turkmen - were smuggled into Osh in small 
groups in early February 2006 and had been kept at private apartments prior to the flight. They 
had passed through passport and customs control at Osh airport and were sitting on an aircraft 
preparing to leave for Sharjah in the UAE when they were intercepted and taken to a detention 
centre in the city. The basis for detaining the group was illegal crossing of the border and 
violation of Kyrgyz migration rules. However, the head of the regional office of the Kyrgyz 
National Security Service (NSS) declared that they had evidence that the girls were being 
trafficked, with gangs supposed to meet them in the Emirates.  
 
127. It was reported that around 4,000 women and girls are trafficked annually from or 
through Kyrgyzstan for purposes of sexual exploitation.  Traffickers recruit young women 
mainly from rural areas in Central Asia promising them jobs as waitresses, nannies, cooks, 
saleswomen and dancers in the UAE or other countries. Upon arrival in the destination country, 
the women are forced to prostitute themselves. Debt bondage is very often used to subdue the 
women and perpetuate their exploitation.  
 
128. It was alleged that the city of Osh has become a regional transit hub for the trafficking of 
Central Asian women, especially Uzbek and Tajik women. Uzbek women are increasingly 
trafficked via Kyrgyzstan because of stricter exit controls at Uzbek airports, which aim to curb 
trafficking in persons but also the free movement of political and human rights activists. It was 
also alleged that some Kyrgyz law enforcement officials collaborate with the traffickers. 
 
<b>Government Response 
 
</b>129. By letter dated 24 March 2006, the Government informed the Special Rapporteurs that 
the National Security Service (SNB) of the Kyrgyz Republic, as part of measures taken to block </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 30 
 
transborder channels for trafficking in persons, stopped 60 citizens of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan, one Turkmenistan citizen and one Kyrgyzstan citizen from travelling on an Osh-Al-
Fujairah (UAE) charter flight from Osh airport.  The grounds for detaining the citizens of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan were violations of the regulations on staying in and crossing the State 
border. 
 
130. It was established in the course of the investigation that the above individuals were being 
taken for subsequent sale into sexual slavery by organizers of people trafficking.  The average 
age of most of the girls flying out to the UAE was in fact 15 to 30 years.  It has to be pointed out 
that virtually all the Uzbekistan citizens heading to the Emirates were voluntarily going to 
engage in prostitution to solve their material and social problems. As of 15 February 2006, after 
filtering work, the decision was taken by the Kyrgyz SNB investigative group to gradually 
deport and hand over 52 of the detained citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan and the one 
Turkmenistan citizen, who had entered the territory of Kyrgyzstan from Uzbekistan, to the 
Uzbekistan SNB Border Troops. 
 
131. Note was taken of the use by three Uzbekistan citizens of forged passports, as well as the 
discovery on yet another three citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan of forged passports and 
fragments of false passports of the Kyrgyz Republic. On 17 February 2006 the Kyrgyz SNB 
Investigative Department initiated a criminal case in their respect based on evidence of offences 
under articles of the Criminal Code of the Kyrgyz Republic. However, taking into account the 
fact that four of the above-mentioned citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan are victims of 
labour trafficking, on 21 February 2006 they were transferred to the custody of the Osh 
representative office of the International Organization for Migration. 
 
132. Furthermore, as it was established that one of the organizers and links of the transborder 
channel of people trafficking and illegal migration of citizens of the Republic of Uzbekistan are 
representatives of tourist firms, criminal proceedings were also brought against them pursuant to 
the Criminal Code of the Kyrgyz Republic. The Government reiterated that it is carrying out its 
work to prevent and reduce gender violence in society, prohibit trafficking in persons, and also 
to afford protection and support for victims of trafficking and to raise public awareness of the 
problem of violence. In particular, from 2004 up to the present the Government had initiated ten 
criminal cases in relation to such offences and is conducting preventive and educational work 
through the mass media, as well as cooperating closely with IOM to release from forced 
detention citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic in foreign countries.

Letter of allegation 
 
</b>133. On 12 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers sent a setter of allegation concerning the rapes of two girls 
aged 9 and 12.  
 
134. According to information received, on 27 February 2006, a 9-year old girl was allegedly 
raped by a 19-year old man in Lofa County. When the family reported the matter to the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 31 
 
authorities, the Circuit Sheriff Court allegedly tried to extort a bribe of LD 350 from the victim&#8217;s 
father to arrest the alleged perpetrator. It is furthermore alleged that the Magistrate of Voinjama 
also demanded a payment of LD 300 to issue an arrest warrant. The judge reportedly claimed 
that the money was needed to cover the cost of transporting the alleged perpetrator to jail. On 7 
March 2006, after the victim&#8217;s father had paid LD 100 to the Magistrate, the alleged perpetrator 
was arrested and sent to pre-trial detention. The next day, the prison authorities released the man 
pursuant to a written order by the Magistrate to the prison authorities stating that the man &#8220;is 
under bond in court with two sureties&quot;. Since then the authorities have reportedly not taken any 
further steps in the matter. 
 
135. It was also reported that in March and April 2005, J.K., a 48-year old Pastor of the 
Living Word Pentecostal Church, allegedly raped A.K.-, a 12 year-old girl from Todee District 
(Montserrado County), on three separate occasions using physical force to overcome her 
resistance. J.K. allegedly threatened the victim to kill her, if she told her mother about the rapes. 
A.K. only told her mother about the alleged rapes, when the mother discovered that she was 
pregnant. When the mother confronted the alleged perpetrator about the issue, he allegedly gave 
her 250 Liberian Dollars that was meant to arrange an abortion.   
 
136. The family reported the alleged incidents to the Careysburg Police Detachment. 
However, the police initially decided that there was no need to arrest J.K. or initiate criminal 
proceedings against him since he had taken steps to settle the issue amicably with the victim&#8217;s 
family. Following an intervention by the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), J.K. was 
arrested, taken to the Careysburg Magistrates&#8217; Court and later transferred to the City Court in 
Monrovia. On 16 May 2005, a pre-trial conference was held in the chambers of the Stipendiary 
Magistrate of the City Court, where the defendant&#8217;s counsel attempted to settle the case by 
offering a promissory note signed by Joseph Katakoa to the victim&#8217;s family. The document 
contained a pledge to provide support to the victim during her pregnancy and take financial 
responsibility for the care of the child. The family refused the settlement offer and requested the 
Assistant County Attorney to proceed with the prosecution of the case. The case was forwarded 
to the 1st Judicial Circuit Court Criminal Court &#8220;A&#8221; for trial.  Reportedly, the grand jury hearing 
the case later attempted to exhort LD 1,500 to allow the victim to testify. When the family 
refused to pay the requested bribe, the grand jury refused to hear the case. 
 
<b>Observations 
</b> 
137. The Special Rapporteur joined this case because rape, violence and sexual abuse are 
among the primary causes of child sexual exploitation and trafficking of children. The Special 
Rapporteur therefore looks forward to receiving a reply from the Government of Liberia.

<p><b>Libyan Arab Jamahiriya

<b>Letter of allegation 
</b> 
138. On 10 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, sent a letter of allegation concerning 
information relating to arbitrary detention of women and girls in social rehabilitation facilities. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 32 
 
139. According to information received, the General Secretary of Social Affairs supervises 
and administers several so-called social rehabilitation facilities, including the Benghazi Home 
for Juvenile Girls and the Social Welfare Home for Women in Tajoura. According to an internal 
bylaw, the facilities are to provide housing for &#8220;women who are vulnerable to engaging in moral 
misconduct.&#8221; Women and girls detained in these facilities include women who are accused or 
have been convicted of having transgressed Law No. 70 (1973) criminalizing extramarital 
sexual relations. Others have already served their sentences but are transferred to the facilities 
because no male family member would take custody of them. In addition, there are women and 
girls, including victims of rape, who have never been charged or convicted of a crime, but have 
to fear ostracism or violence, because their families suspect them of having engaged in 
extramarital sexual relations.  
 
140. It is alleged that the majority of women and girls are forced to undergo intrusive and 
degrading virginity tests before being committed to a facility. Women and girls, including those 
who were never charged or convicted, are reportedly detained in the social rehabilitation 
facilities for indeterminate periods of time and physically prevented from leaving. Even adult 
women are usually only allowed to leave if their father or another close male relative agrees to 
take custody of them. Alternatively, they can obtain their release through marriage, often to a 
stranger who specifically approaches the facility looking for a bride. The facility determines 
which women &#8220;qualify&#8221; for marriage based on their &#8220;moral character&#8221;. Over the past five years, 
nineteen women were reportedly married this way.  
 
141. It is further alleged that the facility personnel are authorized to discipline detained 
women and girls with solitary confinement of up to seven days. Women and girls have 
reportedly been sent into solitary confinement on grounds such as &#8220;talking back&#8221; or smoking. 
Girls in the Benghazi Home also reported that they had been hand-cuffed while in solitary 
confinement. It is also reported that girls in the Benghazi Home are not given access to 
education, except for religious instruction and sewing lessons. 
 
<b>Government response 
 
</b>142. By letter dated 23 March 2006, the Government mentioned that customs and traditions 
play an important role in the forging of relationships among the individuals in society and the 
shaping of their view of reality and by way of illustration, the custom of avenging honour by 
means of honour killings is found in some regions. Similarly, a woman suspected of immoral 
conduct tends to be regarded with abhorrence and rejected by her family.  The Libyan 
Government noted that the competent authorities are currently endeavouring to eradicate them 
by changing the concepts associated with them through heightened awareness, outreach 
activities and education.  Nor do the customs and traditions of Libyan society accept that women 
and girls should be left to their fate in the street, with unknown associates. Consequently, it 
considers it essential to develop methods of treatment and measures in order to minimize the 
repercussions of these matters. 
 
143. Furthermore, the Government provided information on the different social institutions 
such as children&#8217;s homes, boys&#8217; homes, girls&#8217; homes, or correctional facilities for juveniles. 
With the exception of correctional facilities for juveniles, these are not penal or correctional 
institutions.  All of them are run by the Social Solidarity Fund, which is responsible for the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 33 
 
welfare of incompetent persons and young persons who have no legal guardian and no means of 
leading a life of dignity. These provide integrated health and social care free of charge. The 
main function is to provide safe havens for women who have no means of support and nowhere 
to go, or women who are charged with a criminal offence and consequently must be detained 
pursuant to judicial procedures in one of these facilities, according to their circumstances and 
the offence with which they are charged.  Their situation in the facility is quite different from 
what it would be in a correctional institution for women because the purpose of their detention is 
to avoid an adverse impact on their social situation, from the standpoint of the traditions and 
customs that prevail in Libyan society. According to the Government, these women enter the 
facility voluntarily, for various reasons. Some of them have no homes because they have 
quarrelled with their families, especially those who are suspected of having engaged in immoral 
behaviour, while others have no means of earning a decent living and caring for their families. 
Women in this category have the right to leave the facility whenever they consider it appropriate 
to do so.  It should also be noted that the legislation governing these facilities requires the 
preparation of skills development programmes for women residents who have no particular 
skills in order to enable them to obtain jobs. Furthermore, educational programmes are provided 
for them as well, and those who wish to complete their schooling.  Finally, the facility offers a 
job placement service and facilitates marriages for those who so desire, or by reconciling the 
women with their families. For the women in the second category - those who are being held as 
a judicial measure - they live in a separate wing of the facility. Such matters as how long 
they may be detained in the facility and means of supervision are regulated by the Code of 
Criminal Procedure.  The rules governing precautionary detention set forth in the Code apply 
in these cases.  
</p><p> 
144. The Government also provided information on the residents of the Home for Juvenile 
Girls. They fall into two categories. The first one consists of girls held in precautionary 
detention by the Office of the Public Prosecutor for pending investigation or that are serving a 
sentence imposed by a juvenile court, or homeless girls assigned to residence in the Home by 
the juvenile court in accordance with the Homeless Juveniles Act. As for the second category, it 
comprises girls who have served a sentence or completed court-ordered administrative 
measures, and have subsequently been transferred to a separate wing of the Home because their 
families have refused to have them back. Some questions were raised by the Governement 
pertaining to this situation and it has concluded that it was imperative for them to be placed in 
the Home, where they receive education, training and skills development that will enable them 
to become integrated safely into society or try to return to their families.  
 
145. The Libyan Government finally mentioned the publication of the Great Green Document 
on Human Rights in the Age of the Masses, followed by the enactment of the Promotion of 
Freedom Act. Moreover, the Ghaddafi Strategic Project for African Youth, Women and 
Children, aiming to raise living standards and promote socio-economic activity for the benefit of 
African young people, women and children, is the confirmation of the Jamahiriya&#8217;s 
humanitarian dimension and its permanent commitment to human freedom and happiness, 
without discrimination based on sex, religion, language or colour.

<b>Appel urgent

charg&#233;e de la question de la violence contre les femmes, y compris ses causes et ses 
cons&#233;quences et la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la traite des personnes, en particulier les femmes et 
les enfants a envoy&#233; un appel urgent concernant la situation  de  plusieurs  personnes  qui 
seraient maintenues  en  esclavage  en Mauritanie. 
 
148. Selon  les  informations  re&#231;ues, six enfants et deux femmes seraient maintenus en 
esclavage et r&#233;partis dans les foyers respectifs d&#8217;Abidine Ould Saka et d&#8217;Ehl Hamady Ould 
Saka, deux fr&#232;res, &#224; Nwar, d&#233;partement de Tidkikja, dans la r&#233;gion du Tagant. Les  personnes  
retenues  dans  le  foyer  de  Ehl  Abidine  Ould  Saka  seraient  S. une jeune fille de 20 ans; O. 
L. qui a environ 15 ans (et qui est orpheline de m&#232;re) ; S., 10 ans (orphelin de m&#232;re), inscrit &#224; 
l'&#233;cole mais qui, selon le t&#233;moignage de son ma&#238;tre d'&#233;cole, serait fr&#233;quemment absent car  il  
serait  retenu  par  ses  ma&#238;tre  et  enfin  T.  et  F.,  respectivement 5  et  6  ans  (deux fillettes 
orphelines de m&#232;re). Le foyer d&#8217;Ehl Hamady Ould Saka retiendrait O., une femme d'environ 70 
ans ainsi que deux gar&#231;ons, E.K.O.M. qui a 13 ans ainsi que B.O.M., &#226;g&#233; d'environ 16 ans. 
 
149. Dans cette affaire, une organisation non-gouvernementale (ONG) qui lutte contre 
l'esclavage aurait &#233;t&#233; confront&#233;e &#224; l'opposition des autorit&#233;s, dont le gouverneur adjoint de la 
r&#233;gion du Tagant qui l'aurait accus&#233;e de cr&#233;er de faux probl&#232;mes et de politiser les faits.  Le 
Procureur de la R&#233;publique a quant &#224; lui d&#233;clar&#233; que &quot;l'esclavage n'existe pas et ceux qui 
pr&#233;tendent le contraire peuvent &#234;tre passibles de poursuites judiciaires&quot; avant de se rendre dans 
les foyers o&#249; sont retenues les personnes susmentionn&#233;es. Apr&#232;s son intervention, seule une 
vieille femme aurait &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;e du foyer d&#8217;Ehl Hamady Ould Saka. 
 
150. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, dans la r&#233;gion du Tagant o&#249; seraient retenues les 
personnes susmentionn&#233;es un sentiment d'impunit&#233; r&#232;gne et l'esclavagisme demeure. En effet, 
les autorit&#233;s charg&#233;es de l'application des lois refuseraient souvent de reconna&#238;tre des situations 
d'esclavage. Cette pratique serait apparemment tol&#233;r&#233;e alors que les droits &#224; la libert&#233;, &#224; l'&#233;galit&#233; 
et &#224; la dignit&#233; de tous les citoyens sont proclam&#233;s dans le protocole de la Constitution de 1991. 
De plus, en 1981, suite &#224; la publication d'une ordonnance, l'esclavage a &#233;t&#233; aboli en Mauritanie. 
Cependant, aucune loi d&#8217;application de ce texte n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; vot&#233;e afin de parvenir &#224; une 
abolition effective. Cette ordonnance, qui proclame l'ill&#233;galit&#233; de l'esclavage, n'en donne pas de 
d&#233;finition pr&#233;cise et ne l'&#233;rige pas non plus en  infraction p&#233;nale. 
 
<b>R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement

r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; que les all&#233;gations avanc&#233;es n&#8217;&#233;taient pas fond&#233;es et qu&#8217;il ne s&#8217;agissait nullement 
d&#8217;esclavage. En effet, les personnes cit&#233;es dans la communication sont des citoyens libres qui ne 
souffrent d&#8217;aucune forme de discrimination ni de contraintes. Qui plus est, elles ne se plaignent 
de rien et sont libres d&#8217;aller et venir l&#224; o&#249; elles le d&#233;sirent.  
 
152. Pour ce qui est de la question relative &#224; la l&#233;gislation en vigueur, le Gouvernement 
mauritanien a tenu &#224; faire les pr&#233;cisions suivantes. L&#8217;esclavage a &#233;t&#233; aboli par la Puissance 
coloniale, et ceci a &#233;t&#233; confirm&#233; en 1961 par la premi&#232;re Constitution mauritanienne laquelle 
proclamait la libert&#233; et l&#8217;&#233;galit&#233; entre tous les citoyens sans distinction aucune. L&#8217;actuelle 
Constitution contient une disposition similaire et garantit le droit de propri&#233;t&#233; ainsi que son 
corollaire, le droit &#224; l&#8217;h&#233;ritage. Le Code p&#233;nal pr&#233;voit &#233;galement de lourdes peines pour les 
personnes coupables d&#8217;arrestation, de d&#233;tention ou de s&#233;questration arbitraires.  
 
153. Le Gouvernement mentionne que l&#8217;Ordonnance n&#186; 81-234 du 9 novembre 1981 portant 
l&#8217;abolition de l&#8217;esclavage n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; suivie de d&#233;crets d&#8217;application dans la mesure o&#249; elle visait 
essentiellement &#224; marquer l&#8217;adh&#233;sion des jurisconsultes de droit musulman &#224; l&#8217;abolition d&#233;cr&#233;t&#233;e 
auparavant en vertu du droit positif. Quant aux textes juridiques de base, ceux-ci avaient &#233;t&#233; 
revus &#224; l&#8217;&#233;poque pour s&#8217;assurer de leur compatibilit&#233; avec le droit musulman. Les lacunes ont &#233;t&#233; 
combl&#233;es par les dispositions de la loi n&#186; 2003-025 du 17 juillet 2003 portant r&#233;pression de la 
traite des personnes. Par ailleurs, le Code de travail, adopt&#233; en juin 2004, prot&#232;ge &#233;galement &#224; 
son article 5 contre le travail forc&#233; ou obligatoire par lequel un travail ou un service est exig&#233; 
d&#8217;une personne sous la menace d&#8217;une peine quelconque et pour lequel cette personne ne s&#8217;est pas 
offerte de son plein gr&#233;. Des sanctions &#224; ces dites infractions sont pr&#233;vues par la loi n&#186; 2003-025 
et les articles 434 et 435 du m&#234;me code. Le Gouvernement mentionne finalement que la 
Mauritanie a ratifi&#233; les principaux instruments de droits de l&#8217;homme et les Conventions

<b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation 
 
</b>158. Le 13 juin 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale 
charg&#233;e de la question de la violence contre les femmes, y compris ses causes et ses 
cons&#233;quences et Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la traite des personnes, en particulier les femmes et les 
enfants a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant des abus perp&#233;tr&#233;s contre les enfants 
travaillant comme domestiques. 
 
159. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, il semblerait qu&#8217;un nombre &#233;lev&#233; d&#8217;enfants domestiques 
dans des maisons priv&#233;es commencent &#224; travailler avant d&#8217;avoir atteint l&#8217;&#226;ge de 10 ans. Selon les 
statistiques officielles provenant d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te sur la main d&#8217;&#339;uvre dat&#233;e de l&#8217;an 2000, il 
semblerait que 11 % des enfants &#226;g&#233;s de 7 &#224; 14 ans seraient actifs dans le march&#233; du travail.  
 
160. Cette situation concernerait surtout les filles, &#226;g&#233;es de moins de 15 ans, appel&#233;es 
commun&#233;ment &#171; petites bonnes &#187;. La situation de leur exploitation &#233;conomique avait d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; 
signal&#233;e dans le rapport de la visite de la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale de l&#8217;&#233;poque lors de sa visite au 
Maroc en 2000 (paragraphes 10 &#224; 20 du Rapport de mission, r&#233;f. E/CN.4/2001/78/Add. 1). 
 
161. Les informations re&#231;ues pr&#233;cisent que les &#171; petites bonnes &#187; employ&#233;es comme 
domestiques ou servantes dans les maisons priv&#233;es seraient originaires de r&#233;gions rurales du 
Maroc o&#249; la pauvret&#233; et le manque d&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; l&#8217;enseignement seraient &#224; l&#8217;origine de leur 
embauche comme domestiques. La majorit&#233; des enfants seraient recrut&#233;s &#224; travers des 
interm&#233;diaires, des agents recruteurs connus comme &#171; samasra &#187; qui, sur sollicitation des parents 
ou autres membres de la famille des enfants accepteraient de &#171; placer &#187; ceux-ci chez un 
employeur &#224; travers leurs connaissances, amis, contacts ou voisins. Dans d&#8217;autres cas, les enfants 
seraient plac&#233;s directement chez l&#8217;employeur par les parents eux-m&#234;mes. 
 
162. Les enfants travaillant comme domestiques recevraient un salaire tr&#232;s minime 
(l&#8217;&#233;quivalent de 0.04 $ &#224; 0.11 $ par heure), ou, dans de nombreux cas, ne seraient pas pay&#233;s du 
tout, l&#8217;employeur se chargeant seulement de les loger et les nourrir et de leur acheter parfois 
quelques biens n&#233;cessaires (v&#234;tements). La majorit&#233; des enfants embauch&#233;s comme domestiques 
seraient astreints &#224; des horaires de travail ext&#233;nuants, pouvant aller de 14 &#224; 18 heures par jour. 
Beaucoup de ces enfants seraient victimes d&#8217;abus physiques ou &#233;motionnels de la part de leurs 
employeurs et se retrouveraient &#224; leur merci. Certaines filles seraient aussi victimes d&#8217;abus 
sexuels de la part de leur employeur. </p>

163. Bien que l&#8217;emploi des mineurs de moins de 15 ans soit interdit par le Code du travail, le 
travail des enfants travaillant comme domestiques se ferait de fa&#231;on informelle et ceux-ci ne 
seraient pas prot&#233;g&#233;s par les normes du Code du travail. De plus, les inspecteurs du travail ne 
seraient pas habilit&#233;s &#224; entrer dans des maisons priv&#233;es et enqu&#234;ter sur les violations aux normes 
du Code du travail qui interdit sous toute forme le travail des mineurs de moins de 15 ans, et les 
autres formes d&#8217;abus dont seraient victimes les enfants employ&#233;s comme domestiques. 
 
164. De plus, les pouvoirs publics, notamment la police, le parquet et les juges seraient 
r&#233;ticents &#224; appliquer les sanctions pr&#233;vues dans le Code du travail pour l&#8217;emploi de mineurs en 
dessous de l&#8217;&#226;ge autoris&#233; et de celles pr&#233;vues dans le Code p&#233;nal interdisant les abus dont 
seraient victimes ces enfants. Les parents de ces enfants seraient aussi r&#233;ticents &#224; intenter des 
poursuites au nom de leurs enfants,  &#233;tant donn&#233; que de telles proc&#233;dures sont co&#251;teuses, longues 
et ne garantissent aucun r&#233;sultat ni b&#233;n&#233;fice. De plus, dans beaucoup de cas ce sont ces m&#234;mes 
parents qui ont plac&#233;s leurs enfants &#224; travailler comme domestiques.  
 
165. Les informations re&#231;ues concluent qu&#8217;il serait difficile, voire impossible pour les enfants 
plac&#233;s comme domestiques de pouvoir se soustraire &#224; cette exploitation. Beaucoup craindraient 
des actes violents ou d&#8217;autres repr&#233;sailles de la part de leur employeur s&#8217;ils viendraient &#224; &#234;tre 
rattrap&#233;s apr&#232;s leur fugue. Les filles auraient aussi peur d&#8217;&#234;tre attaqu&#233;es ou abus&#233;es seules dans 
la rue. Certains d&#8217;entre eux profiteraient de f&#234;tes publiques ou de jours f&#233;ries pour pouvoir sortir 
de la maison et rentrer dans leur famille.

<b>Response to previously transmitted communication 
 
</b>167. By letter dated 22 March 2006, the Government responded to the urgent appeal sent on 
28 November 2005 and provided information on each alleged victims. Ms. G.N. was arrested 
from her home town in Arghakhanchi on 10 May 2005 under the Terrorist and Disruptive 
Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance (TADO) and was transferred to District Jail, 
Kapilvastu on 12 May 2005. She was released by the order of Appellate Court in Butwal on 5 
September 2005 but was on the same day arrested by security personnel from Taulihawa of 
Kapilvastu district. She was then released by the order of the Supreme Court in Butwal on 24 
October 2005. During the custody, the alleged victim was allowed to meet up with her family </p>

members and to consult with legal practitioner of her choice. According to the Government, she 
was treated humanly and no violence was inflicted against her during the custody.  
 
168. Ms. R.B. was also arrested in Arghakhanchi on 30 April 2005 under TADO and was 
transferred to District Jail, Kapilvastu on 4 May 2005. She was released by order of Appellate 
Court in Butwal on 5 September 2005. On the same day, she was again arrested by security 
personnel from Taulihawa of Kapivastu district but was released by the order of the Supreme 
Court in Butwal on 24 October 2005.  
 
169. As for Ms. S.S., she is originally from Inruwa, Sunsari. On 17 May 2004, at around 11 
PM, 8 to 10 undermined masked persons took control of the family members of Ms. S. and 
forcefully took her to a nearby pond belonging to Mr. D. B. S. She was found gang-raped, killed 
and later thrown into a pond. According to the Government&#8217;s information, the police 
immediately arrested some local youths for their suspected involvement in the incident. But they 
released them for not having any connection with the said incident. As the case was under 
investigation, the police arrested on 29 November 2004 M.P., M.C., T.N.S.K., K.R.C., D.Y. and 
R.K.C, permanent residents of Bhawanipur, India and currently residing in Dumraha in Sunsari 
District. The Government indicated that they were produced before the competent authority for 
trial. On 28 December 2004, the accused were remanded to pre-trial detention in District Jail 
Morang by the order of the Sunsari District Court. M.C. and R.K.C. were released by the Court 
on the condition that they would report to the court on specified date. According to the 
information provided, the court has also issued a warrant order.  
 
<b>Letter of allegation 
 
</b>170. On 13 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences sent a letter of allegation concerning the trafficking 
and sexual exploitation of Nepalese girls in brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai, India.  
 
171. According to the information received, Nepalese girls, at an average age of 14 to 16 
years, are trafficked from Nepal to brothels in Calcutta and Mumbai where they are required to 
work as prostitutes in debt bondage. The girls are trafficked against their will and without 
knowledge of their destination. The traffickers are reported to be Nepalese men and women, who 
sell the girls to (Nepalese) brothel owners in Calcutta and Mumbai, at a price of approximately 
60,000 to 70,000 Indian rupees ($US  1360 to 1590) in Calcutta and 100,000 to 120,000 Indian 
Rupees ($US  2270to 2720) in Mumbai. There is no evidence of extensive networks of 
traffickers and trafficking seems to take place though an informal network with the collaboration 
of community members, employers, local officials, border officials and others such as those who 
operate &#8216;safe houses&#8217;  where trafficked girls are kept prior to their sale.   
 
172. It is reported that initially the girls are not taken to the brothels directly, but given some 
time to adjust to their new situation, in outside homes, sometimes owned by the brothel owner. 
After being told the work that is required of them, how to dress and behave and after being 
convinced that they themselves, or their families, have incurred a debt which they will have to 
pay off by working as a prostitute after which they are &#8216;free&#8217; to leave, the girls are put to work as 
&#8216;tsukri&#8217; (the Bengali word for child in slavery or debt bondage). When they start to work as </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 39 
 
tsukris, the girls are usually aged between 15 to 18 years. They often work in brothels that are 
referred to as &#8216;bungalows&#8217;: brothels that occupy a flat, usually on the first or higher floors of a 
building, often with a shop on the ground floor. The bungalow is distinguished by a channel gate 
(a sliding iron accordion gate) at the entrance to the brothel. When locked, the channel gate is 
virtually impenetrable; making escape from the brothel impossible for the tsukris kept inside. 
The area within Calcutta that contains most bungalow-type brothels with tsukris is Sonagachi; 
whereas in Mumbai brothels with tsukris can be found mainly in Kamathipura, although due to 
police raids these types of brothels are said to have moved to other cities in India or areas outside 
the known brothel areas.  
 
173. It is also reported that while clients of the brothels do not have a specific preference for 
tsukris, they do prefer Nepalese prostitutes to other prostitutes. Under the tsukri system the 
brothel owner retains all of the fees paid by clients for the services provided to them by the 
tsukris. Considerable profits accrue from the use of tsukri system: brothel owners are said to earn 
four to twenty times the purchase price of the tsukri over the period of her servitude. The initial 
purchase price is recovered by the brothel owner, on average, in little over five and a half 
months. A Nepalese tsukri is also said to cost less than an Indian tsukri and because of continued 
client demand for Nepalese girls, the returns are higher. On occasion the brothel owner may also 
offer &#8216;special services&#8217; such as a tsukri&#8217;s virginity or oral or anal sex as well as sex without a 
condom, at a special price. The total period the girls spend in confinement as tsukris varies from 
two to ten years.  
 
174. It is further alleged that after paying their &#8216;debt&#8217; and being released from bondage, it is 
often very difficult for tsukris to go back to Nepal. They fear isolation and reprisals from family 
and community members. Many of them take up work as free-agent sex workers, earning their 
own fees by doing street prostitution or paying tenancy to brothel owners. Escape prior to being 
released is not only very difficult because the girls are kept in confinement; there is also fear of 
being brought back to the brothels, either by police or other community members followed by 
severe physical punishment, as well as a more general fear of &#8216;India outside&#8217; since few tsukris 
had a clear idea of where they were and could not speak the language and were easily recognized 
as foreigners.  
<b> 
Government response 
 
</b>175. By letter dated 23 January 2007, the Government indicated that Nepal had adopted a 
series of both policy and programs to control the crime of trafficking in persons. Broad based 
and multi-pronged strategies are put in place to address this problem in its entirety that involves 
prevention, strengthening of administrative and law enforcement measures and, rescue and 
rehabilitation. Towards the preventive front, the issue of poverty, especially among women, is 
being addressed within the framework of the Tenth five-year development plan (2002-2007). In 
addition, other sectoral plans and programs of the government ministries including micro-finance 
schemes are geared to reducing women&#8217;s poverty. These efforts are supported by skills 
promotion programs and vocational training schemes. Particular emphasis is given to enhancing 
educational opportunities for girls at the formal and informal level such as programs of 
scholarships, enforcement of compulsory universal primary education. The Government noted 
that it was also working with civil society organizations, social workers, media persons, and girl 
students in promoting awareness among people, focusing on trafficking-prone areas.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 40 
</p><p> 
 
176. As the Government&#8217;s legal commitment and institutional arrangements, national laws 
have been formulated, amended and reformed, action plans devised to effectively deal with the 
problem. The Trafficking in Persons (Control) Act, 1987, as amended in 2003, which has 
incorporated harsher penalties to the culprits and elaborated provisions to address new 
complexities of trafficking, is a comprehensive legal framework that governs investigation, 
prosecution and punishment of the crimes related to human trafficking. Furthermore, a National 
Plan of Action against Trafficking in Children and their Commercial Sexual Exploitation (NPA) 
was formulated in 1998. The Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare (MWCSW) has 
outlined 13 priority areas to control trafficking of women and children such as public awareness 
campaign, non discriminatory laws, cooperation with NGOs and donor agencies, harsh penalties 
to the traffickers and exploiters or rehabilitation programs for the rescued women and children. 
In July 2001, a review of the National Program of Action was undertaken and the issue of 
trafficking of women was included with 8 broad strategic objectives.  
 
177. Concerning the targeted activities, it added that the MWCSW is currently working as the 
national focal point for implementing the NPA and all other activities geared against the 
trafficking of women and children. A high level National Coordination Committee to Control 
Trafficking in Women and Children (NCC) headed by the Minister of MWCSW, is in place and 
includes representatives from various line ministries and NGOs. Under the NCC, there is a 
broad-based National Task Force, representing senior officials of the relevant government 
departments and NGOs and INGOs working in this area, which coordinates activities at the 
national level and provide guidelines. Moreover, there are District and Village/Municipality level 
task forces that are implementing preventive and curative activities against trafficking and 
Women Development Offices are entrusted to work as the Secretariat.   
 
178. The Government indicated that the Nepal Police has created a Women&#8217;s Cell at its 
headquarters, which has also launched awareness programs in various districts with regard to 
trafficking and related exploitation. It has set up 16 Women&#8217;s Cell in its district level security 
units and has also implemented a five year long project to train and mobilize the police in 
awareness raising and prevention of trafficking. There are also several instances of apprehension 
of the traffickers and victims by the vigilant Nepal Police, often in collaboration and cooperation 
of civil society actors, before the traffickers sneak the girls from Nepal-India borders. Such girls 
are then either handed over to their parents or sent to rescue homes for education and income 
generating training. In addition, the Government of Nepal has established a rescue/emergency 
fund in certain districts which are considered as major transit points of trafficking victims. The 
Ministry of Labour also prepared in 1995, and a revised version in 2001, a National Master Plan 
on Child Labour that includes trafficking in children as an important component of the action 
programs. Other activities were mentioned such as a &#8220;women self-reliance and rehabilitation 
home&#8221; run by the MWCSW since 1998. 
 
179. The Government noted that this issue is complex and involves many different actors and 
destinations. While poverty, ignorance, lack of education and awareness, urbanization, socio-
cultural factors, consumerism, lack of job opportunities, and crisis in traditional forms of 
livelihood may function as the push factor of trafficking of women and children, it is 
accompanied by a more complex and vicious network of demand factor within and beyond the 
border. Therefore, the NPA aims at exerting more coordinated effort towards the prevention and </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 41 
 
controlling of women and child trafficking and rescue and rehabilitation of the victims. This 
involves the mobilization of resources at all levels and the participation of not only the 
government but the civil society as well.  
 
180. Regarding the accuracy of the facts summarized in the communication, it indicated that 
there are no specific empirical studies carried out by the Government of Nepal to ascertain them. 
However, the State has incorporated provisions of harsh penalty and imprisonment to the 
perpetrators of such crime. As per the provisions of the Trafficking in Person (Control) Act, 
1987, a convicted criminal of trafficking is liable for a maximum of 20 years of imprisonment 
and up to Rs. 200,000.00 penalty. The Act also provides for an extra-territorial jurisdiction in 
such cases allowing indicted persons to be prosecuted in the court of Nepal wherever the crime 
may have been committed. Any of the police offices in Nepal can accept the complaint of such 
cases. The principle of strict liability is applied, under which the statement of the victim or the 
plaintiff is considered as strong evidence against the defendant who has to prove his/her 
innocence. Cases under this Act are investigated and prosecuted by the Government attorney as a 
party of the case. There are cases where the judiciary has shown encouraging sensitivity in the 
interpretation of the laws on trafficking from the victims&#8217; perspective.  
 
181. Regarding the question whether complaints had been lodged, the Government indicated 
that they may be lodged at any police station verbally or in writing. The police office then 
proceeds with the investigation of the case and in close coordination with the concerned Office 
of the District Government Attorney files the case to the court. According to the record available 
with the Office of the Attorney General, the following figures on the cases filed by the 
prosecution officer to the court are reported: from July 2002 to June 2004, 133 cases were filed 
and 50 adjudicated by the court; and, from July 2003 to June 2004, 173 cases were filed and 88 
adjudicated. Concerning investigation, medical examinations, rehabilitation offered to returned 
women and girls and judicial or other inquiries which may have been carried out, the 
Government specified that investigation and prosecution of every individual case takes place 
after the complaint is lodged. This may follow necessary physical examinations as per nature of 
the case and condition of the victim, which is determined by the investigating officer. The 
investigating officer, in coordination with the Office of the District Government Attorney, files 
the case to the competent court for the adjudication of the case. Furthermore, several NGOs in 
cooperation and coordination with the Government of Nepal have been providing shelter and 
training for the rehabilitation and provided means of livelihood to such victims in different parts 
of the country. The existing laws provide the establishment of a rehabilitation fund to run social 
rehabilitation centers for the victims of trafficking. A committee for the overall coordination of 
the activities with different stakeholders is also envisioned. 
 
182.  The Government further indicated, that as it had already mentioned, the relevant 
statistics show that perpetrators have been identified and penalized by the decision of the court. 
In cases where sufficient evidence proves that a person is involved in trafficking in persons, 
he/she is kept in judicial custody during the prosecution of the case. Even when the court of first 
instance acquits an accused, the Office of the Government Attorney files appeal to the higher 
court for the review of the verdict. Finally, the Government specified that there are instances of 
compensation to the victims. Half of the penalty amount accrued from the convicted criminal of 
trafficking is awarded to the victim or her/his minor children, in case the victim has already died.

183. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Nepal for its extensive and 
informative replies.

<b>Letter of allegation 
 
</b>184. On 16 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children concerning the 
trafficking of Somalian children in the Netherlands for the purpose of facilitating benefit fraud.  
 
185. According to the information received, in the past few years, young Somalian children 
have been brought to the Netherlands by Somalian individuals living in the country and claiming 
that those children are theirs in order to receive social benefits from the Dutch State. Children are 
sometimes led to believe that the people who have brought them to the Netherlands are their 
parents. Some of the children are reported to suffer child abuse and maltreatment at the hands of 
their &#8220;guardians&#8221; in the Netherlands. After a certain time, when the risk of exposure becomes too 
great or the advantages are not outweighed anymore by the costs of raising the children, the 
children are brought back to Somalia where they are left on the street. Having attended school in 
the Netherlands for many years, the children only speak Dutch and often do not know of any 
other relatives than those people they thought were &#8216;family&#8217; in the Netherlands. 
 
186. It is alleged that in the past two years, an estimated 20 children of Somalian descent have 
approached the Dutch embassy in Addis Abbeba, Ethiopia. The reason the embassy in Addis 
Abbeba is sought out is because the Netherlands does not have an embassy in Somalia. The 
children speak fluent Dutch and are brought back from the Netherlands without knowing where 
they are going and dumped back in Somalia against their will. The children however do not 
possess documents, such as passports or school diploma&#8217;s, to prove that they resided in the 
Netherlands for many years. Therefore they are reported to be turned away often by the Dutch 
embassy.  
 
187. The situation of these children was brought to the attention of the media by a Dutch 
national who lives and works in Addis Abbeba. After having encountered these Dutch-speaking 
minors, he reportedly devoted his time to helping these children gain entrance to embassy 
authorities and gather evidence to substantiate their stories. His estimations are that there are 
more than 100 children in Addis Abbeba who have lived in various European countries and have 
been trafficked back to Somalia or Ethiopia. 
 
188. It is reported that on 14 February 2006, the TV Programme Network devoted part of its 
broadcast to the issue of trafficking of Somalian children for the purpose of benefit fraud. In the 
program, details were given on the cases of several children specifically, such as K., F. and A. 
who are currently residing in the Netherlands. K. was able to return to the Netherlands with the 
help of the Dutch national. She is reported to encounter difficulty in relation to her identity 
papers and status of residence in the Netherlands.  
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 43 
 
189. A. and J. are currently living in Ethiopia. J. was taken to the Netherlands in 1991 as a 
five-year old and taken back to Somalia in 2000 when he was 14 years old. He has been living in 
the streets in Addis Abbeba for six years now and the only evidence he had of his residence in 
the Netherlands, an expired identity -card, was reportedly taken from him by the embassy as they 
claimed the identity-card was State property. J. and A. have no address in Ethiopia so that they 
cannot receive information from the Netherlands to back up their stories. A. and S. are also still 
in Ethiopia although their cases are reported to be currently under review by the Dutch 
authorities. A. and S. are brothers of A. who with help from the above-mentioned Dutch national 
in Ethiopia was able to return to the Netherlands. The Dutch individual facilitated contact with 
A.&#8217;s old school in the Netherlands so that he was able to substantiate his claims.   
 
190. Network also reported that an investigation into the matter was carried out by the District 
Attorney&#8217;s Office (OM) in 2002. However it remains unclear what the outcome of this 
investigation was. In response to the Network broadcast, representatives of a political party, 
Christian Union, called for a hearing in the House of Representatives and submitted written 
questions to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Alien Affairs and Integration and the State 
Secretary of Social Affairs. In a joint letter dated 17 February 2006 (reference 28 638-18) the 
authorities reportedly illustrated the procedures followed by Immigration Services and the 
embassy in Addis Abeba with regard to the trafficked children. The above-mentioned estimation 
of 20 children is derived from this letter.  
 
191. It is further reported that in a hearing on 23 February 2006 in the House of 
Representatives, representatives from all political parties allegedly demanded a more thorough 
investigation of the matter and accepted a motion which proposed to extend residence permits to 
all victims of this trafficking scheme. The Ministers are reported to have pledged to investigate 
the matter more thoroughly, among others by having the National Ombudsman investigate the 
matter, and to inform the House of Representatives of their findings in March 2006. Also, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs allegedly declared that he will look into the possibility of a new 
directive for embassy handling of these cases. 
 
192. The Special Rapporteurs have expressed concern at these practices and would appreciate 
being kept informed about further developments in this case, such as the outcome of the 
investigation by the national Ombudsman or an official letter and renewed directive for embassy 
personnel from the Department of Foreign Affairs.   
 
<b>Letter of allegation 
 
</b>193. On 2 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning the 
decision by The Hague Court to legalize the PNVD Party (&quot;Brotherly Love Freedom and 
Diversity Party&quot;). 
 
194. According to the information received, on 17 July 2006, The Hague Court authorised the 
PNVD Party (&quot;Brotherly Love Freedom and Diversity Party&quot;), launched earlier in May 2006, 
preaching, amongst others, the lowering of age of consent for sexual relations from 16 to 12 
years, the legalisation of child pornography and the legalisation of sexual relations with animals. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 44 
 
195. It is reported that The Hague Court, in authorising the PNVD Party, argued that the only 
limits to freedom of expression are those undermining public order, and that the PNVD does not 
challenge them, and that, in a democratic society, this party has the right to exist as any other 
political party. 
 
196. Concern has been expressed that, in allowing a political party with an openly paedophile 
agenda, the application of the Convention of the Right of the Child, and in particular the 
Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, to which the 
Netherlands is a party, might be compromised. 
 
<b>Government responses 
 
</b>197. By letter dated 22 June 2006, the Government informed that it has conducted a thorough 
investigation and attached a translation of the report which was sent to the Dutch Parliament on 
18 April by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice, the Minister for Immigration 
and Integration, the Minister for Administrative Renewal and Kingdom Relations and the 
Minister for Social Security. The Dutch Parliament intends to have a debate with the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Immigration and Integration on this report in the near future.  
 
198. The Report addresses in four different chapters the following questions respectively: 
people smuggling and document fraud, child abandonment in Somalia, possible social security 
fraud, and consultation between the government and the Dutch-Somali community. 
 
199. The report considers that people smuggling from Somalia is entirely a Somali affair since 
both the smugglers and the people smuggled are ethnic Somalis. The people smuggling networks 
are firmly embedded in the close-knit Somali Diaspora in Europe. The networks are very well 
organized. The Netherlands is an important base for the smuggling of Somalis to Europe, both as 
a transit and a destination country. Dutch passports are frequently used to smuggle Somali into 
Europe. The letter further describes the costs and methods used to smuggle people into Europe. 
 
200. The document establishes a distinction between people smuggling and trafficking in 
persons. People smuggling is considered a cross-border crime where the interests of the state, in 
particular, are at issue, and is incriminated by the Dutch Criminal Code under article 197 (1). In 
human trafficking, however, exploitation is the key aspect and the crossing of national borders is 
not strictly necessary. These are situations where people are forced or induced to work or 
provide particular services or to part with their organs, which can be done by applying pressure 
or violence, or simply by taking advantage of a person&#8217;s vulnerability. Intentionally profiting 
from such exploitation is also punishable (art. 273a, Criminal Code). 
 
201. According to the report, the cases discussed in the Network programs broadcast on 14, 
20, 21 and 23 of February 2006 involved children who were reportedly brought to the 
Netherlands illegally and under false pretences to be housed with someone wanting to profit 
from their stay by spending less on them than the child benefit received. If this were the case, the 
practice could not generally be referred to as &#8220;human trafficking&#8221; because the key aspect of 
&#8220;human trafficking&#8221; is exploitation. It is not clear whether or not this was indeed the case. If the 
children attend school and are fed and dressed, the aspect of exploitation is not immediately 
evident. If the children are made to work hard in the home, and do not attend school, however, </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 45 
 
they could be said to be exploited. The practices portrayed in the media may well be punishable 
in other aspects, e.g. fraud or people smuggling. 
</p><p> 
202. In respect cases which may concern human trafficking, the report refers to the Human 
Trafficking Action Plan and supplementary measures as submitted to the House of 
Representatives on 17 February 2006. The report further examines several recent developments 
intended to improve and simplify the prevention of people smuggling, details the role of the 
Royal Military Constabulary, and addresses the issue of misuse of travel documents. 
 
203. Regarding the question of children who are abandoned in Somalia, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs sent a delegation immediately after the emergency debate that took place on 23 
February 2006, to Addis Ababa to gather as much information as possible. The delegation spoke 
with the Dutch evangelist who raised the issue, with three of the young people interviewed in the 
Network programs, with all staff concerned at the Dutch embassy in Addis Ababa, with other 
embassies facing similar problems, and with the UNHCR, IOM, UNICEF and the refugee 
organization ZAO. The delegation also went through all the applications for a passport, 
emergency passport or authorization for temporary stay made by young Somalis in the period 
2000-2006. The issue was discussed with the Dutch embassy there in Nairobi. The chapter on 
children who are abandoned in Somalia details : the situation of Somali children smuggled into 
the Netherlands, the reasons for abandonment in Somalia, the issue of Dutch Somali going to 
Somalia on holiday and lending their passports for substantial fees to members of their family or 
clan, or to people smugglers, the number of abandoned children, the children&#8217;s background, the 
children&#8217;s situation in Somalia, consular assistance from the Dutch embassy in Addis Ababa, 
parents who oppose return, practical assistance during the procedure, access to the embassy in 
Addis Ababa and  immigration policy and Dutch nationality. 
 
</p>
<p>204. The third chapter explains that child benefit has always been a contribution towards the 
cost of maintenance, meaning that the cost of maintaining a child in the Netherlands is higher 
that the child benefit and that there is no evidence to suggest that obtaining child benefit is the 
main reason for (alleged) child smuggling. It further details issues related to the application for 
child benefit and social security fraud. 
</p><p> 
205. Finally, regarding consultation with the Somali community, the fourth chapter mentions 
consultation taking place between the Minister for Immigration and Integration and local Somali 
organizations, the National Ethnic Minorities Consultative Committee (LOM) and the VON 
Refugee Organization which also represents Somali refugees. Other Ministries also maintain 
contacts with Dutch-Somali NGOs.  
 
206. By letter dated 6 February 2007, the Government responded to the letter of allegation 
sent on 2 October 2006 and indicated that given that it is a fundamental right to found a political 
party, the Government adopts a restrained attitude to the permissibility of political convictions. 
However, there are some avenues under the Dutch private law by which political parties may be 
banned or dissolved.  
 
207. Before becoming a party, the PNVD was an association, which is a legal person under 
private law. Article 2:20 paragraph 1 of the Dutch civil Code stated that the district court may 
ban or dissolve a legal person at the request of the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) if its </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 46 
 
activities are contrary to public policy. If the legal person&#8217;s activities are contrary to public 
policy but its activities as such are not, the court may not ban the legal person, but it does have 
the option of dissolving it, at the request of the PPS on the basis of paragraph 2. The Government 
indicated that it has become clear that the words &#8220;contrary to public policy&#8221; should be interpreted 
as follows : the only acts that can justify banning a legal person are acts deemed to be in breach 
of the fundamental principles of the Dutch legal order, which breach &#8211; if occurring on a large 
scale &#8211; would disrupt society. Several examples were set forth such as the use, the threat of force 
against a public authority or racial and other prohibited discrimination or utterances inciting 
hatred or discrimination.  
 
208. It was reported that the aim of the PNVD was to amend the Dutch Criminal Law so as to 
lower the age of consent for sexual relations from 16 to 12, allow children to participate in 
pornographic productions if they want to do so, lower the age of permitted prostitution to 16 and 
legalise the private possession of child pornography. According to the Government, these aims, 
no matter how reprehensible, cannot be regarded as contrary to the public policy in themselves. 
Therefore, the PPS did not request the court to ban the PNVD, nor did the manifesto in itself 
give grounds for requesting the court to dissolve the association. It added that the case court in 
this matter concerned a civil action brought by an organisation that works to combat child abuse. 
The court determined that a civil action can succeed only it the claimant has a very compelling 
and urgent direct interest in the court order being sought and it was not the case here.  
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b><i>209. </i>The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its extensive and informative replies 
concerning both communications. Concerning the reply to the communication sent on 2 October 
2006, the Special Rapporteur would nonetheless like to point out that every state party to the 
Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography should encourage the full and harmonious development of 
every child by undertaking all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures, for 
example by adopting a holistic approach, addressing the contributing factors and by raising 
public awareness to reduce consumer demand.  In keeping with these standards, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to stress that by tolerating unacceptable behaviors invoked openly by the 
Brotherly Love Freedom and Diversity Party (PNVD), it will undoubtedly impede the full 
realization of the protection of children, particularly with regards to sexual abuse, child 
prostitution and child pornography. </p>
<p><b>Nigeria 
 
Urgent Appeal 
 
</b>210. On 21 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children regarding the situation of 
children from Benin who continue to be trafficked to Nigeria for the purposes of labour 
exploitation in gravel pits and plantations. It is alleged that despite a June 2005 agreement 
between Benin and Nigeria, hundreds of children from Benin, the youngest of which are six 
years old, continue to work in the gravel pits of Abeokuta and surrounding areas as well as in 
numerous agricultural plantations in South-West Nigeria.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 47 
</p><p> 
 
211. According to the information received, the pits in which these children have to work 
consist of small layers which contain &#8216;holes&#8217; in which groups of two to three children, called 
&#8216;gangs&#8217;, work during several weeks before moving on to another layer. The owners of the pits 
are, in general, local notables. The owners rely on intermediaries, often Yoruba women, to 
manage the exploitation of the pits. The intermediaries allegedly call on traffickers from Benin to 
supply them with child labourers. Reportedly the children work between five to seven days a 
week in the pit. The length of their &#8216;contracts&#8217; is normally 6 years (consisting of 3 periods of two 
years each). During these six years it is not perceived as appropriate to speak of wages. As 
remuneration the children can earn a bicycle and/or a radio at the end of each period. The 
children&#8217;s parents are paid a moderate amount of money on periodic and precise dates during the 
6 year contract. 
 
212. It is further alleged that the physical exertions required of the children are intensive and 
dangerous and especially trying on the knees and hands with a high risk of accidents. The 
children work 8 to 10 hours each day, they are malnourished and they have to rely on themselves 
to wash, dress and care for themselves. The children sleep in slum-like dwellings. There is 
permanent violence among the children who are also subjected to ill-treatment by adults who 
inflict blows, vexations and insults on them. A war between traffickers in September 2003 made 
the situation of these children publicly known. Knowledge of the trafficking was followed by 
urgent action aimed at the withdrawal, repatriation, protection and rehabilitation of the children 
under the control of the Beninese and Nigerian authorities, with the assistance of international 
and non governmental organizations that are specialized in child protection.  
 
213. Officially 261 children, the great majority of which come from the community of 
Zakpota in the Department of Zou, have been withdrawn from the pits and repatriated. The 
majority of this group consisted of children aged between 10 to 15 years. More than 50 per cent 
of them spent one to two years working in the pits, 35 per cent spent three to four years in the 
pits and the remaining children spent between four and seven years in the pits. In addition to the 
261 repatriated children, at least a thousand other children have reportedly returned to the 
Department of Zou without any help or institutional protection (these children are said to have 
&#8216;returned informally&#8217;).  However, tens or even hundreds of other children from Benin who were 
exploited at Abeokuta were reportedly hidden in the bush for several weeks or even months 
before being sent on to other sites of exploitation in the South-West of Nigeria (States of Ogun, 
Osun and Oyo) where they probably joined other children from Benin who have been exploited 
in gravel pits or plantations there.  
 
214. It is finally reported that only seven traffickers were arrested in connection with the 
abovementioned allegations. They were released at the end of 2004 following a period of pre-
trial detention or after serving several months to a year of their prison sentences. No measures 
have been taken to facilitate their economic reintegration or to discourage them from reverting to 
their illegal practices. As a consequence the trafficking network and the routes between Benin 
and Nigeria have remained in place.

<p><b>Pakistan 
</b> 
<b>Response to previously transmitted communication 
 
</b>216. By letter dated 20 December 2005, the Government of Pakistan responded to the 
communication sent on 2 September 2005 and indicated that during the course of the 
investigation, the allegations were found baseless. Ms. S.S. testified to a Magistrate in 
Bahawalpur that she had run away since her parents were forcing her to marry an old man. The 
magistrate ordered Ms. S. to be sent to Darul Aman, a sanctuary for women in distress and 
dismissed the case on 13 September 2005.  
 
</p>
<p><b>People&#8217;s Republic of China 
 
Letter of allegation 
 
</b>217. On 24 March 2006, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking 
in persons sent a letter of allegation concerning the forced repatriation of a female national of the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) by the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) on 28 
February 2006.  
 
218. According to information received, six years before, the woman referred to above and her 
one-year-old daughter were sold for 3,000 RMB to a Chinese man, whom she was forced to 
marry. The woman became pregnant soon thereafter and gave birth to a second daughter named 
K.Y.S. It is reported that the mother was arrested by a Chinese police raid squad at 11:30 p.m. on 
25 February 2006 and handed over to the DPRK security police three days later. Concern is 
expressed that the woman may face harsh punishment since she had already been deported on 
two previous occasions, but managed each time to return to her children in the PRC. In this 
context, reference was made to the communication of 19 December 2005, in which the Special 
Rapporteurs had expressed their concern about the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women 
from the DPRK and the cruel and inhuman punishment DPRK nationals face in the DPRK, if 
they are deported by the Chinese Government. Concern was also expressed about the situation of 
K.Y.S. and her older sister since they are now left alone with their father who reportedly often 
beats them in a drunken state. 
 
219. It is also reported that the deportation case referred to above is not a singular incident and 
that in cities near the border, including Yanji and Longjin, an intensified information exchange 
between DPRK and Chinese authorities on DPRK defectors has reportedly lead to an increase in 
deportations of DPRK nationals. Chinese police reportedly receive a salary bonus of 2,000 RMB 
for every arrest of a suspected defector from the DPRK. The Special Rapporteurs appealed to the 
Chinese Government not to deport citizens of the DPRK and to protect them from all forms of 
trafficking, exploitation and abuse. </p>

<b>Government response 
</b> 
220. By letter dated 14 June 2006, the Government of the Republic of China acknowledged 
receipt of the communication sent on 24 March 2006 and indicated that because the letter only 
refered to a child J.Y. born of a mother from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and a 
Chinese father and to the time that the mother had been apprehended and repatriated without 
providing information on her full name, age, place of entry in China, place of residence, border-
crossing point where she had been repatriated or details of the Chinese father, it is thus hard for 
the Chinese authorities to trace her. According to investigations conducted by the Jilin and 
Liaoning public security authorities, the Chinese authorities were not able, during the last ten 
days of Febuary 2006, to apprehend or repatriate any illegal immigrants from the DPRK and 
whose description matched that of J.Y.&#8217;s mother.  
 
221. Furthermore, referring to the communication concerning the number of illegal 
immigrations from DPRK (50,000), the Government considers the data to be an exaggeration. In 
fact, as a consequence of the improved economic situation in the DPRK and the strenghthened 
controls exercised over the frontier region by China and the DPRK, the number of North Korean 
illegal immigrants entering China is decreasing. The Chinese Government added that in 
accordance with the law, it guarantees the lawful rights and interests of foreign citizens within its 
territory. Regardless whether these people have entered the country legally or have crossed the 
frontier illegally, their rights and interests are equally protected under Chinese law. In fact, in 
regard on the issue of illegal entry, the Chinese Government indicated that it proceeds in an 
appropriate manner, consistent with both domestic and international law and in observance of 
humanitarian principles. In this process, the Chinese police authorities enforce the law in an 
impartial manner and there are no cases of commissions being paid for the repatriation of 
citizens of the DPRK.  
 
222. Finally, the Chinese Government also noted that it attached, together with the public 
security authorities, a great importance to safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of women 
and children and countering any kind of activities which infringe their rights and interests. It 
added that it is consistently working to crack down any illegal activities involving trafficking 
women and children. In fact, as from this year and as a consequence of the increase of contacts 
between China and foreign countries, offences involving trafficking in women and children are 
occurring in China as well. Therefore, the Governement considers this issue very seriously and 
has increased its preventive measures, taken stronger action to combat these offenses, stepped up 
cooperation with police forces in all the other countries involved and cracked down with severity 
Chinese or foreign offenders involved in the trafficking of women and children. Those people are 
actually charged in accordance with the Chinese Criminal Code, with the offences of abducting 
and trafficking in women and children, rape, inflicting injury, unlawfully detaining others and 
other associated offences. And simultaneously, the authorities ensures that the victims receive 
personal care and consideration, and actively assists foreign women and children who have been 
rescued from such abusive pratices, endeavouring to ensure the personal safety and physical and 
mental health of the victims.

<b>Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation 
 
</b>224. Le 13 avril 2006, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur 
la traite des personnes, en particulier les femmes et les enfants  a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gations 
concernant le nombre croissant d&#8217;enfants roumains victimes d&#8217;exploitation sexuelle en Italie, et 
notamment dans la ville de Rome. 
 
225. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, au cours des six premiers mois de l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2005, les 
services de la ville de Rome auraient enregistr&#233;s 497 mineurs non accompagn&#233;s, soit autant que 
pour l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2004. La plupart d&#8217;entre ceux seraient des adolescents victimes de trafic ou qui 
auraient migr&#233; de leur propre chef en Italie depuis Bucarest, Calarasi, Craiova, Galati et Iasi, 
Craiova &#233;tant le principal lieu de provenance de ces mineurs. S&#8217;ils certains d&#8217;entre eux sont 
impliqu&#233;s dans des vols, des trafics de drogue ou sont contraints de mendier, la majorit&#233; se 
prostituent sur les principales avenues de la p&#233;riph&#233;rie de Rome et notamment dans le quartier 
Cristoforo et Salaria aux c&#244;t&#233;s de mineurs non accompagn&#233;s issus d&#8217;autres pays. 
 
226. Dans ce contexte, de vives pr&#233;occupations ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es s&#8217;agissant des moyens 
limit&#233;s mis en &#339;uvre jusqu&#8217;ici pour combattre l&#8217;exploitation sexuelle de ces mineurs. Il n&#8217;y 
aurait pas de contacts entre les deux pays en vue de r&#233;soudre ce probl&#232;me. A ce jour, ni la 
Roumanie ni l&#8217;Italie n&#8217;aurait mis en place un syst&#232;me permettant d&#8217;&#233;valuer le nombre d&#8217;enfants 
victimes de trafic et une base de donn&#233;es au niveau national concernant les enfants victimes 
ayant &#233;t&#233; rapatri&#233;s vers leur pays d&#8217;origine. En outre, bien que la l&#233;gislation italienne comporte 
de nombreuses dispositions sur les droits et protections accord&#233;es aux enfants &#233;trangers, faute de 
ressources financi&#232;res suffisantes et de personnel sp&#233;cialis&#233;, les services sociaux n&#8217;auraient pas 
la capacit&#233; de fournir &#224; ces adolescents le soutien et la protection auxquels ils ont pourtant droit. 
 
<b>Government response 
 
</b>227. By letter dated 20 June 2006, the Government indicated that it had adopted a &#8220;Program of 
prevention and countering the sexual abuse against minors&#8221; and a &#8220;National Action Plan for 
preventing and countering the children trafficking&#8221;. Based on these documents, joint actions are 
currently performed with foreign partners in order to prevent and combat the cases of minors&#8217; 
exploitation. In fact, Law No. 248/2005 concerning the freedom of movement of Romanian 
citizens abroad entered into force on 29 January 2006 and specifies that minors under 18 are not 
allowed to travel abroad unaccompanied.  
 
228. Information was provided on the case presented by the Special Rapporteur, which is 
similar to the information given within the study the &#8220;Extension of the prostitution phenomenon 
among the Romanian minors from Rome&#8221;, drawn up by the Casa del Diritti Sociali Focus, the 
Romanian Foundation for Children, Community and Family. According to their data, during the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 51 
 
first six months of the year 2005, the public services have registered 487 Romanian 
unaccompagnied minors.  
</p><p> 
229. The Romanian National Authority for the Protection of the Rights of the Child provided 
details to the Italian organization concerning the sources used for their study. It was drawn up 
based on data of the Department GIATMS Gruppo Acoglienza e Tuteia Minori Stranleri within 
the City Hall of Rome who did not confirm the information with the Committe for Foreign 
Children in Rome. The Casa del Diritti Sociali Focus only contacted three Romanian children 
and based their analysis on publications, reports and consultations with institutions, NGO&#8217;s, local 
and public authorities and social workers. An Italian and Romanian social workers team was 
organized and whenever possible, the children were interviewed without being able to compare 
the information provided with other sources. As a consequence, the Romanian authorities was 
supported by the Office of the Romanian attach&#233;s of internal affairs in Italy, and the Romanian 
Consulate in Rome initiated investigations on the situation of the Romanian minors. They also 
cooperated with the Italian authorities in order to identify the persons who have exploited those 
children. In fact, specific activities were carried out through the countering organized crime 
structures with the view of identifying the minor victims and the traffickers&#8217; networks in order to 
punish them.  
 
230. The Government added that after receiving the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication, the 
Ministry of Administration of Interior requested the Romanian liaison officer in Italy, to carefully 
analyze the facts submitted and identify the solutions that would safeguard the fundamental 
rights of the affected children. It concluded that the judicial authorities of Rome did not register 
the 497 Romanian minors as victims, did not make any report in this respect to the Romanian 
authorities and not all the minors discovered by the Italian authorities were unaccompanied 
because some of them were making it up. Moreover, the identification and punishment of 
traffickers and panders is generally the responsibility of the Italian authorities. In that sense, the 
Government confirmed that its embassy in Italy expressed the full avaibility to collaborate with 
the local authorities in order to identify and annihilate the networks of traffickers. In the case of 
arrested minors, the Italian legislation does not allow the local authorities to inform the 
diplomatic mission of the country concerned, if the minor does not give his/her consent in this 
respect; in fact, in most cases, the minors do not wish to notify the Romanian authorities that they 
are detained.  
 
231. In preventing and combating trafficking in children, the Government added that it had 
developed a close cooperation and mutual exchange of operational data with the Italian 
counterparts. In fact, the existing cooperation is actually satisfactory as regards to the 
identification of un-documented children that accept the protection and social integration 
programs and contacts with the family of origin. Moreover, a project entitled &#8220;Illegal migration 
and exploitation of unaccompagnied minors &#8211; Urgent measures in favor of extremely vulnerable 
minors&#8221; is currently being financed by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is unfolding in 
present. This project covers the period of January 2006 to January 2007 and presents social 
issues determined by the psycho-social impact of migration on local communities and families, 
such as abandon and abuse on minors in Romania and the Republic of Moldova. It also aims to 
strengthen the cooperation between the central and local administrations and to involve the civil 
society in the protection and supporting activities for unaccompagnied minors in Italy, Romania 
and the Republic of Moldova, through activities such as training activities, exchanges of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1

experience and expertise in the field of child protection. Finally, the Government added that the 
agreement with the Italian Government concerning the cooperation for protection of Romanian 
minors encountering difficulties on the territory of Italy and their return in the country of origin, 
as well as the field of combating the exploitation of minors is still under negociation. This will 
set up the legal framework and the adequate procedures in order to identify and ensure assisted 
repatriation for the Romanian minors identified on the territory of Italy.  
 
232. The Government concluded by mentioning that in 2005, the General Directorate for 
Countering Organized Crime of the Ministry of Administration and Interior in Romania 
registered different data on trafficking of Romanian chidren in Italy. 65 files sent to the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s office, referring to cases involving 128 minor victims and in 80 per cent of these 
cases, requests for assistance were addressed to Italian authorities. Also during 2005, the 
Romanian National Authority for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (NAPRC) received 
398 requests regarding Romanian unaccompagnied children on Italian territory. The repatriation 
procedure was initiated for all the children and in 8 cases, it was completed. Finally, during the 
first semester of 2006, NAPRC received 60 requests regarding Romanian unaccompanied 
children of Italian territory and in only 11 cases were the procedures completed.

<b>Response to previously transmitted communication

2005 by three persons in a three wheeler taxi that took her to the town of Nagastenna in 
Thalawakele Police area where she was raped by all three of them in an abandoned building 
previously used as a printing press.  
 
235. Upon receipt of this complaint, the Government mentionned that officers of Talawakelle 
Police produced the victim before the Judicial Medical Officer at Base Hospital, Nuwara Eliya 
under Judicial Medical form No. 20 A/000049 and she was warded after consultations for 
necessary examination. Moreover, acting on information given by the victim, the Police visited 
the scene and made necessary examinations. On 26 September 2006, Police arrested the under-
mentionned two perpetrators who are alleged to have committed the said crime: P.M.S. of Devon 
Tea Estate, Talawakelle and S.S. of Pharmston Tea Estate, Talawakelle. The police aslo 
recovered three wheeler taxis and produced the same together with the suspects before Magistrate 
Court/Nuwara Eliya under Case No: B668/05 and the suspects were remanded. At the 
identification parade held on 11 October 2005, the victim identified the above two suspects, out 
of the three who raped her. The third suspect T.S. of Chandirigama Estate, Talawakelle who was 
said to be absconding was finally arrested on 21 June 2006 and remanded. At the investigation 
parade, held on 27 June 2006 at Magistrate Court, Nuwara Eliya, the victim identified him as the 
third person who raped her. The Government also noted that investigations in this case were </p>

completed and the reports of the medical examinations together with the statements of witnesses 
and of the suspects were forwarded to the Attorney General to contemplate direct indictments in 
High Court of Nuwara Eliya. His advice is currently awaited. As for the suspects, they are 
presently on court bail and the Magistrate Court Case No B 668/05 is to be called on 21 
November 2006. Finally, the Government indicated that the names of the perpetrators given in 
the summary of the case were incorrect. In fact, the correct names and addresses, who are 
actually all residents of Tea Estate Quarters, are the one in the reply provided. Finally, the victim 
had not made any request for special protection but the Police, however have taken adequate 
security measures to take care of the vicim from repraisals.

<p><b>Thailand 
</b> 
<b>Letter of allegation 
 
</b>236. On 18 July 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children and the Special Rapporteur 
on violence against women, its causes and consequences concerning women and children 
refugees from Myanmar at risk of trafficking.  
 
237. It is reported that hundreds of thousands of people from Myanmar, many of them women 
and children, have fled into neighbouring Thailand in the course of the past two decades, 
escaping armed conflict and rampant human rights violations in their homeland. Concern has 
been expressed about their vulnerable situation, which reportedly puts them at risk of continued 
human rights abuses. It is also reported that these women and children are particularly at risk of 
trafficking, and the sexual and physical exploitation and forced labour associated with it. 
 
238. It is further alleged that these persons seek assistance in crossing the border. Sometimes 
family or community members offer such help. At other times, people pay &#8220;carriers&#8221; to help them 
cross the border undetected. Such transportation can sometimes be accompanied by an offer of 
employment. 
 
239. It is also reported that people from Myanmar who wish to enter Thailand and do not have 
enough money when they arrive at the border to pay a carrier have to wait at the border area 
anywhere from a few days to months before crossing it. It seems that trafficking often occurs 
during this vulnerable time. It is further reported that sometimes carriers themselves are in fact 
engaged in trafficking. The carriers tell relatives of women or children that life is better in 
Thailand. These persons are then forced to work without pay. It is alleged that some Thai 
officials could collaborate with the traffickers. 
 
240. Concern has also been expressed about the fact that, after being trafficked, women and 
children may end up in a range of abusive situations, including forced prostitution, forced 
begging, abusive domestic work, or work in substandard labour conditions in textile factories, 
fishing or other industrial settings. According to the allegations received, sometimes, the victims 
are not paid at all or are paid a wage far below that promised or allowed under Thai law. Labour 
conditions for trafficked persons are reportedly characterized by long hours and physical and 
sexual abuse. Some women working as domestic servants reported that their inability to speak </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
page 54 
 
Thai left them isolated, and the nature of their work, which often involves living in their 
employer&#8217;s homes, left them vulnerable to abuse. 
</p><p> 
241. Moreover, the fear of deportation haunts people living without status, including victims 
of trafficking. Women and children may be especially susceptible to ill-treatment, and are 
reluctant to complain due to fear of persecution by the Myanmar military if returned as well as 
the fear of stranding their families without economic support if they lose their source of income, 
as abusive as their employment situation might be. 
 
242. Sources also allege that the number of children who arrive alone in Thailand has 
significantly increased in the past four years. The families are often separated once in Thailand. 
In other cases, children may be left alone while their parents are at work. Children who are alone 
are reportedly more vulnerable to abuses such as trafficking. 
 
243. It is further alleged that some children are trafficked from inside Myanmar across the 
border into Thailand. The traffickers then collect a large group of children in Mae Sot 
(Thailand), directly across the border and transport the children to Bangkok. The traffickers lie 
to the children&#8217;s parents, telling them that the children will live &#8220;an easy, better life&#8221;.  
 
244. Once they arrive in Bangkok, the traffickers reportedly force the children to 
communicate to their parents that they are well cared for. Gradually, however, the traffickers tell 
the parents that the children are misbehaving, that they are not working hard enough, and that the 
children are forgetting them. Therefore, when a child does not send money back to the parents, 
the parents assume it is because the child is not working hard enough or is no longer gainfully 
employed. This is to drive a wedge between the children and their parents in order to sever the 
child&#8217;s familial ties. If the parents continue to insist that they want to see their children, the 
trafficker may send the child back in order to avoid trouble and unwanted attention. In most 
cases, however, the parents are unable to investigate the whereabouts of their child and thus are 
forced to give up finding them, at which point the trafficker may sell the child to someone else.  
 
245. It is alleged that a common strategy is to force the children to sell flowers or trinkets or 
to beg on the streets of Bangkok. If the child does not make the required amount of money each 
day, he is reportedly deprived of food, beaten or forced to stay on the street. 
 
246. Concerning the sex industry in Thailand, in addition to the lack of legal residence and 
employment options, trafficked persons who are removed from the brothels are reportedly not 
screened for refugee status. Sources alleged that these trafficked victims are reluctant to share 
information because they typically do not want to return home in Myanmar. Besides, according 
to the information received, the witness protection in Thailand is insufficient and if the trafficked 
person presents testimony, the person would be at risk of retaliation. 
 
247. Furthermore, prosecutions that are supposed to result from the brothel raids are often 
unsuccessful. The prosecution effort is primarily aimed at actors who are only minor figures in 
the trafficking networks, such as the pimps and brothel owners. In the meantime, the trafficking 
victims may be held at the shelters indefinitely, waiting to testify in the proceedings. After 
testifying, the victims are reportedly deported, including those under age 18.

<b>Observations 
 
</b>248. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received a reply to his communication of 18 
July 2006 from the Government of Thailand. He considers it appropriate to draw attention to the 
concerns and recommendations of the Committee of the rights of the child with regard to its 
March 2006 review of the second periodic report of Thailand under the Convention on the rights 
of the child (CRC/C/THA/CO/2, paras. 71-75). The Committee remained concerned at the 
widespread occurrence of economic exploitation, including child labour, in the State party.  
Concerns were also expessed that the Labour Protection Act does not cover children working in 
the informal sector such as agriculture, small-scale family enterprises and domestic service. 
 
249. Furthermore, the Committee expressed concern, at the wide occurrence of sexual 
exploitation including child prostitution, sex tourism and child pornography in Thailand despite 
its intensified efforts to combat trafficking in children. It was preoccupied that Thailand was a 
source, transit and destination country for trafficking in children for the purposes of sexual 
exploitation and forced labour and noted the reported cases of internal trafficking, such as 
trafficking of girls belonging to indigenous and tribal peoples from north to south, as well as the 
increased risk of trafficking and exploitation faced by children of vulnerable groups.

<b>Letter of allegation 
 
</b>250. On 18 October 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation jointly with the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, concerning S. M., 
the founder of Villa N. 18 - City of Hope, a shelter for abused and/or exploited women, 
including abused migrant domestic workers, trafficked women and minor girls. In early August 
2006, the competent authorities had reportedly accused S. M. of having assaulted a 15-year old 
girl who had sought refuge in the shelter. The authorities had reportedly also threatened to close 
the shelter, although no formal decision to that effect has yet been taken.   
 
251. The sources alleged that the criminal charges against S. M. were fabricated. Concerns 
were expressed that these charges and the possible closure of the shelter may be in retaliation for 
her activities in defence of women's rights since the shelter&#8217;s work is reportedly viewed as a 
threat to the traditional culture and family values of the country and its continued operation 
largely depends on S. M.'s work.  
 
252. Concerns were also expressed that the charges against S. M. and the possible closure of 
the women and children shelter could lead to a protection gap for women and children at risk of 
violence, including migrant domestic workers and minor girls. An appeal was also made to 
investigate the allegations against Ms. S. M. in an objective, impartial, fair and speedy manner 
awarding her all procedural guarantees set out in international and national law.

<p><b>United Kingdom 
 
Response to previously transmitted communication 
 
</b>254. By letter dated 28 April 2006, the Government responded to the letter of allegation sent 
on 2 December 2005 and indicated that its strategy to combat human trafficking is multi-faceted 
and has thus been strengthened in order to cover trafficking for all purposes. The offence of 
trafficking for prostitution was introduced in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 
and carries a tough maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Moreover, the Sexual Offence 
Act 2003 introduced new wide-ranging offences covering trafficking into, out of or within the 
United KIngdom for any form of sexual offence, which also carriers a 14 year maximum 
penalty. The Act also introduced a range of new offences covering the commercial sexual 
exploitation of a child, protection children up to 18. These include buying the sexual services of 
a child and causing or inciting, arranging or facilitating and controlling the commercial sexual 
exploitation of a child in prostitution or pornography, for which the maximum penalty is 14 
years imprisonment. Another new offence of &#8220;trafficking for exploitation&#8221;, which covers 
trafficking for forced labour and the removal of organs, was introduced in the Asylum and 
Immigration Act 2004. The Governement added that there had been a number of arrests and 
convictions since the new legislation received Royal Assent. In April 2004, L. P. was sentenced 
to 23 years in prison for trafficking women for prostitution. In December 2004, two men were 
the first to be prosecuted under the specific offences of trafficking contained in the Sexual 
Offences Act 2003, together with associated charges such as rape and false imprisonment. This 
was quickly followed by three further successful prosecutions in March 2005 for human 
trafficking.  
 
255. Moreover, a multi-agency task force was set up, REFLEX, which is overseen by the 
National Crime Squad. It aims to reduce the harm caused by crime of in people smuggling and 
human trafficking. Its establishment has enhanced coherence of theUnited Kingdom&#8217;s broad 
response to organized immigration crime and brings government departments and law 
enforcement agencies together to foster an intelligence-led operational response. Knowledge of 
child trafficking amongst appropriate professionals has also improved and a best practice toolkit 
on trafficking was published. In addition, the Immigration Service has reviewed and updated the 
Unaccompanied Minors Best practice guide to include a chapter on child trafficking. The 
guidance aims to equip officers with the tools they need to recognize children who may have 
been trafficked and contains also a section on trafficking, the aim of which is to enable 
Immigration Officers to refer any children who may have been trafficked to the appropriate 
practionners. An Interviewing Minors training course has also been made available to border 
control staff since November 2003. Staff who have received this training have formed &#8220;Minors 
Teams&#8221; at ports, and deal with cases of unaccompanied minors arriving from the United 
Kingdom and work closely with Social Services, police and child protection officers.  
 </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 57 
</p><p> 
256. It added that after the murder of V.C., the British Government formed in January 2001 a 
statutory inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming and in January 2003, the Laming report was 
published. In response to the report, the Government published a Green Paper, entitled &#8220;Every 
Child Matters&#8221; and following extensive public consultation on it, the Children Act 2004 was 
introduced. In conjunction with the legislation, a highly significant cross-government strategy 
known as the &#8220;Every Child Matters: Change for Children Programme&#8221; is also currently 
underway. Moreover, officers in the Department for Education and Skills will be publishing a 
revised and updated multi-agency guidance to all statutory bodied which have a role in 
safeguarding children and protect their welfare. Entitled &#8220;Working Together to Safeguard 
Children&#8221;, it will provide focused guidance to practionners working with children particularly 
vulnerable to abuse or exploitation.  
 
257. Regarding the identification of children missing from schooling, local authorities have 
now a named individual responsible for receiving details of children found missing, and for 
brokering support for them through the most appropriate agencies. This is supported by the good 
practice guide, Identifying and Maintaining Contact with Children Missing or At Risk of Going 
Missing from Education&#8221; that has provided a practical model of process steps to help Local 
Education Authorities. The Department for Education and Skills, the Home Office, and the 
policing service are also continuing to work together. Furthermore, there have been 
circumstances where concerns about the safety and welfare of children missing from school 
were sufficient to warrant police involvement. Initial enquiries made by the Metropolitan Police 
officers investigating the &#8220;Adam&#8221; murder (the case of the torso of a boy found in the Thames) 
actually identified 300 cases where African or Caribbean children had not returned to school 
following the 2001 summer break. However, no evidence was uncovered to suggest that any of 
them had come to harm, and there were no allegations from any of their families or schools that 
the welfare of these children was significantly at risk and the type of crime of which Adam was 
the victim is extremely rare. This case did, nevertheless, increase concerns about a type of abuse 
which it was thought might emanate as a consequence of some belief systems in African 
communities. As a result, Operation Violet was launched by London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police to 
support the education of new community groups and representatives in acceptable and legal 
methods of child discipline.  
 
258. On the question pertaining to children brought to the United Kingdom who who 
contrcated  HIV through sexual intercourse, the Government indicated that it had no information 
to support this, although they were aware that it is a belief in some regions of Africa where 
HIV/AIDS has reached endemic proportions. About the claim mentioned in the communication 
on the shortcomings within the children&#8217;s services, police, and the immigration service resulting 
in children becoming victims of abuse, it indicated that they had been several operational 
projects dedicated to the investigation of children entering the United Kingdom who may be at 
risk from different forms of exploitation. For example, in order to improve the sharing of 
information between the Immigration Services and Local Authorities, joint Treasury and Home 
Office funding has been used to set up a National Register of Unaccompanied Children (NRUC) 
database.  
 
259. Information on the work from Operation Paladin Child, an operation led by London&#8217;s 
Metropolitan Police Service between August and November 2004 to explore the nature of child 
migration from non-EU countries to the United Kingdom through London was also provided. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/31/Add.1

The 1,738 children at Heathrow actually refer to the results of Operation Paladin Child, where 
1,738 non asylum-seeking unaccompanied minors were purposely identified by the United 
Kingdom Immigration Service during a three month study period. Of these, 551 (30 per cent) 
were identified as potentially vulnerable. Social Services departments were unable to trace 12 of 
the 551 unaccompanied minors, and police enquires continue into their whereabouts. Operation 
Paladin did not find conclusive evidence that children were being trafficked into the United 
Kingdom through Heathrow, although it was acknowledged that the study was too limited in 
scale to predict fully the level of illegal child migration to the United Kingdom. The Metropolitan 
Police Child Abuse Investigation Command, with funding from REFLEX, have continued a 
presence at Heathrow airport as part of a permanent multi-agency partnership to address the 
specific safeguarding needs of unaccompanied minors. They also have safeguarding 
responsibilities at Lunar house Asylum Screening Unit in some train stations and other airports. 
Police forces in other parts of the country are now working with immigration officers to use 
experience gained during Operation Paladin to work more effectively to safeguard children and 
other ports of entry.  
 
260. The Government also described the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) and it was 
made clear that people smuggling and trafficking should be SOCA&#8217;s second priority after 
tackling drugs trafficking. Furthermore, on 1 April 2005, the Home Secretary announced plans to 
create a new national centre to protect children from sexual exploitation and combat online child 
abuse. Called the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) and affiliated to SOCA, it 
will provide a specific service to address internet-based child abuse, as well as developing a 
strategic role in using its international networks to raise awareness, collect intelligence and 
combat child trafficking. Finally, the Home Office recently published a draft United Kingdom 
Action Plan to combat Human Trafficking.  
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>261. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its extensive and comprehensive reply.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Vietnam 
</b> 
<b>Letter of allegation 
 
</b>262. On 30 November 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation concerning 
reports of serious abuses of street children occurring since 2003 in Hanoi.  
 
263. According to the information received, poor children from the countryside go to Hanoi to 
find work, and street children are routinely and arbitrarily rounded up by police in periodic 
sweeps. It is alleged that they are sent to two compulsory state &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; centers on the 
outskirts of town, Dong Dau and Ba Vi social protection centers, where they may be detained for 
periods ranging from two weeks to as much as six months.  
 
264. The Social Protection Centers (<i>Trung Tam Bao Tro Xa Hoi</i> in Vietnamese), also known 
as Social Charity Establishments, Social Support Centers, Social Relief Centers, or Transit 
Centers, are reportedly closed institutions for beggars, homeless adults and children, sex workers, 
drug addicts, orphans, disabled and elderly people without family support, and street children. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 59 
 
These centers are operated and administered by the Department of Labor, Invalids and Social 
Affairs (DOLISA) together with local People&#8217;s Committees. It is alleged that in fact the Ministry 
of Public Security plays a significant role in their operation. These centers operate as part of the 
administrative - rather than criminal justice - system. According to Vietnamese law, court orders 
are not required in order for children and others to be rounded up and detained at the centers, and 
the normal criminal law safeguards do not apply.  
</p><p> 
265. Sources further report that the treatment of street children in detention, particularly at 
Dong Dau, is harsh. Children are allegedly locked up for 23 hours a day in dirty, overcrowded 
cells, sometimes together with adults, with only a bucket for excrement. The lights remain on 
night and day. They are released for two half-hour periods a day to wash and to eat. At Dong 
Dau they are reportedly offered no rehabilitation or educational and recreational activities, and 
no medical or psychological treatment.  
 
266. It is also alleged that children detained at Dong Dau are subject to routine beatings, 
verbal abuse, and mistreatment by staff or other detainees, sometimes with staff acquiescence. It 
is reported that Dong Dau staff members slap, punch, and beat children with rubber truncheons 
for violations of rules, which sometimes have not been clarified with the children. It is further 
reported that children are beaten for benign behavior such as being slow to respond to questions 
or not knowing how to queue, as well as for attempting to escape. Afterwards, they allegedly 
rarely receive medical treatment for their injuries, nor are staff persons who carry out the 
beatings disciplined.  
 
267. It is also reported that at the end of their detention period no efforts were made to take 
these children back home or reunite them with their families. Instead, these children were 
allegedly deposited at the gates of the centers - which are more than 20 miles from Hanoi - and 
expected to find their way. Most did not go back to their homes in the countryside, but returned 
to Hanoi with no new alternatives.  
 
268. Concern has been expressed that roundup campaigns directed by government authorities 
are often launched in advance of national holidays, international meetings, and prominent state 
visits in order to remove street children, beggars, and vagrants from the street and out of view of 
international visitors. One such crackdown on homeless adults and children in Hanoi allegedly 
took place in 2003 before the South East Asian (SEA) Games and another in October 2004 
before the meeting of the Asia-Europe Summit Meeting (ASEM). Concern has also been 
expressed that arrests of street children were intensifying in the lead up to the Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting of world leaders, scheduled in Hanoi on 17-19 
November 2006, which was attended by the United States President, Goerge W. Bush. These 
round-up campaigns in Hanoi have allegedly cleared some of the city&#8217;s high-profile districts of 
street people, including children who make their living on the street.  
 
269. Concern has also been expressed that this situation places the above-mentioned minors at 
high social risk and vulnerability towards becoming victims of trafficking and child prostitution.

<b>Government response 
</b> 
270. On 31 January 2007, the Government of Viet Nam responded to the letter of allegation 
and indicated that it had always prioritized the protection and ensured the implementation of the 
rights of the child, through provisions of laws, policies, programmes and projects for children.  
 
271. With regard to the street children issue, the National Committee for Population, Family 
and Children (NCPFC) has since 2003, advocated &#8220;returning street children to families, helping 
them to reintegrate into community&#8221;. In 2004, the Prime Minister of Viet Nam also approved a 
programme to prevent and deal with the issue on street children, sexually harassed children and 
children who have to do heavy works in harmful and dangerous conditions for the period 2004 - 
2010, emphasizing on the objective to return street children to their families and a five step 
process was therefore developed. The Government added that street, displaced and unsupported 
children are taken to social protection centres for health caring, educating, vocational training 
and preventing them from being exploited into social evils and illegal activities. After receiving 
them, the social protection centres usually collaborates with the families and local 
administrations to return them to their families and reintegrate them into the community. For 
children who are unable to do so or have not yet found their supported families, they may stay at 
the social protection centre for a longer period of time. Thus, these children are not arrested nor 
rounded up by police.  
 
272. The Government indicated that state compulsory rehabilitation centres do not exist in 
Viet Nam. Social protection centres are operated within a framework of laws, notably articles 7, 
26 and 55 of the Law on Protection, Care and Education for Children and budgets for the 
operation of these centres in ensured. Moreover, professionals agencies often inspect the 
operations of the centres to deal with shortcomings if any, and timely provide necessary 
supporting measures. It noted that two inspection teams had recently conducted examinations 
and directly contacted children in two Social Protection centres. Their comments were overall 
positive and noted that only a small number of children aged 16 to 18 years did not fully comply 
with the State&#8217;s reintegration process. 
 
273. Information was provided on the Dong Dau Centre, which is a place for temporarily 
receiving street children. The above mentioned steps are strictly followed in this centre. For a 
few cases of older children who want to go back home on themselves, the Centre provides them 
with the financial assistance. Furthermore, street parentless, unsupported children and children 
who want to stay in the centre, after 15 days of temporary stay, are taken to the Ba Vi Centre for 
nursing, health caring, educating and vocational training. Regarding the living conditions in 
these centres, the Government mentioned that children are allocated in rooms with adequate 
equipments suitable for their age. The Dong Dau Centre has 16 rooms with an area of 18 m&#178; 
each. Each room has 10 sleeping places with sufficient equipments and good hygiene conditions. 
Children have moreover free movement and contact. In that sense, the Government considered 
the allegation totally untrue. The equipments in the Dong Dau Centre are relatively poor but it is 
due to the fact that this centre is only a place for temporary nursing of street children. Children 
there are nevertheless ensured of normal living conditions and are provided with meals, pocket 
money and a good health care. They are organized to follow a daily timetable and in addition to 
the hours allocated for education, children can participate in cultural and recreational activities. 
Furthermore, the Government added that the staffs have an excellent behaviour, treat the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/31/Add.1 
 page 61 
 
vulnerable children responsibly. There has never been any case of verbal abuse, slap, punching 
and beating of children with rubber truncheons at the Dong Dau Centre.  
 
274. The Government concluded by noting that in order to deal with this issue, Viet Nam has 
and will pursue a number of policy measures such as continue to implement the Law on 
Protection, Care and Education for Children and other existing legal documents, conduct training 
courses on skill in caring and receiving children for the staff who are working in social 
protection centres, propagandise to raise awareness, create favourable conditions for children to 
have access to the Child Help Line and free phone number for direct consultation, provide direct 
assistance to children in social protection centres, such as health, examination, education fees, 
scholarships  
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>275. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Vietnam for its extensive and 
informative reply. 
</p>
<p><b>Yemen 
</b> 
<b>Response to previously transmitted communication 
 
</b>276. By letter dated 20 March 2006, the Government responded to the letter of allegation sent 
on 6 December 2005 and indicated that the issue of children being trafficked from Yemen to 
Saudi Arabia was being treated as a social problem and that the Chamber of Deputies, the Higher 
Council for Motherhood and Childhood, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, the Ministry 
of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior, a number of non-governmental organizazions and 
international organizations were concerned with it. According to the Government, the issue of 
smuggling has a number of causes and a study was conducted in the Governorates of al-Mahwit 
and Hajjah in 2004 which identified several aspects contributing to the phenomenon, such as 
families&#8217; low standard of living and lack of employment opportunities, and a low level of social 
awareness. 
 
277. The Government agreed that the problem of trafficking in children has increased after the 
1990 Gulf War and the return of nearly 2 million Yemeni &#233;migr&#233;s from Saudi Arabia to their 
native land. It added that the figure of 3,500 children being trafficked into Saudi Arabia every 
month appears however to be exaggerated. Furthermore, a child may be smuggled out or leave 
the country unlawfully as a member of a group consisting of the child&#8217;s family of other persons 
whom the child knows and who are related to him, or the operation may be handled by a 
professional trafficker. The same study referred to above found that children outside the country 
did indeed contribute to their families&#8217; income and enabled them to enjoy a higher standard of 
living. It also noted that the members of Yemeni society are being made aware of the dangers to 
which these children are exposed, such as having to perform hard and dangerous labour, through 
a human rights information campaign conducted in the hardest-hit regions of the country. In fact, 
trafficked children will inevitably be at risk of violence and abuse as long as there are reports of 
children being subjected to sexual abuse and exhortion at the hands of border guards or in places

278. The Government also expressed its appreciation from the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
expression of welcome concerning the creation of a reception centre. This centre is a permanent 
facility, especially now that its operating budget has been included as a separate item within the 
overall State budget for 2006.  
 
279. An information campaign on human rights and the hazards and adverse impacts of child 
trafficking and their future was furthermore recently conducted in some governorates with a 
view to heightening the awareness of children, families and opinion leaders in society.  
According to the same study, poverty is directly related to the trafficking of children in Yemen. 
Consequently, low-income family support programmes must take this factor into account in their 
future policies.  
 
280. The Government further indicated that Yemen signed the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child in 1991 and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and 
Child Pornography. These intruments were reflected in Yemen&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Rights Act. They 
are, actually, regarded as fundamental to the National Strategy on Childhood and Youth, 2006-
2016. Bilateral cooperation measures with Saudi Arabia are also being implemented, in the form 
of action to coordinate the drafting of a bilateral agreement aimed at enhanced cooperation to 
combat child smuggling. The Government added that preparations were under way for a joint 
Yemeni-Saudi field study on the said issue.  
 
281. Concerning young offenders in detention, the Government indicated that they are kept 
separate from adult. The issue was addressed in law No. 26 of 1997 concerning the custody of 
minors, particularly article 11 para b. It added that the recommendations made by the Special 
Rapporteur concerning the ratification of a number of instruments, such as the Protocol to 
Prevent, Supress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the 
Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Trafficking, will be given due 
consideration.  
 
282. The Government also provided information on the smuggling of children into Saudi 
Arabia available from numerous sources. The Ministry of Interior supplied data on cases of the 
smuggling of children intercepted at the Harad border crossing point. The total for 2004-2005 
was 216 children, including 205 boys and 11 girls. These children originated from the several 
Governorates that border with Saudi Arabia. More came from the Governorate of Hajjah which 
accounted for 97 of the children. Moreover, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour noted that 
a total of 386 children were referred to the Temporary Protection Centre reception facility in 
Harad. These children originated from the Governorates of Hajjah, al-Hudaydah, Sa&#8217;dah, al-
Mahwit, Dhamar, Tai&#8217;zz, &#8216;Amran, al-Bayda, Raimah, San&#8217;a, Ibb, Aden and Lahij. Again, the 
Hajjah Governorate heads the list with 160 children. Finally, the Ministry of Justice indicated 
that in 2005, prosecutions for child smuggling resulted in a total of approximately 22 convictions 
in Hajjah Governorate alone.  
 
283. The Government finally provided information on dealt measures which addressed the 
problem of child smuggling. Several have been elaborated up to date such as a field study on the 
problem of child smuggling in the Governorates of Hajjah and al-Mahwit, and a workshop for 
leaders and officials concerned with the issue, with a view to developing a plan of action to deal 
with child smuggling and the establishment of a temporary protection centre in the Harad border </p>

region. A review of Yemeni law and the enactment of amendments to the Criminal Code to 
prescribe a penalty for a child smuggler or the father of a child smuggled with his knowledge 
and consent, a training for security officers, the establishment of an information desk (&#8220;hot line&#8221;) 
on cases of child smuggling within the Ministry of Human Rights are also being set up. 
Furthermore, several campaigns in Governorates, the preparation of a documentary video on the 
subject, leaflets and other materials, strategies and workshops are being elaborated. The 
celebration of Arab Children&#8217;s Day 2005 in Hajjah Governorate, with the participation of 
children from the reception centre, also highlights the problem of child smuggling.
