<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth 
session from 3 to 14 October 2011.  The review of Thailand was held at the 6th meeting on 
5 October 2011. The delegation of Thailand was headed by Sihasak Phuangketkeow, 
Special Envoy of the Royal Thai Government. At its 10th meeting held on 7 October 2011, 
the Working Group adopted the report on Thailand. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Thailand: Cuba, Indonesia and Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Thailand: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/THA/1 and Corr.1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/THA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/THA/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Thailand through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. In its opening statement, the delegation stated that the UPR process had helped to 
promote dialogue and cooperation on human rights issues among all stakeholders. In 
particular, 14 consultations were held between Government agencies and civil society 
organizations, with a view to identifying human rights progress and challenges, and five 
public hearings on the draft national report were held in all regions. The review process 
provided an opportunity for self-assessment on the human rights situation and served as a 
catalyst for change in society, particularly in terms of human rights awareness-raising 
among all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>6. Thailand was a party to a number of international human rights instruments, 
including seven core treaties, and had been considering becoming a party to other human 
rights treaties and withdrawing reservations made under some treaties. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation provided information on the new Government&#8217;s commitment to 
further promote democracy and prioritize human rights in its policies. Thailand indicated 
that it had achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals, including reducing the 
poverty rate. Fifteen years public education has been ensured to all children. The right to 
health has been guaranteed through improved health security and the Universal Healthcare 
Coverage Scheme. The delegation also provided information about the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>efforts to protect marginalized groups, such as children, women, persons with disabilities, 
older persons, ethnic groups and migrants.  </p>


<p>8. Thailand acknowledged that challenges remained in various areas, particularly with 
regard to the political situation in the country following the turmoil of May 2010, the 
situation in the Southern Border Provinces, and the issues of migration and human 
trafficking. In this regard, Thailand referred to the establishment of the Truth for 
Reconciliation Commission of Thailand (TRCT), which had recently submitted seven 
recommendations based on the principles of justice for all, accountability for all and 
reconciliation among all, which had been positively received by the Government. 
</p>
<p>9. Another challenge highlighted was the situation in the Southern Border Provinces, 
which is not an armed conflict, but which involved protracted violence and needed to be 
addressed at its root cause. This region, known for its unique Thai-Malay-Muslim cultural 
identity, had been threatened by perpetrators of violence using cultural differences to claim 
legitimacy for violent acts. Thailand stated that cultural differences could not be a 
justification for indiscriminate violence directed at the civilian population, which caused 
tremendous physical and psychological impact on the people. At the same time, the 
allegations of impunity of State officials would continue to be addressed through civil, 
disciplinary and criminal remedies. Thailand recognized that the situation required a multi-
pronged approach. 
</p>
<p>10. Thailand also considered that migration and human trafficking were challenges 
which needed to be addressed at national, regional and international levels. Thailand 
provided information about the existing two million migrant workers and many thousands 
of displaced persons and asylum-seekers in the country. While recognizing migrant 
workers&#8217; contribution to the country and the need to promote and protect their rights, 
</p>
<p>Thailand also saw a need to protect the integrity of its immigration and labour laws and 
borders. In particular, Thailand pointed out that since 2004, a registration process, now 
supplemented by the nationality verification process, had been implemented to allow for 
systematic regularization of migrant workers and their children. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the interactive dialogue, 52 delegations made statements. Additional 
statements which could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time 
constraints are posted on the extranet of the Universal Periodic Review site when available.1 
Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present 
report.  
</p>
<p>12. A number of delegations commended Thailand for the presentation of its report, 
which had been prepared in consultation with stakeholders and was comprehensive, 
informative and self-critical in providing an assessment of the challenges faced. 
</p>

of the Council was much appreciated by a number of delegations.

considered that the violence had substantiated the need for special security laws. However, 
the Emergency Decree did not provide for impunity of government officials, nor arbitrary 
arrest or detention of suspects for indefinite periods of time without trial. In this regard, 
Thailand pointed out that representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, 
the National Human Rights Commission, United Nations agencies and the diplomatic corps

of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and articles 6 and 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>

most of the articles of the Protocol, as well as many articles from the OHCHR 
Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>71. Thailand has also developed guidelines and procedures for the identification of 
victims of trafficking, including the provision of medical services, psychosocial 
counselling, legal aid, education and vocational training. Additionally, the victims are not 
prosecuted for violation of immigration laws and may stay and work temporarily in 
Thailand during the prosecution of perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>72. The delegation explained that Thailand has started the process of making child 
pornography a specific crime under national law. Thailand has prepared guidelines on the 
coordination of law enforcement agencies to protect children who are victims of sexual 
abuse, and regulations have been put in place by the police and the judiciary to protect the 
privacy of children victims and avoid their re-victimization. Corporal punishment in 
schools is prohibited by law and all children are entitled to be registered at birth.  
</p>
<p>73. Thailand is promoting gender equality through various measures, including the 
criminalization of marital rape. Thailand is also working towards changing societal, cultural 
and traditional attitudes in order to promote greater participation by women in political and 
public life. In this regard, the assumption of office of the first woman Prime Minister 
demonstrates Thailand&#8217;s commitment and acceptance by the society to enhance the role of 
women in politics. A draft Gender Equality Bill is under consideration by the Government 
and steps are being taken to ensure a more effective enforcement of the 2007 Protection of 
Victims of Domestic Violence Act.

and to protect children from exploitation. It encouraged the continuation of these efforts. 
</p>
<p>80. Hungary, while<b> </b>welcoming the<b> </b>National Human Rights Action Plan, noted the lack 
of advancement in abolishing the death penalty. Hungary enquired about the findings of the 
committee that was studying the issue of ratifying the Rome Statute. Hungary encouraged 
efforts to balance protection of the monarchy and the right of individuals to express their 
views. Hungary suggested that equal attention be given to the work of international, as well 
as national and community, human rights mechanisms.<b> </b>It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. Sweden,<b> </b>while<b> </b>noting that Thailand had a vibrant media, referred to international 
perceptions that it had dropped to being among the countries least respectful of the right to 
freedom of expression.<b> </b>Sweden expressed concern about investigations and accountability 
following complaints made against members of the police or armed forces.  Sweden made 
recommendations.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>82. Chad<b> </b>noted that Thailand was endeavouring to guarantee access to social security to 
all the population and that it was moving forward on the process of reconciliation. It 
welcomed Thailand&#8217;s commitment to guarantee social justice, reduce socio-economic 
disparities and improve the well-being of the population. Chad made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>83. Spain highlighted<b> </b>the improvements achieved through the implementation of the 
National Human Rights Plan and the effectiveness of its follow-up mechanisms. Spain 
highlighted Thailand&#8217;s dialogue with civil society as well as its cooperation with the treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies. Spain made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>84. The delegation informed that the Prime Minister&#8217;s Order of June 2010 to suppress, 
arrest and prosecute foreign workers working underground had been overridden by an 
amnesty, and a new round of migrant workers registration has been opened and the 
registration process has been facilitated. Campaigns to disseminate information on the 
rights of migrant workers have been implemented and several mechanisms has been made 
available to migrant workers facing mistreatment, including through the National Human 
Rights Commission.  
</p>
<p>85. Regarding questions on child labour, the delegation indicated that the employment

among children had declined, including as a result of the labour inspection system.  
</p>
<p>86. On issues relating to freedom of association and labour unions, the delegation stated 
that it intended to become party to ILO Conventions Nos. 87 and 98.  
</p>
<p>87. In conclusion, the delegation reiterated the commitment of the Government of 
Thailand to the principles of the rule of law, justice and respect for all human rights. The 
delegation welcomed the constructive spirit in which the recommendations were given and 
promised to give serious consideration to each one of them. Many of the recommendations 
are in fact in the pipeline or are already being implemented. It indicated that the 
Government had approved the signing of the Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance and that it was ready to extend an open invitation to all 
special procedures. Thailand plans to organize a series of follow-up workshops to raise 
awareness of the UPR recommendations and to form an alliance with the public and civil 
society so as to translate the recommendations into action. It also plans to integrate the UPR 
recommendations into its National Human Rights Plan of Action and set up a monitoring 
mechanism to ensure progress. Thailand intends to work with the OHCHR, treaty bodies 
and special procedures of the Human Rights Council in the implementation process. </p>
