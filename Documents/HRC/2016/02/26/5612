<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
<i> 
 Recalling </i>paragraph 5 (g) of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in 
which the Assembly decided that the Council should assume the role and responsibilities of 
the Commission on Human Rights relating to the work of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, as decided by the Assembly in its resolution 48/141 of 
20 December 1993, 
<i> 
 Taking note </i>of all relevant resolutions on this issue adopted by the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and the Council, 
<i> 
 Taking note also </i>of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on the composition of the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (A/HRC/10/45), 
</p>
<p>                                                 
*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>GE.09-12536 </p>

 <p><i> Taking note further</i> of the reports of the Joint Inspection Unit on the follow-up to the 
management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(A/59/65-E/2004/48 and Add.1) and on the funding and staffing of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2007/8), 
<i> 
 Bearing in mind </i>that an imbalance in the composition of the staff could diminish the 
effectiveness of the work of the Office of the High Commissioner if it is perceived to be 
culturally biased and unrepresentative of the United Nations as a whole, 
</p>
<p><i> 
Expressing its concern </i>that, despite the repeated requests to correct the unbalanced 
</p>
<p>geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for more 
than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four 
remaining regional groups combined, </p>
<p><i> 
Reaffirming </i>the importance of continuing the ongoing efforts to address the imbalance 
</p>
<p>regarding the regional representation of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, 
 </p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level is the need 
for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, and taking into account 
Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, expressing its conviction that this 
objective is compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution,  
<i> 
 Reaffirming </i>that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the 
General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, 
 
 1. <i>Welcomes </i>the statement made by the High Commissioner in her report that achieving 
geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights will remain one of her priorities, and requests the High Commissioner to continue 
taking all measures needed to redress the current imbalance in geographical distribution of the 
staff of the Office of the High Commissioner;  
 
 2. <i>Notes</i> the increase in the percentage of staff from regions identified as requiring 
better representation and the various measures proposed and already taken to address the 
imbalance in geographical distribution of the staff, while stressing that the imbalance in 
geographical distribution is still prominent;  
 
 3. <i>Takes note</i> of the progress achieved towards improved geographic diversity in the 
staff of the Office, and takes note also of the commitment of the High Commissioner to remain 
attentive to the need to maintain the emphasis on the broadest possible geographic diversity of 
her Office, as stated in the conclusion of her report; 
 
 4. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner to work on the broadest geographic diversity of her 
staff by enhancing the implementation of measures to achieve a better representation of countries 
and regions that are unrepresented or underrepresented, particularly from the developing world, 
while considering applying a zero-growth cap on the representation of countries and regions 
already overrepresented in the Office of the High Commissioner; 
 </p>

 <p> 5. <i>Welcomes</i> the efforts towards the achievement of a gender balance in the 
composition of the staff and the decision to continue paying special attention to this issue; 
 
 6. <i>Requests</i> future High Commissioners to continue enhancing the ongoing efforts in 
the fulfilment of the goal of a geographical balance in the composition of the staff of the Office;  
 
 7. <i>Underlines </i>the importance of continuing promoting geographical diversity in the 
recruitment of and promotion to high-level and Professional posts, including senior managers, as 
a principle of the staffing policies of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
 
 8. <i>Affirms </i>the vital importance of geographical balance in the composition of the staff 
of the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the significance of national and 
regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious backgrounds, as well as of 
different political, economic and legal systems, to the promotion and protection of the 
universality of human rights;  
 
 9. <i>Recalls </i>the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly 
resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001, on human resources management, in which the Assembly 
reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the 
composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff 
in all departments, and also recalls the request that he submit to the General Assembly proposals 
for a comprehensive review of the system of desirable ranges, with a view to establishing a more 
effective tool to ensure equitable geographic distribution in relation to the total number of staff 
of the Secretariat; 
 
 10. <i>Encourages </i>the General Assembly to consider further measures for promoting 
desirable ranges of geographical balance in the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner 
representing national and regional specificities and various historic, cultural and religious 
backgrounds, as well as the diversity of political, economic and legal systems;  
 
 11. <i>Welcomes </i>the significant increase in the human and financial resources allocated to 
the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner, and the impact it should have on the 
geographic composition of the Office; 
 
 12. <i>Recognizes </i>the importance of the follow-up to and implementation of 
General Assembly resolution 61/159 of 19 December 2006, and underlines the priority 
importance that the Assembly continue providing support and guidance to the 
High Commissioner in the ongoing process of improvement of the geographical balance 
in the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner; 
 
 13. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner to submit a comprehensive and updated report to 
the Council at its 13th session in 2010, in accordance with its annual programme of work, 
following the structure and scope of her report and with a special focus on further measures 
taken to correct the imbalance in geographical composition of the staff of the Office.
