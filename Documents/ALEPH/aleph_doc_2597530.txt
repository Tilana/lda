Financial outlook
Metro Glass has started the financial year well, and continues to benefit from the strong construction 
market in New Zealand
We expect the current year to provide a marked improvement on our previous year’s result
Year to date, Retrofit has continued to grow at similar strong levels to last year
o
o Our forward book of commercial projects has grown modestly since the financial year end
On 12 August 2016, we announced the acquisition of Australian Glass Group (“AGG”) which is expected 
to formally complete on approximately 31 August 2016. This timing would see the Company’s FY17 
results incorporate ~7 months of AGG earnings
o
o
AGG generates annual sales of circa A$45 million (~NZ$48 million) and earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of circa A$8 million (~NZ$8.5 million)
This transaction will be debt funded so Metro Glass will face increased interest costs. The 
Company will have also incurred one off costs of approximately NZ$1m which will be expensed in 
the FY17 year

Chief Executive Officer’s address
Strictly confidential and not for public release
Benefiting from a strong market, backed by record net migration, low interest 
rates and sustained positive momentum in building activity
Metro Glass’ revenue remains aligned to 9 month lagged residential housing consents. In FY16 our 
revenue grew c. +10%3, outpacing the +8% growth suggested by lagged consents 
– The lagged consents relationship is beginning to diverge as Metro Glass’ sales mix includes an
increasing proportion of commercial and Retrofit revenue
New Zealand residential new build consents -
previous peak was 33.3k units in June 2004
Metro Glass revenue versus 9 month lagged 
housing consents
Average: 21.4k 
consents per 
annum

Residential consents lagged by 9 months

Residential construction growth is heading north, while commercial work is 
strong through out the country
Residential building consent issuance grew 11% year on year, with consents in FY16 reaching ~27,800, 
led by Auckland +20% and surrounding regions (Waikato +34%, Bay of Plenty +45%)
The Canterbury residential rebuild is nearing completion and consents have begun declining as 
anticipated (-13%)
Commercial construction activity continues to be lumpy but is on an upward trajectory with a 
significant pipeline of projects yet to gain consents. The construction industry faced continuing 
capacity constraints during FY16

Australian expansion: Increasing adoption of double glazing in Australia 
presents Metro Glass with a significant opportunity
Double glazing penetration is gathering significant momentum in cooler climates like Victoria and 
Tasmania, which we currently estimate to account for c. 30-50% of windows in new construction
Metro Glass is the largest producer of double glazed units (“DGUs”) in Australasia, and has considerable 
expertise in processing high performance glass and producing its highly customisable range of DGUs
