&#8220;Rectification of the legal status of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&#8221;, in 
which the Council decided to initiate a process to rectify, in accordance with international law, 
the legal status of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, with the aim of 
placing the Committee on a par with all other treaty monitoring bodies. Through this resolution, 
the Council requested the Committee to present a report outlining views, proposals and 
recommendations on this issue to its last session in 2007.

<p><b>ANNEX 
</b></p>
<p><b>Letter from the Chairperson of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
addressed to the Chairperson of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>18 May 2007 
</p>
<p>Excellency, 
</p>
<p>The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, established in 1985 under 
resolution 1985/17 of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), expresses its 
satisfaction at the efforts of the Human Rights Council to rectify its status, as conveyed in 
resolution 4/7 of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>The Committee adheres to the principles of the 1993 Vienna World Conference on 
Human Rights, according to which all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent, 
and interrelated. These principles are reflected in the functioning of the treaty bodies. Although 
the rectification of the status of the Committee is desirable to grant equal treatment to all 
monitoring bodies of the United Nations human rights system, it is a fact that up to now the 
Committee has not been hindered in its functions owing to its status as a subsidiary body of 
ECOSOC and as an independent body of experts.  
</p>
<p>The Committee considers that the responsibility for the rectification of its status lies with 
the States parties. The Committee also considers this to be a timely and advisable measure, 
bearing in mind the ongoing process for the drafting of an Optional Protocol. An Optional 
Protocol would enable the Committee to strengthen and enhance its work in monitoring the 
implementation of the Covenant, particularly by examining States parties&#8217; reports, through a 
procedure that would deal with individual and collective communications. The Committee 
hopes, however, that all steps will be taken to ensure that efforts made to rectify its status will 
not hinder the adoption of an Optional Protocol without further delay.  
</p>
<p>The Committee is at the disposal of the Human Rights Council to take part in a dialogue 
with the Council with regard to the rectification of its status, based on the principles of 
universality, indivisibility and equal treatment of all human rights, whenever the need arises.  
</p>
<p> Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration. 
</p>
<p> Yours sincerely, 
</p>
<p> (<i>Signed</i>): Philippe TEXIER 
  Chairperson, 
  Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
