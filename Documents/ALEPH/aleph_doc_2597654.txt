The Board considers any non-audit services provided during the year by the auditor and satisfies itself that the 
provision of any non-audit services during the year by the auditor is compatible with, and does not compromise, 
the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:
all  non-audit  services  are  reviewed  by  the  Board  to  ensure  they  do  not  impact  the  impartiality  and 
objectivity of the auditor; and
the  non-audit  services  provided  do  not  undermine  the  general  principles  relating  to  auditor 
independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they do not involve 
reviewing or auditing the auditor’s own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for 
the Group, acting as an advocate for the Group or jointly sharing risks and rewards.

performance  indicators  when  implementing  Short  Term  Incentive  Payments.  The  Board  considers  that  the 
success of exploration and feasibility programs, safety and environmental performance, the securing of funding 
arrangements  and  responsible  management  of  cash  resources  and  the  Company’s  other  assets  are  more 
appropriate performance indicators to assess the performance of management.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Basis of preparation of financial report
These financial statements are general purpose financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and comply with other requirements of the law.
The  accounting  policies  below  have  been  consistently  applied  to  all  of  the  years  presented  unless  otherwise 
stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for available for sale investments 
and derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. Cost is based on the fair values of 
consideration given in exchange for assets.
The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars.
These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The financial report of the Company was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of Directors on 1st 
September 2016.
Statement of Compliance 
The  financial  report  of  the  Group  complies  with  Australian  Accounting  Standards,  which  include  Australian 
Equivalents  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (AIFRS),  in  their  entirety.  Compliance  with  AIFRS 
ensures that the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in their 
entirety. The Company is a for profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.
Going Concern Basis for Preparation of Financial Statements 
These financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which contemplates the continuity 
of  normal  business  activities  and  the  realisation  of  assets  and  discharge  of  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of 
business.
As at 30 June 2016, the Group has net current assets of $6,360,320 (2015: $3,587,031). These net current assets 
are considered sufficient by the Directors to meet all current minimum exploration expenditure commitments, 
settle all debts as and when they become due as well as operating cash outflows of the Group. In addition, should 
the Company require, the Board are confident of raising sufficient capital to fund the short term exploration and 
feasibility programs as well as fund the working capital requirements of the Group.
Material accounting policies adopted in the presentation of these financial statements are presented below:
(b)
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue 
are net of returns, allowances and amounts collectable on behalf of third parties.
Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis and is recognised as it accrues.
(c)
Income Tax
The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current  period’s taxable income 
based  on  the  national  income  tax  rate  for  each  jurisdiction  adjusted  by  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and 
liabilities  attributable  to  the  temporary  differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.
21
Annual Financial  
Statements
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Income tax (continued)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary timing differences at the tax rates expected to 
apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which  are enacted or 
substantially  enacted  for  each  jurisdiction.  The  relevant  tax  rates  are  applied  to  the  cumulative  amounts  of 
deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is made 
for certain temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability. No deferred tax 
asset or liability is recognised in relation to those timing differences if they arose in a transaction, other than a 
business combination, that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit 
or loss.
Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  deductible  temporary  differences  and  unused  tax  losses  only  if  it  is 
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount 
and tax bases of investments in controlled entities where the parent is able to control the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and 
liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net 
basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current  and  deferred  tax  balances  attributable  to  amounts  recognised  directly  in  equity  are  also  recognised 
directly in equity.
Amounts receivable from the Australian Tax Office in respect of research and development tax concession claims 
are recognised as a tax benefit in the year in which the claim is lodged with the Australian Tax Office.
(d)
Other Taxes
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
o  when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, 
in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense 
item as applicable; and
o
receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables 
or payables in the statement of financial position.
(e)
Financing Costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred and included in net financing costs.
(f)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand. Cash 
equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, 
cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  as  defined  above,  net  of  outstanding  bank 
overdrafts.
(g)
Trade and Other Receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30–90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount 
less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An allowance for doubtful debts is made when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect the debts. Bad debts are written off when identified.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(h)
Property, plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. Such cost includes the cost of replacing parts that are eligible for capitalisation when the cost of replacing 
the parts is incurred. Similarly, when each major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying 
amount of the asset as a replacement only if it is eligible for capitalisation. The assets' residual values, useful lives 
and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis or written down value over the estimated useful life of the 
assets as follows:
(i) Impairment
Office & computer equipment
Fixtures and fittings
Plant and equipment
Motor Vehicles
25%-50% straight line
33% written down value
33% written down value
33% written down value
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date, with 
recoverable amount being estimated when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired. This assessment for impairment is discussed further in note 1(j).
(ii) De-recognition and Disposal
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no further future economic 
benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated 
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit 
or loss in the year the asset is de-recognised.
(i)
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure
Exploration and evaluation costs are written off in the year they are incurred, apart from acquisition costs and 
those costs that are incurred on an area of interest that contains a JORC reserve.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to specific areas of interest are recognised as an 
exploration  and  evaluation  asset  in  the  year  in  which  they  are  incurred  where  the  following  conditions  are 
satisfied:
(i)
the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
(ii)    at least one of the following conditions is also met:
(a)
(b)
the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful 
development and exploration of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; or
exploration  and  evaluation  activities  in  the  area  of  interest  have  not  at  the  reporting  date 
reached  a  stage  which  permits  a  reasonable  assessment  of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of 
economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, 
the area of interest are continuing.
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  initially  measured  at  cost  and  include  acquisition  of  rights  to  explore, 
studies, exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling and associated activities and an allocation of depreciation 
and amortisation of assets used in exploration and evaluation activities. General and administrative costs are 
only  included  in  the  measurement  of  exploration  and  evaluation  costs  where  they  are  related  directly  to 
operational activities in a particular area of interest.

Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure (continued)
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the 
carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of the exploration and evaluation asset (for the cash generating unit(s) to which it has been allocated 
being no larger than the relevant area of interest) is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss 
(if any). Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the 
asset in previous years.
Where a decision has been made to proceed with development in respect of a particular area of interest, the 
relevant  exploration  and  evaluation  asset  is  tested  for  impairment  and  the  balance  is  then  reclassified  to 
development.
(j)
Impairment of Assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate 
of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell 
and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows 
that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset's value in use cannot 
be estimated to be close to its fair value. In such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash-
generating unit to which it belongs. When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable  amount,  the  asset  or  cash-generating  unit  is  considered  impaired  and  is  written  down  to  its 
recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. Impairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognised in those expense categories consistent 
with  the  function  of  the  impaired  asset  unless  the  asset  is  carried  at  re-valued  amount  (in  which  case  the 
impairment loss is treated as a re-valuation decrease).
An  assessment  is  also  made  at  each  reporting  date  as  to  whether  there  is  any  indication  that  previously 
recognised  impairment  losses  may  no  longer  exist  or  may  have  decreased.  If  such  indication  exists,  the 
recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was 
recognised.  If  that  is  the  case  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  is  increased  to  its  recoverable  amount.  That 
increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss 
unless the asset is carried at the re-valued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a re-valuation increase.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying 
amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
(k)
Trade and Other Payables
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised costs and represent liabilities for goods and services 
provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes 
obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services.

(l)
Interest Bearing Liabilities
All  loans  and  borrowings  are  initially  recognised  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  less  directly 
attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are  subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using  the  effective  interest  method.  Gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  when  the  liabilities  are 
derecognised.
(m)
Share Based Payments
Equity Settled Transactions:
The Group provides benefits to employees (including senior executives) of the  Group in the form of Options, 
whereby employees render services in exchange for Options (equity-settled transactions).
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the 
equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of the Options is determined by using an 
appropriate valuation model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions 
linked to the price of the underlying Shares to which the Option relates (market conditions) if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the 
period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant 
employees become fully entitled to the Option (the vesting period).
The  cumulative  expense  recognised  for  equity-settled  transactions  at  each  reporting  date  until  vesting  date 
reflects:
(i) 
(ii)
the extent to which the vesting period has expired; and 
the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these 
conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date. The income statement charge or credit for 
a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No  expense  is  recognised  for  Options  that  do  not  ultimately  vest,  except  for  Options  where  vesting  is  only 
conditional upon a market condition.
If the terms of an Option are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been 
modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair  value of the 
Option, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, as measured at the date of modification.
If an Option is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled 
Option and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled Option and new 
awards are treated as if they were a modification of the Option, as described in the previous paragraph.
(n)  Share Capital
Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of Shares pursuant to the Offer 
or Options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds of issue.

Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
(o)  Basis of consolidation
The financial statements consolidate those of Dacian Gold Limited and all of its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2016.  
The parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the 
subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary.  All subsidiaries have 
a reporting date of 30 June.
All transactions and balances between controlled entities are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised 
gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions.  Where unrealised losses on intra-group asset sales are 
reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a group perspective.  Amounts 
reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency 
with accounting policies adopted by the Company.
Profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  income  of  subsidiaries  acquired  or  disposed  of  during  the  year  are 
recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, represent the portion of a subsidiaries profit or loss and 
net  assets  that  is  not  held  by  the  Company.    The  company  attributes  total  comprehensive  income  or  loss  of 
subsidiaries  between  the  owners  of  the  parent  and  the  non-controlling  interests  based  on  their  respective 
ownership interests.
(p)  Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group and that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances.
Accounting for capitalised mineral exploration and evaluation expenditure
The  Group’s  accounting  policy  is  stated  at  1(i).    A  regular  review  is  undertaken  of  each  area  of  interest  to 
determine the reasonableness of the continuing carrying forward of costs in relation to that area of interest.
Mine restoration provisions estimates
The calculation of rehabilitation and closure provisions (and corresponding capitalised closure cost assets where 
necessary) rely on estimates of costs required to rehabilitate and restore disturbed land to its original condition. 
These estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted in order to ensure that the most up to date data is used to 
calculate these balances.
Significant  judgement  is  required  in  determining  the  provision  for  mine  rehabilitation  as  there  are  many 
transactions and other factors that will affect the ultimate costs required to rehabilitate the mine site. Factors 
that  will  affect  this  liability  include  future  development,  changes  in  technology,  price  increases,  changes  in 
interest rates and changes in legislation.
Currently the Group bases its mine restoration provision on information provided by the Departments of Mines 
and Petroleum.
Measurement of share based payments
The Group records charges for share based payments. For option based share based payments, management 
estimate certain factors used in the option pricing model. These factors include volatility and exercise date of 
options. If these estimates vary the share based payment expense would have been different.

(q)  Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In  the  financial  year  ended  30  June  2016,  the  Group  has reviewed  all  of  the  new  and revised  Standards  and 
Interpretations issued by the AASB that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2015. It has been determined by the  Group  that, there is no impact, material or 
otherwise,  of  the  new  and  revised  standards  and  interpretations  on  its  business  and  therefore  no  change  is 
necessary to Group accounting policies.
The  Group  has  also  reviewed  all  new  Standards  and  Interpretations  that  have  been  issued  but  are  not  yet 
effective for the financial year ended 30 June 2016.  As a result of this review the Directors have determined that 
there is no impact, material or otherwise, of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations on its business 
and, therefore, no change necessary to Group accounting policies.
Note 2  Segment Information
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the 
Board of Directors in assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources.
Reportable segments disclosed are based on aggregating operating segments, where the segments have similar 
characteristics.  The  Group’s  sole  activity  is  mineral  exploration  wholly  within  Australia,  therefore  it  has 
aggregated all operating segments into the one reportable segment being mineral exploration.
The reportable segment is represented by the primary statements forming these financial statements.

Dacian Gold Limited Employee Option Plan
The  establishment  of  the  Dacian  Gold  Limited  Employee  Option  Plan  (‘the  Plan”)  was  last  approved  by  a 
resolution of the shareholders of the Company on 16 November 2015. All eligible Directors, executive officers 
and employees of Dacian Gold Limited who have been continuously employed by the Company are eligible to 
participate in the Plan.
The Plan allows the Company to issue free options to eligible persons. The options can be granted free of charge 
and  are  exercisable  at  a  fixed  price  in  accordance  with  the  Plan.  Options  issued  under  the  Plan  have  vesting 
periods prior to exercise, except under certain circumstances whereby options may be capable of exercise prior 
to the expiry of the vesting period.
During the financial year ended 30 June 2016, 3,950,0000 (30 June 2015: 3,000,000) options over unissued shares 
were issued to a  Director and  employees, pursuant  to the terms of the Dacian Gold Limited  Employee Share 
Option Plan.

Note 19 Financial Instruments
Credit risk
The  Group  has  exposure to a variety of risks arising from  its use of financial  instruments. This note presents 
information about the Group’s exposure to the specific risks, and the policies and processes for measuring and 
managing those risks. The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the risk management framework 
and has adopted a Risk Management Policy.   
 
(a) 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from transactions with customers and investments. 
 
Trade and other receivables 
The nature of the business activity of the Group does not result in trading receivables. The receivables that the 
Company  does  experience  through  it’s  normal  course  of  business  are  short  term  and  the  most  significant 
recurring by quantity is receivable from the Australian Taxation Office, the risk of non-recovery of receivables 
from this source is considered to be negligible. 
 
Cash deposits 
The Directors believe any risk associated with the use of predominantly only one bank is addressed through the 
use of at least an A-rated bank as a primary banker and by the holding of a portion of funds on deposit with 
alternative A-rated institutions. Except for this matter the Group currently has no significant concentrations of 
credit risk.
Liquidity risk
The Directors do not consider that the Group’s financial assets are subject to anything more than a negligible 
level of credit risk, and as such no disclosures are made. 
 
(b) 
Liquidity risk  is the risk  that the  Group  will not  be able to  meet  its  financial obligations as they fall due. The 
Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity 
to  meet  its  liabilities  when  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions,  without  incurring  unacceptable 
losses or risking damage to the Company’s reputation.
The  Group  manages  its  liquidity  risk  by  monitoring  its  cash  reserves  and  forecast  spending.  Management  is 
cognisant  of  the  future  demands  for  liquid  finance  resources  to  finance  the  Group’s  current  and  future 
operations, and consideration is given to the liquid assets available to the Group before commitment is made to 
future expenditure or investment.

(c)  Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity 
prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
any return.
Interest rate risk 
The Group has significant cash assets which may be susceptible to fluctuations in changes in interest rates. Whilst 
the  Company  requires  the  cash  assets  to  be  sufficiently  liquid  to  cover  any  planned  or  unforeseen  future 
expenditure,  which  prevents  the  cash  assets  being  committed  to  long  term  fixed  interest  arrangements;  the 
Group does mitigate potential interest rate risk by entering into short to medium term fixed interest investments.
The Group does not have any direct contact with foreign exchange or equity risks other than their effect on the 
general economy.

2016, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for 
the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information and the directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity 
comprising the Company and the entities it controlled at year’s end or from time to time 
during the financial year.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report 
that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Corporations Act 2001. The Directors’ responsibility also includes such internal control as 
the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that 
gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. The Directors also state, in the notes to the financial report, in accordance with 
Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, the financial 
statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We

require us to comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial report is 
free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
report, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the 
Company’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit 
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion.

In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001.
