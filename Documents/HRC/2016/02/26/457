<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 26/32, decided to establish a new 
</p>
<p>mandate on capacity-building and technical cooperation with C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in the field of 
</p>
<p>human rights, to follow on from the previous mandate, for a period of one year, renewable, 
</p>
<p>from the twenty-sixth to the twenty-ninth sessions of the Council. In the same resolution, 
</p>
<p>the Council requested the Independent Expert to submit a report to the Council at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>2. Owing to the delay in the appointment of the mandate holder and, consequently, the 
</p>
<p>conduct of his first visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Independent Expert will present an oral report 
</p>
<p>to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session and submit to it a written report at 
</p>
<p>its twenty-ninth.  
</p>
<p>    
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> <i>*</i> Late submission.
