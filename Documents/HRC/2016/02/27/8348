</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Peace 
Agreements in 1991, which set in motion the peace process in Cambodia. The mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur has its origins in these Agreements. It is commendable that 
Cambodia has achieved significant milestones in a number of areas. However, it still has a 
long way to go to fulfil its obligations under international human rights treaties ratified by 
the country. The international community should continue assisting Cambodia in its efforts 
to establish the rule of law and reconstruct State institutions.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned by the state of various human 
rights issues, and especially freedom of expression and land and housing rights. He is of the 
view that the peaceful expression of opinion should not be dealt with under the Penal Code 
as is currently the case with crimes such as defamation and disinformation. He is also 
concerned about the narrowing of space for people, including those belonging to different 
political parties, to express their views peacefully and without fear. He is particularly 
concerned in this regard by the charges of incitement, defamation and dissemination of 
information that have been brought against human rights defenders, land rights activists 
and individuals of communities defending their land and housing rights in the face of 
eviction. 
</p>
<p> Cambodia has enacted a number of laws designed to protect human rights, but it is 
lagging behind in their implementation. Many of the laws passed by Parliament and its own 
internal rules fall short of the standards required by the principle of the rule of law. What 
prevails in Cambodia in a number of areas is rule by law rather than rule of law. 
</p>
<p> The present report focuses on an assessment of the independence and capacity of 
Parliament as one of the State institutions responsible for upholding people&#8217;s rights. 
Parliament in Cambodia has not been able to safeguard the freedom of speech of some of 
</p>

<p>its own members. Furthermore, the doctrine of the separation of powers is weak and 
Parliament has been regarded as having limited capacity to act as an effective check on the 
executive. 
</p>
<p> Parliament is the soul of democracy and is responsible for adopting laws required to 
protect human rights. With this in mind, the Special Rapporteur makes a series of 
recommendations in the present report in a constructive manner and hopes that the 
Government, Parliament and other stakeholders will implement them.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the third report of the present Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Cambodia, submitted in accordance with resolution 15/20 of the Human Rights 
Council.  
</p>
<p>2. What has been achieved in Cambodia in a number of areas since the conclusion of 
the Agreement on a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict (the Paris 
Peace Agreements) is commendable. The conflict was resolved, the transitional period was 
managed reasonably well, the new democratic Constitution was adopted in 1993 and 
periodic elections have taken place since then. There has been steady economic growth and 
political stability in recent years which has enabled many people to come out of poverty, at 
least in urban areas.  
</p>
<p>3. The Paris Peace Agreements established the rule of law, human rights and 
democracy as major pillars of the new political architecture for the country. Thus, the peace 
process cannot be regarded as complete until the democratic institutions created under the 
Constitution are able to work effectively and independently. The international community 
has a particular stake and a responsibility in this regard. It is in this context that the 
Government agreed to the proposal of the Special Rapporteur that he carry out a systematic 
assessment of the State institutions with a view to exploring the ways and means of 
strengthening their capacity and independence in upholding people&#8217;s rights. Accordingly, 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous report (A/HRC/15/46) was focused on the judiciary, and 
the present report is focused on Parliament. The Special Rapporteur centred his two 
missions to the country in 2011 mainly on examining the capacity of Parliament to uphold 
people&#8217;s rights and democratic norms.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that the Government has responded 
positively to accelerate its legislative programme designed to implement, inter alia, the key 
recommendations of the Special Rapporteur relating to the judiciary. The Government has 
indicated that the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in his previous report 
are being implemented or in the process of planning for implementation. The Special 
Rapporteur is, for example, encouraged by indications that the long-delayed organic laws 
on the judiciary are finally moving forward. It is noteworthy that an inter-ministerial 
working group has been set up in this regard. However, the Government has not responded 
to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s request to commit itself to a time frame or a concrete plan of 
action to implement his key recommendations.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Working methodology and approach 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur undertook two missions to 
Cambodia in 2011, from 15 to 24 February and from 30 May to 4 June. He is grateful to the 
Government for extending its cooperation during his missions and demonstrating its 
willingness to work with him in a constructive manner. During his missions, the Special 
Rapporteur focused his work on Parliament. The Special Rapporteur had the privilege to 
meet with Prime Minister Hun Sen, the President of the National Assembly, Heng Samrin, 
Deputy Prime Minister Sok An and other senior members of the Government, as well as 
members of both the Senate and the National Assembly belonging to various political </p>


<p>parties.1 He was encouraged by their response to some of the issues that he raised. The 
Special Rapporteur was made aware of the work carried out by both houses of Parliament 
in holding the executive to account and to protect and promote human rights in the country. 
He appreciates some of the new laws enacted by Parliament to this effect. The Special 
Rapporteur has identified a number of shortcomings in the functioning of Parliament and 
has made recommendations to address them in the concluding section of this report.  
</p>
<p>6. Separately, the Special Rapporteur had meetings with the United Nations Country 
Team and its members, donor organizations, and diplomats, and visited the Extraordinary 
Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, where he met with the President and Vice President 
of the Court&#8217;s judicial plenary shortly before the close of its seventh session. He also met 
with victims of human rights violations, including indigenous groups and communities 
affected by land evictions in the recent past and an individual who had been charged with 
defamation, and interacted with representatives of trade unions; civil society organizations 
working in the area of human rights, such as land rights and freedom of expression, and on 
parliamentary reform; and private citizens. He visited sites in Kampong Chhnang, Boeung 
Kok Lake and Khan Sen Sok where families are facing the threat of eviction or have been 
forcibly removed.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Recent developments in human rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. While the general situation of human rights has progressed in some areas, it has not 
improved much in others. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Land and housing rights 
</b></p>
<p>8. Disputes linked to land continue to have an impact on the lives of many people in 
the country, especially those who are poor, marginalized and left without an effective 
mechanism to address their grievances. While the Government is developing a number of 
land management, housing and relocation policies, progress has been slow. Unresolved 
land disputes, many of them marred by corruption, have led to ongoing clashes among the 
Government, civil society and communities under threat of forced eviction and have been 
the cause of several outbreaks of violence in recent months.   
</p>
<p>9. The judiciary has not been effective in upholding the rights of many people affected 
by a lack of land title. The existing mechanisms for land disputes currently in place, such as 
the cadastral commissions and the National Authority for Land Dispute Resolution, are 
reportedly lacking in resources and not effective in upholding the rights of small 
landholders, and some communities report that they favour non-judicial mechanisms due to 
a lack of faith in the courts and the existing land-dispute systems currently in place. During 
the reporting period, numerous land disputes escalated and a large number of people were 
evicted from their land or were faced with the threat of forced eviction, after having 
exhausted legal remedies to peacefully settle the dispute or obtain a fair settlement. 
</p>
<p>10. At least 3,000 to 4,000 families living in the Boeung Kok Lake area have been 
evicted or face the threat of forced eviction from their homes since the Government granted 
a 99-year lease to Shukaku, Inc. for development of the land. Intimidation and threats were 
used against villagers to coerce them into accepting inadequate compensation or 
resettlement outside Phnom Penh, despite many villagers having strong claims to formal 
</p>
<p>  
 1  The Special Rapporteur has unfortunately not had the opportunity to meet with the Minister of Justice 
</p>
<p>thus far.  </p>


<p>land title under articles 30 and 31 of the 2001 Land Law. The security forces have also used 
intimidation and violence against protesters. Since August 2008, Shukaku began filling the 
lake with sand and many families have moved from the site, accepting an inadequate 
package of compensation in the face of the threat of an eventual forced eviction. However, 
it is estimated that 1,500 families still remain under threat of forced eviction. While some 
dialogue has taken place between affected communities who remain in the Boeung Kok 
Lake area and the Municipality of Phnom Penh, much remains to be achieved in terms of 
compensation and solutions for onsite upgrading. 
</p>
<p>11. With the help of the international community, the Government has embarked on an 
ambitious land-titling programme in the country which, however, often lacks transparency 
regarding economic land concessions. Land grabbing by the rich and powerful has at times 
overshadowed the progress made in land titling. While some of the economic and social 
land concessions have been for bona fide public purposes, the same cannot be said of some 
other such concessions.  
</p>
<p>12. Furthermore, individuals advocating for the rights of their communities to land have 
often been subjected to arbitrary arrest or unfounded charges. A lack of dialogue and 
consultation with potentially affected communities before the granting of economic land 
concessions is an unfortunate pattern that the Special Rapporteur has observed, as is the 
failure to conduct an environmental impact assessment. The Special Rapporteur had 
expressed hope in his report of last year that the Government would create a mechanism in 
conjunction with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in an attempt to address the 
growing number of land disputes (A/HRC/15/46, para. 32), and he was encouraged by the 
announcement made by the Chair of the Cambodian Human Rights Committee to create 
such a mechanism in May 2011.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur has observed a trend characterized by the convergence of 
the State apparatus with private business interests. In February 2011, the Special 
Rapporteur visited the Kampong Chhnang province and witnessed for himself the situation 
of some villagers from Lorpeang village, Taches commune, Kampong Tralach district who 
had been evicted from their land in early 2008 without compensation, even though a case 
concerning the situation of those and other villagers was pending in the district cadastral 
commission, and had been sent to the National Authority for Land Dispute Resolution. 
Despite the communities&#8217; claim to it, their land was taken over by KDC International, a 
company run by the wife of a Government Minister. Eight villagers, including a village 
chief and a staff member of an NGO who assisted the affected villagers, were charged with 
property infringement, incitement, and dissemination of disinformation (more details in 
para. 21 below).  
</p>
<p>14. In June 2011, the Special Rapporteur met with three families who were forcibly 
evicted from their homes in Sangkath Phnom Penh Thmey commune, Russei Keo district 
(now Sen Sok district), despite the lack of an official decision on the land in question that 
had been pending since 1992. The families reportedly bought the land from a military 
officer in 1992 (they have the purchase document, but attempts to secure a land title from 
the municipality have been unsuccessful). Since September 2003, there had reportedly been 
multiple attempts to seize the land and evict the families, with little or no compensation, 
against which the families protested. The case was examined first by the municipal court, 
and then sent to the municipal cadastral commission in 2004, and had remained pending 
and unresolved for several years.  
</p>
<p>15. In June 2011, a violent clash occurred between authorities of Kampong Speu 
province and villagers of Oudong district over a disputed 65-hectare plot of land currently 
used for rice production, and the intended destruction of three houses on the land used by 
five families. Four members of the gendarmerie and at least six villagers reported injuries. 
The clash was the culmination of a long-standing dispute over the parcel of land, on which </p>


<p>88 families claim to have lived since the early 1980s. The dispute started after military 
officials allegedly sold the land to the Taiwanese Meng Keth Company (owned by a 
Taiwanese businessman who had become a naturalized Cambodian citizen), which now 
claims that it owns the land; the villagers deny the sale. The dispute had been pending in 
the court system since 2004, and in December 2009, the Supreme Court ruled against the 
villagers. The clash came after prosecutor Kuth Sopheang led a force of hundreds of armed 
police and military police in an attempt to enforce the Supreme Court&#8217;s verdict.   
</p>
<p>16. These are some of the representative examples of problems relating to land rights in 
the country. Although the Government and local authorities have on a number of occasions, 
when acquiring land for public purposes, offered a reasonable package to residents in 
different sites to relocate elsewhere, there are still far too many cases where the 
Government has taken a heavy-handed approach towards the residents in disputed land 
areas.  
</p>
<p>17. In early 2010, the Council on Land Policy released a draft housing policy, which 
recognizes the right to adequate housing; the policy, however, is still pending. In May 
2010, the Government adopted a circular relating to illegal temporary settlements in urban 
areas, which offers some solutions with regard to onsite upgrading and relocation. The 
circular, however, does not provide for a system by which the legality of urban settlements 
is determined. The Special Rapporteur hopes that a moratorium on eviction for dwellers in 
informal settlements will be respected until the Government can further develop its land-
dispute capacity, as recommended by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 12/25, 
which urged the Government to enhance its efforts to resolve equitably and expeditiously 
land ownership issues in a fair and open manner, in accordance with the 2001 Land Law, 
by strengthening the implementation of the law through the development of national 
guidelines to clarify relevant procedures. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
redouble efforts to use both the existing and emerging domestic legal framework to resolve 
disputes, rather than allow land conflicts to erupt into violence, which has been escalating 
during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>18. The state of the right to freedom of expression and opinion in Cambodia remains a 
matter of concern. There has been a disproportionate use of defamation and disinformation 
provisions in the law by the Government against journalists, human rights defenders and 
political leaders, who seem to be resorting to self-censorship because of the fear of such 
possible charges against them.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur noted that provisions in many laws in Cambodia, including 
even the new Penal Code, go beyond international standards in curtailing people&#8217;s 
freedoms, as do the courts&#8217; application and interpretation of such laws. The courts do not 
demonstrate sufficient understanding of the evolving international practice and 
jurisprudence and have a tendency to interpret the law literally rather than in spirit. For 
instance, in August 2010 Leang Sokchoun, a staff member working for the Cambodian 
League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights (LICADHO), and two others, 
Tach Vannak and Tach Le, were sentenced to two years in prison and a fine of two million 
riel, and another defendant, Tach Khong Phoung, was tried in absentia and sentenced to 
three years&#8217; imprisonment. They had been accused of distributing anti-government leaflets 
in Takeo province on 4 January 2010. The trial on 30 August was marked by a number of 
deficiencies, indicating that the defendants did not enjoy a fair trial. The evidence presented 
and the situation around this case suggested that elements for conviction under article 62 of 
the Penal Code for the crime of disinformation had not been not satisfied, as the alleged </p>


<p>distribution of the leaflets did not disturb the peace and it seems that no public-order issues 
arose after the leaflets were found.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers jointly sent an urgent appeal 
to the Government of Cambodia on 14 September 2010 on this case. The Special 
Rapporteurs expressed concern that the situation of the four nationals might constitute a 
violation of the right to freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. They also 
expressed concern that the conviction of one of the four nationals, who is a human rights 
defender, on the basis of alleged questionable evidence might have an adverse impact on 
the working climate of human rights defenders in the country. The Special Rapporteurs 
sought clarification on the investigation, and judicial and other inquiries related to the 
cases, the measures that were in place to guarantee fair trial, and how the sanction against 
the defendants with respect to the alleged distribution of fliers constituted a permissible 
restriction on the right of freedom of expression. At the time of writing, no response has 
been received from the Government.  
</p>
<p>21. Similarly, on 3 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Cambodia, the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders jointly 
sent an allegation letter to the Government of Cambodia questioning the legal basis of the 
case of Sam Chankea and Reach Seima, convicted of disinformation and defamation under 
article 305 of the new Penal Code, for allegedly pointing out in a radio interview the 
unresolved legal status of an ongoing land dispute and the unlawful act by the company 
involved, KDC International, of bringing machinery to work on the land (see background 
information in para. 13 above). Mr. Chankea is a local coordinator of the human rights 
organization Adhoc. His comments in the broadcast of Radio Free Asia on 26 December 
2009 were that &#8220;what the company has done violates the law because the court has yet to 
rule on the merits of the case. Therefore the company should suspend the activity and await 
the court decision&#8221;. The company claimed that the comments were not true and upon 
receiving that complaint, the public prosecutor brought a charge of defamation against the 
Adhoc coordinator. When the case went to the court, the trial had a number of shortcomings 
which suggested that it did not meet the standards of a fair trial. Mr. Chankea was 
sentenced to pay 4 million riel in fines and compensation or face three months&#8217; 
imprisonment. Mr. Seima was sentenced to pay 10 million riel in fines and compensation or 
face six months in jail. The use of criminal defamation proceedings against human rights 
workers promoting a fair resolution of a land dispute is a matter of serious concern. At the 
time of writing, no response has been received from the Government.  
</p>
<p>22. Another case in point is that of Seng Kunnaka, a staff member of the World Food 
Programme, who was convicted of incitement to commit a felony by Phnom Penh 
Municipal Court on 19 December 2010, and was sentenced to six months&#8217; imprisonment 
and a fine of 1 million riel. On 17 December 2010, Mr. Kunnaka was arrested and taken 
into custody in Russei Keo district for questioning for 48 hours. On 19 December 2010, he 
was tried by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court under the new Penal Code and convicted for 
printing information materials from an Internet website and sharing them with two 
colleagues in his workplace. The materials appear to include caricatures of political leaders, 
which were called &#8220;traitors&#8221;. Observers were not authorized to attend the trial proceedings, 
which were held in camera. The trial took place two days after his arrest and on a Sunday, 
when courts are normally closed other than for exceptional cases. It looked as if the 
prosecutors did not have time to properly investigate the case and the Court was in rush to 
deliver a verdict without allowing for a proper trial. An urgent appeal was jointly sent by 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, the Special </p>


<p>Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 22 March 2011, seeking clarifications on the 
legal basis of the conviction of Mr. Kunnaka. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern 
that article 495 of the new Penal Code may have been interpreted to curtail the 
constitutional exercise of freedom of opinion, expression and information, rather than to 
protect the public from the commission of any crime. At the time of writing, no response 
has been received by the Government.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur observed that courts implement laws that do not conform to 
the nature and scope of the rule of law in the first place and thus risk being used by the 
executive for political purposes. An example of this is the 10-year jail sentence imposed on 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy in absentia after he had been found guilty of a falsification of 
public documents and disinformation, a charge that was allegedly politically motivated. The 
Special Rapporteur had hoped that the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court would be 
more objective during the appeal of the opposition leader&#8217;s case. Regrettably, the Supreme 
Court upheld in March 2011 the verdict of the Court of Appeal, which had upheld the 
verdict of the court of first instance. The allegation made by the Government was that Mr. 
Rainsy had manipulated a map to show that Viet Nam had encroached on the territory of 
Cambodia. In any properly functioning democracy, such political matters would be debated 
in the parliament and become a matter of public debate rather than the subject of a criminal 
case before courts. Scrutinizing the activities of the Government and requiring the 
Government to respond to any criticisms of its policy decisions is one of the basic functions 
of the leaders of opposition parties and they should not be subjected to criminal 
proceedings for discharging their responsibilities in a peaceful manner.  
</p>
<p>24. On 24 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Prime Minister and 
provided him with a briefing note outlining the international human rights perspective on 
the use of defamation proceedings and disinformation charges. The Special Rapporteur 
highlighted how important it was for the protection of democratic space for public debate 
that public authorities and politicians, as well as members of the media and the public who 
participate in these debates, tolerate dissenting views and do not regard them as personal 
attacks. The Special Rapporteur referred to a worrying trend of restrictions on freedom of 
expression in the form of criminal defamation, disinformation and incitement suits that had 
resulted in prison terms for individuals, including journalists, NGO workers and 
parliamentarians, who had no intention of affecting national security. The Special 
Rapporteur has regularly noted that, in defamation cases, the complainant appears not to 
have proven that his or her reputation has been damaged (one of the elements of the crime 
of defamation). With regard to disinformation cases, the Special Rapporteur has noted that 
there was often no proof tendered to the court that the information in question endangered 
national security (an element of the crime of disinformation).  
</p>
<p><b> C. Draft law on non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>25. In September 2008, during the fourth legislature (2008-2012), the Government 
decided to adopt a law regulating the activities of non-governmental organizations and 
associations. On 15 December 2010, the Ministry of the Interior publicly released the first 
draft of the law and invited NGOs and other stakeholders to participate in a first public 
consultation on the draft on 10 January 2011. The role of civil society actors in the political 
and economic development of Cambodia has been acknowledged by the Prime Minister in 
his speeches of 24 November 2009 and 6 June 2011, and by other senior members of the 
Government. Many of the civil society organizations have been playing a complementary 
role to that of the State in helping or delivering key social services in the areas of education, 
health, rural development, sanitation, social welfare and the protection of natural resources 
and the environment.  </p>


<p>26. The decision to adopt a law to regulate NGOs and associations is a critical initiative 
which requires careful attention, given its long-term implications for the development of 
Cambodian society - and in turn the country - itself. In the past two years, human rights 
groups and other NGOs working to promote and protect the land and housing rights of the 
poorest, sustainable development, or the constitutional rights to freedom of expression, 
assembly and the press have been increasingly subjected to various forms of harassment 
and intimidation, including restrictions on movement and freedom of assembly, verbal 
threats, threats of legal action and, in some cases, criminal proceedings. Their efforts to 
educate and advise local communities about their legal rights and how to exercise them 
peacefully, through existing institutions, have increasingly been labelled as &#8220;incitement&#8221; 
and have been associated with the political opposition.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the consultations on the draft law on 
NGOs carried out by the Ministry of Interior with the concerned parties, and expressed 
hope that this good practice will be replicated in other areas. However, for consultations to 
be meaningful, the final draft of this law should incorporate appropriate suggestions made 
during the consultations, so that the laws enacted will enable the concerned associations to 
strengthen their activities rather than restrict them. 
</p>
<p>28. At the time of writing, several aspects in the new draft still required careful 
attention; also, there should be a wider consultation in order to address the issues of 
concern raised by the NGOs themselves. An allegation letter, jointly sent on 13 May 2011 
by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, outlines concerns that the 
provisions contained in the second draft of the law on associations and non-governmental 
organizations (draft NGO Law) of Cambodia may hamper the legitimate work of NGOs in 
the promotion of human rights. The Special Rapporteurs pointed out that the registration 
process should be expeditious, easily accessible and inexpensive and the registering bodies 
independent of the Government. In this regard, clear procedures and timelines for review of 
applications should be established. The Government should guarantee the right of an 
association to appeal against any refusal of registration, and that there be effective and 
prompt recourse against any rejection of application, and independent judicial review 
regarding the decisions of the registering authority. The Government should also not 
criminalize or impose criminal penalties for activities in defence of human rights and for 
participating in unregistered entities.  
</p>
<p>29. An open, mutually respectful and constructive dialogue is necessary to jointly 
develop an NGO law that would further promote the development of civil society in 
Cambodia. While there is growing cooperation, there remain challenges, some of which 
could be resolved through increased contact and discussion.   
</p>
<p>30. In his letter of 24 August 2010 to the Prime Minister, the Special Rapporteur 
recalled the Prime Minister&#8217;s positive response to his proposal for the creation of a 
mechanism for meaningful and constructive cooperation between the Government and the 
civil society in their meeting in January 2010 and emphasized the need to work together to 
develop such a mechanism. To that effect, the Special Rapporteur forwarded a working 
draft of a proposal jointly prepared by some 300 human rights organizations in the country 
for the Prime Minister&#8217;s consideration.  
</p>
<p>31. In response, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to receive assurances from the 
Prime Minister that he had tasked relevant officials to make a thorough study of the points 
presented in September 2010. In his letter, the Prime Minister also expressed his hope that 
his colleagues and the Special Rapporteur could soon work out the way forward to address 
issues of concern. During their meeting in February 2011, the Prime Minister pointed out 
the need for participation by NGOs in such a mechanism to be truly representative and </p>


<p>inclusive of civil society. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government and civil 
society to pursue dialogue with a view to establishing a regular consultation mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Draft trade union law 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Ministry of Labour is currently drafting a trade unions law and reviewing its 
compatibility with international standards on labour and human rights. However, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned about limitations on the freedom of expression and 
assembly of trade union members. During the reporting period, trade union leaders had 
faced reprisals such as threats, charges of incitement of the commission of a crime (charges 
were subsequently dropped upon the request of the Prime Minister) and suspension from 
work. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to conduct inclusive 
consultations with the concerned parties on the draft law.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia   
</b></p>
<p>33. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia made significant 
achievements during the reporting period. Following the landmark conviction of Kaing 
Guek Eav, alias &#8220;Duch&#8221;, in July 2010, the Court has advanced its second case - against 
Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Ieng Thirith and Khieu Samphan (Case 002). The case was sent to 
trial in January 2011. An initial hearing was held in June 2011, and the trial is slated to 
begin in the latter half of 2011. At the same time, the Supreme Court Chamber of the 
tribunal has been considering the appeals in the case of Duch. The Chamber heard 
submissions from the co-prosecutors and the defence in March 2011. It is anticipated that 
the Chamber will issue its verdict in the coming months. 
</p>
<p>34. The Court&#8217;s activities in this regard continue to set an important example for the 
national sector of the administration of justice in accordance with international fair trial 
standards. In particular, the progress in Case 002 is commendable. In addition, the Court 
continues to open its doors to the Cambodian public for study tours about its work, and it 
received 32,000 visitors in 2010 alone. At the same time, the Victims Support Section 
continues to hold regional public forums throughout Cambodia, with forums being held in 
Battambang, Kampot and Kampong Chhnang during the reporting period. At the time of 
writing, Cases 003 and 004 remained uncertain.  
</p>
<p>35. In December 2010, the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Prime Minister on the 
importance of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia setting an example to 
the international community of the country&#8217;s commitment to ensuring accountability for 
past atrocities, to protecting human rights, and to upholding the independence of the 
judiciary and the rule of law. He reiterated his hopes that the trials at the Extraordinary 
Chambers would have a positive impact on strengthening the independence of the judiciary, 
and serve as a catalyst for the Government to address impunity and accelerate its legal and 
judicial reforms.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The role and effectiveness of Parliament in protecting human 
rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General structure of Parliament 
</b></p>
<p>36. Cambodia has a bicameral parliament consisting of the Senate and the National 
Assembly. There are 123 seats in the National Assembly and 61 in the Senate. The term of </p>


<p>the National Assembly is five years and ends on the day when the new National Assembly 
takes office. The members of the National Assembly are elected for 21 multi-member 
constituencies corresponding to the country&#8217;s provinces, using a proportional representation 
system. 
</p>
<p>37. The term of the Senate is six years. Of the 61 members of the Senate, 57 are elected 
by Commune/Sangkat Councillors while two others are elected by the National Assembly. 
The remaining two are appointed by the King. Both of these houses have a commission 
structure and each of them has nine commissions. All of these commissions are chaired by 
members of the ruling Cambodian People&#8217;s Party. 
</p>
<p>38. The Cambodian Parliament has faced the same institutional and structural upheavals 
faced by the country as a whole in the last 40 or so years. Like the judiciary, Parliament and 
parliamentary culture had to be rebuilt from scratch following the systematic destruction of 
all democratic institutions during the Khmer Rouge period. The structure of Parliament and 
its physical facilities are now as good as any in a developing country and in many respects 
well above the average. Similar to many other parliaments, the Cambodian Parliament has 
oversight, legislative and representative functions.   
</p>
<p>39. Parliamentary activities as a whole &#8211; from legislating to overseeing the executive &#8211; 
cover the entire spectrum of human rights. Such activities have a direct impact on the 
ability of the people to enjoy their rights. With a view to focusing on human rights issues, 
the National Assembly and the Senate have each established a Commission for this 
purpose. The Commission on Human Rights of the Senate has received more than 300 
complaints of human rights violations from members of the general public; in more than 
100 of those cases it has received responses from relevant Government departments. The 
Commission has carried out investigations in about 40 cases in recent years. The Human 
Rights Commission of the National Assembly received a total of 1,158 complaints from 
members of the public between 2006 and 2010, the vast majority of them related to land 
disputes. Upon receiving these complaints, the Commission has taken action on a good 
number of them and written to relevant Government departments. The total number of 
responses received between 2006 and 2010 was about 250. The Commission has also 
examined various draft laws concerning the protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>40. While the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the progress made by the country 
in developing parliamentary practices within a relatively short period of time, there remain 
a number of shortcomings in the workings of Parliament in general and the National 
Assembly in particular.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Effectiveness of the Senate 
</b></p>
<p>41. Generally speaking, the parliamentary practices in the Senate are more advanced and 
more in tune with the principles of democracy and transparency. There is a great deal the 
National Assembly could learn from the practices of the Senate. The various commissions 
of the Senate, including the Commission on Human Rights, have been able to discharge 
their responsibilities more effectively. Altogether the nine Commissions of the Senate have 
conducted 24 fact-finding missions per year on average. However, the Senate itself has 
admitted that &#8220;the time given for scrutinising legal texts is too short&#8221;. Further, the 
consultation on draft laws with concerned stakeholders &#8220;is not yet very transparent&#8221;.2  
</p>
<p>  
 2 Cambodia, Secretary-General of the Senate, &#8220;A report on the self-assessment of the Senate on the 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Cambodia after 10 years of operation and development&#8221; (Phnom Penh, 2011), p. 24. </p>


<p><b> C. Effectiveness of the National Assembly  
</b></p>
<p>42. A key function of the parliament is to make new and amend existing laws. Another 
key function is to have oversight of the executive, by monitoring its activities and holding it 
accountable for its actions in order to defend the people&#8217;s interests against possible abuse of 
power. A third function of the parliament is representation, which requires members of 
parliament to engage with their constituents in dialogue to better understand and represent 
their interests in the parliament.  
</p>
<p>43. Generally speaking, many bills are rushed through the Assembly without a proper 
debate. The tightly controlled system of adopting laws in the Assembly has meant in 
practice that amendments are rarely accepted at any stage of the process. This has 
highlighted the limited effectiveness of the Assembly in scrutinizing legislation prepared by 
the executive. While the Assembly asserted its independent role by sending the draft law on 
peaceful demonstrations back to the Council of Ministers in early 2008, other important 
laws, such as the Penal Code, the anti-corruption law and the law on expropriation were 
adopted with almost no debate, no amendments and little or no consultation, and in very 
short time frames. Furthermore, a number of pieces of legislation adopted in the recent past 
(and some regulations and subdecrees) have tended to narrow the scope of human rights. 
The ability of Parliament in Cambodia to restrain this executive tendency has been limited. 
</p>
<p>44. A key obstacle is the lack of a properly functioning parliamentary culture. The 
notions of pluralism and liberalism enshrined in the Constitution were designed to ensure 
space for all to participate in the process of democratization and nation-building. However, 
there is an absence of a culture of debate and discussion and political will to foster a climate 
that is conducive to constructive dialogue and accelerating the process of democratization 
of the society. Parliamentary practices are being developed but it seems to be taking time to 
accept the need for an effective opposition. Certain internal rules do not facilitate space for 
opposition voices. There is also a gap in knowledge and expertise among the Members of 
Parliament and professional parliamentarian staff whose qualifications and skills reflect a 
lack of fundamental legal training. This has impeded the capacity of the Members of 
Parliament to carry out their functions effectively. Overall, members of the National 
Assembly in Cambodia have not effectively used their powers of oversight to act as a check 
on the executive branch and hold the executive accountable for its actions. 
</p>
<p>45. None of the commissions in Parliament is chaired by a member of the opposition or 
a minority party. Many parliaments have the practice of having a member of the opposition 
or a minority party chair specific committees or commissions. It is an international practice 
to have equitable or proportionate representation of the opposition in such commissions or 
committees of the parliament. But this is not the case in Cambodia. Opposition or minority 
parties have a crucial role to play in holding the Government to account. They can provide 
alternative policy options for consideration by the Government and the public. For this, 
they should be guaranteed the right to place items for legislation and policy debate on the 
parliamentary agenda together with the time commensurate to this object and not be denied 
a voice to represent their constituents.  
</p>
<p>46. After the ruling Cambodian People&#8217;s Party won more than two thirds of the seats in 
the National Assembly in the last general election, held in July 2008,3 the role and work of 
the National Assembly as a proper debating chamber seems to be declining. Only 23 per 
cent of the letters from the opposition party in Parliament received a response from the 
</p>
<p>  
 3 The Cambodian People&#8217;s Party won 90 out of 123 seats in the National Assembly; the Sam Rainsy 
</p>
<p>Party 26 seats; the Human Rights Party 3 seats; the Norodom Ranariddh Party 2 seats; and the 
Funcinpec Party 2 seats. </p>


<p>Government and 90 per cent of the responses have come after more than a month. Ministers 
rarely attend the meetings in Parliament to answer questions from Members of Parliament. 
The Members of Parliament belonging to the main party in opposition and some other 
minority parties are virtually cut off from the law-making process. The Cambodian 
People&#8217;s Party, with its large majority in the National Assembly, has a tendency to ignore 
the political role of other parties. The opposition party and many other minority parties 
complain that they are treated by the ruling party as an enemy of the State rather than as 
political partners with differing views.  
</p>
<p>47. Although the Constitution requires a secret ballot for important decisions in 
Parliament, most important decisions in the National Assembly are taken on the basis of 
bloc voting and by show of hands so that the Government can identify the people voting 
against any of its motions. The individual members of Parliament might therefore lack the 
courage to vote independently or against proposals tabled by the Government.  
</p>
<p>48. When the Cambodian People&#8217;s Party won a two-thirds majority at the last general 
election, the National Assembly adopted new internal rules in September 2008 further 
narrowing the scope of effective participation in Parliament by the opposition and other 
minority parties. For instance, articles 48 and 55 of the rules require Members of 
Parliament to sit as a group of 10 and elect their own leader and deputy leader. This means 
that Members of Parliament from minority parties with fewer than 10 seats must join a 
group with representatives of other political parties.  
</p>
<p>49. Accordingly, an individual Member of Parliament cannot speak in Parliament 
without going through a group leader and without getting the permission to do so from the 
President of the National Assembly. These rules have the effect of denying Members of 
Parliament belonging to minority parties with fewer than 10 seats any meaningful role in 
Parliament and go beyond the scope of parliamentary procedures outlined in article 96 of 
the Constitution. For instance, currently the Human Rights Party has only three members in 
Parliament. Since they have not joined any group because they wish to retain their 
independence, they have no opportunity to function as normal Members of Parliament in 
parliamentary debate. For the reasons outlined above, the role of Parliament has been 
limited in overseeing the work of the executive.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Protecting the freedom of speech of Members of Parliament 
</b></p>
<p>50. Parliament is the soul of democracy. For democracy to work properly, all individual 
Members of Parliament should be able to exercise their freedom of speech in the course of 
discharging their official duties. It is a fundamental condition for a Member of Parliament 
to be able to speak his or her mind without fear. Democracy is about dialogue and debate 
on all issues of national importance, and this is especially so in the case of the parliament, 
which by definition is a chamber where members can debate freely any issues of national 
importance. It is for this reason that they have been accorded parliamentary immunity. 
However, some of the current internal rules of procedure of the National Assembly are not 
conducive to enabling all individual members to enjoy their freedom of speech when 
holding the executive to account and defending the rights of the people that they represent. 
In the recent past, the scope for Members of Parliament in Cambodia to participate in 
parliamentary debate has been limited and the parliamentary immunity of a number of 
Members of Parliament has been lifted, even for speaking out on issues of national 
importance. Further, many of these members have not been given an opportunity to make a 
representation in their defence, which goes against the basic principles of natural justice. A 
properly functioning democracy requires effective checks on the executive and on the 
majority.  </p>


<p>51. Article 80 of the Constitution guarantees parliamentary immunity to Members of 
Parliament to enable them to enjoy their freedom of speech so that the conduct of ministers 
and the activities and policies of the executive could be scrutinized and criticized. Article 4 
of the Law on the Status of National Assembly Members divides parliamentary immunity 
into two categories: absolute immunity and relative immunity. Absolute immunity applies 
to the expression of opinions and idea during the adoption of the law by the National 
Assembly and relative immunity applies in relation to the protection of Members of 
Parliament from being prosecuted, detained or arrested. Only when parliamentary immunity 
has been lifted can a Member of Parliament be arrested, detained and subjected to criminal 
proceedings.  
</p>
<p>52. A request to remove the parliamentary immunity of any Member of Parliament who 
is alleged to have committed a crime should be submitted by the Minister of Justice to the 
President of the National Assembly. The National Assembly can remove the parliamentary 
immunity of a Member of Parliament by two-thirds majority vote of all members of the 
National Assembly. However, the Law on the Status of National Assembly Members does 
not provide an opportunity for the Member of Parliament in question to make a 
representation in his or her defence. Thus, a Member of Parliament could be stripped of his 
or her parliamentary immunity without having been given an opportunity for a fair hearing. 
The ruling party, with its two-thirds majority, has used these powers to lift the 
parliamentary immunity of Members of Parliament belonging to the opposition, without 
giving them an opportunity to defend their case.  
</p>
<p>53. Furthermore, some of the provisions of the Law on the Status of National Assembly 
Members seem to go beyond the freedom of speech guaranteed to members through the 
Constitution. Article 80 of the Constitution states that no Assembly member shall be 
prosecuted, detained or arrested because of opinions expressed while exercising their 
duties. However, article 5 of the Law on the Status of National Assembly Members narrows 
down protection by stating that if a Member of Parliament is found guilty of abusing an 
individual&#8217;s dignity, social customs, public order or national security &#8211; without defining 
what these acts constitute &#8211; parliamentary immunity could be lifted. Provisions such as this 
can be misused if not defined properly and not coupled with adequate safeguards. In this 
context, it should be noted that the National Assembly has not yet restored the 
parliamentary immunity of one of the members of the opposition even after the fine that the 
Member of Parliament had to pay, according to a court order for alleged defamation of the 
Prime Minister, had been taken from her salary as a Member of Parliament.4 There is no 
clarity in the Law on the Status of National Assembly on how immunity will be restored if 
the National Assembly member is neither sentenced to serve a prison term nor acquitted. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that defamation and disinformation should be 
decriminalized altogether in Cambodia. The main opposition political party members and 
other members belonging to minority parties in the National Assembly have been 
marginalized. They cannot work freely when they face the threat of a criminal charge of 
defamation, disinformation or incitement when criticizing not only the programmes and 
policies of the Government but also the conduct of Ministers. Owing to this culture of fear, 
members of the general public or even civil society workers seem to hesitate to attend the 
public meetings of most of the opposition parties. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about the narrowing of the political space in Cambodia, which is not conducive 
to promoting and strengthening a democratic culture in the country. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 The serving Member of Parliament had announced in a press conference, held on 23 April 2009, that 
</p>
<p>she would bring a defamation lawsuit against the Prime Minister for derogatory statements he had 
made about her. Her lawsuit against the Prime Minister was dismissed and the decision upheld on 
appeal, her parliamentary immunity was lifted and she was found guilty of defamation.  </p>


<p><b> V. The Constitutional Council, human rights and Parliament 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Constitutional Council was established under the Constitution to review the 
laws enacted by Parliament to ascertain their compatibility with the Constitution and 
thereby the fundamental freedoms and rights guaranteed by it and by international human 
rights treaties ratified by Cambodia. It consists of distinguished people drawn from various 
walks of public life. This is an innovative element of the Cambodian Constitution and a 
very welcome addition to the institutions designed to strengthen democracy. The 
Constitutional Council is a powerful body, at least on paper. Such a body for post-adoption 
review of the law does not exist in many countries. In many countries, is the constitutional 
court or the supreme court that has the power to declare a piece of legislation ultra vires of 
the constitution. The Council is composed of one president and eight members. The 
Council cannot examine any matter on its own initiative. Only the King, the President of 
the Senate, the President of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister, one quarter of the 
Senators, one tenth of the members of the National Assembly, or the Supreme Court can 
make a request to the Council to review the constitutionality of a law passed by Parliament.  
</p>
<p>56. In the exercise of its powers, the Cambodian Constitutional Council has delivered 
some decisions with far-reaching implications, such as its ruling on the Law on 
Aggravating Circumstances for Felonies in July 2007,5 drawing on international standards. 
However, the scope of its work is limited by the fact that private citizens have no direct 
opportunities to challenge the constitutionality of the laws enacted by Parliament. The 
citizens of Cambodia have to go through their Members of Parliament to the Council and 
the Members of Parliament seem to rarely exercise their powers to request the Council to 
review a piece of legislation that they themselves adopted in the first place. 
</p>
<p>57. Only a private citizen who is party to legal proceedings before a court of law can 
raise the question of the unconstitutionality of a piece of legislation or decisions of other 
State institutions including royal decrees, subdecrees and other administrative decisions, 
but even in this case it is up to the Supreme Court to refer the matter to the Council. The 
Supreme Court has not yet exercised this right even when it was called upon to do so in 
some recent court cases. The Council has very few cases before it for consideration. Given 
the passage of many laws and the controversy around them, some of the acts of Parliament 
or its internal regulations could have been reviewed by the Council. Although article 140 of 
the Constitution accords explicit powers to the Council to review the internal regulations of 
the National Assembly and the Senate before promulgation, the Council has not been as 
assertive and as active as it should be. It does not seem to have reviewed the 
constitutionality of some of the controversial provisions in the internal rules of the 
Assembly and the Senate before they were promulgated. The domination of the Cambodian 
People&#8217;s Party in the State machinery seems to have led to some self-censorship by the 
Council.  
</p>
<p>  
 5 This law, passed in 2002, removed both the discretion that judges previously had to consider the age 
</p>
<p>of an offender in mitigation and the obligation judges had to halve any prison sentence for persons 
under 18 years of age. The Constitutional Council, in 2007, ruled that the Law was constitutional but 
on the basis that the Law was not intended to abrogate the protections provided to child offenders in 
the 1992 Provisions Relating to the Judiciary and Criminal Law and Procedure Applicable in 
Cambodia during the Transitional Period (United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia law), 
since that would have violated both the Constitution and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It 
further clarified in its decision that international human rights treaties to which Cambodia was party 
were part of domestic law and directly applicable by judges in the courts. (See A/HRC/7/56, paras. 
24-26). </p>


<p>58. Although the Constitutional Council is not grounded within the system and 
hierarchy of the judiciary or Parliament, it is the ultimate body responsible for reviewing 
the constitutionality of the laws enacted by Parliament. This function of the Council is 
judicial in nature and akin to the powers exercised in many other jurisdictions by the 
supreme or constitutional court of a country. Therefore, the Council should consist of the 
best independent legal brains of the country drawn from among the retired Supreme Court 
judges, distinguished professors of law and senior lawyers of the country. The practice of 
appointing to the Council people without a legal background and without a long legal 
service to the nation and on the basis of their party political affiliations should be 
discontinued. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p><b>59. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia has 
enjoyed a good level of cooperation from the Government. The dialogue with the 
Prime Minister and other senior Ministers has been candid but cordial and both sides 
have agreed to continue their cooperation. The meetings that the Special Rapporteur 
had with the President and Members of the National Assembly and Senate, 
representatives of political parties and civil society representatives were fruitful. His 
direct interaction with victims of human rights violations was helpful to understand 
the weaknesses that still exist in the implementation of domestic laws and 
international norms in the country. 
</b></p>
<p><b>60. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the narrowing of space for people, 
including those belonging to different political parties, to express their views 
peacefully and without fear. He is particularly concerned in this regard by the use of 
the charge of incitement against human rights defenders. In his view, political actors 
and civil society organizations should work towards creating an environment which is 
conducive to the enjoyment of human rights by all and to economic development for 
the benefit of all.  
</b></p>
<p><b>61. Cambodia has come a long way since the conclusion of the Paris Peace 
Agreements. There is a democratic constitution in place and a number of State 
institutions have been established to protect and human rights. However, many of 
these institutions have not been effective in upholding people&#8217;s rights. The judiciary 
remains a weak institution. Political issues have been taken to court and members of 
the opposition have been convicted of crimes which would not constitute crimes by 
international democratic standards.  
</b></p>
<p><b>62. What Parliament in general and the various specialized commissions in 
particular have been able to achieve in Cambodia is commendable. The work of the 
Human Rights Commissions of both houses of Parliament has been encouraging. All 
in all, Cambodia has made a huge transformation, from a State in which the 
institutional framework had all but been completely destroyed, to one whose law-
making and institution-building processes are functioning. However, Cambodia has 
not yet successfully entered the phase of implementing the laws enacted to promote 
and protect human rights and to make its institutions independent, impartial and 
robust.  
</b></p>
<p><b>63. After focusing on economic, social and cultural rights such as food security and 
development, the Cambodian society is now anxious to make rapid progress towards 
implementing civil and political rights and issues such as freedom and justice, and 
strengthening parliamentary culture. However, the Government is not fully geared up 
to make a similar transition. The approach of the Government in relation to issues </b></p>


<p><b>concerning democracy and human rights is rather mechanical. As a result, despite the 
plethora of institutions created to promote and protect human rights, many of them 
have not been effective in performing their functions in an independent, impartial and 
robust manner. Many of the commitments undertaken by the Government have not 
been more than paper exercises. Therefore, what the Government of Cambodia needs 
is a shift in its mindset, and political will to accelerate the process of democratization 
and to associate democracy and human rights with human values that promote and 
protect the dignity of all individuals and respect their freedom.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Parliament 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General 
</b></p>
<p><b>64. Cambodia needs to accelerate the process of democratization in the country. 
There should be a genuine will and attempt at political reconciliation so that all 
political actors enjoy equal opportunities to make their contribution to the country&#8217;s 
political and economic development and parliamentary process. The right of all 
parliamentarians, including minority as well as majority parties, to carry out their 
duties should be fully respected. 
</b></p>
<p><b>65. The Constitution of Cambodia makes it mandatory to hold a National Congress 
once a year under the chairmanship of the King to enable the people to be directly 
informed on various matters of national interest and to raise issues of concern to the 
authorities of all three main organs of the State. This is a unique and innovative 
provision of direct democracy which could constitute an appropriate forum for 
achieving national political reconciliation, reviewing the progress made in promoting 
and protecting human rights and for strengthening the sovereignty of the country. 
Since the King is the guarantor of the Constitution, the monarch should be able to 
receive people in audience and receive information from people from all walks of life. 
However, no such National Congress has ever been held. It should be held every year 
as mandated by the Constitution. For this, the organic law relating to National 
Congress should be enacted without any delay. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Strengthening the capacity and the workings of Parliament 
</b></p>
<p><b>66. The Human Rights Commissions in Parliament should mainstream human 
rights as a cross-cutting issue and work towards ensuring the compliance of domestic 
laws with international human rights standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>67. The opposition parties should participate fully in the work of Parliament and 
cooperate, in particular in the work of the Commissions of the National Assembly. 
</b></p>
<p><b>68. The internal procedures of Parliament in general and the National Assembly in 
particular should be revised to encourage equitable or proportionate sharing of power 
and responsibility in parliamentary activities and especially in the leadership positions 
in the various parliamentary Commissions. 
</b></p>
<p><b>69. The procedure for removing parliamentary immunity and other disciplinary 
actions against sitting Members of Parliament should be brought in line with the 
principles of natural justice, constitutional standards and freedom of expression. 
</b></p>
<p><b>70. The Government should increase the resources allocated to Parliament to 
enhance the overall capacity of Parliament as an independent and effective institution </b></p>


<p><b>and the capacity of individual Members of Parliament to scrutinize draft laws tabled 
before Parliament by the Government. 
</b></p>
<p><b>71. Parliament in general and the National Assembly in particular should increase 
their effectiveness in overseeing the work of the executive and holding the latter to 
account. The environment should be made conducive for parliamentarians to openly 
question policies and decisions of their own parties. In this regard, there should be a 
clear understanding that being a Member of Parliament comes with specific 
responsibilities that transcend party lines.  
</b></p>
<p><b>72. The Secretary-General of both houses of Parliament should be an independent 
person and not an active member of any political party. 
</b></p>
<p><b>73. The recruitment of officials of Parliament in general and the National 
Assembly in particular should be conducted on the basis of merit and through a 
competitive and transparent process. 
</b></p>
<p><b>74. Draft laws should be published for public consultation and especially in outlets 
such as the <i>Official Gazette</i>. The <i>Gazette</i> itself should be made accessible to members 
of the public. 
</b></p>
<p><b>75. Laws should not be enforced until they are published in the <i>Official Gazette</i>. 
</b></p>
<p><b>76. Parliamentary Commissions should review regulations adopted by the 
Government to ascertain whether they exceed the scope of the original laws. 
</b></p>
<p><b>77. The requirement to be part of a group of 10 Members of Parliament in order to 
participate in parliamentary debate should be removed, affording all individual 
Members of Parliament equal opportunity to participate in such debate.  
</b></p>
<p><b>78. The main opposition party should have a constructive role to play in the 
appointment of members of various constitutional bodies, such as the election 
commission, to ensure that they are able to operate in an impartial and independent 
manner. 
</b></p>
<p><b>79. As in many other parliaments around the globe, the ruling party should invite 
the opposition parties to chair some of the Commissions in Parliament in general and 
in the National Assembly in particular. This would strengthen parliamentary culture 
as well as the culture of opposition. This used to be the case in Cambodia, but in 
recent years the situation has regressed in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p><b>80. Constituents should have easy access to parliamentarians in order for the latter 
to better represent them in Parliament.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Enhancing the effectiveness of the Constitutional Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>81. The Constitutional Council should review not only the laws enacted by 
Parliament but also the internal rules of Parliament in general and the National 
Assembly in particular to ascertain whether they are compatible with the 
Constitution, international human rights standards, and the principles of rule of law, 
including the principles of natural justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>82. Any law enacted by Parliament which has direct implications for human rights 
should automatically be referred to the Constitutional Council for review before it is 
presented to the King for royal assent. 
</b></p>
<p><b>83. Access to the Constitutional Council should be widened: certain recognized 
non-State actors, such as professional associations of lawyers and law professors, as 
well as citizens under narrowly defined conditions and in exceptional cases, should 
have access to the Council. </b></p>


<p><b>84. The Council should consist of the best legal and independent brains of the 
country, drawn from among the retired Supreme Court judges, distinguished 
professors of law and senior lawyers of the country. 
</b></p>
<p><b>85. The practice of appointing to the Council people without a legal background 
and without a long legal service to the nation and on the basis of their party political 
affiliations should be discontinued. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Parliament and the freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>86. Parliament should review the new Penal Code with a view to ensuring its 
compliance with the permissible limitation to freedom of expression under 
international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>87. Parliament should safeguard the right to freedom of expression of its own 
members and protect their parliamentary immunity. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>88. The judiciary should interpret the provisions of the Penal Code in line with 
international human rights standards of freedom of expression. The Ministry of 
Justice should call on the international community, including the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, to provide training for judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Land and housing rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>89. The Government is urged to examine the current trend of unresolved land 
disputes in the country and address the alarming patterns of violence by facilitating 
dialogue among potentially affected communities, local, provincial and national 
authorities, and private enterprises. 
</b></p>
<p><b>90. The Government should engage the people affected by land disputes in 
meaningful consultation regarding adequate compensation, or adequate alternative 
housing options, where applicable. Authorities should respect and protect the rights of 
such people, including by ensuring that they are not subjected to excessive use of 
force, harassment and intimidation, that they can exercise their right to peaceful 
protest, and that defamation, disinformation and incitement charges are not brought 
arbitrarily. 
</b></p>
<p><b>91.</b> <b>The Government is advised to exercise greater transparency in economic land 
concessions and other land deals involving Government officials or private 
enterprises, and is encouraged to strengthen the capacity and independence of the 
court system, the cadastral commissions, and the National Authority for Land Dispute 
Resolution so that they may exercise accountability, impartiality and greater 
efficiency in resolving disputes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>92.  The Government is urged to enforce the existing provisions of the 2001 Land 
Law that prohibit interference with indigenous land and accelerate the pace of land 
registration for indigenous peoples to obtain collective title; interim protection 
measures should be implemented on all land where indigenous communities live until 
the registration process is completed and titles obtained.  
</b></p>
<p><b>93. When engaging in land deals either with the Government of Cambodia or other 
land owners, foreign Governments and international business organizations should </b></p>


<p><b>bear in mind that they have a responsibility under international law to respect the 
human rights of the people of Cambodia. Sponsorship of the use of armed law 
enforcement officials to carry out an unlawful eviction is illegal under international 
law and should be made illegal in Cambodia as well.
