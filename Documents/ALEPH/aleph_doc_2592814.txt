Transatlantic Petroleum Ltd.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1. General
Nature of operations
TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “TransAtlantic”) is an
international oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition, exploration, development and production. We have
focused our operations in countries that have established, yet underexplored petroleum systems, are net importers of
petroleum, have an existing petroleum transportation infrastructure and provide favorable commodity pricing, royalty rates
and tax rates to exploration and production companies. We hold interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural
gas properties in Turkey and Bulgaria. As of August 8, 2016, approximately 36% of our outstanding common shares were
beneficially owned by N. Malone Mitchell 3rd, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors.
TransAtlantic is a holding company with two operating segments – Turkey and Bulgaria.  Its assets consist of its
ownership interests in subsidiaries that primarily own assets in Turkey and Bulgaria.
Basis of presentation
Our consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. Dollars and have been prepared by management in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). All amounts in the notes to
the consolidated financial statements are in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated. In preparing financial statements,
management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the
date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On
an ongoing basis, management reviews estimates, including those related to fair value measurements associated with
acquisitions and financial derivatives, the recoverability and impairment of long-lived assets, contingencies and income
taxes. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these
estimates.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we reclassified certain balance sheet amounts previously
reported on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 to conform to current year presentation.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.
2. Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going
concern. These principles assume that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our obligations in the normal
course of operations for the foreseeable future.
We incurred a net loss of $12.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which included net loss from discontinued
operations of $0.1 million.  At June 30, 2016, the outstanding principal amount of our debt was $84.7 million (excluding
unamortized deferred financing costs), and we had a working capital deficit (excluding assets and liabilities held for sale)
of $19.8 million.
Due to the significant decline in Brent crude oil prices during 2015, the borrowing base under our senior credit facility (the
“Senior Credit Facility”) with BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA (“BNP Paribas”) and the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”,
and together with BNP Paribas, the “Lenders”) was decreased to $5.4 million effective April 1, 2016. The decline in the
borrowing base resulted in a $18.8 million borrowing base deficiency under the Senior Credit Facility as of June 30, 2016.
On April 19, 2016, we entered into a second waiver and consent to credit agreement (the “Second Waiver and Consent”)
with BNP Paribas and IFC, which granted us a conditional waiver of defaults under the Senior Credit Facility and the
current ratio financial covenant non-compliance at December 31, 2015, and March 31, June 30, and September 30,
2016.  The Second Waiver and Consent also permitted the borrowers to make certain limited transfers and withdrawals
from the collection accounts pledged to the Lenders under the Senior Credit Facility.
6
The Second Waiver and Consent included certain conditions, including the following:
(i)The borrowing base deficiency must be repaid by September 30, 2016 (provided that the Lenders may, in their sole and
absolute discretion, agree in writing to extend such date to December 31, 2016) (the “Waiver Period”);
(ii)All monthly hedge settlement proceeds shall be used to pay down debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility;
 (iii)Net proceeds from certain asset sales shall be used to prepay loans outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility;
 (iv)On or before May 15, 2016, the Company shall have entered into a binding purchase and sale agreement for the sale
of all of the equity interests in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, Thrace Basin Natural Gas (Turkiye)
Corporation (“TBNG”);
(v)By June 30, 2016, the Lenders shall be granted a security interest over all of the equity interests in, and assets and
property of, TBNG; and
(vi)On or before September 30, 2016, all holders of our 13.0% convertible notes due 2017 (the “2017 Notes”) shall either
(a) convert their debt interest under the 2017 Notes into equity interest, or (b) agree to extend the maturity of the 2017
Notes to April 1, 2019 or later on substantially identical terms.
As of June 30, 2016, we had $24.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, a borrowing base
deficiency of $18.8 million and no availability.  In addition, we were not in compliance with certain covenants in the
Second Waiver and Consent, including the requirement to enter into a binding purchase and sale agreement for TBNG by
May 15, 2016.  We continue to work with the Lenders to satisfy these conditions and restructure our Senior Credit Facility
obligations.  Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we repaid $0.9 million of principal under the Senior Credit Facility, reducing
the outstanding balance to $23.3 million and the borrowing base deficiency to $17.9 million as of August 8, 2016.  In
addition, as of June 30, 2016 and August 8, 2016, the Lenders held $7.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of
restricted cash in our collection accounts in Turkey.
Even if we obtain the funds to repay our borrowing base deficiency, we will need some form of debt restructuring, capital
raising effort or asset sale in order to fund our operations and meet our substantial debt service obligations of
approximately $29.7 million in 2016 and $55.0 million in 2017.  We have engaged Seaport Global Inc. as an independent
advisor, and our management is actively pursuing improving our working capital position and/or restructuring our future
debt service obligations in order to remain a going concern for the foreseeable future.
As a result there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.
Management believes the going concern assumption to be appropriate for these consolidated financial statements. If the
going concern assumption was not appropriate, adjustments would be necessary to the carrying values of assets and
liabilities, reported revenues and expenses, and in the balance sheet classifications used in these consolidated financial
statements.
3. Recent accounting pronouncements
In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-11,
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (“ASU 2015-11”), an amendment to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
Subtopic 330-10.  The amendment states that entities should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable
value.  The amendment does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory
method.  The amendment applies to all other inventory, which includes inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out
(FIFO) or average cost.  ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim
periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2015-11 on our consolidated
financial statements and results of operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus
Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (“ASU 2016-08”).  ASU 2016-08 does not change the core
principle of Topic 606 but clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.  ASU 2016-08 is
effective for the annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently assessing the potential
impact of ASU 2016-08 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”).  ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting
for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax
withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.  We are currently assessing the
potential impact of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.
7
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing (“ASU 2016-10”).  ASU 2016-10 does not change the core principle of Topic 606
but clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation
guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas.  ASU 2016-10 is effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-10 on our consolidated
financial statements and results of operations.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASU 2016-13”).  ASU 2016-13
changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other
receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss
model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Entities will apply the standard's
provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which
the guidance is adopted. We are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial
statements and results of operations.
We have reviewed other recently issued, but not yet adopted, accounting standards in order to determine their effects, if
any, on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Based on that review, we believe that
none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations.

At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we excluded $0.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, from the depletion
calculation for proved development wells currently in progress and for costs associated with fields currently not in
production.
At June 30, 2016, the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depletion, included $18.8
million relating to acquisition costs of proved properties, which are being depleted by the unit-of-production method using
total proved reserves, and $100.6 million relating to well costs and additional development costs, which are being
depleted by the unit-of-production method using proved developed reserves.
At December 31, 2015, the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties included $20.0 million relating to
acquisition costs of proved properties, which are being amortized by the unit-of-production method using total proved
reserves, and $111.4 million relating to well costs and additional development costs, which are being amortized by the
unit-of-production method using proved developed reserves

Impairments of proved properties and impairment of exploratory well costs
Proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the carrying
value of such properties may not be recoverable. We primarily use Level 3 inputs to determine fair value, including but are
not limited to, estimates of proved reserves, future commodity prices, the timing and amount of future production and
capital expenditures and discount rates commensurate with the risk reflective of the lives remaining for the respective oil
and natural gas properties.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $0.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of
impairment of proved properties and exploratory well costs, which are primarily measured using Level 3 inputs.
Capitalized cost greater than one year
As of June 30, 2016, we had $1.3 million and $2.2 million of exploratory well costs capitalized for the Hayrabolu-10 and
Pinar-1 wells, respectively, in Turkey, which we spud in February 2013 and March 2014, respectively. The Hayrabolu-10
and Pinar-1 wells continue to be held for completion.

materials will ultimately be classified as long-term assets when the material is used in the drilling of a well.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we excluded $21.0 million and $21.3 million of inventory, respectively, from
depreciation as the inventory had not been placed into service.

Our ARO is measured using primarily Level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs to this fair value measurement
include estimates of plugging costs, remediation costs, inflation rate and well life. The inputs are calculated based on
historical data as well as current estimated costs.

6. Commodity derivative instruments
We use derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of a portion
of our future oil production. We have not designated the derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes, and
accordingly, we record the derivative contracts at fair value and recognize changes in fair value in earnings as they occur.
To the extent that a legal right of offset exists, we net the value of our derivative contracts with the same counterparty in our
consolidated balance sheets. All of our oil derivative contracts are settled based upon Brent crude oil pricing. We
recognize gains and losses related to these contracts on a fair value basis in our consolidated statements of
comprehensive (loss) income under the caption “(Loss) gain on commodity derivative contracts.” Settlements of derivative
contracts are included in operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows under the caption “Cash
settlement on commodity derivative contracts.”
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a net loss on commodity derivative contracts of $3.0
million and $3.3 million, respectively.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a net loss on
commodity derivative contracts of $2.2 million and a net gain of $0.5 million, respectively.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding contracts with respect to our future crude oil production as
set forth in the tables below:

Senior Credit Facility
On May 6, 2014, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into the Senior Credit Facility with BNP Paribas and
IFC. The Senior Credit Facility is guaranteed by us and each of TransAtlantic Petroleum (USA) Corp. (“TransAtlantic
USA”) and TransAtlantic Worldwide, Ltd. (each, a “Guarantor”).
11
The borrowing base amount is re-determined semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st of each year.  The April 1, 2016
redetermination resulted in a $5.4 million borrowing base and a $18.8 million borrowing base deficiency under the Senior
Credit Facility as of June 30, 2016.   Loans under the Senior Credit Facility accrue interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR
plus 5.00% per annum (5.63% at June 30, 2016), except as described below.  The borrowing base amount equals, for any
calculation date, the lowest of:
·the debt value which results in the field life coverage ratio for such calculation date being 1.50 to 1.00; and
 ·the debt value which results in the loan life coverage ratio for such calculation date being 1.30 to 1.00.
On April 19, 2016, we entered into the Second Waiver and Consent with BNP Paribas and IFC, which granted us a
conditional waiver of defaults under the Senior Credit Facility and permitted the borrowers to make certain limited transfers
and withdrawals from the collection accounts pledged to the Lenders under the Senior Credit Facility.  The Second Waiver
and Consent also waived non-compliance with the current ratio financial covenant in the Senior Credit Facility on each of
December 31, 2015, and March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2016.
The Second Waiver and Consent included certain conditions, including the following:
(i)The borrowing base deficiency must be repaid by September 30, 2016 (provided that the Lenders may, in their sole and
absolute discretion, agree in writing to extend such date to December 31, 2016);
(ii)All monthly hedge settlement proceeds shall be used to pay down debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility;
 (iii)Net proceeds from certain asset sales shall be used to prepay loans outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility;
 (iv)On or before May 15, 2016, the Company shall have entered into a binding purchase and sale agreement for the sale
of all of the equity interests in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, TBNG;
(v)By June 30, 2016, the Lenders shall be granted a security interest over all of the equity interest in, and assets and
property of, TBNG; and
(vi)On or before September 30, 2016, all holders of the 2017 Notes shall either (a) convert their debt interest under the
2017 Notes into equity interest, or (b) agree to extend the maturity of the 2017 Notes to April 1, 2019 or later on
substantially identical terms.
Pursuant to the Second Waiver and Consent, as of April 19, 2016, the Lenders’ aggregate commitments were reduced to
$30.5 million, with individual commitments of $15.2 million each, and shall be further reduced by the amount of any
payments under the Senior Credit Facility.  During the Waiver Period, interest on the borrowing base deficiency will accrue
at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 7.00% per annum (7.63% at June 30, 2016).
As of June 30, 2016, we had $24.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, a borrowing base
deficiency of $18.8 million and no availability. In addition, we were not in compliance with certain covenants in the Second
Waiver and Consent, including the requirement to enter into a binding purchase and sale agreement for TBNG by May 15,
2016.  We continue to work with the Lenders to satisfy these conditions and restructure our Senior Credit Facility
obligations.  Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we repaid $0.9 million of principal under the Senior Credit Facility, reducing
the outstanding balance to $23.3 million and the borrowing base deficiency to $17.9 million, as of August 8, 2016.  In
addition, as of June 30, 2016 and August 8, 2016, the Lenders held $7.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of
restricted cash in our collection accounts in Turkey.
As of August 8, 2016, we had granted a security interest in favor of the Lenders over all of the equity interests in, and
moveable assets of, TBNG, and were in the process of granting a security interest in favor of the Lenders over all present
and future receivables of TBNG. We are also in active negotiations with third party purchasers for the sale of TBNG. We
have engaged Seaport Global Inc. as an independent advisor, and our management is actively pursuing alternate
structures for the 2017 Notes.
We have classified all borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility as short-term debt as of June 30, 2016 due to the
uncertainty regarding our ability to comply with the covenants in the Senior Credit Facility for the next twelve months.
12
2017 Notes
As of June 30, 2016, we had $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2017 Notes. The 2017 Notes bear
interest at a rate of 13.0% per annum and mature on July 1, 2017. The 2017 Notes are convertible at any time, at the
election of a holder, into our common shares at a conversion price of $6.80 per share.
On June 30, 2016, we issued 2,905,737 common shares in a private placement to certain holders of the 2017 Notes, at the
election of such holders to receive common shares in lieu of cash interest on the 2017 Notes (see Note 9, “Shareholders’
equity”).
TBNG credit facility
TBNG has a fully-drawn credit facility with a Turkish bank.  During the second quarter of 2016, the facility was amended
and the monthly principal installments were deferred until August 29, 2016.  The facility may be prepaid without penalty.
The facility is secured by a lien on a Turkish real estate property owned by Gundem Turizm Yatirim ve Isletmeleri Anonim
Sirketi (“Gundem”), which is 97.5% beneficially owned by Mr. Mitchell and his children. At June 30, 2016, TBNG owed
$0.9 million under the credit facility and had no availability.
West Promissory Notes
In August 2015, TransAtlantic USA entered into promissory notes (the “Promissory Notes”) with each of Mary West CRT 2
LLC and Gary West CRT 2 LLC, shareholders of the Company (collectively, the “Holders”), whereby TransAtlantic USA
could borrow up to $1.5 million under each Promissory Note to fund our share repurchase program. The Holders are
managed by Randy Rochman, an observer of our board of directors.
On August 21, 2015, TransAtlantic USA borrowed $500,000 under each Promissory Note. Pursuant to the terms of the
Promissory Notes, the Holders are granted a first priority lien and security interest in all of our common shares purchased
under our share repurchase program. Loans under the Promissory Notes accrue interest at a rate of 9.00% per annum and
mature on October 1, 2016. The Promissory Notes are guaranteed by us. As of June 30, 2016, we had borrowed $1.0
million under the Promissory Notes and had no availability. The funds were used to purchase our common shares
pursuant to our share repurchase program.
ANBE Note
On December 30, 2015, TransAtlantic USA entered into a $5.0 million draw down convertible promissory note (the “Note”)
with ANBE Holdings, L.P. (“ANBE”), an entity owned by the children of the Company’s chairman and chief executive
officer, N. Malone Mitchell 3rd, and controlled by an entity managed by Mr. Mitchell and his wife. The Note bears interest at
a rate of 13.0% per annum.  On December 30, 2015, the Company borrowed $3.6 million under the Note (the “Initial
Advance”) for general corporate purposes.
On June 30, 2016, TransAtlantic USA entered into an extension of the Note (the “Extension”) with ANBE.  The Extension
extended the date on which the Company could request advances under the Note from June 15, 2016 to August 15, 2016
and extended the maturity date of the Note from June 30, 2016 to August 31, 2016.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company
had borrowed $3.6 million under the Note and had availability of $1.4 million.
Advances under the Note may be converted, at the election of ANBE, any time after the NYSE MKT approves the
Company’s application to list the additional common shares issuable pursuant to the conversion feature of the Note and
prior to the maturity of the Note.  The conversion price per common share for each advance is equal to 105% of the closing
price of the Company’s common shares on the NYSE MKT on the trading date immediately prior to such advance.  The
conversion price of the Initial Advance is $1.3755 per share.
On June 30, 2016, we issued 355,826 common shares in a private placement to ANBE in lieu of cash interest on the Note
(see Note 9, “Shareholders’ equity”).

8. Contingencies relating to production leases and exploration permits
Selmo
We are involved in litigation with persons who claim ownership of a portion of the surface at the Selmo oil field in Turkey.
These cases are being vigorously defended by TransAtlantic Exploration Mediterranean International Pty Ltd (“TEMI”) and
Turkish governmental authorities. We do not have enough information to estimate the potential additional operating costs
we would incur in the event the purported surface owners’ claims are ultimately successful. Any adjustment arising out of
the claims will be recorded when it becomes probable and measurable.
Morocco
During 2012, we were notified that the Moroccan government may seek to recover approximately $5.5 million in
contractual obligations under our Tselfat exploration permit work program. In February 2013, the Moroccan government
drew down our $1.0 million bank guarantee that was put in place to ensure our performance of the Tselfat exploration
permit work program. Although we believe that the bank guarantee satisfies our contractual obligations, during 2012, we
recorded $5.0 million in accrued liabilities relating to our Tselfat exploration permit for this contingency.
Bulgaria
During 2012, we were notified that the Bulgarian government may seek to recover approximately $2.0 million in
contractual obligations under our Aglen exploration permit work program. Due to the Bulgarian government’s January
2012 ban on fracture stimulation and related activities, a force majeure event under the terms of the exploration permit was
recognized by the government. Although we invoked force majeure, we recorded $2.0 million in general and
administrative expense relating to our Aglen exploration permit during 2012 for this contractual obligation.
In October 2015, the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy and Economy filed a suit against our subsidiary, Direct Petroleum
Bulgaria EOOD (“Direct Bulgaria”), claiming a $200,000 penalty for Direct Bulgaria’s alleged failure to fulfill the Aglen work
program.  We believe that Direct Bulgaria is not under any obligation to fulfill the work program until the 2012 force
majeure event is rectified and intend to vigorously defend this claim.
Direct Petroleum
In July 2013, we entered into a second amendment (the “Amendment”) to the purchase agreement (the “Purchase
Agreement”) with Direct Petroleum Exploration, LLC (“Direct”). The Amendment set forth a new obligation to drill and test
the Deventci-R2 well by May 1, 2014. We completed the drilling and testing requirements pursuant to the Amendment
during April 2014, which resulted in the reversal of a $2.5 million contingent liability recorded in 2011. The reversal was
recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) under the caption “Revaluation of contingent
consideration” during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.
In December 2014, Direct filed suit against the Company alleging that it was due liquidated damages of $5.0 million worth
of common shares of the Company pursuant to the Amendment. On March 15, 2016, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement pursuant to which we agreed to issue 225,000 common shares to Direct in exchange for a mutual
release of all current and future claims against the other party in connection with the Purchase Agreement. On April 17,
2016, the Company issued 225,000 common shares to Direct pursuant to a settlement agreement, and the court dismissed
the lawsuit on April 28, 2016.

On June 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 5,773,305 common shares in private placements under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Of the 5,773,305 common shares, (i) 2,905,737 common shares were issued to
holders of the 2017 Notes at the election of such holders to receive common shares in lieu of cash interest on the 2017
Notes; (ii) 355,826 common shares were issued to ANBE in lieu of cash interest on the Note; and (iii) 2,511,742 common
shares were issued for cash, which was used to pay cash interest to certain holders of the 2017 Notes. All of the shares
were issued at a value of $0.6599 per share, which was equal to 75% of the 10-day volume weighted average price
through the close of trading of the common shares on the NYSE MKT on June 29, 2016.
Direct settlement
On April 17, 2016, we issued 225,000 common shares to Direct pursuant to a settlement agreement.
Restricted stock units
We recorded share-based compensation expense of $0.2 million for awards of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) for each of
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. We recorded share-based compensation expense of $0.4  million and
$0.5 million for awards of RSUs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $0.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested
RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
Earnings per share
We account for earnings per share in accordance with ASC Subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260-10”). ASC
260-10 requires companies to present two calculations of earnings per share: basic and diluted. Basic earnings per
common share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 equals net loss divided by the weighted
average shares outstanding during the periods. Weighted average shares outstanding are equal to the weighted average
of all shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested RSUs. Diluted earnings per common share for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are computed in the same manner as basic earnings per common share after
assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common share equivalents, which includes
RSUs.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, there were no dilutive securities included in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share.
The following table presents the basic and diluted earnings per common share computations:

11. Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and our loans
payable were each estimated to have a fair value approximating the carrying amount at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, due to the short maturity of those instruments.
Interest rate risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our variable rate short-term cash holdings and borrowings under the
Senior Credit Facility.
Foreign currency risk
We have underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Our currency exposures relate to transactions denominated
in the Canadian Dollar, Bulgarian Lev, European Union Euro, Romanian New Leu and Turkish Lira (“TRY”). We are also
subject to foreign currency exposures resulting from translating the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary financial
statements into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency. We have not used foreign currency forward contracts to manage
exchange rate fluctuations. At June 30, 2016, we had 28.6 million TRY (approximately $9.9 million) in cash and cash
equivalents and restricted cash, which exposes us to exchange rate risk based on fluctuations in the value of the TRY.
Commodity price risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices for oil and natural gas. Commodity prices are affected by many factors,
including, but not limited to, supply and demand. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were a party to commodity
derivative contracts (see Note 6, “Commodity derivative instruments”).
16
Concentration of credit risk
The majority of our receivables are within the oil and natural gas industry, primarily from our industry partners and from
government agencies. Included in receivables are amounts due from Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi, the national oil
company of Turkey, and Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri A.Ş., a privately owned oil refinery in Turkey, which purchases all of
our oil production. The receivables are not collateralized. To date, we have experienced minimal bad debts from
customers in Turkey. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held by three financial institutions in the United
States and Turkey.

Services transactions
On March 3, 2016, Mr. Mitchell closed a transaction whereby he sold his interests in Viking Services B.V. (“Viking
Services”), the beneficial owner of Viking International Limited (“Viking International”), Viking Petrol Sahasi Hizmetleri A.S.
(“VOS”) and Viking Geophysical Services Ltd. (“Viking Geophysical”), to a third party.  As part of the transaction, Mr.
Mitchell acquired certain equipment used in the performance of stimulation, wireline, workover and similar services, which
equipment is owned and operated by a new entity, Production Solutions International Petrol Arama Hizmetleri Anonim
Sirketi (“PSIL”).  PSIL is beneficially owned by Dalea Investment Group, LLC, which is controlled by Mr. Mitchell.
Consequently, on March 3, 2016, TEMI entered into a master services agreement (the “PSIL MSA”) with PSIL on
substantially similar terms to the current master services agreements with Viking International, VOS and Viking
Geophysical.  Pursuant to the PSIL MSA, PSIL performs the services on behalf of TEMI and its affiliates.  The master
service agreements with each of Viking International, VOS and Viking Geophysical will remain in effect through the
remainder of the five-year term of the agreements ending on June 13, 2017.
Dalea Amended Note and Pledge Agreement
On April 19, 2016, we entered into a note amendment agreement (the “Note Amendment Agreement”) with Mr. Mitchell,
and Dalea Partners, LP (“Dalea”), pursuant to which Dalea agreed to deliver an amended and restated promissory note
(the “Amended Note”) in favor of us, in the principal sum of $7,964,053, which Amended Note would amend and restate
that certain promissory note, dated June 13, 2012, made by Dalea in favor of us in the principal amount of $11.5 million
(the “Original Note”). The Note Amendment Agreement reduced the principal amount of the Original Note to $8.0 million in
exchange for the cancellation of an account payable of approximately $3.5 million (the “Account Payable”) owed by
TransAtlantic Albania Ltd. (“TransAtlantic Albania”), a former subsidiary of the Company, to Viking International.  We have
indemnified a third party for any liability relating to the payment of the Account Payable.
Pursuant to the Note Amendment Agreement, on April 19, 2016, we entered into the Amended Note, which amended and
restated the Original Note that was issued in connection with our sale of our subsidiaries, Viking International and Viking
Geophysical Services, to a joint venture owned by Dalea and Abraaj Investment Management Limited in June 2012. In the
Amended Note, we and Dalea acknowledged that (i) while the sale of Dalea’s interest in Viking Services enabled us to
take the position that the Original Note was accelerated in accordance with its terms, the principal purpose of including the
acceleration events in the Original Note was to ensure that certain oilfield services provided by Viking Services to us
would continue to be available to us, and (ii) such services will now be provided pursuant to the PSIL MSA.  PSIL is
beneficially owned by Dalea Investment Group, LLC, which is controlled by Mr. Mitchell. As a result, the Amended Note
revised the events triggering acceleration of the repayment of the Original Note to the following: (i) a reduction of
ownership by Dalea (and other controlled affiliates of Mr. Mitchell) of equity interest in PSIL to less than 50%; (ii) the sale
or transfer by Dalea or PSIL of all or substantially all of its assets to any person (a “Transferee”) that does not own a
controlling interest in Dalea or PSIL and is not controlled by Mr. Mitchell (an “Unrelated Person”), or the subsequent
transfer by any Transferee that is not an Unrelated Person of all or substantially all of its assets to an Unrelated Person;
(iii) the acquisition by an Unrelated Person of more than 50% of the voting interests of Dalea or PSIL; (iv) termination of the
PSIL MSA other than as a result of an uncured default thereunder by TEMI; (v) default by PSIL under the PSIL MSA, which
default is not remedied within a period of 30 days after notice thereof to PSIL; and (vi) insolvency or bankruptcy of PSIL.
The maturity date of the Amended Note was extended to June 13, 2019. The interest rate on the Amended Note remains at
3.0% per annum and continues to be guaranteed by Mr. Mitchell.  The Amended Note contains customary events of
default.
18
In addition, pursuant to the Note Amendment Agreement, on April 19, 2016, we entered into a pledge agreement (the
“Pledge Agreement”) with Dalea, whereby Dalea pledged the $2.0 million principal amount of the 2017 Notes owned by
Dalea (the “Dalea Convertible Notes”), including any future securities for which the Dalea Convertible Notes are converted
or exchanged, as security for the performance of Dalea’s obligations under the Amended Note. The
Pledge Agreement provides that interest payable to Dalea under the Dalea Convertible Notes (or any future securities for
which the Dalea Convertible Notes are converted or exchanged) will be credited first against the outstanding principal
balance of the Amended Note and, upon full repayment of the outstanding principal balance of the Amended Note, any
accrued and unpaid interest on the Amended Note. The Pledge Agreement contains customary events of default.
On June 30, 2016, we entered into a waiver with Dalea, whereby we waived our right under the Pledge Agreement to
receive the interest payment due July 1, 2016 under the Dalea Convertible Notes in connection with the payment of
201,459 common shares to Dalea with respect to the 2017 Note interest payment paid on June 30, 2016.
Private placements
On June 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 5,773,305 common shares in private placements under the Securities Act.
Of the 5,773,305 common shares, (i) 1,974,452 common shares were issued to Dalea, the trusts of Mr. Mitchell’s four
children and Pinon Foundation, a nonprofit entity controlled by Mrs. Mitchell, at their election to receive common shares in
lieu of cash interest on the 2017 Notes; (ii) 355,826 common shares were issued to ANBE in lieu of cash interest on the
Note and (iii) 814,627 common shares were issued to Dalea and the trusts of Mr. Mitchell’s four children for cash, which
was used to pay cash interest to certain holders of the 2017 Notes (see Note 9, “Shareholders’ equity”).
Indemnity agreement
On May 9, 2016, Mr. Mitchell guaranteed the payment of director and officer liability premiums in the amount of $0.4
million (the “Guaranteed Payments”) payable to US Premium Finance solely in the event of a change of control of the
Company.  On May 9, 2016, we entered into an Indemnity Agreement with Mr. Mitchell pursuant to which we agreed to
indemnify him for any damages he incurs related to the Guaranteed Payments.
13. Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations in Albania
As of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, we classified our Albania segment as assets and liabilities held for sale and
presented the operating results within discontinued operations for all periods presented.
In February 2016, we sold all of the outstanding equity in Stream Oil & Gas Ltd. (“Stream”) to GBC Oil Company Ltd.
(“GBC Oil”) in exchange for (i) the future payment of $2.3 million to Raiffeisen Bank Sh.A. (“Raiffeisen”) to pay down the
term loan facility dated as of September 17, 2014 (the “Term Loan Facility”) between Stream’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
TransAtlantic Albania and Raiffeisen, and (ii) the assumption of $29.2 million of liabilities owed by Stream, consisting of
$23.1 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $6.1 million of debt.  TransAtlantic Albania owns all of our
former Albanian assets and operations.  In addition, GBC Oil issued us a warrant pursuant to which we have the option to
acquire up to 25% of the fully diluted equity interests in TransAtlantic Albania for nominal consideration at any time on or
before March 1, 2019.  Prior to the sale of Stream to GBC Oil, TransAtlantic Albania entered into an assignment and
assumption agreement pursuant to which TransAtlantic Albania will assign its Delvina natural gas assets and $12.9
million of associated liabilities to Delvina Gas Company Ltd. (“Delvina Gas”), our newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary,
to be effective immediately upon receipt of required contractual consents. There is no assurance that we will be able to
obtain the required contractual consents.  In addition, we agreed to indemnify GBC Oil and Stream for the $12.9 million of
liabilities related to the Delvina gas operations.  We are currently negotiating a joint venture with a third party for the
purchase of a portion of Delvina Gas.  There is no assurance that we will be able to complete a joint venture for the
purchase of a portion of Delvina Gas.  If the Delvina natural gas assets are not transferred to Delvina Gas due to a breach
of the purchase agreement by GBC Oil or its affiliates, we believe we have contractual damages claims that would offset
any such indemnification obligations, including the Account Payable.  Subsequent to the divestiture, we reduced the $12.9
million of indemnification liabilities to $9.5 million due to the cancellation of the Account Payable discussed in Note 12,
“Related party transactions”.
19
Discontinued operations in Morocco
On June 27, 2011, we decided to discontinue our operations in Morocco. We have substantially completed the process of
winding down our operations in Morocco. We have presented the Moroccan segment operating results as discontinued
operations for all periods presented.
The assets and liabilities held for sale at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

Term Loan Facility
TransAtlantic Albania was a party to the Term Loan Facility with Raiffeisen.  The loan was scheduled to mature on
December 31, 2016 and bore interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 5.5%, with a minimum interest rate of 7.0%. TransAtlantic
Albania was required to pay 1/16th of the total commitment each quarter on the last business day of each of March, June,
September and December each year. The loan was guaranteed by TransAtlantic Albania’s parent company, Stream.
TransAtlantic Albania could prepay the loan at its option in whole or in part, subject to a 3.0% penalty plus breakage
costs.  The Term Loan Facility was secured by substantially all of the assets of TransAtlantic Albania.
20
As of December 31, 2015, TransAtlantic Albania had $6.1 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and no
availability.  As of December 31, 2015, TransAtlantic Albania was in default under the Term Loan Facility for failure to
repay $1.1 million due on December 31, 2015.  On February 29, 2016, we sold all the equity interest in Stream, the parent
company of TransAtlantic Albania, to GBC Oil, who assumed the Term Loan Facility.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to “we,” “our,” “us” or the “Company,” refer to TransAtlantic Petroleum
Ltd. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis unless the context requires otherwise. Unless stated otherwise, all sums
of money stated in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are expressed in U.S. Dollars.
Executive Overview
We are an international oil and natural gas company engaged in acquisition, exploration, development and production.
We have focused our operations in countries that have established yet underexplored petroleum systems, are net
importers of petroleum, have an existing petroleum transportation infrastructure and provide favorable commodity pricing,
royalty rates and tax rates to exploration and production companies. As of June 30, 2016, we held interests in
approximately 1.4 million net acres of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties in Turkey and Bulgaria.
As of August 8, 2016, approximately 36% of our outstanding common shares were beneficially owned by N. Malone
Mitchell 3rd, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors.
TransAtlantic is a holding company with two operating segments – Turkey and Bulgaria.  Its assets consist of its
ownership interest in subsidiaries that primarily own assets in Turkey and Bulgaria.
Decline in Oil Prices, Effect on Liquidity and Going Concern
Due to the significant decline in Brent crude oil prices during 2015, the borrowing base under the Company’s senior credit
facility (the “Senior Credit Facility”) with BNP Paribas (Suisse) SA (“BNP Paribas”) and the International Finance
Corporation (“IFC”, and together with BNP Paribas, the “Lenders”) was decreased to $5.4 million effective April 1, 2016.
The decline in the borrowing base resulted in a $18.8 million borrowing base deficiency under the Senior Credit Facility as
of June 30, 2016.
On April 19, 2016, we entered into a second waiver and consent to credit agreement (the “Second Waiver and Consent”)
with BNP Paribas and IFC, which granted us a conditional waiver of defaults under the Senior Credit Facility and the
current ratio financial covenant non-compliance at December 31, 2015, and March 31, June 30, and September 30,
2016.  The Second Waiver and Consent also permitted the borrowers to make certain limited transfers and withdrawals
from the collection accounts pledged to the Lenders under the Senior Credit Facility.  The Second Waiver and Consent
includes certain conditions, including that no borrowing base deficiency exist as of September 30, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, we had $24.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, a borrowing base
deficiency of $18.8 million and no availability.  In addition, we were not in compliance with certain covenants in the
Second Waiver and Consent, including the requirement to enter into a binding purchase and sale agreement for Thrace
Basin Natural Gas (Turkiye) Corporation (“TBNG”) by May 15, 2016.  We continue to work with the Lenders to satisfy these
conditions and restructure our Senior Credit Facility obligations.  Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we repaid $0.9 million of
principal under the Senior Credit Facility, reducing the outstanding balance to $23.3 million and the borrowing base
deficiency to $17.9 million as of August 8, 2016.  In addition, as of June 30, 2016 and August 8, 2016, the Lenders held
$7.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of restricted cash in our collection accounts in Turkey.
Given the unfavorable market conditions and our limited access to capital, we are focused on the following near-term
business strategies: (i) the sale of assets to raise cash, (ii) a significantly reduced development plan focused on
maintaining our acreage position by drilling obligation wells and performing low cost, high return well optimizations, (iii)
continued cost reduction measures to reduce our operating costs and general and administrative expenses, and (iv)
restructuring, repaying or refinancing our debt obligations, including the Senior Credit Facility and our convertible
notes.  During the second quarter of 2016, we engaged Seaport Global Inc. as an independent advisor, and our
management is actively pursuing improving our working capital position and/or restructuring our future debt service.
Notwithstanding these measures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully sell assets or cure, waive
or extend the deadline to repay the borrowing base deficiency repayment obligation.
These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial
statements included in this report do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of
recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Financial and Operational Performance Summary
The following is a summary of our financial and operational performance for the second quarter of 2016:
·We reported a $6.5 million net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
 ·We derived 82.9% of our oil and natural gas revenues from the production of oil and 17.1% from the production of natural
gas during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
 ·Total oil and natural gas sales revenues decreased 34.1% to $16.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, from
$24.5 million in the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a $12.84 decrease in the average price
received per barrel of oil equivalent (“Boe”) and a decrease in sales volumes of 61 Mboe.
 ·For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we incurred $0.9 million in capital expenditures, including seismic and corporate
expenditures, as compared to $4.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.
 ·As of June 30, 2016, not including unamortized deferred financing costs and liabilities held for sale, we had $55.0 million
in long-term debt and $29.7 million in short-term debt, as compared to $55.0 million in long-term debt and $41.9 million in
short-term debt as of December 31, 2015.  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we repaid $9.6 million in debt as we
continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet.
Second Quarter 2016 Operational Update
During the second quarter of 2016, we completed one well and continued workover and production optimizations in
Southeastern Turkey.  The following summarizes our operations by location during the second quarter of 2016:
Turkey-Southeast
In the second quarter of 2016, we re-tested the Catak-1 well and, subsequently, completed it as a Bedinan producer.  This
discovery well has allowed us to apply for, and be granted, a two-year extension on our West Molla license.  We are still in
the process of our electrification and gas utilization project in the Bahar field.  We expect to complete this project, which
will allow for further well optimization, this summer.
In Selmo, we continued facility modifications and upgrading the western pipeline extension.  We also performed minor
optimization and maintenance work.  Following the completion of the pipeline upgrades, we will be able to perform
additional production optimization work.
Turkey-Northwest
We did not engage in any new drilling activities during the second quarter of 2016, but spud the Guney Reisdere-1
obligation well (50% working interest) on August 2, 2016, and plan to resume workover activity in the third quarter of 2016.
Bulgaria
We continue to evaluate our position in Bulgaria with updated geologic models and continue to market a joint venture
exploration program for our assets in Bulgaria.
Planned Operations
We currently plan to execute the following activities under our reduced development plan during the remainder of 2016:
Turkey. We will continue our well optimizations in the Bahar and Selmo fields.  Upon spudding the Guney Reisdere-1
obligation well in August in the Thrace Basin, we have fulfilled all drilling obligations in Turkey to maintain our acreage
through the end of 2016.  We also continue to evaluate and perform secondary recovery and workover operations that we
expect to be cash flow positive at current oil prices.
Bulgaria.  We plan to continue working on our geologic model for additional prospects and continue to market a joint
venture exploration program for our assets in Bulgaria.
Discontinued Operations in Albania
In February 2016, we sold all of the outstanding equity in our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stream Oil & Gas Ltd. (“Stream”),
to GBC Oil Company Ltd. (“GBC Oil”) in exchange for (i) the future payment of $2.3 million to Raiffeisen Bank Sh.A.
(“Raiffeisen”) to pay down a term loan facility, and (ii) the assumption of $29.2 million of liabilities owed by Stream,
consisting of $23.1 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $6.1 million of debt.  TransAtlantic Albania Ltd.
(“TransAtlantic Albania”), Stream’s
23
wholly owned subsidiary, owns all of our former Albanian assets and operations.  In addition, GBC Oil issued us a warrant
pursuant to which we have the option to acquire up to 25% of the fully diluted equity interests in TransAtlantic Albania for
nominal consideration at any time on or before March 1, 2019.  Prior to the sale of Stream to GBC Oil, TransAtlantic
Albania entered into an assignment and assumption agreement pursuant to which TransAtlantic Albania will assign its
Delvina natural gas assets and $12.9 million of associated liabilities (the “Delvina Gas Liabilities”) to Delvina Gas
Company, Ltd. (“Delvina Gas”), our newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, to be effective immediately upon receipt of
required contractual consents. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required contractual consents.  In
addition, we agreed to indemnify GBC Oil and Stream for the Delvina Gas Liabilities.  We are currently negotiating a joint
venture with a third party for the purchase of a portion of Delvina Gas.  There is no assurance that we will be able to
complete a joint venture for the purchase of a portion of Delvina Gas.  If the Delvina natural gas assets are not transferred
to Delvina Gas due to a breach of the purchase agreement by GBC Oil or its affiliates, we believe we have contractual
damages claims that would offset any such indemnification obligations, including the account payable of approximately
$3.5 million (the “Account Payable”) owed by TransAtlantic Albania to Viking International Limited.  Subsequent to the
divestiture, we reduced the $12.9 million of indemnification liabilities to $9.5 million due to the cancellation of the Account
Payable.  We have presented the Albanian segment operating results as discontinued operations for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.
Discontinued Operations in Morocco
In June 2011, we decided to discontinue our Moroccan operations. We have substantially completed the process of
winding down our operations in Morocco. We have presented the Moroccan segment operating results as discontinued
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.
Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. Our
significant accounting policies are described in “Note 3. Significant accounting policies” to our audited consolidated
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and are of
particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of
significant judgment by management. These estimates are based on historical experience, information received from third
parties, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.

Oil and Natural Gas Sales. Total oil and natural gas sales revenues decreased $8.4 million to $16.2 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016, from $24.5 million realized in the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in the average realized price per Boe and reduced production.  Our average price received decreased $12.84
per Boe to $40.97 per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $53.81 per Boe for the same period in
2015.  Additionally, our average daily sales volumes decreased 671 Boepd for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to the same period in 2015.
Production. Production expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $3.1 million, or $6.81 per Boe,
from $3.3 million, or $6.40 per Boe, for the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to fewer workovers,
reduced headcount and successful cost-cutting measures in our field operations during the three months ended June 30,
2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.
Exploration, Abandonment and Impairment. Exploration, abandonment and impairment costs for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 decreased $4.0 million to $0.1 million, from $4.1 million for the same period in 2015.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $3.9 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016, compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2015.  Our general and administrative expenses decreased $2.8
million due to a $2.3 million decrease in personnel expenses, a $0.3 million decrease in office expenses, a $0.1 million
decrease in travel expenses and a $0.1 million decrease in legal, accounting and other services.
25
Depletion. Depletion decreased to $7.2 million, or $16.04 per Boe, for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to
$8.3 million, or $12.04 per Boe, for the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the net book
value of our Goksu field to zero during 2015, which resulted in lower depletion expense during the three months ended
June 30, 2016.
Interest and Other Expense. Interest and other expense decreased to $2.6 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016, compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to our lower average debt
balances during the three months ended June 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015.
Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income remained unchanged at $0.2 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, as compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2015.
Foreign Exchange Loss (Gain). We recorded a foreign exchange loss of $0.6 million during the three months ended June
30, 2016, as compared to a gain of $0.8 million in the same period in 2015. The foreign exchange loss is primarily
unrealized (non-cash) in nature and results from the re-measuring of specific transactions and monetary accounts in a
currency other than the functional currency. For example, a U.S. Dollar transaction which occurs in Turkey is re-measured
at the period-end to the New Turkish Lira (“TRY”) amount if it has not been settled previously. The foreign exchange loss
for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was due to a 2.1% decrease in the value of the TRY compared to the
U.S. Dollar, versus a 2.9% decrease in the value of the TRY for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Loss on Commodity Derivative Contracts. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss on
commodity derivative contracts of $3.0 million, as compared to a net loss of $3.3 million for the same period in 2015.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a $3.2 million loss to mark our commodity derivative contracts
to their fair value and a $0.2 million gain on settled contracts. During the same period in 2015, we recorded a $6.1 million
loss to mark our derivative contracts to their fair value and a $2.9 million gain on settled contracts.
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). We record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating
the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting
currency.  Foreign currency translation adjustment for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to a loss of $2.3
million from a loss of $4.9 million for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in foreign currency translation loss in the
three months ended June 30, 2016 was due to a 2.1% decrease in the value of the TRY as compared to the U.S. Dollar,
versus a 2.9% decrease in the value of the TRY for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Discontinued Operations. All revenues and expenses associated with our Albanian and Moroccan operations have been
classified as discontinued operations.  Our operating results from discontinued operations in Albania and Morocco are

Oil and Natural Gas Sales. Total oil and natural gas sales revenues decreased $19.2 million to $30.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, from $49.9 million realized in the same period in 2015.  The decrease was primarily due to a
decrease in the average realized price per Boe and reduced production.  Our average price received decreased $15.12
per Boe to $36.97 per Boe for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $52.09 per Boe for the same period in
2015.  Additionally, our average daily sales volumes decreased 734 Boepd for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to the same period in 2015.
Production. Production expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $6.0 million, or $6.28 per Boe,
from $7.0 million, or $6.35 per Boe, for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in Turkey was primarily due to fewer
workovers, reduced headcount and successful cost-cutting measures in our field operations during the six months ended
June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.
Exploration, Abandonment and Impairment. Exploration, abandonment and impairment costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 decreased $3.0 million to $1.4 million, from $4.4 million for the same period in 2015. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, we incurred proved property impairment of $1.4 million.
27
General and Administrative. General and administrative expense was $8.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2015.  Our general and administrative expenses decreased $5.1 million
due to a $4.5 million decrease in personnel expenses, a $0.6 million decrease in office expenses and a $0.3 million
decrease in travel expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in legal, accounting and other services of $0.4
million.
Depletion. Depletion decreased to $14.8 million, or $15.63 per Boe, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to
$18.7 million, or $17.05 per Boe, for the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the net
book value of our Goksu field to zero during 2015, which resulted in lower depletion expense during the six months ended
June 30, 2016.
Interest and Other Expense. Interest and other expense decreased to $5.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to $6.5 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to our lower average debt balances
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015.
Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income remained unchanged at $0.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, as compared to $0.4 million for the same period in 2015.
Foreign Exchange Loss. We recorded a foreign exchange loss of $0.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016,
as compared to a loss of $5.6 million in the same period in 2015. The foreign exchange loss is primarily unrealized (non-
cash) in nature and results from the re-measuring of specific transactions and monetary accounts in a currency other than
the functional currency. For example, a U.S. Dollar transaction which occurs in Turkey is re-measured at the period-end to
the TRY amount if it has not been settled previously. The foreign exchange loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016
was due to a 1.0% decrease in the value of the TRY compared to the U.S. Dollar, versus a 15.8% decrease in the value of
the TRY for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
(Loss) Gain on Commodity Derivative Contracts. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss on
commodity derivative contracts of $2.2 million, as compared to a net gain of $0.5 million for the same period in 2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a $3.7 million loss to mark our commodity derivative contracts to
their fair value and a $1.5 million gain on settled contracts. During the same period in 2015, we recorded a $6.7 million
loss to mark our derivative contracts to their fair value and a $7.2 million gain on settled contracts.
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). We record foreign currency translation adjustments from the process of translating
the functional currency of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting
currency.  Foreign currency translation adjustment for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to a gain of $0.7
million from a loss of $28.5 million for the same period in 2015.  The increase in foreign currency translation adjustments in
the six months ended June 30, 2016 was due to a 1.0% decrease in the value of the TRY as compared to the U.S. Dollar,
versus a 15.8% decrease in the value of the TRY for the six months ended June 30, 2015.

Capital Expenditures
For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we incurred $0.9 million in capital expenditures, including seismic and corporate
expenditures, as compared to $4.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015.  The decrease was due to our planned
reduction in our capital expenditures during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
We expect our net field capital expenditures for the remainder of 2016 to range between $2.0 million and $10.0 million in
Turkey for obligation wells and low cost, high return well optimizations. We do not anticipate material capital expenditures
in Bulgaria during the remainder of 2016. We expect cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund
our remaining 2016 net field capital expenditures. If not, we will either curtail our discretionary capital expenditures or seek
other funding sources. Our projected 2016 capital expenditure budget is subject to change.
Cash Flows
Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was
$11.6 million, a decrease from net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $28.2 million during
the same period in 2015, due primarily to a decrease in our oil and natural gas sales and a decrease in cash settlements
on our commodity derivative contracts.  Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $6.7 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities from continuing
operations of $13.3 million for the same period in 2015, due primarily to a decrease in drilling operations in light of the low
oil price environment.  Additionally, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 was $10.5 million, an increase from net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations
of $1.1 million for the same period in 2015, due primarily to a decrease in our borrowings and higher loan repayments in
2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On a consolidated basis, as of June 30, 2016, TransAtlantic had $84.7 million of indebtedness, not including $14.9 million
of trade payables, as further described below.  TransAtlantic believes that its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to
meet its normal operating requirements and to fund planned capital expenditures during the next 12 months.
Outstanding Debt
At June 30, 2016, we had a Senior Credit Facility, a credit facility with a Turkish bank, convertible notes, and promissory
notes, all of which are discussed below.
29
Senior Credit Facility. On May 6, 2014, DMLP, Ltd. (“DMLP”), TransAtlantic Exploration Mediterranean International Pty
Ltd (“TEMI”), Talon Exploration, Ltd. (“Talon Exploration”), TransAtlantic Turkey, Ltd. (“TransAtlantic Turkey”), Amity Oil
International Pty Ltd, (“Amity”) and Petrogas Petrol Gaz ve Petrokimya Urunleri Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (“Petrogas”)
(collectively the “Borrowers”) entered into the Senior Credit Facility with BNP Paribas and the IFC. Each of the Borrowers
is our wholly owned subsidiary. The Senior Credit Facility is guaranteed by us and each of TransAtlantic Petroleum (USA)
Corp. (“TransAtlantic USA”) and TransAtlantic Worldwide, Ltd. (each, a “Guarantor”).  As of June 30, 2016, we had
borrowings of $24.2 million, bearing interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum (5.63% at June 30,
2016), except as described below.  Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Credit Facility, the borrowing base resets on the
first day of each fiscal quarter. The April 2016 redetermination resulted in a $18.8 million borrowing base deficiency under
the Senior Credit Facility as of June 30, 2016.  The borrowing base was $5.4 million as of June 30, 2016.
On April 19, 2016, the Company entered into the Second Waiver and Consent with BNP Paribas and IFC. Pursuant to the
Second Waiver and Consent, the Lenders provided a conditional waiver of the defaults under the Credit Agreement and
permitted the Borrowers to make certain limited transfers and withdrawals from the collection accounts pledged to the
Lenders under the Senior Credit Facility.  The Second Waiver and Consent also waived non-compliance with the current
ratio financial covenant in the Senior Credit Facility on each of December 31, 2015 and March 31, June 30, and
September 30, 2016.
The Second Waiver and Consent included certain conditions, including the following:
(i)The borrowing base deficiency must be repaid by September 30, 2016 (provided that the Lenders may, in their sole and
absolute discretion, agree in writing to extend such date to December 31, 2016) (the “Waiver Period”);
(ii)
All monthly hedge settlement proceeds shall be used to pay down debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility;
All monthly hedge settlement proceeds shall be used to pay down debt outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility;
(iii)Net proceeds from certain asset sales shall be used to prepay loans outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility;
 (iv)On or before May 15, 2016, the Company shall have entered into a binding purchase and sale agreement for the sale
of all of the equity interests in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, TBNG;
(v)By June 30, 2016, the Lenders shall be granted a security interest over all of the equity interests in, and assets and
property of, TBNG; and
(vi)On or before September 30, 2016, all holders of the 13% Convertible Notes Due 2017 issued by the Company (the
“2017 Notes”) shall either (a) convert their debt interests under the 2017 Notes into equity interests, or (b) agree to
extend the maturity of the 2017 Notes to April 1, 2019 or later on substantially identical terms.
Pursuant to the Second Waiver and Consent, as of April 19, 2016, the Lenders’ aggregate commitments were reduced to
$30.5 million, with individual commitments of $15.2 million each, and shall be further reduced by the amount of any
payments under the Senior Credit Facility.  During the Waiver Period, interest on the borrowing base deficiency will accrue
at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 7.00% per annum (7.63% at May 6, 2016).
As of June 30, 2016, we had $24.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, a borrowing base
deficiency of $18.8 million and no availability.  In addition, we were not in compliance with certain covenants in the
Second Waiver and Consent, including the requirement to enter into a binding purchase and sale agreement for TBNG by
May 15, 2016.  We continue to work with the Lenders to satisfy these conditions and restructure our Senior Credit Facility
obligations.  Subsequent to June 30, 2016, we repaid $0.9 million of principal under the Senior Credit Facility, reducing
the outstanding balance to $23.3 million and the borrowing base deficiency to $17.9 million, as of August 8, 2016.  In
addition, as of June 30, 2016 and August 8, 2016, the Lenders held $7.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of
restricted cash in our collection accounts in Turkey.
As of August 8, 2016, we had granted a security interest in favor of the Lenders over all of the equity interests in, and
moveable assets of, TBNG, and were in the process of granting a security interest in favor of the Lenders over all present
and future receivables of TBNG. We are also in active negotiations with third party purchasers for the sale of TBNG. We
have engaged Seaport Global Inc. as an independent advisor, and our management is actively pursuing alternate
structures for the 2017 Notes.
TBNG Credit Facility. TBNG has a fully-drawn credit facility with a Turkish bank.  During the second quarter of 2016, the
facility was amended and the monthly principal installments were deferred until August 29, 2016.  The facility may be
prepaid without penalty. The facility is secured by a lien on a Turkish real estate property owned by Gundem Turizm
Yatirim ve Isletmeleri Anonim Sirketi (“Gundem”), which is 97.5% beneficially owned by Mr. Mitchell and his children. At
June 30, 2016, TBNG owed $0.9 million under the credit facility and had no availability.
30
2017 Notes.  At June 30, 2016, we had $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes.  The 2017 Notes bear
interest at an annual rate of 13.0% per annum.  Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on January 1 and July 1 of
each year.  The 2017 Notes mature on July 1, 2017.  The 2017 Notes are convertible at any time, at the election of a
holder, into our common shares at a conversion price of $6.80 per share.
On June 30, 2016, we issued 2,905,737 common shares in a private placement to certain holders of the 2017 Notes, at the
election of such holders to receive common shares in lieu of cash interest on the 2017 Notes.
West Promissory Notes. In August 2015, TransAtlantic USA entered into promissory notes (the “Promissory Notes”) with
each of Mary West CRT 2 LLC and Gary West CRT 2 LLC, shareholders of the Company (collectively, the “Holders”),
whereby TransAtlantic USA could borrow up to $1.5 million under each Promissory Note to fund our share repurchase
program. The Holders are managed by Randy Rochman, an observer of our board of directors.  Loans under the
Promissory Notes accrue interest at a rate of 9.00% per annum and mature on October 1, 2016.  As of June 30, 2016, we
had borrowed $1.0 million under the Promissory Notes and had no availability. The funds were used to purchase our
common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program.
ANBE Note. On December 30, 2015, TransAtlantic USA entered into a $5.0 million draw down convertible promissory
note (the “Note”) with ANBE Holdings, L.P. (“ANBE”), an entity owned by the children of the Company’s chairman and
chief executive officer, N. Malone Mitchell 3rd, and controlled by an entity managed by Mr. Mitchell and his wife. The Note
bears interest at a rate of 13.0% per annum.  On December 30, 2015, the Company borrowed $3.6 million under the Note
(the “Initial Advance”) for general corporate purposes.
On June 30, 2016, TransAtlantic USA entered into an extension of the Note (the “Extension”) with ANBE.  The Extension
extended the date on which the Company could request advances under the Note from June 15, 2016 to August 15, 2016
and extended the maturity date of the Note from June 30, 2016 to August 31, 2016.  As of June 30, 2016, we had borrowed
$3.6 million under the Note and had availability of $1.4 million.
Advances under the Note may be converted, at the election of ANBE, any time after the NYSE MKT approves the
Company’s application to list the additional common shares issuable pursuant to the conversion feature of the Note and
prior to the maturity of the Note.  The conversion price per common share for each advance is equal to 105% of the closing
price of the Company’s common shares on the NYSE MKT on the trading date immediately prior to such advance.  The
conversion price of the Initial Advance is $1.3755 per share.
On June 30, 2016, we issued 355,826 common shares in a private placement to ANBE in lieu of cash interest on the Note.
Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Our derivative contracts may expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our counterparty. One of the
Lenders is a counterparty to our derivative contracts. While collateral is generally not required to be posted by
counterparties, credit risk associated with derivative instruments is minimized by entering into derivative instruments only
with creditworthy counterparties that are generally large financial institutions. Additionally, master netting agreements are
used to mitigate risk of loss due to default with counterparties on derivative instruments. These agreements allow us to
offset our asset position with our liability position in the event of default by the counterparty.
During the second quarter of 2016, there were no material changes in market risk exposures or their management that
would affect the Quantitative or Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The following tables set forth our outstanding derivatives contracts, which are
settled based on Brent crude oil pricing, with respect to future crude oil production as of June 30, 2016:

Item 4.Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of June 30, 2016, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon the evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Accordingly, even
effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurances of achieving their control objectives.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended June 30,
2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 5.Other Information
RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES
The following table sets forth our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the six months ended June 30, 2016. You should
read this ratio in connection with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.  Because we did not have preferred stock outstanding during this period, our ratio of earnings to
combined fixed charges and preferred dividends for any given period is equivalent to our ratio of earnings to fixed charges.

Deficiency of earnings to fixed charges (in thousands)  (13,784)
For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, “earnings” represents income (loss) from continuing
operations before income taxes plus fixed charges. “Fixed charges” includes interest expense, capitalized interest,
amortization of discount and capitalized expenses related to indebtedness and the portion of rental expense that
management believes is representative of the interest component of rental expense. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges
presented in this Form 10-Q may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may
not be comparable to corresponding measures used in our various agreements, including the Senior Credit Facility.
