<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all 
</p>
<p>human rights by older persons, Rosa Kornfeld-Matte, pursuant to Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 24/20. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Independent Expert 
</b></p>
<p>2. During the reporting period, the Independent Expert visited the following countries: 
</p>
<p>Slovenia, from 17 to 21 November 2014 (see A/HRC/30/43/Add.1); Austria, from 22 to 30 
</p>
<p>January 2015 (see A/HRC/30/43/Add.2) and Mauritius, from 28 April to 8 May 2015 (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/30/43/Add.3). She expresses her appreciation to the Governments of those 
</p>
<p>countries for their cooperation before and during her visits. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert has identified elder abuse as a priority area for her mandate, 
</p>
<p>and has participated in a number of events addressing this issue during the past year. On 12 
</p>
<p>September 2014, she participated in a side event on &#8220;Elder abuse and violence against 
women: a global crisis&#8221;. The event was organized by the Permanent Mission of the United 
States of America to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva 
</p>
<p>on the margins of the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council. In her 
</p>
<p>statement, she highlighted the importance of large-scale research, data and indicators, and 
</p>
<p>legal and institutional mechanisms to tackle elder abuse effectively. 
</p>
<p>4. She also participated in a side event on the occasion of the United Nations World 
</p>
<p>Elder Abuse Awareness Day on 15 June 2015, entitled &#8220;Falling between the cracks: abuse 
and violence against older women &#8212; marking World Elder Abuse Awareness Day&#8212;10 
years on&#8221;, co-organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Geneva NGO Committee on Ageing, with the support of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Population Fund and several civil society organizations in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>5. In her statement, the Independent Expert drew specific attention to the 
</p>
<p>recommendations in the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing on elder abuse, 
</p>
<p>including against older women, and called for their implementation. She also encouraged 
</p>
<p>further cooperation among all actors to combat all forms of abuse and violence against 
</p>
<p>older persons and to promote the human rights of these persons. 
</p>
<p>6. Also on 15 June, she participated through a video statement, in a conference on 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tackling elder abuse in Europe: a renewed commitment or a missed opportunity?&#8221;, which 
was organized in Brussels by the Council of Europe, the European Commission, AGE 
</p>
<p>Platform Europe and the European Network of National Human Rights Institutions. She 
</p>
<p>highlighted the positive initiatives that had been undertaken at the regional level, and 
</p>
<p>recalling the obligations of Member States, urged them to renew their commitments to 
</p>
<p>ensuring that older persons lived free from abuse and violence in all circumstances. 
</p>
<p>7. Marking the twenty-fourth anniversary of the United Nations International Day of 
</p>
<p>Older Persons in Geneva, on 1 October 2014, the Independent Expert participated in a side 
</p>
<p>event entitled &#8220;Leaving no one behind: promoting a society for all&#8221;. In her address, she 
emphasized the need for a holistic approach to protecting and respecting the human rights 
</p>
<p>of older persons to address the challenges they faced on a daily basis.  
</p>
<p>8. The issue of care is another thematic priority for the mandate holder. In her video 
</p>
<p>message of 8 October 2014, in the context of the Conference on Human Rights of Older 
</p>
<p>Persons in Long-term Care, organized in Brussels by the European Commission and the 
</p>
<p>European Network of National Human Rights Institutions, she advocated for a human 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach for older persons in long-term care, in order to ensure a life of 
</p>
<p>dignity for them. She also addressed the Group of 7 third Global Dementia Legacy Event in </p>


<p>Japan through a statement on 5 November 2014, highlighting the importance of a human 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach when addressing dementia, innovation in care and risk reduction. 
</p>
<p>9. On 16 and 17 March 2015, she delivered a keynote speech at the World Health 
</p>
<p>Organization&#8217;s first Ministerial Conference on Global Action against Dementia, held in 
Geneva. She stressed the importance of considering older persons with dementia as rights 
</p>
<p>holders and States as duty bearers with international obligations to respect, protect and 
</p>
<p>promote human rights. The Independent Expert was pleased to note that, for the first time, 
</p>
<p>States were integrating a human rights-based approach into their call for action against 
</p>
<p>dementia, which was adopted on 17 March as an outcome of the conference.  
</p>
<p>10. The Independent Expert is mandated to pay particular attention to different groups 
</p>
<p>of older persons, including refugees and climate-displaced persons, as well as persons 
</p>
<p>facing conflict, emergency or disaster situations. On 18 March 2015, she participated in a 
</p>
<p>side event in Geneva on the margins of the twenty-eighth session of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, on &#8220;Building climate resilience: the rights of groups in focus&#8221;, organized jointly 
by OHCHR, Displacement Solutions and the Applied Research Association on Justice, 
</p>
<p>Peace and Development.  
</p>
<p>11. On 11 June 2015, the Independent Expert participated in a follow-up expert round-
</p>
<p>table discussion on &#8220;Climate displacement and human rights&#8221; at the Centre for 
Humanitarian Dialogue, Geneva. In her presentation, she highlighted the fact that older 
</p>
<p>persons were disproportionately affected by climate change, and referred to initiatives that 
</p>
<p>took into consideration the specific needs of older persons, such as the IASC (Inter-Agency 
</p>
<p>Standing Committee) Operational Guidelines on the Protection of Persons in Situations of 
</p>
<p>Natural Disasters, the Peninsula Principles on Climate Displacement within States, and the 
</p>
<p>Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which had been adopted at the 
</p>
<p>Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, held in Sendai, Japan, 
</p>
<p>from 14 to 18 March 2015.  
</p>
<p>12. In accordance with her mandate, the Independent Expert also continued to work in 
</p>
<p>close coordination with the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing, and attended its sixth 
</p>
<p>session, which was held in New York from 14 to 16 July 2015. As a member of the panel 
</p>
<p>on recent policy developments and initiatives concerning the human rights of older persons, 
</p>
<p>she provided an overview of positive initiatives and remaining challenges for the full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of all human rights by older persons.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Autonomy and care 
</b></p>
<p>13. It is estimated that by 2050 over 20 per cent of the world&#8217;s population will be 60 
years of age or older. While the increase in the number of older persons will be the greatest 
</p>
<p>and the most rapid in the developing world, Asia is the region with the largest number of 
</p>
<p>older persons, and Africa is facing the largest proportionate growth.  
</p>
<p>14. In 2011, the Secretary-General, in his report on the follow-up to the Second World 
</p>
<p>Assembly on Ageing, stated:  
</p>
<p>With this in mind, enhanced attention to the particular needs and challenges faced by 
</p>
<p>many older people is clearly required. Just as important, however, is the essential 
</p>
<p>contribution the majority of older men and women can continue to make to the 
</p>
<p>functioning of society if adequate guarantees are in place. Human rights lie at the 
</p>
<p>core of all efforts in this regard.1 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See A/66/173, para. 4.  </p>


<p>15. Whereas older persons are often seen as a homogeneous group, this group is in fact 
</p>
<p>the most heterogeneous of all age groups. Some persons may be in good health and may be 
</p>
<p>able to live independently or autonomously throughout their lives; but others will become 
</p>
<p>increasingly dependent on the help of others in old age for several reasons&#8212;such as illness, 
impairments or loss of mobility&#8212;and may require varying degrees of specific care.  
</p>
<p>16. Ensuring that older persons are in a position to lead autonomous lives to the greatest 
</p>
<p>extent possible&#8212;irrespective of their physical, mental and other conditions&#8212;requires a 
radical change in the way society perceives ageing. There is a need to foster age-sensitive 
</p>
<p>communities and age-friendly environments to help older persons retain their autonomy and 
</p>
<p>be active, and be integrated effectively in all aspects of life.  
</p>
<p>17. It is therefore essential to move away from a needs-based and biomedical approach 
</p>
<p>that focuses on disease and functional dependency to an all-encompassing human rights-
</p>
<p>based approach in which the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons becomes an 
</p>
<p>integral part of all policies and programmes affecting them, including care planning and 
</p>
<p>delivery. 
</p>
<p>18. Ageist attitudes still persist throughout the world, leading to discriminatory practices 
</p>
<p>towards older persons, including in care settings. Age-based discrimination generates a lack 
</p>
<p>of self-esteem and disempowerment, and undermines an older person&#8217;s perception of 
autonomy. This is particularly true when they are in need of care to maintain or regain 
</p>
<p>autonomy. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Autonomy 
</b></p>
<p>19. Autonomy is a core principle of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities. Even though ageing should not be associated with disability, this legal 
</p>
<p>framework could be applied to older persons with disabilities and could provide guidance 
</p>
<p>on the scope of the concept of autonomy.  
</p>
<p>20. The Convention, in its preamble, recognizes the importance for persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities to have their individual autonomy and independence, including the freedom to 
</p>
<p>make their own choices. Article 3 (a) refers to respect for inherent dignity and individual 
</p>
<p>autonomy, including the freedom to make one&#8217;s own choices, and the independence of 
persons.  
</p>
<p>21. The Convention also refers to autonomy in relation to health care and recovery from 
</p>
<p>violence or abuse. Article 25 (b) requires that health services be designed to minimize and 
</p>
<p>prevent further disabilities, including among children and older persons. Article 19 provides 
</p>
<p>further guidance on measures that should be adopted to facilitate independent living and the 
</p>
<p>full inclusion and participation of older persons with disabilities in the community. 
</p>
<p>22. The United Nations Principles for Older Persons refer to the principle of 
</p>
<p>independence to describe the importance for older persons to have access to adequate food, 
</p>
<p>water, shelter, clothing and health care, through the provision of income, family and 
</p>
<p>community support and self-help. Older persons should also have the opportunity to find 
</p>
<p>remunerated work or have access to education and training to allow them to live 
</p>
<p>independently.  
</p>
<p>23. In accordance with the Principles, participation is to be understood as ensuring that 
</p>
<p>older persons are actively involved in formulating and implementing policies that affect 
</p>
<p>their well-being, sharing their knowledge and skills with younger generations, and being 
</p>
<p>able to form movements and associations.  
</p>
<p>24. The section on self-fulfilment foresees that older persons should be able to pursue 
</p>
<p>opportunities for their full development through having access to the educational, cultural, </p>


<p>spiritual and recreational resources of their societies. Autonomy is referred to in the 
</p>
<p>Principles in relation to care. 
</p>
<p>25. The Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing recommends, among other 
</p>
<p>things, taking into account the needs and concerns of older persons in decision-making at 
</p>
<p>all levels, including their participation in the labour market and in voluntary activities, 
</p>
<p>access to knowledge, education and literacy, numeracy and technological training, and to 
</p>
<p>social protection and security.  
</p>
<p>26. The Inter-American Convention on Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons, 
</p>
<p>which has recently been adopted and is open for ratification, includes, as core principles, 
</p>
<p>the dignity, independence, proactivity and autonomy of older persons. For the first time, 
</p>
<p>independence and autonomy are explicitly mentioned as rights per se, in article 7. This 
</p>
<p>encompasses the right to make decisions, to determine a life plan, to lead an autonomous 
</p>
<p>and independent life in keeping with traditions and beliefs. Article 11 further specifies the 
</p>
<p>right to give free and informed consent on health matters.  
</p>
<p>27. Other non-binding instruments include the San Jos&#233; Charter on the Rights of Older 
</p>
<p>Persons in Latin America and the Caribbean, which states in its preamble that the political, 
</p>
<p>public and social participation of older persons is a fundamental human right, as well as 
</p>
<p>respect for their autonomy and independence in decision-making. It also refers, in 
</p>
<p>paragraph 7, to autonomy when addressing the right to free and informed prior consent for 
</p>
<p>any medical intervention, regardless of age, health or treatment. The principle of autonomy 
</p>
<p>is also addressed in reference to the need to create and guarantee the social services 
</p>
<p>necessary to provide care for older persons, taking into account their specific characteristics 
</p>
<p>and needs, and to promote their independence, autonomy and dignity. In paragraph 10, the 
</p>
<p>Charter encourages the improvement of living conditions and environment to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>autonomy and independence of older persons. 
</p>
<p>28. In Europe, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in article 25, 
</p>
<p>calls on member States to recognize and respect the rights of the elderly to lead a life of 
</p>
<p>dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life. In addition, the 
</p>
<p>European Social Charter, in article 23, stipulates the right of elderly persons to social 
</p>
<p>protection, enabling them, among other things, to choose their lifestyle freely and to lead 
</p>
<p>independent lives in their familiar surroundings for as long as they wish and are able, by 
</p>
<p>means of the provision of housing suited to their needs and state of health or of adequate 
</p>
<p>support for adapting their housing. 
</p>
<p>29. More recently, the Council of Europe, in its recommendation on the promotion of 
</p>
<p>human rights of older persons, made explicit references to autonomy. In particular, it stated 
</p>
<p>that older persons are entitled to lead their lives independently, in a self-determined and 
</p>
<p>autonomous manner. This means, inter alia, taking decisions independently on all issues 
</p>
<p>that concern them, including in relation to property, income, finance, place of residence, 
</p>
<p>health, medical treatment or care, and funeral arrangements.  
</p>
<p>30. In this regard, autonomy is understood in the Council of Europe recommendation on 
</p>
<p>the promotion of human rights of older persons  as including the right to participate fully in 
</p>
<p>social, cultural, educational and training activities, as well as in public life; the right to 
</p>
<p>privacy and family life; legal capacity and the right to receive appropriate support when 
</p>
<p>making decisions and exercising their legal capacity should they feel the need for it, 
</p>
<p>including by appointing a trusted third party of their own choice to help with their decisions 
</p>
<p>and adopt safeguards in order to avoid abuses (see paras. 9-15). 
</p>
<p>31. The draft protocol to the African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights on the 
rights of older persons in Africa uses the term &#8220;independence&#8221; as a core principle. Article 3 
provides that &#8220;States parties shall ensure that the principles of independence, dignity, self-
fulfillment, participation and care of older persons are included in their national laws and 
</p>
<p>are legally binding as the basis for ensuring their rights&#8221;. Article 7, entitled &#8220;Right to make 
decisions&#8221;, contains an implicit reference to autonomy by mentioning that States should </p>


<p>ensure that appropriate legislation exists that recognizes the rights of older persons to make 
</p>
<p>decisions regarding their own well-being without undue interference from family and 
</p>
<p>affiliated groups, and that older persons have the right to appoint a party of their choice to 
</p>
<p>carry out their wishes and instructions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Care 
</b></p>
<p>32. Care, in turn, has been referred to as part of the right to social security, including 
</p>
<p>social insurance, and the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
</p>
<p>standard of physical and mental health. Article 25 (1) of the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights states that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the 
</p>
<p>health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and 
</p>
<p>medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of 
</p>
<p>unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in 
</p>
<p>circumstances beyond his control. Articles 9 and 12 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights refer to social security, including social insurance, 
</p>
<p>and health care, respectively. 
</p>
<p>33. The United Nations Principles for Older Persons dedicate a specific section to the 
</p>
<p>subject of care. They include references to family, community and institutional care, access 
</p>
<p>to health care and to social and legal services to enhance the autonomy of older persons. 
</p>
<p>They also stress that older persons should be able to enjoy their human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms when residing in any shelter, care or treatment facility, including full 
</p>
<p>respect for their dignity, beliefs, needs and privacy, and for the right to make decisions 
</p>
<p>about their care and the quality of their lives. There is no reference to the concept of self-
</p>
<p>care.  
</p>
<p>34. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interpreted the right to 
</p>
<p>health in an inclusive manner, extending the concept not only to the provision of timely and 
</p>
<p>appropriate health care, but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to 
</p>
<p>safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and 
</p>
<p>housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, and access to health-related 
</p>
<p>education and information, including on sexual and reproductive health.  
</p>
<p>35. The Committee underlined the importance of the participation of the population in 
</p>
<p>all health-related decision-making.2 It also recommended that health policies should range 
</p>
<p>from prevention and rehabilitation to the care of the terminally ill,3 including periodical 
</p>
<p>check-ups for both sexes; physical as well as psychological rehabilitative measures aimed 
</p>
<p>at maintaining the functionality and autonomy of older persons; and attention and care for 
</p>
<p>chronically and terminally ill persons, sparing them avoidable pain and enabling them to 
</p>
<p>die with dignity.4  
</p>
<p>36. The Committee has further emphasized that the growing number of chronic, 
</p>
<p>degenerative diseases and the high hospitalization costs involved cannot be dealt with only 
</p>
<p>by curative treatment. In this regard, States should bear in mind that maintaining health into 
</p>
<p>old age requires investments during the entire life span, basically through the adoption of 
</p>
<p>healthy lifestyles. Prevention, through regular checks suited to the needs of the elderly, 
</p>
<p>plays a decisive role, as does rehabilitation, by maintaining the functional capacities of 
</p>
<p>elderly persons, with a resulting decrease in the cost of investments in health care and 
</p>
<p>social services.5 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p> 4 General comment No.14, para. 25.  
</p>
<p> 
5 General comment No. 6, para. 35.  </p>


<p>37. The Committee also noted that national policies should help older people to continue 
</p>
<p>to live in their own homes as long as possible, through the restoration, development and 
</p>
<p>improvement of homes and their adaptation to the ability of those persons to gain access to 
</p>
<p>and use them.6  
</p>
<p>38. In addition, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities includes the 
</p>
<p>concept of &#8220;universal design&#8221;, which may be of benefit to older persons. It is defined, in 
article 2, as the design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by 
</p>
<p>all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized 
</p>
<p>design and develops State obligations regarding the promotion of the availability and use of 
</p>
<p>universally designed goods, services, equipment and facilities. 
</p>
<p>39. The Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing recommends the establishment 
</p>
<p>of preventive and curative care, including rehabilitation and sexual health care, recognizing 
</p>
<p>that health-promotion and disease-prevention activities throughout life need to focus on 
</p>
<p>maintaining independence, on prevention, and on avoidance of delay in disease treatment, 
</p>
<p>as well as on improving the health and quality of life of older persons who already have a 
</p>
<p>disability.  
</p>
<p>40. Particular actions are encouraged to provide counsel and guide persons on healthy 
</p>
<p>lifestyles and self-care.7 Detailed actions are designed to further encourage the adoption of 
</p>
<p>care measures that take into account age and the diversity of older persons, including 
</p>
<p>primary care, acute care, rehabilitation, long-term and palliative care, self-care and 
</p>
<p>gerontological services, provided both by formal and informal caregivers. Special attention 
</p>
<p>is given to the importance of developing housing options for older persons that encourage 
</p>
<p>and reduce barriers to independence, including in public spaces, transportation and other 
</p>
<p>services.8 
</p>
<p>41. At the regional level, the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights recognizes 
the right to health and the role played by the family in society, and the right of older 
</p>
<p>persons to special measures of protection in keeping with their physical or moral needs 
</p>
<p>(arts. 16 and 18). The draft protocol to the Charter on the rights of older persons in Africa 
</p>
<p>makes clear mention of care and support and access to health services, including in conflict 
</p>
<p>and disaster situations. For instance, according to article 12, States should identify, promote 
</p>
<p>and strengthen traditional support systems, including medical home based care, to enhance 
</p>
<p>the ability of families and communities to care for older family members and adopt policies 
</p>
<p>and legislation that provide incentives to all stakeholders including adult children, to 
</p>
<p>support older persons in their communities, ensuring that they remain at home for as long 
</p>

<p>42. In the Americas, the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes the right to social 
</p>
<p>security and the right to health (arts. 9 and 10). Moreover, the Inter-American Convention 
</p>
<p>on Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons dedicates an article to the right of older 
</p>
<p>persons to receive long-term care, while maintaining their independence and autonomy. A 
</p>
<p>comprehensive approach to the right to health has been adopted in article 19, by including 
</p>
<p>health promotion, prevention and care of disease at all stages, including rehabilitation and 
</p>
<p>palliative care.  
</p>
<p>43. In Europe, the Council of Europe recommendation on the promotion of human 
</p>
<p>rights of older persons dedicates a specific title to care, in which it recommends that States 
</p>
<p>promote a multidimensional approach to health and social care for older persons and 
</p>
<p>encourage cooperation among the competent services. It mentions several measures,

</p>
<p><b> B. Autonomy 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Definition and scope 
</b></p>
<p>44. Autonomy refers to the principle or right of individuals or groups of individuals to 
</p>
<p>determine their own rules and preferences. It includes the freedom and capacity to make 
</p>
<p>one&#8217;s own decisions and the legal capacity to exercise those decisions. Autonomy 
encompasses three main elements: an individual aspect, which includes the capacity to 
</p>
<p>make decisions; an economic and financial aspect, understood as self-sufficiency and the 
</p>
<p>ability to generate and receive income; and a societal aspect, which means the existence of 
</p>
<p>communities and environments that are age-sensitive and age-friendly in order to ensure 
</p>
<p>that older persons are able to decide or act for themselves.  
</p>
<p>45. The full enjoyment of autonomy has broad scope, including not only the right to 
</p>
<p>equal recognition before the law, legal capacity, dignity, self-determination, empowerment 
</p>
<p>and decision-making, but also the right to choose where to live, the right to work, the right 
</p>
<p>to vote and to the right to participate actively in all spheres of society. The denial or 
</p>
<p>restriction of legal capacity directly impacts the autonomy of older persons, as they will no 
</p>
<p>longer be able to exercise these other rights, including making decisions regarding civil, 
</p>
<p>commercial, administrative, judicial or health-related matters concerning their well-being.  
</p>
<p>46. Autonomy and independence are mutually reinforcing and are often used 
</p>
<p>interchangeably in legal instruments and frameworks. While autonomy refers to the ability 
</p>
<p>to exercise freedom of choice and control over decisions affecting one&#8217;s life, including with 
the help of someone if needed, independence means to live in the community without 
</p>
<p>assistance or, at least, where the amount of help does not subject older persons to the 
</p>
<p>decisions of others. In that sense, the concept of independence is broader than autonomy, 
</p>
<p>while autonomy may better reflect the reality of older persons, considering that with age, 
</p>
<p>the need for assistance tends to increase. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal capacity and equal recognition before the law 
</b></p>
<p>47. Various tools exist to measure the degree of physical, cognitive and psychological 
</p>
<p>autonomy, which take into account: mobility, communication and tasks performed on a 
</p>
<p>daily basis to determine the degree of functional and mental autonomy of an older person. 
</p>
<p>In terms of a human rights-based approach, however, the individual aspect of autonomy 
</p>
<p>refers not only to functional autonomy but also mainly to the right to equal recognition 
</p>
<p>before the law and legal capacity. This implies being recognized as a legal person before 
</p>
<p>the law and having the ability to exercise rights as a legal person. Consequently, the will 
</p>
<p>and preferences of older persons are respected, which allows for the exercise of free and 
</p>
<p>informed consent. Older persons should therefore be consulted about and involved in any 
</p>
<p>decision affecting their well-being. 
</p>
<p>48. Legal capacity is a key aspect of autonomy, allowing older persons to exercise civil, 
</p>
<p>political, economic, social and cultural rights. In circumstances where an older person is 
</p>
<p>partially or completely unable to look after their own interests because of a mental 
</p>
<p>condition, such as dementia, or an extreme state of physical frailty, there may be a need for 
</p>
<p>supported decision making. There is a need to ensure, however, that in such instances a 
</p>
<p>person is not stripped of his or her legal capacity by guardianship measures, which remove 
</p>
<p>their ability to make decisions about certain aspects of their lives. It is important to note in 
</p>
<p>this regard that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides that a 
</p>
<p>person&#8217;s status as a person with a disability or the existence of impairment must never be a 
ground for denying legal capacity. In its general comment No. 1 on article 12 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities highlighted that the </p>


<p>Convention does not legitimatize the denial of legal capacity based on perceived or actual 
</p>
<p>deficits in mental capacity.  
</p>
<p>49. The Independent Expert noted the positive trend in recent years to reform legal 
</p>
<p>capacity and guardianship laws. General comment No.1 also provides guidance to States 
</p>
<p>parties on reforming their current laws and legislation&#8212;in particular mental-health 
legislation that deprives persons with disabilities of their legal capacity&#8212;and encourages 
States to replace regimes that provide for substitute decision-making by supported decision-
</p>
<p>making.  
</p>
<p>50. Effective safeguards for ensuring the autonomy of older persons should be 
</p>
<p>developed and implemented to ensure the respect of the rights, wishes and preferences of 
</p>
<p>older persons and to avoid undue interference. The Committee on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities provides guidance on supportive measures, stressing that if, after 
</p>
<p>significant efforts have been made, it is still not practicable to determine the will and 
</p>
<p>preferences of an individual, the &#8220;best interpretation of will and preferences&#8221; must replace 
the &#8220;best interests&#8221; determinations.9 In addition, articles 11 and 30 of the Inter-American 
Convention on Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons could also guide States on 
</p>
<p>this issue.   
</p>
<p>51. Legal capacity has particular relevance for older persons regarding making 
</p>
<p>fundamental decisions regarding their social and health care, in particular medical 
</p>
<p>treatment. The respect for and the strengthening of older persons&#8217; autonomy in care settings 
means that they must be able to give consent to, refuse or choose an alternative medical 
</p>
<p>intervention.  
</p>
<p>52. In his report on the fundamental role played by informed consent in respecting, 
</p>
<p>protecting and fulfilling the right to health, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone 
</p>
<p>to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
</p>
<p>highlighted that informed consent is not a mere acceptance of a medical intervention, but a 
</p>
<p>voluntary and sufficiently informed decision, safeguarding the right of the patient to be 
</p>
<p>involved in medical decision-making, and assigning associated duties and obligations to 
</p>
<p>health-care providers.10 Its ethical and legal normative justifications stem from its 
</p>
<p>promotion of patient autonomy, self-determination, bodily integrity and well-being.11 Older 
</p>
<p>persons should therefore be encouraged to plan in advance any decisions regarding their 
</p>
<p>care. Advance planning allows them to prevent abuses that often occur in older age. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Adequate standard of living and social protection 
</b></p>
<p>53. Living with autonomy is closely linked to the right to an adequate standard of living, 
</p>
<p>social security, income security and an adequate public pension. The important role of 
</p>
<p>social protection is recognized in several international and regional instruments and should 
</p>
<p>be fully implemented and enforced in order to promote the autonomy of older persons. 
</p>
<p>54. Poverty contributes to the decline of older persons&#8217; autonomy and is an impediment 
to accessing adequate nutrition, water and sanitation, and social and health care. Not 
</p>
<p>receiving a pension or not having insurance often inhibits older persons from seeking 
</p>
<p>medical attention, putting them at a higher risk of social isolation and of being denied 
</p>
<p>access to health care. Even for those who have insurance, there are delays in seeking public 
</p>
<p>health care or obtaining prescription drugs because of the financial burden. Financial 
</p>
<p>services, such as loans or mortgages, or insurance are often not available to older persons or 
</p>
<p>are prohibitively expensive because of the inappropriate use of age as a criterion, including 
</p>
<p>for determining risk.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 General comment No. 1, para. 21. 
</p>
<p> 10 See A/64/272. 
</p>
<p> 11 Ibid., para. 9. </p>


<p>55. Social transfers and pension schemes often account for the largest part of the 
</p>
<p>resources of older persons and significantly reduce their at-risk-of poverty rate by ensuring 
</p>
<p>some financial security.12 They are thus an important factor in enabling older persons to live 
</p>
<p>autonomously and not be dependent on intra-family transfers or any other private income. 
</p>
<p>Access to social insurance schemes and pensions, particularly for women, rural workers, 
</p>
<p>and persons who worked in the informal sector, is essential for persons to live an 
</p>
<p>autonomous life when they become old.  
</p>
<p>56. The Independent Expert strongly encourages the review of austerity measures and 
</p>
<p>fiscal consolidation programmes, especially those which may negatively impact the 
</p>
<p>economic and financial autonomy of older persons by increasing the risk of poverty, 
</p>
<p>exclusion and insecurity in old age. Social protection should be strengthened, both 
</p>
<p>contributory and non-contributory schemes, by increasing resources, improving the 
</p>
<p>availability of and access to services, through communication and by removing any 
</p>
<p>obstacles to receiving the benefits. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Right to work  
</b></p>
<p>57. It is also important to ensure the right to work by fostering the active economic 
</p>
<p>participation of older persons as long as they are willing or able. Older persons have much 
</p>
<p>to contribute, based on the considerable skills, wisdom, expertise and experience they have 
</p>
<p>acquired throughout their professional life, and they should be encouraged to continue 
</p>
<p>working if they wish. Therefore, workplaces and job options that include older workers 
</p>
<p>should be developed, as well as voluntary work. Older persons have indispensable roles in 
</p>
<p>assisting peers and participating in intergenerational activities by helping younger 
</p>
<p>generations, and by contributing to the education of grandchildren. This will help reinforce 
</p>
<p>social cohesion and the interaction of older persons with other members of the community.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Right to adequate housing and accessibility  
</b></p>
<p>58. Age-sensitive communities and age-friendly environments are preconditions for 
</p>
<p>older persons to live with autonomy and remain integrated in society. Older persons should 
</p>
<p>be able to live in environments that are safe and adaptable to their personal preferences and 
</p>
<p>changing capacities. The environment should therefore be adapted to their needs. This 
</p>
<p>should include, for instance, outdoor and public spaces, the physical environment, 
</p>
<p>buildings, transportation, social participation and inclusion, civic participation and 
</p>
<p>employment, information and communications and other facilities and services in both 
</p>
<p>urban and rural areas. 
</p>
<p>59. Physical barriers significantly undermine the autonomy of older persons and deny 
</p>
<p>them access to basic services, including health care. When older persons are unable to 
</p>
<p>drive, the lack of public transport, especially in rural and remote areas, presents serious 
</p>
<p>challenges. Even if they are able to access public transport, older persons still require a 
</p>
<p>reasonable level of physical fitness, the competence to follow bus-route directions, the 
</p>
<p>ability to endure long rides and bus transfers, and a safe environment to wait and to walk in. 
</p>
<p>60. Accessibility encompasses access to infrastructure, buildings, transportation, 
</p>
<p>information and care settings in urban and rural areas. States should provide comprehensive 
</p>
<p>barrier-free accessibility environments and work towards eliminating existing barriers. 
</p>
<p>Public buildings, facilities, roads and transportation should be easily accessible. For this to 
</p>
<p>occur, revisions to building control acts and urban planning codes, with the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>standards of universal design in a variety of sectors and facilities, may be needed. States 
</p>
<p>should also provide training to all stakeholders involved in adapting public spaces to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 A/HRC/14/31. </p>


<p>demographic changes: including engineers, designers, architects, urban planners, transport 
</p>
<p>authorities and conductors, service providers and members of the academic community.  
</p>
<p>61. Another important element to leading an autonomous life is housing. Older persons 
</p>
<p>have the right to choose where to live, and, to the extent possible, housing should be 
</p>
<p>adapted to their needs. Should they wish If they feel the need to change or adapt their 
</p>
<p>homes because of their mobility requirements, States should secure rent- free 
</p>
<p>accommodation, or at least provide rent subsidies or , credit facilities , to help older persons 
</p>
<p>afford to remain in their own houses.  
</p>
<p>62. Housing options for older persons, including co-housing based on intergenerational 
</p>
<p>communities, age-adapted homes and flat-sharing concepts should be further developed. 
</p>
<p>Other schemes that include bank credit facilitation, tax incentives and subsidies, involving 
</p>
<p>both private and public sectors should be encouraged so as to build accessible and 
</p>
<p>appropriate housing for older persons. Particular attention should be given to older women 
</p>
<p>and widows, who tend to live alone with no family support.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Participation and social inclusion 
</b></p>
<p>63. An age-friendly community is one that also considers an older person&#8217;s political 
involvement, meaning that age cannot be a justification for any exclusion from decision-
</p>
<p>making processes and active citizenship. The right to participate in political and public life 
</p>
<p>includes the possibility of being able to vote, and of being elected, sometimes requiring the 
</p>
<p>availability of facilities and materials that are accessible to older persons, including in 
</p>
<p>nursing and institutional care settings. States should provide access to transport to and from 
</p>
<p>polling stations, as well as to attend meetings of public authorities and to participate in 
</p>
<p>trade-union and advocacy efforts.  
</p>
<p>64. The involvement of older persons in the electoral system has been declining, 
</p>
<p>especially in the age group of 80 and above, as a result of discriminatory practices leading 
</p>
<p>to social exclusion and political marginalization. The participation of older persons should 
</p>
<p>therefore be institutionalized through forums, or consultative, coordinating or advisory 
</p>
<p>bodies at the local, regional and national level.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Education, training and lifelong learning 
</b></p>
<p>65. Autonomy includes access to education, training and lifelong learning that will help 
</p>
<p>maintain self-esteem and extend knowledge and adaptability to cultural and social changes, 
</p>
<p>especially regarding advances in information technology. The target of educational 
</p>
<p>programmes should not be limited to older persons only, in order to promote inter-
</p>
<p>generational learning and understanding. States should develop specific pedagogical 
</p>
<p>methods for teaching older persons, such as master&#8217;s degree programmes in geronto-
pedagogics. Particular attention should be given to information technology and computing 
</p>
<p>training programmes.  
</p>
<p>66. With the rapid evolution of new technologies, autonomy also means having access 
</p>
<p>to the Internet and being able to use information and communications technology and 
</p>
<p>services. When online registration is sometimes the only or easiest way to purchase goods 
</p>
<p>and services, older persons should be able to access these goods and services without 
</p>
<p>depending on others. Older persons constitute a distinct consumer group, with specific 
</p>
<p>needs, interests and preferences. Technologies can contribute to strengthening an older 
</p>
<p>person&#8217;s autonomy by adapting products to meet the changes incurred with age, such as 
through adjusting the size of objects or through offering technical support.  
</p>
<p>67. Autonomy also means being able to access cultural activities through the availability 
</p>
<p>of transport, subsidized tickets for cultural activities and reduced fees or free entrance for 
</p>
<p>older persons. Services such as closed-captioning and open subtitled for those with hearing 
</p>
<p>impairments should be provided in theatres, museums and other cultural-related facilities.  </p>


<p><b> 8. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>68. In care settings, autonomy means that older persons are able to participate in the 
</p>
<p>formulation, monitoring and evaluation of their care services, as well as in clinical trials in 
</p>
<p>order to determine the effect of medication.13 Older persons should no longer be seen as 
</p>
<p>passive recipients of care but as active users.14 This change of paradigm from passive to 
</p>
<p>active care is a shift from care provided for people to care provided with people.15  
</p>
<p>69. Older persons should receive health education, and information on the social and 
</p>
<p>health-care services available to them, on their rights in care settings. They should also 
</p>
<p>receive guidance on adequate nutrition and on different pathologies, including 
</p>
<p>communicable and non-communicable diseases. In this context, self-care can help older 
</p>
<p>persons to participate actively in and manage their own health. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Care 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Definition and scope 
</b></p>
<p>70. There is no universally accepted definition of care.16 Care aims at maintaining or 
</p>
<p>regaining the optimum level of physical, mental and emotional wellbeing and to prevent or 
</p>
<p>delay the onset of disease. While a distinction is generally made between social and health 
</p>
<p>care, depending on where and by whom such services are provided, care should be 
</p>
<p>understood in a complementary and integrated manner for the benefit of older persons. It 
</p>
<p>comprises a range of services, facilities, knowledge and support aimed at increasing the 
</p>
<p>individual&#8217;s physical, mental and social well-being, provided either by formal or informal 
carers, and through the public or the private sector. 
</p>
<p>71. Care encompasses services such as assistance with the activities of daily life, social 
</p>
<p>income, protection and security, as well as health promotion and disease prevention, 
</p>
<p>treatment and rehabilitation and the provision of primary, secondary and tertiary health 
</p>
<p>care, in ambulatory, institutional or home settings. Equality of access to social and health 
</p>
<p>care throughout the life of older persons is also the basis of an autonomous life and active 
</p>
<p>and healthy ageing. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Care settings 
</b></p>
<p>72. Home and family care is the most common form of care for older persons in many 
</p>
<p>countries, where care of older persons is regarded very much seen as the responsibility of 
</p>
<p>the family. While for many older persons, family care is the preferred option in old age, 
</p>
<p>there is a need for adequate parallel support to family members and other informal 
</p>
<p>caregivers. This would include respite care services, needs assessment, counselling and 
</p>
<p>advice, self-support groups and practical training in care-giving, as well as information 
</p>
<p>about measures to protect carers&#8217; own physical and mental health, weekend breaks, and 
integrated planning of care for older persons and families. Including family carers into the 
</p>
<p>social security system is particularly important given that caregivers are often women who 
</p>
<p>are not gainfully employed and in view of the increasing need for care in ageing societies.

<p>73. The Independent Expert emphasizes that the assistance provided by family members 
</p>
<p>and communities cannot substitute for States&#8217; obligations to promote and protect all human 
rights of older persons. She also notes the radical changes some societies are undergoing, 
</p>
<p>such as changes in family patterns or lifestyles, as well as challenges related to migration 
</p>
<p>and urbanization, which need to be taken into account. 
</p>
<p>74. The institutionalization of care, while it can be the result of an autonomous decision 
</p>
<p>of a person as he or she becomes older, can often take the form of forced institutionalization 
</p>
<p>and compulsory placements, especially when no other forms of care are available for the 
</p>
<p>individual or when relatives are unable or unwilling to provide care.17 When proper legal 
</p>
<p>and institutional mechanisms and procedures are in place in care settings, thus ensuring 
</p>
<p>freedom of choice and informed consent, older persons in need of care can lead a life with 
</p>
<p>dignity. It is therefore crucial to ensure older persons&#8217; autonomy, in particular when it 
comes to any decision-making affecting their care. 
</p>
<p>75. Flexible and open care institutions have been established in several countries in 
</p>
<p>order to avoid such institutionalization, with free provision of medical home care, including 
</p>
<p>administration of medication and infusions. Such services have improved the quality of life 
</p>
<p>of older persons by enabling them to stay at home. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Quality control and accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>76. Ensuring quality control in care settings is one of the main challenges. It has been 
</p>
<p>pointed out that the office hours of social and health-care services were often anti-social 
</p>
<p>and to the disadvantage of older persons. For example, older persons are often required to 
</p>
<p>arrive early in the morning and queue to receive a number that will correspond to their 
</p>
<p>attendance. Such an approach results in long waits in uncomfortable and even inhumane 
</p>
<p>conditions, with a lack of appropriate assistance that takes into account their specific needs. 
</p>
<p>Associated with this, is the shortage of social and health-care professionals with formal 
</p>
<p>education in geriatrics and gerontology, and with gender and disability-based expertise.  
</p>
<p>77. Most health-care undergraduate programmes do not include geriatric and 
</p>
<p>gerontology in their curricula, with the result that health-care professionals are not fully 
</p>
<p>trained to help and understand older persons. For older persons who do not have family or 
</p>
<p>community support, having to rely exclusively on formal caregivers without such training 
</p>
<p>or qualifications can make their lives particularly difficult.  
</p>
<p>78. The fragmentation of care also causes problems owing to the co-existence of many 
</p>
<p>units that are not integrated into the network of services, and which results in hours spent in 
</p>
<p>filling complicated forms to access both social and health-care services and facilities. It also 
</p>
<p>results in poor quality service provision, inefficient use of available resources and low user 
</p>
<p>satisfaction. This may often be due to the lack of coordination between the different levels 
</p>
<p>and places of care, especially in hospitals. Consequently, older users experience a lack of 
</p>
<p>continuity in care, together with a lack of consistency in the provision of services for 
</p>
<p>meeting their needs. 
</p>
<p>79. Equitable access to health services is another challenge faced by many countries. 
</p>
<p>Care facilities, goods and related services need to be made available, accessible, affordable 
</p>
<p>and acceptable, and be of good quality for all older persons. There is a need to ensure that 
</p>
<p>these all older persons have access to the same services irrespective of the type of care and 
</p>
<p>the place of residence, including in urban, rural and remote areas. In this connection, older 
</p>
<p>persons may require access to transportation, information and communication on care-
</p>
<p>related programmes and facilities that meet their requirements and needs.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 See E/2012/51, para. 25.  </p>


<p>80. Care work is often characterized by a heavy workload, long working hours and 
</p>
<p>emotional exhaustion; and care workers tend to be undervalued, underpaid and 
</p>
<p>undertrained. There is evidence that the satisfaction of persons receiving care correlates 
</p>
<p>with the well-being of their care workers. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Elder abuse and violence against older persons 
</b></p>
<p>81. Abuse of and violence against older persons in home and institutional care settings, 
</p>
<p>by both formal and informal caregivers, is still a taboo subject in many countries and an 
</p>
<p>underreported problem. These older persons may be subjected to intimidation, aggression, 
</p>
<p>inappropriate behaviour-control methods, negligence, or a failure to provide the appropriate 
</p>
<p>or necessary care, among other forms of ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>82. Risk factors for abuse and violence in care settings may relate to institutional 
</p>
<p>aspects, such as poorly trained staff, also as a result of a lack of career prospects and high 
</p>
<p>turnover, as well as a culture of tolerance of aggression towards patients.  
</p>
<p>83. Regular inspection and monitoring of home visits by certified care workers is 
</p>
<p>necessary to ensure adequate quality of care and the protection of older persons, including 
</p>
<p>against physical and mental violence, and from degrading treatment and neglect. 
</p>
<p>84. Certain countries have implemented technical services provided by public 
</p>
<p>prosecutors to help older persons who are involuntarily hospitalized or involuntarily 
</p>
<p>receiving medical treatment. Offices of an ombudsperson have also been created to support 
</p>
<p>older persons in expressing their needs and decisions, and to seek remedy.18 In care 
</p>
<p>facilities, committees composed of older persons have been put in place to supervise and 
</p>
<p>evaluate the quality of the services, especially regarding food, hygiene and interaction with 
</p>
<p>staff. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Geriatric services and palliative care 
</b></p>
<p>85. Older persons have different patterns of disease presentation than younger adults, 
</p>
<p>they respond to treatments and therapies in different ways, and they frequently have 
</p>
<p>complex social needs that are related to their chronic medical conditions. It is therefore 
</p>
<p>important to ensure that sufficient doctors, staff and others qualified in geriatric health are 
</p>
<p>available to ensure that these older persons can fully enjoy their right to health. 
</p>
<p>86. Particular attention needs to be given to palliative care. In certain countries, this is 
</p>
<p>not officially recognized as a medical speciality and the medicine used in such care is 
</p>
<p>limited, for several reasons, including restrictive drug regulations, failure to implement a 
</p>
<p>properly functioning supply and distribution system, and inadequate health-care system 
</p>
<p>capacity.  
</p>
<p>87. The Independent Expert stresses that the Special Rapporteur on the right to health 
</p>
<p>and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment qualified the failure to ensure access to controlled medicines for the relief of 
</p>
<p>pain and suffering as a threat to the fundamental right to health and the right to be free from 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.19 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Groups in focus 
</b></p>
<p>88. Particular attention should be given to specific groups of older persons when 
</p>
<p>designing and implementing care policies, goods and services, in particular older women,

<p>older persons with disabilities, and persons with chronic illnesses, non-communicable 
</p>
<p>diseases and dementia. Gender, disability and cultural sensitivities should be promoted in 
</p>
<p>care settings to allow older persons from different backgrounds to be informed effectively 
</p>
<p>and to be able to make decisions. Specialized integrated social and health-care services 
</p>
<p>should be developed and implemented to address dementia and other degenerative diseases 
</p>
<p>that lead to dependency. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>In the light of the intensity of ageing in many societies, there is a need to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that older persons are enabled to lead autonomous lives. This also calls for a paradigm 
</b></p>
<p><b>shift that focuses on the inclusion of older persons in society at all levels, 
</b></p>
<p><b>encompassing age-friendly communities and environments, as well as people-centred 
</b></p>
<p><b>models of care, and that promotes the autonomy and dignity of older persons. </b> 
</p>
<p>90. <b>The design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of any social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>health-care legislation, policies, programmes, strategies and settings must take into 
</b></p>
<p><b>account the respect for and the strengthening of older persons</b>&#8217; autonomy<b>. To promote 
this autonomy, effective care for older persons needs to integrate economic, physical, 
</b></p>
<p><b>mental, social, spiritual and environmental factors. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The increasing prevalence of chronic and degenerative diseases in older age 
</b></p>
<p><b>poses challenges to the development and implementation of appropriate models of 
</b></p>
<p><b>care for older persons. The disease-focused approach in care at different levels needs 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be replaced by more effective and rights-based models in order to address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific needs of the most heterogeneous of all age groups.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b> With a view to assisting States in developing and implementing appropriate 
</b></p>
<p><b>and effective measures to ensure the autonomy of older persons, including in social 
</b></p>
<p><b>and health-care settings, the Independent Expert makes the recommendations set out 
</b></p>
<p><b>below.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legal, institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>States must fully comply with their international obligations relating to 
</b></p>
<p><b>autonomy and care. The Independent Expert strongly encourages States to ratify all 
</b></p>
<p><b>the core human rights treaties, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>Disabilities, as well as all relevant regional instruments </b>&#8212;<b>notably the recently adopted 
Inter-American Convention on the Human Rights of Older Persons, which makes 
</b></p>
<p><b>explicit reference to autonomy and care. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>States should design and implement effectively national policies and action 
</b></p>
<p><b>plans on ageing that include specific provisions on autonomy and care, in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive and intersectoral manner.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>States should establish national councils on ageing, with older persons among 
</b></p>
<p><b>its members, to design and develop policies, including care, that correspond to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs and respect their autonomy. Such councils should guarantee pluralism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>represent the diversity of older persons and receive sufficient funding so that they can 
</b></p>
<p><b>function properly and effectively.  </b></p>


<p><b>  Study and statistics 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>States should ensure, nationwide, systemic and regular collection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregated statistical data, and carry out studies to assess the situation and needs 
</b></p>
<p><b>of older persons and develop targeted policies for older persons. Data must be used 
</b></p>
<p><b>sensibly to avoid stigmatization and potential misuse. Particular care should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercised when collecting and analysing data in order to respect and enforce data 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection and privacy. Older persons, including the very old and those in 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutionalized care settings, should systematically be included in surveys and official 
</b></p>
<p><b>statistics, in order to ensure a better differentiation for age and to better reflect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>broad heterogeneity of older persons. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>States should constantly conduct researches and studies and collect age- and 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender-disaggregated data on abuse and violence against older persons in and outside 
</b></p>
<p><b>care settings in order to assess the current situation and take appropriate measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>tackle elder abuse. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Discrimination, abuse and violence 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>There is a need for national anti-discrimination strategies addressing 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination in a coherent and multifaceted way. States should, through legislation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibit direct or indirect discrimination against older persons, including in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial and insurance services sectors, as well as in care settings.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legal capacity and equal recognition before the law 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Independent Expert emphasizes that supported decision-making for 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities, including older persons, is 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential for the respect of the autonomy of older persons and their individual rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in their own capacity to give and withdraw informed consent for medical treatment, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>access justice, to vote, to marry, to work and to choose their place of residence. Judges 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be guided by the objective of ensuring that older persons can lead a self-
</b></p>
<p><b>determined and autonomous life for as long as possible. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Older persons must be provided with guarantees to ensure that their 
</b></p>
<p><b>preferences, their will and their best interests are taken into consideration in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>matters relevant to their life, including treatment, residence or assets. Conflict of 
</b></p>
<p><b>interest and undue influence should be regulated, especially in reference to family 
</b></p>
<p><b>members and caregivers.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Safeguards to free and informed consent should be adopted through legislation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies and administrative procedures in conformity with international and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards. Particular attention should be given to illiterate older persons or persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>with less formal education.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Adequate standard of living and social protection 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>States must recognize the human right to social security in domestic law. Non-
</b></p>
<p><b>contributory and contributory pension schemes must be guided by international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights standards for the right to social security.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>States should put in place social-protection and poverty-reduction 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes, particularly designed for older persons, including those with disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human rights principles and standards should be integrated throughout the design, 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation and evaluation of social pensions, thereby ensuring that older persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully enjoy their human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Independent Expert recalls that the right to social security includes both 
</b></p>
<p><b>contributory and non-contributory benefits and benefits both in cash and in kind, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that benefits should be adequate in amount and duration and accessible to all without </b></p>


<p><b>discrimination. Non-contributory old-age benefits or other assistance should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided for those without resources on reaching old age, with special attention to  be 
</b></p>
<p><b>given to older persons working in the informal sectors, older women, older widows, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and those living in rural and remote areas.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>In the light of the significant contribution of social transfers and pension 
</b></p>
<p><b>schemes, austerity measures and fiscal consolidation programmes should be revised in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to ensure the provision of basic income to older persons, together with adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>social and health-care services and support. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>A thorough evidence-based analysis of the current and future needs of various 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of care or affordable, accessible and barrier-free housing is essential for 
</b></p>
<p><b>meeting the immediate needs and for planning and preparing for the future and for 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing appropriate measures to ensure an inclusive society for all ages. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Right to work  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>States should introduce incentives for employers and employees to extend 
</b></p>
<p>people&#8217;s <b>working lives beyond the mandatory retirement age. Workplace 
environments and working conditions should be adapted to older workers by 
</b></p>
<p><b>introducing flexible working arrangements, including phased retirement. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Independent Expert also points out the importance of continued education and access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to new technologies, as well as vocational rehabilitation. States should ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>social security and pension systems do not penalize older workers who choose to work 
</b></p>
<p><b>beyond normal retirement age. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The contribution of older persons should be recognized and encouraged, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including, but not limited to, their role in the care of family members, in household 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintenance and in voluntary and associative activities.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Right to adequate housing and accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>States should adopt housing policies that take into account the special needs of 
</b></p>
<p><b>older persons to enable these persons to live autonomously. Ageing at home requires 
</b></p>
<p><b>innovations in the housing sector, including alternative forms of housing for older 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons, such as mixed and designated communities and age-adapted homes, or flat-
</b></p>
<p><b>sharing concepts that promote intergenerational interaction. Alternative forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing and the possibility to adapt their homes should ensure that older persons can 
</b></p>
<p><b>remain in their homes and lead autonomous lives.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>States should establish tax incentives and subsidies to encourage developers to 
</b></p>
<p><b>build accessible and appropriate housing for older persons. Credit facilities should 
</b></p>
<p><b>also be encouraged in public and private banks to allow older persons to adapt their 
</b></p>
<p><b>homes or to become homeowners. In view of the difficulties often faced by older 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons in accessing financial and insurance services and resources, the Independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Expert wishes to remind businesses of their obligations to adhere to international 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards preventing, inter alia, all forms of discrimination and to the Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles on Business and Human Rights, which provide guidance on responsible 
</b></p>
<p><b>contracting and State-investor contract negotiations.</b> 
</p>
<p>111. <b>Given that the physical ability, individual characteristics and the transport 
</b></p>
<p><b>environment crucially influence the mobility of older persons, States are encouraged 
</b></p>
<p><b>to adopt comprehensive national accessibility policies. There is also a need to include 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandatory provisions demanding the implementation of barrier-free access. States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should also ensure the elimination of existing barriers in public spaces and buildings, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in care settings. The Independent Expert recommends that architects and 
</b></p>
<p><b>engineers apply a human rights-based approach in designing public and private 
</b></p>
<p><b>buildings. </b></p>


<p>112. States should ensure older persons&#8217; mobility, including affordable and 
</p>
<p><b>accessible public transport, both in urban, rural and remote areas. This could 
</b></p>
<p><b>encompass free or discounted transport, low-floor buses and trains, and facilities to 
</b></p>
<p><b>help older persons purchase tickets online or in person. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Education, training and lifelong learning 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The promotion of lifelong learning is essential for older persons to be able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>deal with constantly changing circumstances, requirements and challenges, for their 
</b></p>
<p><b>active participation in society and for an autonomous life continuing into old age. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific needs of older persons should be taken into account in the planning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>design of educational offers. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Distance learning and digital training should be offered to older persons in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to bridge the gap among generations and avoid dependency on others as a result 
</b></p>
<p><b>of to the lack of knowledge of information and communications technology.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Care 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>States should improve coordination among sectors throughout the continuum 
</b></p>
<p><b>of care, from prevention, promotion, rehabilitation, through to long-term and 
</b></p>
<p><b>palliative care, including social care and other community services, and prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>unnecessary institutionalization. Universal coverage and uniform national legislation 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be introduced in order to avoid fragmentation of social and health services. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Older persons should be included in the design, planning, implementation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>evaluation of care, be these social or health-related services and facilities. Gender, 
</b></p>
<p><b>disability and cultural-sensitivity programmes should be integrated in every care 
</b></p>
<p><b>setting in order to take into account the diversity of older persons and meet their 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirements and needs.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>States should provide assistance to families and to other informal caregivers. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This should include human rights, medical and human resources training, counselling, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and financial, social and psychological support. States should strengthen mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>to officially recognize the work undertaken by informal caregivers, including, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate, work permits that allow flexible schedules in order to combine paid work 
</b></p>
<p><b>with informal care of older persons, as well as their inclusion in the social security 
</b></p>
<p><b>system. Particular attention should be given to older women in their role as 
</b></p>
<p><b>caregivers. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>States should develop national home-care programmes and community-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>care services, in rural and remote areas alike. Such programmes and services should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be designed and implemented in consultation with the older persons themselves and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their families.  
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>States should provide long-term care through a comprehensive and 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersectoral approach, and promote the transfer of older persons from an 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional to a community-care residence and home, if the older person so wishes. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>States should develop training programmes to improve the self-care of older 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons. Older patient education may include health education and awareness of 
</b></p>
<p><b>pathologies, thereby increasing self-esteem and confidence.  
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>As forced institutionalization violates the rights of older persons, States should 
</b></p>
<p><b>revise their legislation and regulations, in particular with regard to mental health-care 
</b></p>
<p><b>settings. A clear set of standards should be established on free informed consent in 
</b></p>
<p><b>care settings, in particular in mental health-care settings.  </b></p>


<p>122. <b>Residential councils that include older persons should be established in 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional care settings to promote the active participation of these persons in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>organization of their own daily activities.  
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>States should establish quality monitoring and effective and transparent 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability mechanisms for public and private care settings, which take into 
</b></p>
<p>account older persons&#8217; assessments and evaluations. This requires establish<b>ing clearly 
defined benchmarks, such as codes of practices and conduct, and where conformity 
</b></p>
<p><b>can be assessed and verified by sufficient and well-trained staff both in home and 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutionalized care settings. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>Quality care is also correlated with the working conditions and well-being of 
</b></p>
<p><b>care workers. In order to ensure that care workers provide care that meets the 
</b></p>
<p><b>emotional and physical needs of older persons with compassion and dignity, and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to attract people into the care sector and retain them there, better training 
</b></p>
<p><b>opportunities, including academic qualifications, should be provided. This, in turn, 
</b></p>
<p><b>will also help portray care work as a profession with good career prospects. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>Given the multidimensionality of abuse and violence against older persons, 
</b></p>
<p><b>there is a need to adopt a comprehensive, integrated and inclusive approach involving 
</b></p>
<p><b>different disciplines, organizations and actors, as well as older persons themselves, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>identifying appropriate responses to abuse and violence. 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>States should adopt legislation and policies to prevent, detect, investigate, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecute and criminalize elder abuse. Procedures must be in place for reporting 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuse and violence, including in public and private care settings. The Independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>Expert calls on States to pay particular attention to protecting victims from 
</b></p>
<p><b>retaliation, especially in cases where the abuse or violence is committed by a family 
</b></p>
<p><b>member, relative or is the result of an intimate relationship. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>Collective prejudice against older people and general public awareness 
</b></p>
<p><b>influence the way in which abuse and violence is perceived, recognized and reported. 
</b></p>
<p><b>States should devise an awareness-raising strategy regarding the issue of abuse of and 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against older persons. Awareness-raising campaigns should not only target 
</b></p>
<p><b>older persons themselves, but also their social environment, such as family, friends 
</b></p>
<p><b>and caregivers. They should also target employees in homes and institutions, doctors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>nurses and caregivers and the broader communities.  
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>Information about remedies, referral pathways and available services should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>made widely available to older persons and the broader public domain, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly the social environment of older persons. Dissemination of information to 
</b></p>
<p><b>older persons about their rights could help to further improve disclosure about 
</b></p>
<p><b>abusive experiences and make more effective the implementation of laws related to 
</b></p>
<p><b>elder abuse when such laws exist. Caregivers and law enforcement personnel should 
</b></p>
<p><b>receive training to recognize and handle cases of abuse and violence against older 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>States should develop ombudsman-like positions inside institutionalized care 
</b></p>
<p>settings that could improve older persons&#8217; care and quality of life and denounce cases 
<b>of abuse and violence, including health-care fraud. 
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>Older persons have different patterns of disease presentation from younger 
</b></p>
<p><b>adults, they respond to treatments and therapies in different ways and they frequently 
</b></p>
<p><b>have complex social needs that are related to their chronic medical conditions. States 
</b></p>
<p><b>should therefore ensure the availability of geriatric and gerontological specialists in 
</b></p>
<p><b>different types of care services and facilities. There is a need to further promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>geriatric medicine to ensure that a sufficient number of qualified geriatrics are 
</b></p>
<p><b>available to meet the needs of an ageing society. </b></p>


<p>131. <b>The right to palliative care should be enshrined in the legal framework so that 
</b></p>
<p><b>older persons can enjoy the last years of their lives in dignity and without unnecessary 
</b></p>
<p><b>suffering. States should ensure the availability and accessibility of palliative care for 
</b></p>
<p><b>all older persons in need, particularly those who suffer from a life-threatening or life-
</b></p>
<p><b>limiting illness. Training, and adequate and affordable medication and therapeutic 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures, should be provided in public and private care settings. 
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>Innovative care for older persons with chronic and degenerative diseases, such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as dementia, should be encouraged through public and private partnerships, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>scientific and academic sectors, in order to improve the quality of life and well-being 
</b></p>
<p><b>of those affected.
