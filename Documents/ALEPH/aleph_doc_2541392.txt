stockholders shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by 
means of remote communication as authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the &#147;DGCL&#148;). In the absence of any such 
designation or determination, stockholders&#146; meetings shall be held at the

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:16px; text-indent:48px">2.2 <U>Annual

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:16px; text-indent:48px">2.3 <U>Special 
Meeting</U>. A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by 
a majority of the Board, chief executive officer or president (in the absence of

aggregate entitled to cast not less than 10% of the votes at that meeting.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">If any

writing;</P>

<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:16px; text-indent:48px">2.6 
<U>Quorum</U>. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of 
Incorporation or these Bylaws, at each meeting of stockholders the presence in 
person or by proxy of the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the 
votes which could be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock 
entitled to vote at the meeting shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute 
a quorum. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting 
of the stockholders, then either (i) the chair of the meeting, or (ii) the 
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without 
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or 
represented.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:16px; text-indent:48px">2.7 <U>Adjourned
Meeting; Notice</U>. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may adjourn
from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need 
not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place if any thereof, and the
means of remote communications if any by which stockholders and proxy holders 
may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are 
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the continuation 
of the adjourned meeting, the Company may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 
days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned 
meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at the meeting.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:13.333px; text-indent:48px">2.8 
<U>Conduct of Business</U>. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by 
the chair of the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the vice chair of 
the Board, if any, or in his or her absence by the president, or in his or her 
absence by a vice president, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a 
chair designated by the Board, or in the absence of such designation by a chair 
chosen at the meeting. The secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but 
in his or her absence any assistant secretary may act as secretary, and in the 
absence of the secretary and all assistant secretaries the chair of the meeting 
may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The chair of any 
meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure 
at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the 
conduct of business.<FONT style="font-size:12pt"> </FONT></P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:16px; text-indent:48px">2.9 
<U>Voting</U>. The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders 
shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these 
Bylaws, subject to Section 217 (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, 
pledgors and joint owners of stock) and Section 218 (relating to voting trusts 
and other voting agreements) of the DGCL.</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:16px; text-indent:48px">Except as may be
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each 
stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held 
by such stockholder. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written 
ballot and need not be conducted by inspectors of election unless so determined 
by the holders of shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be 
cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon 
which are present in person or by proxy at such meeting. Except as otherwise 
provided in any corporate governance guidelines or other policies or procedures 
adopted by the Board, at all meetings of stockholders for the election of 
directors a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect. All other 
elections and questions shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, be decided by the vote of the holders of 
shares of stock having a majority of the votes which could be cast by the 
holders of all shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in 
person or represented by proxy at the meeting.</P>

given to any stockholder who shall, either before or after the meeting, submit a
waiver of notice or who shall attend such meeting, except when the stockholder 
attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,

<P style="margin:0px; text-indent:48px" align=justify>2.13 <U>List of

the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each 
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
The Company shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other 
electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the 
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a 
period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible 
electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to 
such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary 
business hours, at the Company<font style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS,Times

Company determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the<FONT

such information is available only to stockholders of the Company. If the 
meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at 
the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be 
inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely
by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the 
examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a 
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access
such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall

the requirements of this Section shall not affect the validity of any action 
taken at such meeting.</P>
