<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment undertook a visit to Equatorial Guinea from 9 to 18 November 2008.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude for the invitation extended by the 
Government, which he interprets as a sign of the Government&#8217;s preparedness to subject its 
places of detention to independent scrutiny by an external, objective expert. He appreciates 
the Government&#8217;s cooperation in issuing authorization letters providing him with access to 
prisons and police and gendarmerie custody.   
</p>
<p> He notes that a comprehensive law prohibiting torture and providing for the 
prosecution of torturers was adopted in 2006. However, on the basis of discussions with 
public officials, judges, lawyers and representatives of civil society, interviews with victims 
of violence and with persons deprived of their liberty, often supported by forensic medical 
evidence, he found torture by the police to be systematic in the initial period after arrest and 
during interrogation, including by suspension, severe beatings, electroshocks, etc. A 
number of cases of corporal punishment were reported to the Special Rapporteur in Malabo 
Black Beach and Bata prisons. The Special Rapporteur further observes that neither 
safeguards against ill-treatment, nor complaints mechanisms are effective and that 
perpetrators of torture and ill-treatment are not prosecuted, with the exception of one case 
in 2007. On the contrary, in many cases, victims of torture experience a total lack of justice, 
which, combined with the physical and psychological consequences of ill-treatment and the 
absence of any rehabilitation or compensation mechanism, may cause ongoing suffering 
that might amount to inhuman treatment.  
</p>
<p> Whereas physical conditions of detention in Black Beach and Evinayong prisons 
and in Bata police station were of a high standard, Bata prison and the remaining police and 
gendarmerie custody facilities were in urgent need of refurbishment in order to fulfil 
international minimum standards. Also, in most police and gendarmerie cells, no food was 
provided (unless the family did so) and access to sanitary facilities was either severely 
restricted or completely absent. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, detention in such 
conditions, in particular for longer periods, amounts to inhuman treatment. The Special 
Rapporteur notes with concern that, in Black Beach Prison, persons suspected of political 
crimes have been held in solitary confinement for prolonged periods of up to four years. 
Moreover, most of them have been held in leg irons practically all the time. He also finds 
troubling that in Black Beach Prison family visits appear to be forbidden (except for a 
small number of prisoners), which contradicts the spirit of rehabilitation required by 
international standards. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur regrets that, in violation of international norms, in police 
and gendarmerie custody, women and children were not separated from male adults and 
were therefore extremely vulnerable to sexual violence and other forms of abuse. Also, 
immigrants detained pending deportation were frequently held in police detention in poor 
conditions for long periods, with little access to food and/or water. The latter also ran an 
increased risk of being subjected to discriminatory practices and sometimes even physical 
abuse by other detainees with the tacit approval of the police.  
</p>
<p> In the assessment of the Special Rapporteur, in order for Equatorial Guinea to 
comply with its obligations under both international human rights law and its Constitution, 
a comprehensive institutional and legal overhaul establishing law enforcement bodies based 
on the rule of law, an independent judiciary, and effective monitoring and accountability 
mechanisms are necessary to effectively combat torture. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p> Finally, the Special Rapporteur cautions that the international community, including 
trans-national corporations, should ensure that, in their development cooperation and 
business practices, they are not complicit in violations of human rights by state authorities.

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment of the Human Rights Council, Manfred Nowak, undertook a visit to the 
Republic of Equatorial Guinea from 9 to 18 November 2008, at the invitation of the 
Government.  
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was: to assess the situation of torture and ill-treatment 
including the conditions of detention in all places where persons are deprived of their 
liberty, and to offer assistance to the Government in addressing shortcomings in the 
administration of justice, including the police/gendarmerie and prison sectors. The Special 
Rapporteur appreciates the fact that Equatorial Guinea extended an invitation to him and 
trusts that this is a reflection of the willingness of the Government, based on his 
observations and recommendations, to improve the situation in order to ensure that the 
conditions and treatment of persons deprived of their liberty comply with international 
human rights norms. He also thanks the Government for issuing authorization letters 
providing him with access to prisons and police and gendarmerie custody.   
</p>
<p>3. However, he regrets that, in spite of the earlier commitment by the Government to 
grant him access to all places of detention, he was unable to verify allegations against the 
military because he was denied access to military detention facilities. This is a clear 
violation of the Terms of Reference for Fact-finding Missions by Special 
Rapporteurs/Representatives of the Commission on Human Rights of 1998, which 
guarantee: &#8220;(b) Freedom of inquiry, in particular as regards: Access to all prisons, detention 
centres and places of interrogation&#8230;&#8221;1  
</p>
<p>4. Similarly, he is very concerned that, at the main Police Stations in Malabo and Bata, 
he was denied access when attempting to undertake follow-up visits, which means he could 
not ascertain whether or not detainees who provided testimony to him had been subjects of 
reprisals. In this regard, he wishes to recall that the Commission on Human Rights urged 
&#8220;Governments to refrain from all acts of intimidation or reprisal against: (a) Those who 
seek to cooperate or have cooperated with representatives of United Nations human rights 
bodies, or who have provided testimony or information to them&#8221;2. He also refers to the 
Terms of Reference for Fact-finding Missions by Special Rapporteurs/Representatives of 
the Commission on Human Rights of 1998 (c), which provide for &#8220;Assurance by the 
Government that no persons, official or private individuals who have been in contact with 
the Special Rapporteur / Representative in relation to the mandate will for this reason suffer 
threats, harassment or punishment or be subjected to judicial proceedings&#8221;3. In light of the 
above, of the absence of any independent monitoring mechanisms and the reigning 
impunity in the country, the Special Rapporteur feels that he cannot exclude that there 
might be reprisals against individuals he interviewed during his mission. He has therefore 
decided to depart from usual practice and to publish only the names of persons whose story 
is already in the public domain. The names of all other interlocutors are kept confidential.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with the First Deputy Prime Minister for 
Human Rights; the Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and Francophone 
Affairs, the Minister of National Security; the Minister of Justice, Cults and Penitentiary 
Institutions; the Minister of Internal Affairs and Local Corporations; the Minister for Social 
Affairs and the Promotion of Women; the Vice Minister of National Defense; the

<p>Prosecutor General of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, and the Governor of the Province 
of Bata &#8211; Litoral.  
</p>
<p>6. Outside of Government, the Special Rapporteur met with the Chairman of the 
Appeals Court of Malabo and the Secretariat of the National Human Rights Commission. 
He also had discussions with civil society representatives, persons in places of detention 
and victims of ill-treatment.  In addition, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with the 
United Nations country team and the diplomatic community. The Special Rapporteur 
visited a number of prisons and police/gendarmerie custody facilities on Bioko Island and 
on the mainland (please see appendix).   
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the United Nations 
Country Team, in particular the Resident Coordinator; and the OHCHR staff for the 
excellent assistance prior to and throughout the mission; Dr. Derrick Pounder, forensic 
expert; and Ms. Isabelle Tschan and Ms. Johanna Lober of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute 
of Human Rights in Vienna.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings with the Government at the 
close of his mission. On 2 September 2009, a preliminary version of this report was sent to 
the Government. On 16 October 2009, the Government provided comments, which are 
attached to this report. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>9. Equatorial Guinea is party to the major United Nations human rights treaties 
prohibiting torture and ill-treatment: the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR); the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment and Punishment (CAT); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); and 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW). Equatorial Guinea has acceded to the first Optional Protocol to ICCPR and has 
therefore recognized the competence of the Human Rights Committee to consider 
complaints by individuals regarding violations of the Covenant. It has not acceded to the 
Second Optional Protocol aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. Equatorial Guinea 
has not made a declaration under Art. 22 of CAT, recognizing the competence of the 
Committee against Torture to receive and consider communications from or on behalf of 
individuals claiming to be victims of a violation of one or more provisions of the 
Convention and has not signed the Optional Protocol for the Prevention of Torture 
(OPCAT).  
</p>
<p>10. Equatorial Guinea has ratified the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the 
Additional Protocols I and II but is not a State Party to the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>11. Equatorial Guinea also ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights 
as well as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. It has signed 
Protocols on the Rights of Women and the African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
As a member of the African Union, Equatorial Guinea is encouraged to abide by the 
Resolution on Guidelines and Measures for the Prohibition and Prevention of Torture, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa (the Robben Island 
Guidelines) adopted in 2002 by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National level 
</b></p>
<p>12. Many of the laws and decrees on which Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s legal order is based, 
date prior to its independence and were declared applicable by Decree No. 4/80 of 3 April 
</p><p>1980. Some legal acts therefore remain in force, such as the Code of Military Justice of 17 
July 1945, the Spanish Criminal Procedure Act (CPA) of 1882, and the Spanish Penal Code 
of 1965, without any thorough assessment having been made to determine whether they are 
compatible with the current Constitution and the laws adopted since 1995. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Constitution of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea 
</b></p>
<p>13. According to article 5 of the Constitution of 17 January 1996, the principles that 
govern the society of Equatorial Guinea are, inter alia, the respect of the individual, his/her 
dignity, freedom and other fundamental rights. Article 8 provides that the State shall 
endeavour to follow the principles of international law and shall reaffirm its commitment to 
the rights and obligations enshrined in the instruments of international organizations and 
bodies of which Equatorial Guinea is a member. Article 13 guarantees a wide range of civil 
and political rights and a number of economic, social and cultural rights.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Prohibition of torture in national legislation 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Constitutional guarantees for the prohibition of torture 
</i></p>
<p>14. The Constitution of Equatorial Guinea does not contain an explicit prohibition of 
torture but rather provides for the right of every citizen to the respect of his or her person, 
life, integrity and physical and moral dignity (article 13(a)). The principle of the respect for 
human dignity is enshrined in article 5 (1) as well as article 14 of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p><i>  Provisions criminalizing torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment 
</i></p>
<p>15. On 2 November 2006, Act No. 6/2006 on the Prevention of and Disciplinary 
Measures against Torture came into effect. According to its article 3,  a public official 
acting in this capacity commits an act of torture if he or she inflicts physical or 
psychological pain or suffering on a person, for the purposes of investigating a crime or 
offence to obtain information or a confession from the person, or from a third person as a 
means of intimidation, as punishment for an act committed or an omission, or is suspected 
of having committed, or coercion to make him or her do or stop a certain conduct, or for 
any other purpose. Neither urgency for investigative or other reasons, nor the order from a 
superior or any other authority may be invoked as a justification for the use of torture. 
</p>
<p>16. Article 4 contains a legal sanctions clause by which physical or mental pain inherent 
in legal punishments do not fall under the definition of torture. According to the same 
article, acts constituting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not 
meet all the criteria of the definition of torture are covered by the law, if committed by a 
civil servant or a person acting in official capacity, or at the instigation, with the consent or 
acquiescence of a civil servant. The punishments for such crimes, according to article 5, are 
prison terms between six months and six years, a fine of 300.000 CFA and a ban from 
holding public office for twice the period of imprisonment. In the event of re-offence, the 
ban becomes permanent. The same punishment is foreseen in case a public servant incites, 
orders, forces or authorizes a third person or makes use of him or her to inflict serious pain 
or suffering on a person, whether physical or psychological; or does not prevent such pain </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>or suffering from being inflicted on a person in custody. A public official, who, in carrying 
out his duties, becomes aware of an act of torture, is obliged to report it immediately. If he 
or she fails to do so, prison terms between six months and six years as well as a fine of 
300.000 CFA can be imposed. Although the definition of torture contained in Act No. 
6/2006 does not exactly mirror the definition of the United Nations Convention against 
Torture, the catch-all clause at the end of the definition in article 4 (&#8221;or for any other 
purpose&#8221;) is broad enough to cover also acts of torture that are, e.g., inflicted on the basis of 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>17. The Penal Code, the former Spanish Criminal Code adopted in 1963, does not 
contain a provision prohibiting torture; however, article 187 provides for suspension from 
duty for: para. 3. a prison official or any other civil servant who conceals a detainee from 
the judicial authorities. 4. a prison official who, without order from the judicial authority, 
takes a detainee or a convicted (sentenciado incommunicado) to a place which is not an 
official place of detention. 5. a prison official who imposes unnecessary limitations on 
detainees and treats them with unnecessary severity. The same sanction must be applied to 
a judicial authority that decides or prolongs unnecessarily the isolation of a detainee 
(article 188(3)). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Safeguards and jurisdictional issues 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Safeguards  
</i></p>
<p>18. Article 13 of the Constitution provides inter alia that individuals may be deprived of 
their liberty only by means of a judicial warrant, except in cases established by law or 
flagrante delicto cases. Every prisoner must be informed of the reasons and grounds for his 
or her detention. The presumption of innocence is recognized until guilt is proven in 
judicial proceedings. A sentence can only be pronounced on the basis of a trial. The rights 
to a defence attorney and to legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings are also 
guaranteed. In addition, this constitutional provision foresees the right to file complaints 
and petitions and the writ of habeas corpus and amparo.  
</p>
<p>19. Article 520 of the Spanish Criminal Procedure Act of 14 September 1882, applied in  
Equatorial Guinea pursuant to Decree-Law No.4/1980, provides that the treatment of a 
prisoner, whether convicted or in pre-trial detention, must cause the least possible suffering 
for the person in question and for his or her reputation. It also defines possible restrictions 
on freedoms and communications, and article 521 stipulates that prisoners must be 
separated according to sex, age, education and criminal record. Extraordinary security 
measures shall only be applied in case of disobedience, violence, rebellion or attempts of 
escape and only for the time strictly necessary (article 525). Visits by family members, 
representatives of the detainee&#8217;s religion, a doctor and other related persons have to be 
authorized according to the prison regulations (&#8220;reglamento de carceles&#8221;). Whereas 
communication with a defense lawyer cannot be prohibited (article 523), any 
correspondence and communication other than that of a detainee must be authorized by an 
investigative judge (article 524).  
</p>
<p>20. The Criminal Procedure Act states that detention in isolation during pre-trial 
detention should generally not exceed 5 days, last only for the period absolutely necessary 
for investigation purposes (article 506), which may be prolonged for another three days by 
judicial order (article 508). Article 480 of the Penal Code prohibits illegal detention. Law 
No. 18/1995 stipulates that persons who consider themselves unjustly detained must have 
access to a judge (first instance or investigative judge), who shall rule without delay on the 
legality of the detention. Article 3 lists cases of illegal detention, for example when 
guarantees have not been respected or established procedures have not been followed, when </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>the person has been illegally held in an unauthorized facility, or when the maximum period 
of detention has been exceeded without the detainee having access to a judge. 
</p>
<p>21. A person detained by the police has to be brought before an investigative judge 
within a maximum of 72 hours. The judge decides on release, pre-trial detention or release 
on bail (CPA article 497). The investigative judge has sole competence to order pre-trial 
detention. To facilitate the proper discharge of this duty, Organization Act No. 4/2002 of 20 
May 2002 established police courts, which must operate 24 hours per day, 365 days a year. 
Their decisions may be appealed before the criminal division of the territorial high court 
(CPA article 518). 
</p>
<p><i> (b) The Code of Military Justice  
</i></p>
<p>22. The Code of Military Justice (adopted in Spain on 17 July 1945) grants jurisdiction 
to military tribunals over a broad range of civilian offences, disobedience against a military 
authority, as well as over offences considered to be a &#8220;crime against the state&#8221;, regardless of 
whether the defendant is civilian or military. Under the Code of Military Justice, summary 
trials are conducted, due process is limited (trials are often held in absentia or without 
proper legal defence) and there is no possibility of appeal. Art. 257 stipulates that non-
military offences fall under the Ordinary Criminal Code and must be applied both to 
members of the military and civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Capital punishment 
</b></p>
<p>23. Article 13 of the Constitution provides that capital punishment shall only be applied 
in accordance with the law. In accordance with Penal Code article 405 and 406, the death 
penalty is to be applied in cases of parricide and of aggravated homicide. Furthermore Law 
1/1971 states that the death penalty may also be applied in a number of aggravated crimes 
including intent to murder, threat to kill the President (art. 1), murder of a member of the 
Council of Ministers (art. 4), attempt at substituting the Government without popular 
consent or through illegal means (art. 7), promoting or sustaining a rebellion, or leading a 
rebel force (art. 9).  
</p>
<p><b> II. Assessment of the situation  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Prisons 
</b></p>
<p>24. The three prisons in the country were fairly spacious and Black Beach and 
Evinayong prisons had been completely refurbished, for the most part resulting in sufficient 
space for the detainees and an acceptable level of hygiene in the sanitary facilities. Most 
prisoners were allowed to move about freely without any obstacles. However, in all the 
prisons, the Special Rapporteur received numerous complaints about the quantity and 
quality of the food, which needed to be complemented by supplies brought by visitors, in 
case visits were allowed. Although in Black Beach Prison medical doctors were on duty, 
they could only in some cases treat minor problems and overall access to medical treatment 
and medicine was severely restricted, and in the Bata and Evinayong Prisons, medical 
treatment was completely unavailable unless the detainee could afford to pay for it. 
Consequently, in the majority of cases, even serious illnesses remained untreated. The 
Special Rapporteur has learned that no statistics are available on the incidence of 
HIV/AIDS in places of detention and that no HIV/AIDS treatment is available in prisons.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>25. Several detainees indicated that violence among prisoners in both Bata and Black 
Beach Prisons was common and tacitly tolerated by the prison authorities. The Special 
Rapporteur also received reports about discriminatory practices against foreigners and 
sometimes against the minority Bubi ethnic group by other detainees and by the prison 
staff. In addition, he was informed that sexual violence and harassment of women and 
minors was common.  
</p>
<p>26. The high-security unit in Black Beach Prison was newly renovated and the physical 
conditions were of a high standard (the cells measured about 3,5 x 2,5 meters, contained a 
shower, toilet and sink, which were separated by a low wall, a bed, chair and fan, and all 
the prisoners were allowed to have some private items). However, some of the persons 
suspected or convicted of political crimes had been held in solitary confinement for 
prolonged periods of up to four years. As the Special Rapporteur has observed in his last 
report to the GA &quot;the use of solitary confinement should be kept to a minimum, used in 
very exceptional cases, for as short a time as possible, and only as a last resort.&quot;4 Moreover, 
with the exception of Simon Mann, who seemed to receive privileged treatment, the high-
security prisoners were not allowed the one hour of exercise per day required by the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (paragraph 21) and held in leg 
irons practically all the time. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment, the permanent use of 
leg irons amounts to inhuman treatment.  
</p>
<p>27. Bata Prison laudably applied a very liberal visiting policy: the Special Rapporteur 
received no allegations about any restrictions on visits during visiting hours. On the other 
hand, in Black Beach Prison, family visits appeared to be generally forbidden (except for a 
limited number of privileged prisoners). Many of the interviewed detainees indicated that 
they suffered from the fact that they could never see their families. Another concern was 
that no policy seemed to be in place authorizing children, even those of a young age, to see 
their detained parents. Several women told the Special Rapporteur that they had not seen 
their children for many months, which they found unbearable. Contact with the outside 
world is a major component of successful rehabilitation and reintegration of detainees and 
is required by article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Paragraph 37 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provide that 
&#8220;Prisoners shall be allowed under necessary supervision to communicate with their family 
and reputable friends at regular intervals, both by correspondence and by receiving visits.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>28. Some overcrowding was reported to the Special Rapporteur: for instance, in the 
wing for petty offenders in Black Beach, there were only 24 mattresses for about 40 
detainees who were present during the visit of the Special Rapporteur. In Bata prison, 
reportedly more than 70 prisoners were at times kept in the cell, so that three persons had to 
share one bed. Several small, dirty and humid punishment cells, not suitable for detention, 
were located on one side of the large courtyard. On the day of the visit, two persons were 
there because they had tried to escape. Iron rings were cemented into the walls at about 25

<p>Doc. A/63/175, paras 82-83, where he also stated: &quot;&#8220;The weight of accumulated evidence to date 
points to the serious and adverse health effects of the use of solitary confinement: from insomnia and 
confusion to hallucinations and mental illness. The key adverse factor of solitary confinement is that 
socially and psychologically meaningful contact is reduced to the absolute minimum, to a point that is 
insufficient for most detainees to remain mentally well functioning. [&#8230;] In the opinion of the Special 
Rapporteur, the use of solitary confinement should be kept to a minimum, used in very exceptional 
cases, for as short a time as possible, and only as a last resort. Regardless of the specific 
circumstances of its use, effort is required to raise the level of social contacts for prisoners: prisoner-
prison staff contact, allowing access to social activities with other prisoners, allowing more visits and 
providing access to mental health services.&#8221; </p>

<p>cm height, but they were allegedly not used any more. The Special Rapporteur welcomes 
reports that a new prison has replaced the old one. 
</p>
<p>29. In Evinayong Prison, a spacious, recently refurbished prison, only six prisoners were 
detained at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, most of them sentenced to long terms 
of imprisonment. The prison disposed of high standard sanitary facilities and a large clean 
kitchen in which prisoners cook their own food. During the day, prisoners could freely 
move around inside the large courtyard, but the cells were locked during the night.  
</p>
<p><b>  Police custody 
</b></p>
<p>30. With the exception of Bata Central Police Station, the police and gendarmerie 
holding cells were generally in a dilapidated physical state. Most of the cells were 
extremely dirty, humid and lacked any sanitary or sleeping facilities. Some were 
completely dark. In several custody facilities, the Special Rapporteur found piles of bottles 
filled with urine and plastic bags were used to defecate, and the smell was unbearable 
because of the lack of sanitary facilities. Furthermore, detainees had no possibility to take 
showers or to exercise. Detainees did also not have access to nurses or medical doctors. In 
all police and gendarmerie custody facilities without exception, food was only provided by 
the detainees&#8217; families or by fellow detainees and access to water for drinking and washing 
was severely restricted. Many detainees complained that they could not inform their family 
of their arrest and detention.  
</p>
<p>31. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the hygienic conditions and lack of toilets and of 
other sanitary facilities in almost all police detention cells, as well as severe restrictions on 
food supply, access to sanitary facilities, medical treatment and medicine show a complete 
disregard for the dignity of detainees. The fact that many detainees were held in these 
conditions well beyond the maximum of 72 hours stipulated by law, sometimes up to 
several months, exacerbated the situation and amounted to inhuman and degrading 
treatment.   
</p>
<p>32. Bata Central Police Station is located in a new building. On the ground floor, at the 
far end, male foreigners were detained in a spacious area that consisted of an open 
courtyard where the detainees could play football or sit on chairs. During the night, they 
were locked into one large room that was separated from the yard by an iron grid. The room 
had several mattresses on the floor and a few beds, tables and chairs, and was clean. The 
detainees had shaded the electric light on the ceiling with cloth as it was not switched off at 
night, which hence attracted numerous mosquitoes.  The adjacent sanitary facilities were 
newly built and in very good condition, including running water and electricity. At the time 
of the visit, about 15 to 20 persons were detained in this area. The detainees came from 
neighbouring countries. One of them had spent a month at the police station, others several 
weeks. The physical conditions were good on the first floor as well, where mostly 
Equatoguinean detainees were held. Cells were equipped with beds and mattresses as well 
as sanitary facilities. All cells were open so that detainees could walk around. The police 
did not provide adequate food, and detainees had to rely on family and friends, who were 
often not allowed into the police building, so that the detainees did not have enough to eat. 
Despite the acceptable physical conditions, prolonged detention in these cells is 
problematic since some of them were overcrowded, men and women were not separated 
and the toilets were open, to be used in front of other detainees, which interferes with their 
privacy.  
</p>
<p>33. Malabo Central Police Station, located in the centre of the city, is divided in two 
wings, one with three small cells and another one with a large cell and a large courtyard. In 
the latter, there were no toilets and detainees defecated in plastic bags and urinated in 
plastic bottles, which they then threw over the wall. At the time of the visit, the large cell 
was extremely overcrowded, and there were clearly not enough beds for everybody. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur received allegations that, at times, even more persons &#8211; 
sometimes up to several hundred - were detained in the courtyard.  
</p>
<p>34. Whereas in theory the courtyard wing was reserved for illegal immigrants, several 
citizens of Equatorial Guinea were held there as well. According to consistent reports, 
Equatoguinean detainees were at the top of the internal hierarchy, occasionally beating the 
others and applying discriminatory practices against foreigners. The police did not 
intervene in cases of inter-prisoner violence or to protect the women even when requested 
to do so.  
</p>
<p>35. Although, according to the police, the three small cells (each of about 8 square 
meters) were reserved for Equatoguinean citizens, the Special Rapporteur found that many 
among the detainees were foreigners. Conditions in the three cells were in clear violation of 
international minimum standards. There were no beds or mattresses. The middle cell was 
severely overcrowded, so that prisoners had to take turns to lay down on the floor and rest. 
The detainees were confined to their cells for 24 hours and were not allowed to leave the 
cell to shower, bath or even use the toilet. The toilet opposite the cell was unusable and 
emitted an unbearable smell.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Acts of torture and ill-treatment in places of detention  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Prisons  
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur received consistent allegations that corporal punishment 
continued to be routinely applied by prison guards in front of other prisoners in Bata and 
Black Beach prisons as a punishment for having committed disciplinary offenses or for 
unknown reasons. In both places, prisoners were tied to a pillar or face down to a bench in 
the courtyard and received a number of strikes with a police truncheon or high voltage 
cables on their buttocks and other parts of their body, often with several guards or soldiers 
taking turns. On a positive note, the Special Rapporteur welcomes that corporal punishment 
seemed not to have been applied any more for the last several months at Evinayong Prison 
under the new prison director.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that corporal punishment is absolutely 
forbidden under international law, including the United Nations Convention against 
Torture.5  
</p>
<p><b>  Police custody 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur found that torture is systematically used by the police forces 
against persons who refuse to &#8220;cooperate&#8221; &#8211; persons suspected of political crimes as well as 
suspects of common crimes in particular at the Central Police Stations in Bata and Malabo. 
The gendarmerie appeared to practice torture to a lesser extent. The Special Rapporteur was 
unable to verify allegations against the military because he was denied access to military 
detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>39. Types of abuse reported to him, and corroborated by expert medical analysis and 
evidence found in the respective police stations, include: beatings on various parts of the 
body, but often on the soles of the feet and/or the buttocks with police batons, solid 
&#8220;rubberized&#8221; cables and wooden bars; electric shocks with starter cables attached to 
different parts of the body with alligator clips; various forms of suspension with hands and 
feet tied together, including the so-called &#8220;Ethiopian style&#8221; for prolonged periods. In these

</b></p>
<p>positions the victims were swung, beaten, or heavy devices such as car batteries were 
placed on top of their backs. Furthermore, they were sometimes blindfolded or forced to 
inhale candle smoke. In most instances, the purpose of the torture was to extract 
confessions or information; sometimes it was intended as punishment, intimidation or for 
the purpose of extorting money. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur received information and allegations from a wide range of 
actors, including lawyers, representatives of civil society and victims themselves, indicating 
that, in Malabo Central Police Station, torture and ill-treatment took place mainly during 
arrest and interrogation in the premises of the judicial police: For instance, one person 
described how he had cables from a car battery attached to his toes with alligator clips and 
was threatened with electro shocks if he refused to confess. Another man said that he had 
been injured with a stapler on his toe and finger during interrogation. A number of victims 
described how their hands and feet had been tied behind the backs and they had been 
suspended from an iron bar fixed on two chairs so that the face faced the floor; they then 
were forced to breathe the smoke of a candle held in front of their faces; some were beaten 
with a high voltage cable while in this position. Another witness described how he was 
injured on his neck, resulting from violence used during his arrest, when his head had been 
pushed down violently while he was being pushed in a police car. Another victim 
complained about pain in his thumb and forefinger as a result of the prolonged tight 
application of handcuffs. Other alleged victims reported that they had been injured with 
knives on their face, kicked, slapped, or otherwise beaten during arrest. When the Special 
Rapporteur visited these premises, he found several of the torture devices that had been 
described to him by witnesses in the front office situated to the left of the right entrance. 
These devices included a car battery, a starter cable, several iron bars and a thick black 
cable.  
</p>
<p>41. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur received consistent allegations about torture in 
Bata Central Police Station, applied during interrogation mostly at night in the interrogation 
room in the basement. Many interviewees explained how they had been hung up on 
handcuffs, suspended in various ways from a relatively short metal bar between two black 
tables, including the so-called &#8220;Ethiopian style&#8221; for prolonged periods; in these positions 
the victims were swung, or had heavy devices such as car batteries placed on top of their 
backs. Some described that they were beaten on the soles, the back and sometimes on other 
parts of the body with police batons, solid &#8220;rubberized&#8221; cables and wooden bars. 
Furthermore, they were sometimes blindfolded or forced to inhale candle smoke. Often this 
treatment was either preceded or followed by lengthy kicking and beatings, sometimes with 
truncheons, sticks on the buttocks and various other parts of the body while lying on a 
mattress. Some detainees were blindfolded during the beating. Several witnesses described 
to the Special Rapporteur how, after having been suspended and beaten, police officers 
forced them to climb up the stairs from the basement to the first floor on their knees 
because they were unable to walk. Effects of the various forms of ill-treatment described to 
the Special Rapporteur were heavy bleeding, the inability to stand, dress, etc, pain in the 
wrists, ankles, arms, shoulders, numbness in hands and feet, etc. The forensic expert found 
that, on the whole, these descriptions corroborated the allegations. When, following a 
lengthy discussion, the Special Rapporteur was allowed to enter the interrogation room in 
the basement of Bata police station, he found a mattress, two black tables next to each 
other, a special light of red colour, handcuffs and wooden and metal bars &#8211; all objects that 
numerous witnesses had described to him in much detail.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur received very serious allegations of severe and prolonged 
torture of Equatoguinean citizens accused of involvement in attempted overthrows of the 
political system, such as suspensions for long periods while forced to breathe in smoke, 
severe beatings with heavy cables and batons, the use of thumbscrews and electroshocks 
and solitary confinement for long periods. According to credible testimonies, this treatment </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8211; directly ordered by the Government or a Minister - frequently took place at unofficial 
places of detention.  
</p>
<p>43. In other police and gendarmerie custody facilities, the Special Rapporteur received 
only few recent allegations of torture and ill-treatment. Rather, his interlocutors indicated 
that, in recent years, detainees were normally transferred to the central police stations of 
Malabo or Bata fairly quickly.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Groups made vulnerable in detention  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Women  
</b></p>
<p>44. In violation of international norms6 women in prisons as well as in police and 
gendarmerie custody were not separated from male adults and were therefore extremely 
vulnerable to sexual violence and other forms of abuse. Several witnesses reported that 
female detainees were regularly asked to provide sexual services to officers, guards and 
male co-detainees, sometimes in exchange for food or other commodities. The Special 
Rapporteur received consistent allegations of sexual violence and harassment against 
foreign women in prisons and police custody &#8211; officers practically put them &#8220;at the 
disposal&#8221; of Equatoguinean men. When the women asked for protection, they were told off.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur found several women who were pregnant from co-prisoners 
and learned that since women could freely intermingle with men, it was frequently in the 
women&#8217;s interest to choose one of them for a special relationship in order to be protected 
from other male prisoners. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment, no mechanisms to 
protect women from exploitation were in place. He also received allegations that pregnant 
women had little, if any, access to medical care.  
</p>
<p><b>  Children  
</b></p>
<p>46. In violation of international norms, in prisons as well as in police and gendarmerie 
custody, there was no separation of minors from adults. The Special Rapporteur received 
several allegations of harassment and sexual violence of minors. In one interview, a boy 
told the Special Rapporteur that he was afraid because some people in the prison were &#8220;not 
good and force me to do things I do not want to do&#8221;. In particular he was afraid of the night, 
when beatings and &#8220;bad things&#8221; happen.  
</p>
<p>47. In one case that was brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, a group of 
girls aged between 11 and 14, in absence of a legal basis, had been &#8220;sentenced&#8221; to public 
shaving by a judge, which was conducted in front of their parents. In the view of the 
Special Rapporteur, this constitutes degrading punishment. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur also was told in several instances (e.g. at Malabo Central 
Police) that, although the Criminal Code sets 16 as the age of criminal responsibility, young 
children, the youngest aged 9, had been detained and were released just prior to his arrival.  
</p>
<p><b>  Foreigners 
</b></p>
<p>49. The conditions in which immigrants pending deportation were held in police stations 
often for very long periods of time were even worse than for Equatoguineans. They had no

in 1955, and approved by the Economic and Social Council by its resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 
31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>or little access to food and/or water since, in most cases, they had no family members 
nearby to help them. This frequently rendered them dependent on other detainees for 
assistance. Moreover, their ability to contact the consular representations of their countries 
was limited. Many foreign detainees in Malabo Police Station and Bata Police Station had 
not been allowed to contact their consulates in spite of several requests to that effect.  
</p>
<p>50. Immigrants in prisons and police detention facilities ran an increased risk of being 
subjected to discriminatory practices and sometimes even physical abuse by guards, as well 
as other detainees. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned about repeated allegations that 
foreign detainees in police custody in Malabo and Bata were frequently subject to beatings, 
harassment and also sexual violence by Equatoguinean detainees, tacitly tolerated or even 
encouraged by the police officers.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Lack of reparation and re-victimization  
</b></p>
<p>51. Article 9 of Law 6/2006, in accordance with the requirements under article 14 of the 
Convention Against Torture that victims of torture must have access to redress and 
adequate compensation, holds that a person responsible for an offence &#8220;is obliged to 
provide reparation for the damage and compensate the victim or his/her relatives for the 
prejudices caused in the following cases: a) loss of life; b) harm to the health; c) loss of 
liberty; d) loss of revenues; e) incapacity to work; f) loss or harm of property; g) damage to 
one&#8217;s reputation&#8221;. Article 10 provides that the State, as a subsidiary, guarantees reparation 
and the right to just and adequate compensation to any victim of torture or cruel, inhuman 
and degrading treatment or punishment, including means for rehabilitation as complete as 
possible. However, the Special Rapporteur did not learn of a single case where 
reparation/compensation was provided, which is of even greater concern given the scale of 
the use of torture he observed. 
</p>
<p>52. On the contrary, since the administration of justice is dysfunctional (see also section 
III A), many torture victims experience a total lack of justice: perpetrators are practically 
never prosecuted; those who file complaints against their torturers, become stigmatized, 
find it difficult to find jobs or return to school and live in constant fear of reprisals by the 
authorities; those who have been imprisoned for long periods without ever learning why, 
have the feeling that their lives have been destroyed. In addition, some of the detainees 
interviewed by the Special Rapporteur suffer from serious physical symptoms as much as 
seven years after the occurrence of the acts of torture, e.g. one man had not been able to 
move his arms for one year and continues to feel numbness in his hands, is still unable to 
wear shoes and has difficulties walking because the tissue of his soles has been destroyed 
by extremely severe beatings on the soles of his feet and suspension by his arms seven 
years earlier. A number of victims indicated that they were in urgent need of psychological 
rehabilitation, which was not available in Equatorial Guinea. Overall, the Special 
Rapporteur finds that the combination of social exclusion of persons who defended their 
rights, the total lack of reparation and justice, together with the untreated physical and 
mental consequences that torture victims experience constitutes a vicious circle of re-
victimization, in many cases causing ongoing suffering that might amount to inhuman 
treatment. </p>
<p><b> E. Involvement in kidnappings abroad/secret detention 
</b></p>
<p>53. Numerous reports indicate that Equatoguinean officials have been involved in, or 
have committed themselves, kidnapping abroad before transferring the individuals to 
Equatorial Guinea and holding them in secret and/or incommunicado detention. This was 
allegedly the case of three persons who are still being held in secret detention probably in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>Black Beach Prison, namely Florencio Ela Bibang, Antimo Edu Nchama, and Felipe Esono 
Ntutumu7, who the Special Rapporteur regrettably was not able to meet because he was 
unable to gain access to the part of the prison where they were reportedly held. Also a 
number of other cases of prolonged secret detention, most often of persons accused of 
political crimes, have been brought to his attention.  </p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur interviewed one individual who had been arrested in 
Cameroon, where he used to live as a refugee some months prior to the visit. He was then 
handed over to soldiers of the Equatoguinean Presidential Guard who took him to Malabo. 
He was detained incommunicado in solitary confinement, handcuffed and in leg-irons. Both 
were removed shortly before the Special Rapporteur arrived.  </p>
<p><b> III. An environment conducive to torture 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Non-functioning of the Administration of Justice  
</b></p>
<p>55. The context that allows torture to continue unabatedly is characterized by the non-
functioning of the administration of justice and, therefore, the absence of the rule of law. In 
this context, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall the findings of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention on their visit in November 2007 (A/HRC/7/4/Add.3), which discussed 
serious concerns in the following areas: the compatibility of the legal framework with 
international standards; the lack of independence of the judiciary; the excessive power of 
the police and the military, and the lack of a registration system. The Special Rapporteur 
also found that the judiciary did not fulfil its role as an element of protection against torture. 
Rather it appeared to be effectively controlled by the law-enforcement bodies. According to 
numerous testimonies, when any victim or his/her lawyer raised torture allegations in court, 
the judge did not pay any attention.  Moreover, only very few of the detainees interviewed 
by the Special Rapporteur had lawyers. If they did, they generally did not trust them. Law-
enforcement was militarized, in practice the various bodies were indistinguishable from 
each other and lacked any accountability mechanisms. Moreover, &#8220;evidence&#8221; obtained 
under torture was commonly used as the basis for convictions, which meant that there was 
considerable pressure on the police to extract confessions. The police and other law-
enforcement bodies clearly also lacked training. According to many detainees, the prison 
authorities did not take any action when detainees with visible traces of torture arrived. The 
Prosecutor did not appear to play a major role at all. </p>
<p><b> B. Impunity  
</b></p>
<p>56. Notwithstanding article 14 of Law 6/2006, which contains a victim and witness 
protection clause and requires the State to ensure that every alleged victim of torture may 
present a complaint to a judge and that the case be examined promptly and impartially by 
the competent authorities, in practice no complaints channels exist and detainees cannot file 
any complaints with State bodies that would entail investigations and prosecutions. Also, 
many interlocutors of the Special Rapporteur indicated that they were afraid of reprisals, in 
particular by the police. 
</p>
<p>57. Whereas the Commission on Human Rights of Equatorial Guinea (CHR), created by 
Decree Law no. 7/1990 of 27 September 19908, was mandated to receive complaints and 
</p>
<p>  
 7 See also report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention A/HRC/7/4/Add.3.

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>tasked with undertaking investigations, in reality the Special Rapporteur was not informed 
of a single complaint filed with, or investigated by, the Commission.   
</p>
<p>58. Article 282 of the Criminal Procedure Act puts the judicial police in charge of 
investigating offences committed on its territory &#8211; but, as described above, the Judicial 
Police is the body that perpetrates most of the ill-treatment, so this is not a credible 
institutional arrangement. In accordance with article 649 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 
prosecution functions are exercised by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the private 
prosecuting party, but this has been done only with regard to one case: following the 
enactment of Law 6/2006, an attempt was undertaken, on the basis of strong evidence, to 
bring to justice some torturers, and a trial by military court was scheduled to take place in 
Bata in 2007. However, when the victims of torture who were invited to give testimony, 
arrived at the court, they found two of the key defendants on the judges&#8217; bench instead of 
being accused. As a result, the latter were not even tried, and only one female police officer 
was sentenced to seven months of imprisonment for a separate case of torture with lethal 
consequence: apart from her, no alleged perpetrator of torture has ever been brought to 
justice. Instead, even officers who are widely known to regularly use torture continue their 
careers in the police/gendarmerie forces.  
</p>
<p>59. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s assessment, the above is in violation of articles 4 to 9 of 
the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment requiring criminal investigation aimed at bringing each individual perpetrator 
to justice. In addition, articles 12 and 13 require that &#8220;competent authorities proceed to a 
prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an 
act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction&#8221; and that &#8220;any 
individual who alleges he has been subjected to torture in any territory under its jurisdiction 
has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and impartially examined by, its 
competent authorities.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b> C. Lack of inspection/monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>60. Article 2 of the Convention Against Torture stipulates that &#8220;Each State Party shall 
take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of 
torture in any territory under its jurisdiction&#8221;, and the Committee against torture has 
provided further guidance on what this means in practice in its General Comment 2, 
including in terms of &#8220;the need to establish impartial mechanisms for inspecting and 
visiting places of detention and confinement&#8221; (para. 13).  
</p>
<p>61. Although article 526 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Equatorial Guinea provides 
that the investigative judge, accompanied by a representative of the office of the Public 
Prosecutor, is to conduct weekly unannounced visits to prisons to check the situation of 
detainees and to adopt measures to correct any abuses, the overwhelming majority of the 
detainees interviewed by the Special Rapporteur had not seen any judges or prosecutors 
during their detention.  
</p>
<p>62. The Commission on Human Rights of Equatorial Guinea indicated that visits to all 
places of detention had been undertaken prior to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission (each of 
their visits needed to be authorized by the Ministry of National Security), that it had not 
found a single case of torture or ill-treatment and that, on the contrary, the conditions were 
steadily improving. The CHR stated that many of its earlier recommendations had been 
implemented, e.g. conditions in Malabo Police Station improved, women and children were

National Human Rights Institutions. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>held separately from male detainees. All these assertions are in stark contrast to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s own observations.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Corruption  
</b></p>
<p>63. According to many interlocutors of the Special Rapporteur, corruption is deeply 
ingrained in Equatorial Guinea9, in particular at all stages of the criminal justice system. 
Many detainees indicated that they had been offered release in exchange for the payment of 
a certain sum of money; some were even tortured with the aim of extorting money. Others 
said that they were asked to pay for visits, etc. As a result of the endemic corruption, the 
criminal justice system discriminates against the poor and the arbitrariness of the system is 
exacerbated. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, the widespread corruption in the 
administration of justice is a consequence of a generally non-functional and non-
independent judicial system.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Insufficient State action to protect persons from privately inflicted 
harm 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Committee against torture, in paragraph 18 of its General Comment 2 states, 
&#8220;Since the failure of the State to exercise due diligence to intervene to stop, sanction and 
provide remedies to victims of torture facilitates and enables non-State actors to commit 
acts impermissible under the Convention with impunity, the State&#8217;s indifference or inaction 
provides a form of encouragement and/or de facto permission. The Committee has applied 
this principle to States parties&#8217; failure to prevent and protect victims from gender-based 
violence, such as rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, and trafficking.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>65. In Equatoguinean law, there are no clear provisions prohibiting corporal punishment 
of children. Whereas the Government has signed some relevant memoranda, paragraph 4 of 
art. 420 of the Penal Code establishes that, if a father causes injuries to his child, in 
&#8220;exceeding himself&#8221; in correcting him/her, it would not be considered a crime. The latter 
provision is in clear contravention of international law. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur 
has also not learned about any active measures taken to ensure that children are not 
subjected to corporal punishments by their parents, at schools, etc, such as the creation of 
accessible complaints mechanisms, an appropriate institutional framework to protect and 
support victims and/or awareness raising campaigns.  
</p>
<p>66. Violence against women in the private sphere appears to receive little attention as 
well: The Penal Code does not criminalize domestic violence, although it prohibits harm, 
including beatings and ill-treatment. Its article 429 holds that the rape of a woman is to be 
punished by &#8220;reclusi&#243;n menor&#8221; (medium-term imprisonment), but spousal rape seems not 
to be covered by this law. A mediation procedure has been set up within the Dispute 
Settlement Division of the Ministry of Social Action and the Promotion of Women to act as 
facilitator between parties in regard to complaints against physical, psychological and 
economic violence with the aim of reaching a friendly settlement, but no details about the 
results of its work were available. Whereas reportedly some initiatives seem underway to 
combat violence against women, such as training programmes for the police to deal with 
complaints co-funded by the United States and awareness raising-programmes, the 
Prosecutor General indicated that no cases of violence against women have been brought 
before the courts. There is also no shelter in the country. According to the Minister for

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p><b>67. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude for the invitation extended by 
the Government, which he interprets as a sign of the Government&#8217;s preparedness to 
subject its places of detention to independent scrutiny by an external, objective expert. 
He further notes the existence of a comprehensive law prohibiting torture and 
providing for the prosecution of torturers adopted in 2006 and the improvements in 
the physical conditions of prisons.   
</b></p>
<p><b>68. On the basis of discussions with public officials, judges, lawyers and 
representatives of civil society, interviews with victims of violence and with persons 
deprived of their liberty, most often corroborated by forensic medical evidence, the 
Special Rapporteur concludes that torture is systematically used by the police, in 
particular at the Central Police Stations in Bata and Malabo. The types of abuse 
reported and corroborated by expert medical analysis and evidence found in the 
respective police stations, includes severe beatings on various parts of the body, 
electroshocks, various forms of suspension with hands and feet tied together, 
including the so-called &#8220;Ethiopian style&#8221; for prolonged periods. Furthermore, the 
victims were sometimes blindfolded or forced to inhale candle smoke. 
</b></p>
<p><b>69. The Special Rapporteur received consistent allegations that corporal 
punishment continued to be routinely applied by prison guards in front of other 
prisoners in Bata and Black Beach prisons. However, he was encouraged to learn that 
corporal punishment seemed not to have been applied any more for the last several 
months at Evinayong Prison. 
</b></p>
<p><b>70. Whereas the physical conditions in penitentiary institutions have improved 
over recent years, the Special Rapporteur observed some overcrowding and heavy 
restrictions on the detainees (in terms of restraints such as the permanent wearing of 
leg irons and solitary confinement). Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about the severe limitations on contacts with the outside world.  
</b></p>
<p><b>71. With the exception of the newly built Bata Central Police Station, police and 
gendarmerie holding cells were generally in a dilapidated physical state with food 
provided only by the detainees&#8217; families or by fellow detainees, access to water for 
drinking and washing was severely restricted; detainees were usually not allowed to 
use the toilet, and as a result had to resort to using plastic bottles or plastic bags; they 
had no possibility to exercise and no access to medical care. Overall the conditions 
showed complete disregard for the dignity of the detainees and contravened 
international standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>72. The Special Rapporteur received credible reports that immigrants run an 
increased risk of being subjected to discriminatory practices and sometimes even 
physical abuse by other detainees with the tacit approval of the police.  
</b></p>
<p><b>73. In prisons as well as in police and gendarmerie custody, women and children 
are not separated from male adults and are therefore extremely vulnerable to sexual 
violence and other forms of abuse by guards as well as by co-prisoners. Intra-prisoner 
violence, including sexual harassment and rape may amount to torture/ill-treatment, 
if the authorities consent or acquiesce.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>74. The Special Rapporteur finds impunity to be practically total. Except for one 
case, no alleged perpetrator of torture has been brought to justice. In this context, fear 
of reprisals expressed by many interlocutors, is of grave concern. Moreover, no 
preventive mechanisms exist, safeguards are totally ineffective, and no compensation 
and/or rehabilitation is provided in practice.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>75. In order for Equatorial Guinea to comply with its obligations under both 
international human rights law and its Constitution, the Special Rapporteur considers 
it indispensible to undertake a comprehensive institutional and legal overhaul 
establishing law enforcement bodies based on the rule of law, an independent 
judiciary, and effective monitoring and accountability mechanisms; only if these steps 
are taken, Law 6/2006, which, in principle, provides a good basis for preventing and 
combating torture effectively, can be implemented.  
</b></p>
<p><b>76. In addition to the above, a number of steps should be taken in the immediate 
future to address the most urgent human rights concerns:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Implement the recommendations contained in the report on the 2007 
visit of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) to Equatorial Guinea 
(A/HRC/7/4/Add.3, para. 100), notably the Government should urgently end secret 
detention; revise the national criminal law framework with a view to implementing 
international minimum standards, including introducing effective habeas corpus 
proceedings; reform the judiciary with a view to rendering it independent; and allow 
civil society organizations to function independently;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Strictly separate women from adult men in all places of detention;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Bearing in mind the WGAD&#8217;s recommendation (m), introduce a juvenile 
justice system and ensure the strict separation of minors from adults;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Introduce proper registration in police detention (to some extent the 
gendarmerie registers can serve as an example) and establish proper registers in 
prisons;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Issue a transparent set of rules allowing for regular family visits in all 
places of detention;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Minimize the use of solitary confinement (see also A/63/175, paras 77-85 
and annex) and refrain from using leg irons and other restraints;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Improve conditions in police and gendarmerie custody facilities; notably 
provide food and drinking water and ensure that detainees have access to medical 
care as well as toilets and sanitary facilities;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Regarding foreigners, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reinforce the 
recommendation of the WGAD (l) to avoid the detention of foreigners, where possible 
and to fully afford detained immigrants all the rights recognized by international 
instruments to persons deprived of liberty, including their right to contact their 
consular representations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Refrain from using secret detention and abductions in neighbouring 
countries;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Abolish the death penalty.  
</b></p>
<p><b>77. With regard to the international community, the Special Rapporteur notes that, 
as a result of the discovery of considerable oil reserves on Equatorial Guinean </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>territory, many trans-national corporations are operating in the country. Also, a 
number of bilateral and multilateral donors run technical assistance programmes 
including in the areas of law-enforcement and administration of justice. The Special 
Rapporteur invites the international actors present in the country, including trans-
national corporations, to take note of his assessment that torture is systematically 
practiced by the police, and to ensure that, in their joint undertakings and initiatives, 
they are not complicit in violations of the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment10.

</p>

<p><b>Appendix I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Central Police Station - Malabo 
  Visited on 11 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>The following accounts are based on the Special Rapporteur's visit and on allegations by 
detainees he received during private interviews. As mentioned in the main report, the 
Special Rapporteur feels that he cannot exclude that there might be reprisals against 
individuals he interviewed during his mission. He has therefore decided to depart from 
usual practice and to publish only the names of the persons whose story is already known in 
the public domain. The names of all other detainees are kept confidential. If detainees 
requested total confidentiality, their allegations are not contained in the present appendix.  
</p>
<p><b>General information</b>: The Central Police Station is located in the centre of Malabo. The 
Special Rapporteur was received by Sebastian Belope (Commissario Alf&#233;rez). The 
detention facility was divided in two wings, one with three small cells and another one with 
a large cell and a large courtyard. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was informed that the courtyard wing was reserved for illegal 
immigrants. However, several citizens of Equatorial Guinea were held there as well. Men 
and women were detained together, the large cell was completely overcrowded, and there 
were not enough beds for everybody. There were no toilets and detainees defecated in 
plastic bags and urinated in plastic bottles, which they then threw over the wall of the 
building.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur received allegations that, at times, up to several hundred persons 
were detained in the courtyard. The police reportedly did not intervene in cases of inter-
prisoner violence or to protect the women from harassment by male detainees. There was 
an internal disciplinary system allegedly run by Equatoguinean prisoners who occasionally 
beat foreign detainees and applied discriminatory practices against them. According to 
some allegations, the foreigners were moved into the closed cell over night and the persons 
held in the three small cells were brought in the courtyard for sleeping. The Special 
Rapporteur received consistent allegations of beatings, especially of minors. The foreign 
detainees did not receive any food or water.  
</p>
<p>Although, according to the police, the three small cells (each of about 8 square meters) 
were reserved for Equatoguinean citizens, the Special Rapporteur found that many among 
the 18 detainees were foreigners, e.g. from Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad. Some of the 
detainees had already spent up to 26 days in police custody. The youngest was 15 years old. 
The Special Rapporteur was also told that some seven children between 10 and 11 years old 
had been held in one of the cells for three days, but had been released on the morning of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. Similarly, four women had allegedly been detained in the cell 
for four or five days and had just been released on that day. The three cells were in an 
appalling state. There were no beds or mattresses. The middle cell where 12 detainees were 
held was severely overcrowded, so that prisoners had to take turns to lay down on the floor 
and rest. The detainees were confined to their cells for 24 hours and were not allowed to 
leave the cell to shower, bath or even use the toilet. The toilet opposite the cell was 
surrounded by a wall and smelled horrible. The detainees had to urinate into plastic bottles, 
which were piled up in front of the cells and to defecate into plastic bags which they threw 
outside the cells. The detainees said they had not showered since their arrival. They had 
enough water, but complained that they were not provided with food. Food was provided 
exclusively by families.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>None of the detainees in the cells reported that he/she had been subjected to beatings or 
other ill-treatment since they had been put into the cell. However, the Special Rapporteur 
received several allegations of ill-treatment during arrest and interrogation: One detainee 
said he had been injured with a knife on his right cheek by a gendarmerie officer prior to 
this transfer to the police station. Another detainee said he had been injured with a paper 
stapler on his toe and finger during the first interrogation in the section of the Judicial 
Police. Another detainee said he had cables of a car battery attached to his toes by members 
of the Judicial Police, who threatened him with electro shocks if he refused to confess. 
Another detainee complained about pain in his thumb and forefinger as a result of the tight 
application of handcuffs. Another person said he was suffering from injuries on his neck, 
which he had obtained during his arrest. His head had been pushed down violently when he 
was pushed into the police car by the police officers who arrested him. The foreigners 
among the detainees had not been able to contact their consular representatives, although 
they had requested to do so. Many of the allegations were corroborated by medical 
evidence.  
</p>
<p>In Black Beach Prison the Special Rapporteur received consistent allegations from 
prisoners who had been tortured during interrogation in the premises of the Judicial Police. 
When the Special Rapporteur visited, he found several torture devices in the front office 
situated to the left of the right entrance that had been described to him by the detainees. 
These devices included a car battery, a starter cable, several iron bars and a thick black 
cable.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, foreigner, had been arrested in October 2008 because he could not produce 
valid documents. He had paid a considerable sum of money to one of the police officers in 
charge at the police station, who had promised to release him, but was subsequently asked 
for more. He was afraid of reprisals for speaking with the Special Rapporteur. According to 
him, foreign detainees were frequently subject to violence by the Equatoguinean detainees, 
which was tacitly tolerated by the police officers. 
</p>
<p><b>Female detainee</b>, aged 24, foreigner with Equatoguinean mother. She grew up in Nigeria 
and came to Equatorial Guinea to see her mother. In Equatorial Guinea she requested an 
Equatoguinean passport and consequently planned to travel with this passport to Spain. She 
was arrested by two police officers at Malabo airport in early November 2008, who slapped 
her and took her to the Central Police Station, where she was detained in the wing for 
foreigners together with about 40 men and one other woman. She reported that at night 
some male detainees had tried to rape her and one Equatoguinean man in particular kept 
harassing her, but so far she could defend herself. She could see her boyfriend once through 
the barred window of the police station. Since her arrest, she had not received food from the 
police but another female detainee had given her some food.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, foreigner, arrived in Equatorial Guinea in early November 2008 and was 
arrested three days later. He was reportedly beaten and kicked by three police officers all 
over his body. His allegations were corroborated by medical evidence; as a consequence of 
the ill-treatment, he had a fractured right meta carpel bone between knuckles and writs and 
his hand was severely swollen. According to the forensic expert, this is a typical defensive 
injury which occurs when a person tries to protect his or her face from beatings and kicks.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, had been told he would be held for five days but had been detained for 
several months by the time of the Special Rapporteur's visit; he complained that there was 
almost no water and that detainees had to pay for drinking water; food was not provided 
and there was no protection against mosquitoes; for the first month he had been held in a 
cell within the building; he could see his girlfriend through the window.

</p>
<p>Male detainee, foreigner; had been detained for five weeks; he complained that the 
conditions were very poor and many people were sick; he had never seen a doctor, and had 
never been brought before a prosecutor or judge.  
</p>
<p><b>  Black Beach Prison - Malabo 
  Visited on 12 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: Black Beach Prison is located within a military base, where soldiers 
and families are housed. The Special Rapporteur had to negotiate for almost one hour 
before he was granted access. He was not allowed to bring camera equipment. The Special 
Rapporteur spoke with Baltazar Esono Abeso, Jefe de Central Penitenciaria. 
</p>
<p>The actual prison is a complex of two buildings with a courtyard in between. Prisoners 
could move around freely in the building and the courtyard with the exception of the 
detainees held in solitary confinement. In the courtyard, a small wooden shack spent shade 
to a small number of detainees, the rest of the yard was without shelter. The prison guards 
within the complex were heavily armed. 
</p>
<p>To the right of the courtyard, petty offenders (so-called &#8220;bandits&#8221;) were held in a large hall 
where at the time of the visit some 40 detainees were present although there were only 24 
mattresses and one dirty toilet. The prison kitchen was also located in this building.  
</p>
<p>The building on the left-hand side was used for prisoners convicted of &#8220;political&#8221; crimes, 
women and children and prisoners with a higher level of education (according to national 
legislation and to the Sergeant in charge, prisoners were separated depending on their level 
of education). The second floor of this building, which was separated by a horizontal net 
and accessible via stairs protected by a barred gate, housed the &#8220;high security&#8221; section 
consisting of single cells. These were used for solitary confinement of high security 
prisoners (Simon Mann, Nick du Toit, Cipriano Nguema Mba and others) and as 
punishment for disciplinary offences for periods up to one month. All the high security 
prisoners held there, except Simon Mann, were permanently in leg-irons, which were 
removed shortly before the arrival of the Special Rapporteur. The cells had a small window 
to the outside, about two meters from the floor, which provided some daylight; electric light 
was available in every cell, and each cell had video surveillance equipment. The cells 
measured about 3,5 x 2,5 meters, contained a shower, toilet and sink, which were separated 
by a low wall. Items in the cells included a bed with mosquito net, chair, fan and bathing 
utensils.  
</p>
<p>Some detainees convicted of &#8220;political&#8221; crimes were held on the ground floor together with 
persons convicted of common crimes. Women slept in separate cells, but could mingle 
freely with the male detainees during the day. One woman was four months pregnant from 
a co-prisoner. Juveniles were not separated from adults even during the night. The Special 
Rapporteur received consistent allegations regarding sexual abuse of minors. Many 
detainees also reported that corporal punishment was regularly applied close to the portal 
where all detainees could watch.  
</p>
<p>The prisoners were provided with two meals per day (bread and milk in the morning and 
rice with some meat in the afternoon). Most of the detainees reported that they suffered 
from the quasi-total prohibition of visits. Access to medical treatment was restricted and 
dependent on whether the prisoners were able to cover the related costs themselves.  
</p>
<p>Within the prison complex, an additional building comprised a hall resembling a &#8220;court 
room&#8221; (was allegedly used for interrogations) and several rooms, some of which were used 
as special cells for three military prisoners and two female detainees. The conditions were 
decent &#8211; a room of about 16 sqm with air-conditioning with two mattresses and no </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>restrictions on the use of toilets and water; the food was the same as in the main prison. The 
Special Rapporteur interviewed one person who had been in the room for seven months; he 
was held there on the basis of an administrative decision taken by a judge; the only 
complaint he had concerned the fact that he had no idea for how long he had to stay.  
</p>
<p>The pharmacy and office of the medical doctor were located in the back of the building. 
One room was locked, and the Special Rapporteur was denied access since, according to 
the officers on duty, they were not in possession of the key. He had been told by other 
detainees that these facilities were used to hide certain political prisoners. 
</p>
<p><b>Female detainee</b> had been at Black Beach Prison for several months. She had been arrested 
in Bata and stayed at the police post for about 70 days before she was transferred to Malabo 
Central Police Station, where she stayed for another two months in a cell together with 
men. At the Bata police station she was beaten on the buttocks and soles of her feet to 
extort a confession; she complained that at Black Beach Prison the food and the water were 
bad; she had no contact with her family outside the prison; she told the Special Rapporteur 
that she had not experienced violence from co-prisoners and that she could lock the cell 
door from the inside during the night. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been arrested in December 2003 in Bata, where he had been kept in a 
calabozo (military cell) of 1 x 2 meters for three months; the conditions were poor since he 
could not go to the toilet or wash; he was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for 
committing a crime against the State after a closed trial by a military tribunal; he was then 
transferred to Black Beach Prison  where he was held in solitary confinement for more than 
one year; he complained that not long before the visit, the food he had been allowed to 
receive earlier from relatives had been blocked; the food provided by the prison authorities 
was insufficient; he had not been allowed to receive any visits for the past year.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, was brought to the solitary confinement cell directly after his arrest in 
2008; two days later, he was taken to Malabo Central Police Station, where seven persons 
(policemen as well as security agents) beat him with high-voltage cables and batons. They 
kicked and beat him all over the body until he confessed. A pistol, meant as a threat, was 
put on the table next to him while he was subjected to ill-treatment. Following the torture, 
he had lesions and bruises all over his body, but was never allowed access to a doctor. The 
Director General of Security and the Secretary of State for Security were reportedly present 
during the ill-treatment. During his trial, he was represented by a lawyer, but could only 
meet him one day prior to the trial. The fact that he had been tortured was raised by the 
lawyer, but no judge asked any questions about it. In prison, he suffered most from the 
prohibition of any contacts with his family.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>: in early 2008, his wife was arrested, handcuffed and beaten to force her to 
disclose his whereabouts to the security forces. He therefore had to go to the Central Police 
Station to have his wife released, which happened. Subsequently he was brought to the 
office of the Commissioner, where the Director General of Security and the Secretary of 
State for Security were present. His fingers where put between thumbscrews which were 
tightened. After about 25 minutes he started crying and shortly after the thumbscrews were 
removed. As a result he could not move the fingers for a week. He was taken back to the 
cell, where he stayed for two days, while the questioning continued. His hands were tied 
behind the back and his feet were tied as well. In this position, he was suspended from an 
iron bar between two chairs, so that his face faced the floor. They then brought a candle and 
put it in front of his nose, so that he had to breathe the smoke. They also put a big heavy car 
battery on his back for one hour. The pain this caused was unbearable. They stopped the 
torture when he signed a confession. He was detained in the cell for two months. 
Sometimes he was allowed to shower very quickly. His family could visit and bring food. 
He was subsequently tried in a closed trial, where all the allegations of torture were ignored 
and taken to Black Beach Prison. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, was arrested in early 2008, when he reported to the police. He was taken to 
the &#8220;interpol cell&#8221;, where the General Director of Security was present. The police 
incorrectly recorded his statement. When he protested, his hands were tied behind his back 
with a metal cable with tissue underneath. The police put him on a metal bar fixed between 
two chairs with his face down. They put a candle in front of his face so that he had to 
breathe the smoke, which made him dizzy (the dizziness lasted for two weeks). In addition, 
eight persons were beating him with a high voltage cable. On the following two days he 
could not move his legs and arms, and others had to help him to go to the toilet and to eat 
and drink. His whole body was in pain. He could also not walk for a while. During the trial, 
when he raised the allegations of torture, he was interrupted. He was then sentenced to six 
years of imprisonment. He had not seen his family since his transfer to Black Beach Prison 
in the first half 2008. He was not allowed to send or receive letters.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, arrested in Bata in late 2005 by the Minister of Territorial Administration. 
Immediately after his arrest he was taken to a private house outside Bata, where he was 
blindfolded, and his elbows and ankles were tied with ropes. The officers then suspended 
him between two beds for about one hour. He was then taken to the main police station for 
four or five days and subsequently to the gendarmerie, where he stayed for four or five 
days. Then he was detained in Bata Prison for four months and was transferred to Black 
Beach Prison afterwards. As a consequence of the torture he was subjected to, for eight 
months his body was extremely weak and he could hardly move his arms and hands. He 
needed help even for getting dressed or undressed. There was no reaction when he tried to 
raise allegations during the trial. He had not had any visits since 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been in the prison for about 18 months; after his arrest he was detained 
at Malabo Central Police Station for one month in a situation of terrible overcrowding, 
during which he received no food; he told the Special Rapporteur that a soldier named 
Marcus Ekua beat him on his buttocks at his office for about 30 minutes for two subsequent 
nights. He did not have a lawyer and had not had a trial; he was not allowed any visits; at 
Black Beach Prison he had to share a bed with up to three other men; he said he did small 
jobs for richer prisoners to get some food in exchange; he also reported that detainees who 
smoked were punished by the prison guards with beatings or solitary confinement for up to 
one month, sometimes even in shackles.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had spent more than one year at Black Beach Prison; before that he had 
been held in a police cell for six weeks; there he was hooded; several policemen tied his 
feet with a rope and handcuffed him; in this position, he was beaten with an elastic plastic 
baton on his soles and kidneys; they also placed a metal apparatus on his feet, which was 
too tight &#8211; according to the forensic expert the wound was still visible. As a result he could 
not walk for four days, but he did not confess; on the first day the beating lasted very long; 
he needed to be carried back to the cell; his feet and hands were numb &#8211; he could not feel 
any pain; he felt pain in the legs, not in the feet; he also reported that during that period he 
was not provided with any food. According to him, local prisoners at Black Beach Prison 
discriminated against foreign prisoners.  
</p>
<p><b>Simon Mann</b>, aged 56, British citizen, he had been extradited on 2 February 2008 from 
Zimbabwe to Equatorial Guinea to stand trial in relation to his role as mercenary and 
leading figure in the attempted coup to overthrow President Obiang in March 2004. At 
Malabo airport he was met by the Minister of National Security, General Mba, and the 
Director of Black Beach Prison. He said he was welcomed and politely treated. From the 
airport he was immediately brought to Black Beach Prison and put in a single cell in the 
high security section. During the first two days at Black Beach Prison, he was interviewed 
by General Mba for two hours each day during which he offered to cooperate. He said he 
was very well treated by the prison authorities, no threats or violence were used against 
him. He attributed his good treatment to the fact that he had agreed to cooperate with the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>authorities from the very beginning. He said that the South African prisoners, who had also 
been convicted in relation to the attempted coup, were held in much worse conditions, 
because they had refused to cooperate. He said that he enjoyed a special status at Black 
Beach Prison and that he had developed a friendly relationship with General Mba, with 
whom he had lunch during the days of his interrogations. For example, the General had 
provided him with a stepper to exercise in his cell and allowed him to use his cell phone to 
speak to his wife and sister in the UK. He received special food, which was directly brought 
form the Hotel Paraiso in Malabo every day, which he believed was to protect him from 
being poisoned as he had heard of several death threats against him. 
</p>
<p>Until about four days prior to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, he had been allowed to leave 
his cell to have lunch in the court room. The short walk from his cell to the building in 
which the court room was located, had been his only possibility to spend time outside in the 
open air. He did not know why the guards had stopped to take him to the court room for 
lunch. For the rest of the day, he was confined to his cell in solitary confinement. Apart 
from the lack of exercise and fresh air, he said he had no complaints. He said that he had 
everything he needed and that the prison guards carried out minor shopping for him if he 
gave them the money to do so.  
</p>
<p>During the first months of his detention, he had been shackled and handcuffed, except for 
taking a shower once a day. He said the handcuffs and chains had not been too tight. His 
handcuffs were removed in June 2008, and his leg irons in August 2008, which he said was 
due to a direct order by President Obiang. On 11 August 2008 he was taken to a private 
hospital in Malabo, where he had a surgery. The operation was paid for by the government. 
After three days in hospital he was taken back to prison, where he was in pain for about a 
week, without receiving any treatment. He continues to suffer from weak health. Since his 
detention in Black Beach Prison he has received four visits from the United Kingdom 
Consulate, representatives of which were also present during his trial. He was also visited 
by the United States Ambassador on his second day of detention. His sister and brother also 
visited him in the presence of General Mba and an interpreter. He was also visited by 
several press and TV agencies, including Channel 4, Mail on Sunday, the Telegraph, etc. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, South African citizen was arrested in March 2004 in Malabo together with 
a group of other South Africans and Armenians in connection with the attempted coup in 
March 2004 at his home by the Minister of National Security and a group of soldiers. The 
Minister in civilian clothes together with heavily armed members of the security forces 
entered his house and arrested him. He was accused of being one of the leading organizers 
of the coup and brought directly to Black Beach Prison.  
</p>
<p>On the morning following their arrest, the group was taken to Malabo Central Police 
Station to have their statements taken. According to him, Angolan and Zimbabwean 
intelligence officials were present at the police station. He was directly threatened by the 
Minister of National Security that he would be tortured on that day. When he was unable to 
write down his statement, he was beaten. After the rest of the group had been taken back to 
Black Beach Prison, he remained behind. Security forces that he identified as bodyguards 
of the Minister of National Security took him to the &#8220;torture chamber&#8221; in the basement of 
the Central Police Station in Malabo, where he was forced to lie flat on the floor, face 
down. His legs were chained together and then tied to his handcuffed arms behind his back. 
In this position he was suspended from the ceiling on thick nylon ropes and beaten for 45-
50 minutes by several police officers, while being interrogated. He was also electrocuted on 
his feet with open cables.  
</p>
<p>During the first week of his imprisonment at Black Beach Prison, the prisoners linked to the 
attempted coup were separated from the other prisoners several times and heavily beaten by 
a group of soldiers or prison guards who seemed to be on a &#8220;special shift&#8221; to undertake the 
beatings. They did not receive medical treatment for their injuries. After the first week in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>prison, a South African Commission visited the prisoners and the physical abuse 
subsequently stopped. During the first months in prison, he had been handcuffed behind his 
back so that he needed help to go to the toilet. He had marks on both his wrists and said that 
the handcuffs had been so tight that they had cut through his flesh to the bone. He had also 
been forced to bath naked outside of the prison building where women and children would 
come to collect water. Sometimes he was left for a month without the opportunity to bath or 
was forced to bath with his clothes on.  
</p>
<p>For the past four years he has been forced to wear chains 24 hours a day (allowing to 
stretch his feet only about 30 cm apart), which have left marks on his ankles, and he 
complained about swollen feet. According to the forensic expert, this description was 
confirmed by the medical evidence. He said that, with the tacit agreement of the prison 
guards, the prisoners in the high security section were now able to loosen their handcuffs or 
even take them off. 
</p>
<p>Since November 2005, he has been detained in the newly built high security section in strict 
solitary confinement and without being allowed to leave his cell. He complained about a 
general stiffness of his body due to the lack of physical exercise. He added that the years of 
solitary confinement had distressing effects on him, and that there were times when he 
didn&#8217;t know anymore what to do. He said he was provided with insufficient medical 
treatment even in cases of serious illness and usually had to wait for several days to see a 
doctor. According to him, the South African embassy had promised him to provide 
medication but there was no one to inform the embassy in case the prisoners fall ill. With 
respect to the prison food, he said the general meals included four pieces of bred and a cup 
of milk for breakfast, and a main meal at around 3 p.m., including rice and meat, but no 
vegetables, and tap water for drinking. He reported that he was not allowed to receive 
family visits and has not been in contact with his wife for two years. He was last visited by 
the South African embassy in May 2008, when he was delivered the copies of letters by his 
wife that dated back to 2005 and 2006. He said he was not allowed to make phone calls.  
</p>
<p><b>Mohamed Salam</b>, a Lebanese businessman resident in Equatorial Guinea, arrested on 29 
March 2008, convicted for the same offences as Simon Mann and sentenced to 18 years in 
prison, had been detained at Black Beach Prison since April 2008. He was held together 
with other detainees on the ground floor of the left building and reported that in general he 
received a special treatment: he explained that he received special food from a restaurant, 
free anti-malaria medication and was allowed to receive visits every week. In general, he 
reported that more medication was a question of money. Detainees were reportedly allowed 
to be in the courtyard all day. Alcohol and drugs were prohibited. Disciplinary measures 
used included beatings with plastic pipes and detention in disciplinary single cells for one 
week. Prior to his detention in Black Beach he was held in police custody at the Central 
Police Station where he also benefited from a special treatment and was accommodated in 
the office of the Deputy Commissioner equipped with a couch and air conditioner. His 
driver brought him food every day. He witnessed lots of beatings in waiting room and cells 
and said most of the ill-treatment was fuelled by alcohol.  
</p>
<p><b>Nick du Toit</b>, aged 52, South African citizen and former army officer was arrested on 9 
March 2004 and convicted on 26 November 2004 to 34 years of imprisonment in relation to 
the attempted coup in March 2008 together with Simon Mann and other South Africans. 
Nick du Toit alleged that he made his confession under torture.  
</p>
<p>During the first six weeks of his detention at Black Beach Prison he was handcuffed the 
hands behind his back. Subsequently, he was detained for four months in the old complex 
of Black Beach Prison in a very small cell with his feet and hands tied together so that he 
could not move at all. The leg irons were only removed when he had to go to the toilet. 
Although the leg irons were taken off after four months, he remained handcuffed for about 
one year, while detained in a bigger cell with more space, and together with other people. </p>

</b></p>
<p>At this time, a drunken soldier used to come in the cell with a pistol and put it at the 
detainees' heads saying &#8220;We are going to kill you&#8221;. Since his conviction he had been 
detained in solitary confinement in a single cell, and he was forced to wear leg irons the 
whole day which had been taken off shortly before the Special Rapporteur arrived. The 
solitary confinement was not based on a court judgment. He was never allowed to go out of 
the cell and was not allowed to exercise in his cell. He was only able to communicate with 
other prisoners by shouting to other cells. He reported electricity cuts and said that the food 
provided (generally milk and bread and rice and chicken) lacked vitamins which, combined 
with the lack of fresh air and exercise, seriously affected his health since he had spent more 
than four years in detention. He had been receiving visits once every four months. He was 
suffering a lot from the almost non-existing contact with his family. Their letters did not 
arrive at all or were delayed for up to one year. His wife used to come to Equatorial Guinea 
once in a while, but she was allowed to visit her husband for one hour only, and sometimes 
the permission to visit was only given on the day of her departure. He reported that the 
Prosecutor or the President himself authorized the visits. The medical treatment was very 
poor, and no medicine was provided, although a doctor paid visits to the detainees every 
two or three weeks. He reported that he had had malaria and received treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>Lieutenant Colonel Cipriano Nguema Mba Mitoho</b>, aged 43, had been arrested on 8 
October 2008 in Cameroon, where he had been living as a refugee (he had been accused in 
2003 of plotting against the government and was tried in absentia to 30 years in prison after 
his flight to Cameroon), allegedly for smuggling weapons, by a Cameroonian Gendarme, 
Lucien Mba and other persons vested in civil cloths. He was handed over to soldiers of the 
Equatoguinean Presidential Guard who took him to Malabo. At Black Beach Prison he was 
detained incommunicado in solitary confinement with his hands permanently handcuffed 
and his legs permanently chained. Both had been removed shortly before the Special 
Rapporteur arrived. He reported that he received special food which was sent by the 
President. The Minister of National Security reportedly visited him. Four of his relatives 
had reportedly died in prison (three in Bata Prison and one in Black Beach). Other relatives 
were also detained at Black Beach Prison on the ground floor of the left building. He did 
not report any ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>Female detainee</b> had been detained for two months at Black Beach Prison. After her arrest 
she was taken to Malabo Central Police Station where she was detained &#8211;permanently 
handcuffed - for two days. At Black Beach Prison she was detained together with men. She 
reported that the food was of low quality and she was suffering from very serious acne and 
would have to pay for the treatment, but had no money. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been detained for eight months at Black Beach Prison. Before, he had 
been held in police custody at a gendarmerie post for four days. During the interrogation 
there he was forced to undress and was beaten with police truncheons by three gendarmes 
on his buttocks for one hour in order to extract a confession. He had no lawyer and was not 
in contact with his family since visits were prohibited.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> was arrested in mid-2008 and taken to the Central Police Station in Malabo 
where he was beaten by two police officers with police truncheons on this head and his 
body from 4 &#8211; 6 p.m., for two subsequent days. The torture took place in the offices of the 
Judicial Police. Afterwards he was presented to a judge; however he was not allowed to 
speak and was eventually transferred to Black Beach Prison. He reported that in Black 
Beach Prison minors and young adults were abused by other detainees and were forced to 
provide other services to older detainees, such as washing cloths and dishes or cleaning the 
cells. Furthermore, the prison management had prohibited the minors to play games. Visits 
were also prohibited.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been detained for five months at Black Beach Prison. Prior to this he 
had spent two weeks in police custody at the Central Police Station in Malabo. He reported </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>that he was handcuffed during one entire day and was beaten with police truncheons all 
over his body. He indicated that he did not receive any food during these two weeks.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been held in police custody at the Central Police Station in Malabo for 
two months. During the interrogation his feet and hands were tight together and he was 
suspended, face down, for 45 minutes. In this position he was beaten with police truncheons 
on the soles of his feet (phalaca) and on his haunches, where he had undergone surgery 
because of a hernia only shortly before arrest. As a result of the beatings he was unable to 
walk for two weeks. After two months he was transferred to Black Beach Prison, where he 
has since been detained for nine months. During that period, he could not communicate 
with his family and friends, since visits were prohibited and there was no possibility to 
receive or send letters. If a prisoner was released, he was checked by the wards before 
leaving the prison and, in case he carried letters from other detainees, they were taken 
away. As a result of the beatings, his hernia deteriorated and he was in need of surgery, but 
had no access to medical treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been held at Malabo Central Police Station for over two months 
between March and May 2008 and was subsequently held incommunicado in Black Beach 
Prison. At the police station, he was brought to the office of the Secretary of State for 
Security, a place which was allegedly &#8220;equipped&#8221; with all the torture instruments. The 
police asked him to produce his election registration card which he did not have with him. 
He was forced to strip completely naked. His hands and feet were handcuffed behind his 
back and tied together and he was suspended face down from an iron bar fixed between two 
chairs. In this position, he was beaten with police truncheons on the soles of his feet and 
starter cables of a car battery (which he felt was weighing 30 kilograms) were fixed to his 
testicles. Furthermore, he was forced &#8211; with his head pushed down by the boot of a police 
officer in his neck &#8211; to hold his head during two hours over a lighted candle and to inhale 
the smoke. This resulted in a complete dizziness and was reportedly &#8220;the worst he had ever 
experienced&#8221;. In addition, as a consequence of the ill-treatment he could not urinate for four 
days and was urinating blood after this period. The torture was used in order to extract a 
confession and information and lasted from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. During the two months at 
Malabo Central Police Station, he was kept in a cell of approximately 6 sqm, together with 
eleven other persons. There were no sanitary facilities, and the detainees had to urinate in 
plastic bottles and to defecate in plastic bags. He further reported that he was not allowed to 
speak during the trial. Although his lawyer mentioned that he had been tortured during 
interrogation, the judges did not react to this information. The trial lasted only 10 minutes, 
and he was sentenced to six years of imprisonment and a fine. In Black Beach Prison he 
was held under a very strict regime; visits were not allowed and he had no possibility to 
communicate with the outside world. He had no access to medical treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, foreigner, student of science and technology, was arrested at the end of 
February 2008 and brought to the Central Police Station in Malabo. During the 
interrogation he was not mistreated because he said he was under the protection of an 
Equatoguinean woman he had been staying with. Although he denied having been involved 
in the theft he was accused of, he was told that foreigners would be automatically detained 
at Black Beach Prison. He had spent five days at the Central Police Station without being 
provided any food, so that he depended on the food given to him by other detainees. At the 
beginning of March 2008, he was transferred to Black Beach Prison. He reported that the 
foreigners among the prisoners were discriminated against and often experienced inter-
prisoner violence. He also reported that prisoners were frequently beaten by police officers 
inside the prison in front of everyone. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> arrived at Black Beach Prison at the end of August 2008. One week earlier, 
he had been picked up by two police officers at his house, who said his name was on a list 
at the police station. Upon arrest he was handcuffed behind his back and slapped in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>face. He said he had previously had problems with the military, and, upon arrival at the 
police station, he was identified by one soldier as a known &#8220;bandit&#8221;. The soldier threatened 
him with imprisonment if he did not confess. He was not beaten at the police station. He 
subsequently appeared on television together with another young man, where they were 
described by soldiers as widely known thieves that lived at the &#8220;crossroad of death&#8221;. For 
one week he was detained at Malabo Central Police Station in a cell with 35 other persons. 
During this period he could not shower or leave the cell to go to the toilet, but had to use 
plastic bags, which he said were thrown out of the window. He indicated that he did not 
receive any water or food from the police, but had to rely on food and water provided by his 
family. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, foreigner, had been working in Equatorial Guinea for 18 months, when he 
came into conflict with his employer because the latter denied to pay him the full promised 
salary. In late July 2008, he was arrested by two police officers at his home and brought to 
the Judicial Police at Malabo Central Police Station; inside the Judicial Police section he 
was tied to a pole in the middle of one of the offices, and flogged 20 times on his back and 
buttock with a thick black cable. When he complained about the salary, he was beaten again 
by five police officers. He was also suspended for 65 minutes on a stick, which was 
hanging on two ropes from the ceiling, with his hands cuffed and his legs tied in front. For 
the entire time he was swinging in the suspended position and beaten with the black cable. 
The abuse was conducted under the supervision or order of Commissario Fabian, who was 
the chief in charge of the crime section. He also said that in Commissario Fabian&#8217;s office 
(which he described as the office on the right side of the Judicial Police building) he was 
electrocuted with car cables tied to his feet and neck to extract a confession. According to 
the forensic expert, he carried scars on his right foot that stemmed from open wounds that 
had healed without medical treatment.  
</p>
<p>The detainee also reported that detainees at the Central Police Station could bribe the 
officers in charge to receive visits or be allowed outside to get some fresh air. From the 
Central Police Station he was transferred to Black Beach Prison, where he had been 
detained for the last 4 months. He said he had to share a mattress with four other people. He 
reported that he was punished by the Sergeant of Black Beach Prison with 50 strokes on his 
back using a police truncheon for trading food for a bar of soap. In addition, he was 
punished with two weeks solitary confinement. </p>
<p><i>The Special Rapporteur recommends that all detainees should be allowed family contact in 
accordance with international standards, and the persons held in solitary confinement 
should be granted at least one hour per day to exercise outdoors. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to remove the leg irons, which cannot be justified by 
security concerns.  
</i></p>
<p><i>He also suggested that the prison administration should appoint someone who would 
inform the consular representations in Malabo in case one of the foreign prisoners would 
fall ill so that they could provide them with medical treatment.

</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: The Special Rapporteur was received by Brigadier Manuel Esono. 
The police station disposed of one very dirty cell, which was empty. The door of the cell 
had allegedly been broken by the last detainee. The officer in charge explained that the cell 
was only used to keep persons while their cases were registered, following which they were 
transferred to the instruction judge. Persons to be held in custody were directly transferred 
to the police station in Baney. However, he did not know the location of the holding cells in 
Baney. The police kept a registry in which entries and exits of detainees supposedly were 
registered. However, the book was not properly kept and the officer in charge could neither 
tell the number of detainees during the preceding month nor the duration of their detention.

<p><b>General information</b>: The Special Rapporteur was received by several police officers. 
</p>
<p>In the left wing of the building, a corridor led to several offices and one detention cell, 
which was empty on the day of the visit. No register was kept. When the Special 
Rapporteur arrived, two persons were tied to a bench to the right of the main desk, with 
their hands cuffed behind their backs. Both of them had allegedly been involved in a fight 
and were bleeding. When officers on duty realized that the delegation was coming to

<p><b>General information</b>: The Special Rapporteur was denied access to the Military Camp, 
and the soldiers posted at the entrance threatened the two drivers accompanying the

</p>
<p><b>  Bata Prison 
  Visited on 14 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: The Special Rapporteur was received by Miguel Nsang (Sergeant 
Administrator of the Prison) and Malua Damaso (Chief of the penitentiary institutions on 
the mainland). On the day of the visit, the total number of prisoners was 83 out of which 5 
were women, and 30 prisoners were convicted. Several women, one of them pregnant, and 
minors (one aged 13) had been released three days prior to the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur. Some of the convicted prisoners had been convicted by a military court, and 
were detained in Bata prison because Bata had no military detention facility. The two 
officers in charge were unable to indicate how many prisoners were juveniles, as they found 
it difficult to establish their age. Some prisoners were on a regime requiring them to work 
outside, in the service of local government officials. One prisoner was listed as on death 
row, but, according to prison staff, he was not under a special regime. Since the prison 
director had taken office, he remembered one official execution. When asked about the 
method of execution, he referred to firing squad. 
</p>
<p>The prison consisted of two big dormitories for male detainees and one big dormitory for 
female detainees, as well as ten small cells and a church, which were located around a large 
courtyard. The small cells, humid and dirty, were used for disciplinary punishment. On the 
day of the visit, two persons were confined to these cells because they had tried to escape. 
In addition, a detained former military officer who enjoyed special treatment occupied two 
cells. One of the big dormitories for male detainees was 6m x 22m and equipped with 29 
beds, some with mosquito nets. Whereas on the day of the visit the dormitory was not 
overcrowded, there were reports that sometimes more than 70 prisoners were kept in the 
cell, so that three persons had to share one bed. A new prison (next to the old one) was 
under construction. Although the women were accommodated in a separate cell, male and 
female detainees could intermingle during the day and men could easily access the 
women&#8217;s dormitory. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the prison authorities that 
from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. doors to the dormitories were locked and prisoners had to stay inside. 
However, he received allegations that female detainees were regularly asked to provide 
sexual services to men and were offered food or other goods in exchange. Minors were not 
separated from adults. The prison applied a very liberal visiting policy: Visiting hours were 
daily from 7-9 a.m. and 3.30 &#8211; 5 p.m. No restrictions were imposed. 
</p>
<p>As for food, the detainees were provided with 5 bags of rice, 3 tins of sardines and some oil 
once a month. However, this was not sufficient to cover the alimentary needs. Therefore, 
detainees were dependent on additional food from their families, friends and/or other prison 
inmates. For water supply, the detainees relied on their families since the well in the 
courtyard regularly dried out when there had been no rain for a while. Medical treatment 
was only available if a detainee could cover the costs him/herself. In serious cases, sick 
detainees were brought to the hospital of Bata. Although the prison authorities strongly 
denied that corporal punishment was practiced, the Special Rapporteur received consistent </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>allegations that detainees who had violated the prison rules were handcuffed to a 
pillar/column at the portal and flogged by soldiers or prison guards on their buttocks, but 
sometimes also all over their body. All the other prisoners could watch the scene. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was informed of discriminative practices against 
foreigners. Reportedly, not long before the visit, when a foreigner escaped from the prison, 
all other foreign detainees were beaten up to (collectively) punish them.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, minor, had spent four weeks in Bata Prison. During the arrest he was 
punched in his face and on his testicles. As a result of the beatings in his face and head he 
still could not hear well. He was detained for two weeks at a police post and then 
transferred to Bata Central Police Station with instructions to torture him. Soon after his 
arrival, he was taken to the underground investigation room, where his hands and feet were 
tied together (handcuffs and leg-irons) and he was suspended from a bar fixed to a special 
structure. He was beaten on his feet while hanging for two hours. Then he was taken back 
to the upper cells. He needed to be supported as he could not walk because his feet were 
bleeding. After two weeks at the police which he spent mostly on his own, he was 
transferred to Bata Prison. At none of the police stations he received any food and just very 
little water; he could not wash himself or go to the toilet and had to defecate and urinate in 
plastic bags and bottles.  
</p>
<p><b>Female detainee</b> was arrested in 2007. She was held for two weeks at a gendarmerie post 
in Bata in a cell together with other male and female detainees. She was not beaten. The 
Gendarmerie did not provide them with food or water, but her family regularly brought 
what she needed. She was then transferred to Bata Prison. She has some money to buy food 
and water.  
</p>
<p><b>Female detainee</b> was arrested in spring 2008 and was held for two weeks at Bata Central 
Police Station, before being transferred to Bata Prison. At the police station she received 
water, but no food. She reportedly was very sick at that time and asked for medical 
treatment, but did not see a doctor and was neither brought to a hospital. She reported that 
her situation in the prison was better since her family would bring her food every day.

<p><b>Female detainee</b> was arrested in spring 2006 and taken to Bata Central Police Station, 
where she was detained for one week in a cell together with men. Since in the prison, she 
had no support from outside, since her house had been put on fire by the family of the 
victim and her children consequently were taken care of by a church. She received food 
from her cell mates.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been in detention in Bata prison for about six weeks. Prior to this, he 
was held in police custody for two weeks at Bata Central Police Station. He reportedly was 
blindfolded and brought to the interrogation room in the basement, where he was stripped 
naked with only his underpants left, and handcuffed behind his back. In this situation he 
was &#8211; for two hours - kicked with boots and beaten with police truncheons by two police 
officers all over his body and in his face in order to extract a confession. As a result of the 
torture his whole face was swollen and his eyes were bloodshot so that he was not able to 
see any more. Immediately after the &#8220;interrogation&#8221; he was brought into a single cell 
without light where he was held during two days without receiving any food or water. 
Thereafter he was held in a cell together with other detainees (out of which many reportedly 
had also been subjected to torture by the police). Since he had no visitors, his cell-mates 
looked after him and, with the help of their relatives, provided him with medicine to treat 
his wounds resulting from the torture. When he was transferred to Bata Prison two weeks 
later, none of the prison staff made a remark concerning his wounds although the injuries in 
his face were still very well visible. He further reported that the food provided by the prison 
authorities was insufficient, but he had no visitors bringing him food from outside the 
prison. </p>

<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been detained in Bata Prison since spring 2008. Prior to that, he had 
been kept in custody at the Central Police Station in Bata for two weeks. The first day, he 
was brought to the interrogation room in the basement of the building at 9 p. m. In this dark 
room, where only a red light was blinking, he was handcuffed and suspended upside down, 
wearing only his underpants, and beaten 54 times with a truncheon on the soles of his feet 
(phalaca) as well as on his head in order to extract a confession. He however did not 
confess to any crime. Thereafter he was held in a single cell for one week. No visits from 
outside the police were allowed but other detainees could come to see him. He reported 
that, since he had been in prison, his family visited him, but they could not bring him food 
since they had no money. He had been subjected to corporal punishment in summer 2008. 
He reported that his hands and arms were handcuffed around a column and he was beaten 
with a police truncheon 15 times on his buttocks.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> was arrested in summer 2007 by the police in a small town and was taken to 
the police station where he was held in custody for two days. In the cell his hands were 
handcuffed behind his back and he was forced to lie on the floor. In this position, he was 
beaten repeatedly with a police truncheon and once with a cable by a Police Commissioner 
and an Inspector. He had scars on his body, and his eye was injured from the beatings with 
the cable. When he arrived at Bata Prison, his injuries were still visible, but the prison 
authorities did not say anything. He reported that, if detainees needed to see a doctor, they 
had to pay a certain amount of money to the prison staff.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> was arrested in a small town in spring 2008 and was directly taken to Bata 
Prison, where he had since been imprisoned. He had been brought before a judge three 
times but had not been convicted of a crime so far. He said he had not been beaten or ill-
treated himself, but he said that there were cases of corporal punishment in Bata Prison, for 
example when a prisoner was caught drunk. According to him, the flogging and beating 
took place in the courtyard of the prison and was carried out by the prison chief with a 
stick, mostly on the soles, and lower legs and buttocks. He further reported that there was a 
rule that if the detainee moved away from the strokes, the beating would be extended to the 
entire body.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> arrived in Bata Prison in late 2006. He had been picked up at his home four 
days earlier by soldiers, put into a car and brought to the gendarmerie in Bata. During the 
first night at the gendarmerie post he was taken to an empty office and beaten by three or 
more soldiers. The beatings continued for three successive nights. He said that the beating 
during the third night was less severe as he was already badly injured. The soldiers used an 
iron crow bar for the beating. On the fourth day, his family came to the gendarmerie post 
and requested that he be taken to the hospital. According to him, the family had to pay for 
the transfer. Two gendarmerie officers accompanied him to the hospital, where he was 
treated for about an hour. He said that his left leg was fractured above the ankle, with an 
exposed bone. He was x-rayed in the hospital - the wound was enlarged and disinfected, 
then bandaged without stitching. The scars from the wound on his left ankle were still 
visible. He also had marks and scars on his right ankle; on his back he had three bands of 
horizontal scars, which he said stemmed from the 2006 beating. From the hospital he was 
taken directly to the judge and then to Bata Prison. In Bata Prison he reported that he had 
been beaten with a rubber stick about one month earlier. From this beating he had marks on 
his left arm and on his back. He had not filed any complaints. According to the forensic 
expert, the medical evidence on his left and right leg and ankle, as well as on his back and 
left arm corroborated his account.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> was arrested in the last week of September 2008 in relation to a case of 
robbery and taken to the gendarmerie in Bata, where he was detained for three weeks. He 
reported that he was beaten during the interrogation: he was taken to an office by a senior 
officer during the night and told to sit down with his hands cuffed behind his back. He had </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>to stay in that position until the next morning, when the senior officer ordered several 
soldiers to beat him with police truncheons while he was questioned. During the beating he 
was handcuffed and ordered to sit on the ground with stretched legs. The soldier, who 
conducted the beating stood in front of him and hit his lower legs while the interrogation 
continued for about 15 minutes. When he was told to stand up he was not able to do so. His 
soles were very swollen, and he had to move back to the cell on his knees as he was still 
handcuffed. He could not stand on his feet for the next two days and at the time of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit he still suffered from pain in his legs. According to the forensic 
expert, his account of the beating and the symptoms corroborated the events. He was later 
interviewed about the beatings, and the interview was broadcasted on television. After three 
weeks at the gendarmerie, he was transferred to Bata Prison, although the person who had 
committed the robbery had in the meantime been arrested. At the time of the visit he had 
spent about six weeks in Bata Prison.  
</p>
<p>In early November 2008, he was accused by another detainee of having been drinking 
(drinks were reportedly brought into the prison and the detainees could buy them). On that 
same evening, a soldier came to him and threatened that he would be punished the next 
morning. On the following morning soldiers took him out into the courtyard and beat him 
all over his body, including his back and his arms and his legs for 10 minutes with a police 
truncheon. The beating and kicking took place in front of other detainees. He was not 
handcuffed because the soldiers could not find the key, so he had to stretch out his arms in 
front of him and embrace a pole. The beating left marks on his left knee, right sole and left 
elbow. His left wrist was injured. He also said that he felt pain in his testicles. According to 
the forensic expert, his injuries seemed to be the result of the corporal punishment in the 
courtyard.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, had been deprived of his liberty for more than four years. In 2004, he was 
detained abroad together with many others, despite the fact that he was carrying valid 
documents. The detainees were hooded, handcuffed and forced to enter a plane. In the 
plane, they had to lie down on the floor, face down, and had their feet chained together. 
They were flown to Malabo and brought to Black Beach Prison. He was held 
incommunicado for the first 12 months. The first month he spent in solitary confinement, in 
a very small cell measuring about 1,45m x 1,45m, after which he was taken to another cell 
measuring 2 x 2 m, which he shared with another detainee. After 12 months he was allowed 
to leave the cell, the handcuffs were only taken off after 18 months. He said that for two 
years he could not speak to his family or be in contact with his lawyer. After about three 
years, he was transferred to Bata and tried before a judge, who sentenced him to a long 
prison term and a fine. He said his family was trying to raise the money, but he feared he 
would not be able to pay the full fine, in which case he said he would continue to be 
detained indefinitely.  
</p>
<p>He reported that he suffered from health problems, which he said were a result of the 
confinement in very small cells in Black Beach Prison. Whereas he had received some 
treatment, for which his family paid, he thought that it had been insufficient.  
</p>
<p><b>  Central Police Station Bata 
  Visited on 14 and 17 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information (first visit)</b>: The Central Police Station had been moved from 
Bomudi area into a new building constructed by the French company Bouygues one year 
earlier. The detention facilities were located in a two story building annexed to the back of 
the main building hosting the offices. At the end of his visit, the Special Rapporteur was 
received by Bienvenido Esono Engonga, Director of Bata Police (Commissario Jefe </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4

</b></p>
<p>Superior). After lengthy negotiations the Special Rapporteur was granted access to the 
interrogation room in the basement. He found a mattress, two black tables next to each 
other, a special red lamp, handcuffs and wooden and metal bars. The room and its 
equipment matched the description the Special Rapporteur had received prior to his visit to 
Bata Police Station from alleged victims. 
</p>
<p>On the ground floor, at the far end, male foreigners were detained in a spacious area that 
consisted of an open courtyard where the detainees could play football or sit on chairs. 
During the night, the detainees were locked into one large room that was separated from the 
yard with an iron grid but no walls. The room had several mattresses, a few beds, tables and 
chairs on the floor and was generally clean. The lights on the ceiling had been shaded with 
cloths by the detainees as they said the lights were not switched off at night. The adjacent 
sanitary facilities were newly built and in very good condition, including running water and 
electricity. At the time of the visit, about 15 to 20 persons were detained in this area. The 
detainees all came from neighboring countries, such as Congo Brazzaville, Gabon, 
Cameroon, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Democratic Republic of Congo.  
</p>
<p>The detainees informed the Special Rapporteur that they were detained because they could 
not produce visa documents or because they were accused of having false documents. One 
of the detainees had spent one month in detention, others had been held for a week or 
several days. Some complained that they had been beaten upon arrest and most of them said 
the police had taken away their possessions, in particular the money they had in their 
pockets and their cell phones. According to the detainees, in the morning of the day of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, four persons who showed clear physical signs of ill-treatment 
and abuse on their buttocks and backs had been released. 
</p>
<p>According to the detainees, the police did not provide them with adequate food, and they 
had to rely on family and friends, who were often not allowed into the police building, so 
that the detainees did not have enough to eat. With respect to the physical conditions of the 
area, the detainees said they were not protected from the mosquitoes that came through the 
open grid at night, attracted by the burning light.  
</p>
<p>On the first floor, there were two separate wings. Most of the cells to the right were 
reserved for soldiers. On the left side, Equatoguineans and two foreign women were held in 
police custody in seven cells equipped with beds and mattresses as well as sanitary 
facilities. In general, detainees were allowed to receive visitors who brought food and 
water. All cells were open so that detainees could walk around. The Special Rapporteur 
received consistent allegations of torture applied during the interrogation at night in the 
interrogation room in the basement. These allegations were corroborated by the medical 
evidence taken by the forensic expert.  
</p>
<p>At night, the male detainees reportedly approached the foreign women and tried to touch 
and rape them. In addition, a police officer repeatedly asked one of them to become his 
wife, threatening to beat her if she refused. 
</p>
<p><b>Second visit</b>: Although the Special Rapporteur had an appointment with Commissioner 
Bienvenido Esono Eugonga on 17 November, he and his team were insulted and threatened 
with a machine gun when they were about to enter the building of the Central Police 
Station. Only with some delay the Special Rapporteur was admitted to the building and the 
office of the Commissioner. While the Commissioner apologized for the incident, the 
Special Rapporteur was denied access to the detainees to continue his fact-finding.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, foreigner, had been arrested two weeks earlier by five members of the 
Judicial Police because he was unable to produce valid papers. He said that he was slapped 
in the face by the police officers. Since he arrived at Bata Police Station, he was not 
physically abused. However, he said that he had seen other detainees being beaten in the 
station, mostly upon arrival.  </p>

<p><b>Two female detainees</b>, foreigners, were arrested in November 2008 because they had 
crossed the border with false passports. Since that day, they had been held in police custody 
in a cell together with three men in a wing hosting about 20 male detainees. Some cell-
mates reportedly shared their food with the two women and one of the police officers had 
reportedly bought them some food.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been arrested some weeks earlier by two police officers and was 
brought to the police station. In the office of the interrogation officer, he was handcuffed 
behind his back and interrogated. When he refused to answer the questions, he was beaten 
with a police truncheon on his buttocks, his back and his legs, but he still kept silent. In the 
middle of the following night he was taken to the interrogation room in the basement. 
Wearing shorts only, he had his arms and legs tied behind his back, and was suspended face 
down from an iron bar between two black tables for 15 minutes. Five police officers and the 
Commissioner were present. He was beaten on his back and the soles of his feet. The next 
day at midnight, he was again taken to the interrogation room, stripped naked and 
handcuffed again with his hands and feet tied behind his back. In this position, he was first 
left on the floor during 5 minutes and then suspended again for 5 minutes in order to extract 
a confession. Eight police officers were present. Two days later, he signed a declaration and 
paid a fine.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been arrested some weeks earlier. He was taken to Bata Central Police 
Station and handcuffed. In the interrogation room in the basement, he had to lie down on a 
mattress and was beaten on the buttocks with a rubber baton. Then his feet were tied as well 
and, with extra handcuffs, his hands and feet were tied together behind his back. He was 
suspended from an iron bar between two black tables with his face down for 15 minutes, 
during which he was swinging. Since the time of the torture his wrists and ankles were 
hurting and he felt pain in the spine, but overall it was getting better. However, he still 
could not stand for longer periods. After the ill-treatment he was asked to walk upstairs, 
which he hardly could. He reported that detainees were provided neither with food nor 
water; but his family provided him with some products. He had not seen any judge or 
prosecutor since his arrest and had no idea why he was detained.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been in police detention for about three months. Four days after his 
arrival at Bata Central Police Station he was taken to the interrogation room in the 
basement. There he was suspended between two black tables face-down and beaten on his 
soles with batons for 30 minutes. As a result, he made a false confession, but said that at 
least they stopped the torture. He was heavily bleeding on his hands and feet. He was 
forced to walk up the stairs, but it was almost impossible, since he could not walk and was 
on his knees most of the time. During the torture session two victims and six policemen 
were present. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, he did still not feel his hand-
balms. At the police he was not provided with any food or water, but said sometimes the 
other detainees would help him. He has not seen a judge, a prosecutor or medical doctor.

<p><b>  Police Station/Gendarmerie Post Niefang 
  Visited on 15 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: The police station and the gendarmerie post were located in the 
same building, on the ground floor and first floor respectively. The Special Rapporteur was 
received by Etobari Seargent Primero (Secundo Abogado Commissario), Juan Sima, (Sub- 
Inspector of the Police) and Diego Oba Ndong, (Captain/Commissario of the Police), as 
well as Simeon Ondo Engono (Lt. teniente jefe de la Brigada Gendarmeria). Whereas the 
police reported that the last time a person had been detained in their premises was 30 
October 2008, the gendarmerie held one person on the day of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p>visit. The person was detained on the first floor in a room of about 2,5 sqm which was used 
as a cell. The gendarmerie had a very well kept register, which, according to the Chief of 
the Gendarmerie was provided as part of gendarmerie training by the French authorities. In 
addition to the register, the gendarmerie used a complaint register to record any complaints 
made.  
</p>
<p>The hygienic conditions in the room used as cell were very poor. The detainee, who had 
been arrested some weeks earlier, had not been allowed to leave the cell to go to the toilet, 
but had to urinate into plastic bottles and defecate into plastic bags. To sleep, he had to lie 
on the floor on a dirty mattress. The windows were barred with wooden planks, but some 
light came in, where the planks were broken. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was told by the gendarmerie that the detainee was allowed to leave 
the cell to go to the toilet. With respect to the physical conditions of the place, in particular 
the room used to detain people, the officials said they felt the place was not appropriate and 
explained that a new building was under construction. 
</p>
<p><b>  Police Station Evinayong 
  Visited on 15 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>The police station was small with a stone tower next to it used as holding cell. The tower 
was dark with one very small window. Apart from one wooden stool, it was empty. No 
register was kept.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, foreigner, had been arrested a few hours earlier because he had no papers. 
He had been treated correctly, but not received any water.  
</p>
<p><b>  Evinayong Prison 
  Visited on 15 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: Evinayong Prison had been completely refurbished. Only six 
prisoners were detained in the prison at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. Most of 
them were sentenced to long term imprisonment because of murder. The prison consisted of 
six small single cells, a larger multi-occupancy cell as well as one big dormitory with about 
30 bunk beds. Three persons were accommodated in the dormitory. The dormitory was 
reportedly locked at night and the windows permanently closed with iron shutters. Since 
there was no electric light, the prisoners reportedly had to spend the whole evening and 
night in complete darkness. The other multi-occupancy cell (2 or 3 bunk beds) was 
occupied by one person. The prison also disposed of high standard sanitary facilities and a 
large clean kitchen in which prisoners cooked their own food. During the day, prisoners 
could freely move around inside the large courtyard, but the cells were locked between 6 
p.m. and 6 a.m. One person with a mental disability was detained at the prison. It was 
reported that corporal punishment had ceased since the new prison director took office in 
September 2008. However, about one year earlier, a prisoner, Salvador Ndong Nguema, 
had been so heavily beaten by two soldiers (Cabo Primero Diosdado and &#8220;Florencio&#8221;), had 
not received any medical treatment and only been taken to the hospital in Bata when a 
member of his family came to see him in Evinayong; he later died in Bata Hospital. At that 
time, all detainees had been held at the gendarmerie premises of the gendarmerie because 
the prison was being renovated. All prisoners watched when the two soldiers kicked 
Salvador Ndong Nguema with their boots and were beating him with rubber truncheons.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been arrested in early 2001, and spent one month in the Police Station 
of Ebebiyin before being transferred to Bata Prison where he was held for four years. Since </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>April 2005, he had been held in Evinayong Prison. He reported that he was sentenced to 30 
years imprisonment for murder. In none of the detention places, he was ever subjected to 
torture or ill-treatment. He informed the Special Rapporteur that since the present Director 
of the Prison Evinayong took office at the end of September 2008, the prison conditions 
improved significantly. The Director was friendly with the detainees and treated them 
properly. The detainees received once per month sufficient food ingredients for the whole 
month, and they could themselves prepare the food in the kitchen. In the cell, he had light 
and a radio. Between 6.30 a.m. and 7.30 a.m. he could (voluntarily) work outside the prison 
by cutting plants with a machete and could earn some money. Prisoners were allowed to 
receive visitors, but he had nobody to visit him. As long as the Red Cross visited the prison, 
detainees were provided with games (cards etc.), but since these visits ceased, they had no 
longer any games. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been in detention for about eight years. After his arrest, he was first 
held in custody at a gendarmerie post in Bata. On the first day, at midnight, he was brought 
in the &#8220;torture room&#8221; where he was ordered to stand on a chair completely naked. His arms 
were attached to a bar with cords; then the chair was removed so that he was hanging in the 
air. The gendarmerie left him suspended in this position for 30 minutes, and for 10 minutes 
he was beaten with a police truncheon on the soles of his feet. The police officer only 
stopped when he was defecating and sweating very strongly due to the pain. He could not 
walk anymore and was carried back to the cell. One day later, at 1 am, he was taken out of 
the cell, stripped naked and his elbows and feet were both tied together with cords behind 
his back; a bar was glided under the cords and fixed between two chairs. In this position he 
was suspended for 10 minutes in order to extract payment of a large sum and a confession. 
As a result of the torture he was unable to walk for two months. At the time of the Special 
Rapporteur&#180;s visit, more than seven years later, he still felt strong pain in the feet, 
especially on the soles and he had difficulties to wear shoes and to walk distances of more 
than 100 meters. According to the examination by the forensic expert of the team of the 
Special Rapporteur, parts of the tissue on the soles of his feet had been permanently 
destroyed. Furthermore, the detainee could not move his arms and hands for one year after 
the torture so that he was dependent on help of co-detainees in order to eat and to do his 
basic needs etc. He reported that his hands sometimes still felt &#8220;cold&#8221; or &#8220;dead&#8221; and he had 
to move them in order to get rid of the numbness. His arms and hands were weaker than 
before the torture and he had difficulties when carrying out manual work. After one and a 
half months in custody at the gendarmerie post, he was transferred to Bata Prison, where he 
stayed about two and a half years before being transferred to Evinayong Prison. He reported 
that he had no complaints regarding the treatment in Bata Prison. His brother, his wife and 
his two children used to visit him in Bata. He did not know why he was transferred to 
Evinayong Prison since he had no family members living in this region. His brother died 
and he was not allowed to attend the funeral in Bata. Regarding the treatment in Evinayong 
Prison he reported that the money from the authorities for the food of the detainees did not 
reach Evinayong so that the prisoners were short of food and depending on external help. 
However, the new Director of the prison gave detainees money (out of his own pocket) for 
food. He reported that the ill-treatment including corporal punishment had stopped since the 
arrival of the new Prison Director.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been arrested in September 2008 by the gendarmerie. He was detained 
for approximately one month in a small room used as a cell, which had no bed or mattress. 
In November 2008 he was brought before a judge, who ordered his immediate transfer to 
Evinayong Prison to await trial. However, his transfer to the prison was delayed because he 
was doing construction work for an official, which the latter wanted him to finish before his 
transfer. Since his arrival at Evinayong Prison, he had not seen or spoken to a judge. 
According to him, the prison authorities provided the prisoners with adequate food and 
cooking oil to cook their own meals in the prison kitchen. The only complaints he had were </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>the lack of sufficient medicine and the fact that he had to sit in the dark without electric 
light in the big dormitory after 7 p.m. when the doors were locked.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been transferred to Evinayong Prison in 2004; before that, he had been 
held in Bata Prison starting from 1997. He had no major complaints about the prison. He 
found the food insufficient and indicated that, while detainees could see a doctor if needed, 
they were not provided with medicine. When he was arrested, the police tied his hands and 
feet together behind his back and beat him all over his body for about two hours. He was 
also suspended, which left deep wounds. He had two lawyers, but they did not do their job. 
When he made allegations of torture during the trial, the judge did not react. At the 
beginning he had been held at a small gendarmerie post.

<p><b>General information</b>: The officer in charge, Corporal Lucas Ntutum, said he had been 
working at the gendarmerie post since 2005; he had been officer in charge after his superior 
had left one month earlier. Upon request, he provided the Special Rapporteur with the 
register, which showed one undated entry for 2008. The officer in charge made 
contradictory statements with regard to the existence of detention cells and the date of the

<p><b>General information</b>: The Special Rapporteur was received by Sub-Inspector Fermin Osa 
Ndong and Marino Mba Ntschania (Inspector de Tercera de Policia Nacional). At the time 
of the visit, four detainees were held in one cell of about 9 sqm, which was very dark as the 
only window was barred with wooden planks. There were no beds but only some very dirty 
mats on the floor. Detainees had no protection against mosquitoes, were not provided with 
any food, and access to the toilet was sometimes restricted.

  Visited on 16 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: The Police and the Gendarmerie were located in the same run-down 
building which did not dispose of detention facilities. At the gendarmerie the Special 
Rapporteur was received by Luis Ndong (Brigadier) and Egulocio Ndong (Teniente, Chief 
of Brigade). A register was kept in the same clear manner as in other gendarmerie posts. It 
showed no entry for 2008. The Special Rapporteur was however told that, if a person was 
arrested, he/she would be detained at the military camp across the road. 
</p>
<p>At the police station the Special Rapporteur spoke to the Juan Engongo (Comisionado 
Divisional, serving in this function since June 2008). According to Juan Engono, in cases of 
serious crimes, persons would be detained in the military barracks, since there were no cells 
available at the police station. However, at the time of the visit no one was held there as far 
as he knew. The last serious case was a couple of days prior to the visit of the Special

<p>no investigation judge in Cogo. In general, he said the maximum period of detention before 
transfer to a judge would be three days. With respect to illegal immigrants that were 
arrested in the area of Cogo, they would also be transferred to Bata Central Police Station.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur requested to see the cells used by the police in the military camp. 
However he was denied access by the police and the military.

<p><b>  Police Station Mbini 
  Visited on 16 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: At Mbini Police Station, the Special Rapporteur was told by the 
officer in charge that the police station did not have a place to detain people. However, at 
the back of the building, the Special Rapporteur found a separate stonewalled room that 
showed several signs indicating that one or more persons had recently been held there, 
including several plastic bottles filled with urine. When the Special Rapporteur asked to 
speak to the Chief of Police in Mbini, he was told that the Police Chief was not in town, and 
that he had to speak to the Government Delegate of Mbini first. At the Government 
Delegate&#8217;s residence, the Special Residence and his delegation were warmly received. 
However, the Delegate did not comment on the detention facilities since he had not 
received any instructions from the Minister of Interior. 
</p>
<p><b>  Central Gendarmerie Post Bomudi - Bata 
  Visited on 17 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: The post consisted of a two story building. A spacious cell of about 
20 sqm, with electric light and some mosquito coils on the floor, was located on the ground 
floor. The Special Rapporteur was received by Crispin Ntutumu Bibang (Captain) and Jesus 
Edu Moto (Jefe de cuerpo, highest chief of the Gendarmerie at national level) who was 
present only for a very short time. Crispin Nututumu provided the Special Rapporteur with 
a list of detainees which included the day, reason of arrest, age and residence. It contained 
entries in relation to six detainees; four of whom were in the cell, while, according to the 
officials, two were working outside during the day. Detainees were not allowed to leave the 
cells when visited by family members, but had to communicate through a tiny opening 
separating the window covered with a metal shield. 
</p>
<p>According to the detainees, they were not allowed to leave the cell to go to the toilet, but 
had to use plastic bottles and bags. Detainees also said they were not allowed to contact 
their families to inform them of their arrest. When the Special Rapporteur asked one of the 
officers to call the relatives of one of the detainees to inform them about the arrest, the 
officer first said that that was too expensive and that the telephone did not work. However, 
he later tried to reach the family of the detainee, to no avail. 
</p>
<p>Crispin Nututumu, the Captain and officer in charge, had served with the Gendarmerie in 
France for five years, where he underwent some training. He explained that in Equatorial 
Guinea he participated in a human rights course given by the Ministry of Justice where he 
learned that ill-treatment of detainees was prohibited. Consequently, the gendarmerie 
ceased to use electroshocks that had been used earlier during interrogation. He explained 
that persons suspected of having committed small offences would be treated well; however 
he admitted that suspected criminals were threatened with some violence in order to 
intimidate them. Detainees were sometimes threatened with being thrown in the sea. He 
explained that often mere threats of torture would help to make detainees more 
&#8220;cooperative&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been held in custody since the early morning of the previous day. 
During these 14 hours in detention he did receive neither food nor water and had no access 
to toilets. In addition he was forced to work. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been arrested the day before at 7 p.m. by the gendarmerie and brought 
to the gendarmerie post. He was reportedly threatened with beatings &#8220;if he refused to tell 
the truth&#8221;. Furthermore, he had to drink water from a plastic bottle which was before used 
by detainees for their urine. He asked the Gendarmerie if he could call his family to inform 
them of his detention, but was not permitted to do so.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b>, had been arrested three days earlier by officers of the Gendarmerie, but no 
report was taken. According to him, the arresting officer took away all his money and he 
had to rely on friends for the provision of food. He said he was not allowed to call his 
family despite several request. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been arrested not long before the visit by three uniformed gendarmes, 
including Captain Crispin Nututumu. They handcuffed him and brought him by car to the 
Bomudi Gendarmerie Post. He had not received any food or water. He was threatened with 
torture by suspension if he did not confess. Out of fear, he could not sleep. The duty officer, 
Crispin Nututumu, confirmed that he participated in the arrest.  
</p>
<p><b>  Police Station Mondoasi (Mendoc-Asi ) - Bata 
  Visited on 17 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>General information</b>: The station was located in the middle of the Mondoasi market. The 
small building consisted of two offices and a very dark, dirty and hot cell of about 3 sqm  in 
which four persons were detained on the day of the visit of the Special Rapporteur.  No 
toilets were available. Thus, detainees had to urinate in plastic bottles and defecate in front 
of the other detainees in the cell. Not all of the detainees&#8217; names had been entered in the 
register. The Special Rapporteur spoke to Chief of Brigade Adolfo Obama Obama. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been transferred to the police station the day prior to the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur. He did not receive any food or water and had no access to toilets. He 
therefore had to urinate in a plastic bottle. He could not inform his family of his detention.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been held in police custody for two days. He was not informed of the 
reason of his arrest and was provided neither with water nor with food. He had no access to 
toilets or showers. He reported that other detainees were beaten with police truncheons 
when they were arrested.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> was arrested not long before the visit. He spent the night in the small and 
dark cell together with five other detainees. One of them left in the morning. In the morning 
of the day of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, he was taken to his workplace to confirm 
whether or not he actually worked there. He could not inform his family of his arrest, and 
consequently had not received any food or water. Upon arrival at the police station, the 
police officers grabbed his hands from behind and pushed him against the wall. Apart from 
this, no physical force was used against him. 
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been picked up by a soldier a few days earlier. He went with the soldier, 
no force was used. Upon arrival at Mandoasi Police Station, he was arrested and put into a 
cell. He complained that he had to buy his own food and water and had to use a plastic 
bottle to urinate. He also said there was no ventilation in the cell, which was very hot and at 
times had accommodated five other persons.  
</p>
<p><b>Male detainee</b> had been arrested not long before the visit together with his sister by a 
police officer in civilian clothes. He had no idea of the reasons of the arrest.  </p>

<p><b>Appendix II 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Informe replica de Guinea Ecuatorial al informe del Relator 
Especial contra la tortura, el Se&#241;or Manfred Nowak 
</b></p>
<p> El s&#250;bito y repentino deterioro de la situaci&#243;n pol&#237;tica producido en el Pa&#237;s a partir 
de los acontecimientos del 5 de marzo de 1969 agrav&#243; a&#250;n m&#225;s el ya de por s&#237; p&#233;simo 
panorama de los derechos humanos heredado del r&#233;gimen colonial, dos de cuyas principales 
notas caracter&#237;sticas eran la residenciaci&#243;n en la autoridad gubernativa de la capacidad de 
decidir sobre la privaci&#243;n de libertad, y la negaci&#243;n a los detenidos y presos de la condici&#243;n 
de personas.  
</p>
<p> La voluntad de superaci&#243;n del descrito panorama constituye una de las principales 
causas que inspiraron la acci&#243;n del golpe de libertad, consumada el 3 de Agosto del a&#241;o 
</p><p>1979. Desde entonces, la protecci&#243;n y promoci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y libertades 
p&#250;blicos constituye uno de los principales vertebradores de la actuaci&#243;n de los Poderes 
P&#250;blicos de Guinea Ecuatorial. A tal efecto, el Gobierno concibi&#243;, dise&#241;&#243; y puso en marcha 
un Programa que inclu&#237;a las siguientes acciones b&#225;sicas: 
</p>
<p> a) Reconocimiento Jur&#237;dico de los derechos fundamentales y libertades 
p&#250;blicas. 
</p>
<p> b) Adopci&#243;n de disposiciones represoras de actos de violaci&#243;n de los derechos 
fundamentales y libertades p&#250;blicas legalmente reconocidos a las personas.  
</p>
<p> c) Institucionalizaci&#243;n de un Poder Judicial t&#233;cnicamente solvente y 
pol&#237;ticamente independiente. 
</p>
<p> d) Construcci&#243;n de infraestructuras de acogida adecuadas para que los privados 
de libertad se desenvuelvan con comodidad, seguridad e intimidad. 
</p>
<p> e) Humanizaci&#243;n del r&#233;gimen de tratamiento a los detenidos y presos.  
</p>
<p> f) Difusi&#243;n social de la cultura del respeto a los derechos humanos. 
</p>
<p> Tres d&#233;cadas despu&#233;s de la adopci&#243;n y puesta en marcha del referido Programa, el 
gobierno se propuso llevar a cabo una amplia y profunda evaluaci&#243;n de la situaci&#243;n, al 
objeto de determinar tanto los logros alcanzados como las deficiencias persistentes. A tal 
efecto, estim&#243; necesario implicar a las Naciones Unidas, para lo cual curs&#243; invitaci&#243;n a su 
Relator Especial contra la tortura, don Manfred Nowak. 
</p>
<p> El sentido de la invitaci&#243;n formulada era contar con la colaboraci&#243;n de un 
especialista que asistiera al Gobierno en las tares de evaluaci&#243;n, ayudando a determinar los 
logros y deficiencias, y prestando asesoramiento en cuanto a las acciones que conviene 
seguir acometiendo.  
</p>
<p> El se&#241;or Nowak estuvo en nuestro Pa&#237;s y realiz&#243; su misi&#243;n durante el mes de 
noviembre del a&#241;o 2008. Para sorpresa e indignaci&#243;n del Gobierno, el Relator Especial opt&#243; 
por proceder sin contar con las autoridades nacionales habilitadas para suministrarle datos e 
informaciones, movi&#233;ndose al dictado y bajo la orientaci&#243;n de grupos pol&#237;ticos social e 
institucionalmente marginales.  
</p>
<p> Contra esa actitud protest&#243; el Gobierno mediante Nota enviada a las Naciones 
Unidas inmediatamente despu&#233;s de que, finalizada su estancia, el se&#241;or Nowak abandonara 
nuestro Pa&#237;s. En concreto, el Gobierno expresaba sus dudas de que el se&#241;or Relator 
Especial hubiere podido informarse sobre la verdadera situaci&#243;n del Pa&#237;s en materia de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>45 
</b></p>
<p>derechos humanos y, en consecuencia, que sea capaz de emitir un Informe Objetivo y &#250;til. 
Desgraciadamente, consideramos confirmadas nuestras dudas, a la vista del contenido del 
Informe Preliminar que nos ha sido remitido.  
</p>
<p> Para general conocimiento, el Gobierno de Guinea Ecuatorial considera necesario y 
oportuno hacer las siguientes puntualizaciones, tanto con relaci&#243;n a la misi&#243;n misma, como 
con relaci&#243;n al referido Informe Preliminar: 
</p>
<p> 1&#176;. El se&#241;or Manfred Nowak vino a Guinea Ecuatorial por invitaci&#243;n expresa y 
voluntaria del Gobierno; y durante su estancia dispuso de todos los medios y disfrut&#243; de 
todas las facilidades y comodidades que requiri&#243; a las autoridades para el cumplimiento de 
su misi&#243;n. 
</p>
<p> En particular, destacar que visit&#243; diversos Centros Penitenciarios y de Detenci&#243;n; e 
incluso tuvo acceso al Corrigiendo del Campamento Militar &#8220;ACACIO MA&#209;E ELA&#8221;, pese 
a ser conocido que instalaciones como esta no suelen ser accesibles en misiones de su 
naturaleza.  
</p>
<p> 2&#176;. Tal y como parece reconocerlo en su Informe, han sido progresivamente 
incorporados al Ordenamiento Jur&#237;dico de Guinea Ecuatorial tanto las normas que 
reconocen los derechos fundamentales y libertades p&#250;blicas, como las que reprimen los 
supuestos de violaci&#243;n de tales derechos y libertades. 
</p>
<p> Hablamos de la Ley Fundamental, de las Disposiciones adoptadas en su desarrollo y 
de los m&#250;ltiples Tratados y Convenios Internacionales oportunamente ratificados por 
nuestro Estado.  
</p>
<p> Es de destacar que son frecuentes las campa&#241;as de difusi&#243;n social de ese sistema 
normativo, llevadas a cabo tanto por el Gobierno mismo como por Organismos 
Internacionales, y destinadas a fomentar la conciencia sobre la obligaci&#243;n de respeto de los 
derechos de los dem&#225;s y la necesidad de denunciar las violaciones sufridas.  
</p>
<p> 3&#176;. El Gobierno es consciente de que lo que queda por hacer para llegar al escenario 
de una Administraci&#243;n de Justicia eficaz es mucho; pero tambi&#233;n estima, y preocupa que no 
lo reconozca as&#237; el se&#241;or Relator Especial, que lo hasta ahora realizado es considerable.  
</p>
<p> Medidas como la reforma de la Ley que regula la organizaci&#243;n y funcionamiento del 
Poder Judicial, el impulso de la actividad codificadora o la definitiva puesta en marcha del 
Instituto de Formaci&#243;n del personal afecto a dicho Poder del Estado han hecho posible que 
el funcionamiento del Sistema Judicial ecuatoguineano haya mejorado sustancialmente en 
los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os; hasta extremos y niveles que resulta hoy inadmisible, por injusto, referirse 
a el como inoperante.  
</p>
<p> Con todos los matices que se quiera y se pueda hacer, Guinea Ecuatorial es hoy un 
Estado de Derecho, y la garant&#237;a &#250;ltima de tal reside, precisamente, en el Poder Judicial, 
que esta cumpliendo cabalmente su cometido.  
</p>
<p> 4&#176;. Dentro del deseo de que los detenidos y presos vivan y se desenvuelvan con la 
mayor comodidad y seguridad posibles, el Gobierno ha adoptado y est&#225; implementando un 
ambicioso Programa de construcci&#243;n de Comisar&#237;as de Polic&#237;a y centros Penitenciarios 
modernos. Ello est&#225; permitiendo ir dejando paulatinamente las dependencias hasta ahora 
disponibles, que forman parte de la herencia del r&#233;gimen colonial y que nunca reunieron 
condiciones para la habitabilidad humana.  
</p>
<p> En el marco del desarrollo de ese Programa, han sido reformadas las C&#225;rceles 
P&#250;blicas de Malabo, Bata y Evinayong; y se han construido nuevos Centros de Detenci&#243;n 
en Malabo y Bata. El dise&#241;o de todas esas instalaciones, que ya son operativas, tiene muy 
en cuenta ha tenido muy en cuenta la necesidad que tienen los internos tanto de espacios de 
intimidad como de espacios comunales o de recreo.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b> 
</p>
<p> Es de destacar que con respecto de las relacionadas instalaciones esta prevista la 
separaci&#243;n entre hombres y mujeres, por lo que resulta totalmente falsa la afirmaci&#243;n hecha 
por el se&#241;or Relator Especial sobre el particular en sentido contrario.  
</p>
<p> El Gobierno desconoce la fuente de que se ha servido el se&#241;or Relator Especial para 
hablar de ni&#241;os al referirse a la poblaci&#243;n reclusa, pues hasta tanto no sea aprobada la 
todav&#237;a en proceso de elaboraci&#243;n Ley del Menor, dicha categor&#237;a de personas no puede ni 
ha sido nunca ingresada en nuestras prisiones.  
</p>
<p> Por lo dem&#225;s, no hay m&#225;s que apreciar el clima de seguridad con el que se desarrolla 
la vida social en Guinea Ecuatorial para calificar de inveros&#237;mil la afirmaci&#243;n o insinuaci&#243;n 
hecha por el se&#241;or Relator Especial, seg&#250;n la cual la vida en nuestras C&#225;rceles se desarrolla 
en un clima de violencia generalizada y descontrolada, que enfrenta a unos presos con 
otros.  
</p>
<p> 5&#176;. Tal y como recuerda el se&#241;or Relator Especial en su Informe, el 2 de noviembre 
del a&#241;o 2006 fue adoptada la Ley n&#176; 6/2006, sobre la prevenci&#243;n y sanci&#243;n de la tortura. 
Hasta entonces, la represi&#243;n de actos de esa naturaleza se ven&#237;a haciendo bajo la cobertura 
legal del C&#243;digo Penal, que el propio Gobierno acab&#243; juzgando insuficiente.  
</p>
<p> Desde la entrada en vigor de esa Ley, todos los casos denunciados ante las 
autoridades competentes han sido debida y oportunamente investigados y, de constatarse la 
existencia de fundamentos suficientes, juzgados. De haberlo requerido, el Gobierno habr&#237;a 
facilitado al se&#241;or Relator casos concretos de responsables de actos de tortura que se hallan 
cumpliendo condena en virtud de sentencias judiciales firmes.  
</p>
<p> Precisamente por eso desconcierta leer en el Informe Preliminar que nos ha sido 
remitido afirmaciones como que la tortura constituye una pr&#225;ctica sistem&#225;tica en las 
Comisar&#237;as y Centros Penitenciarios de Guinea Ecuatorial, y que su perpetraci&#243;n es 
impune.  
</p>
<p> Por otra parte, se&#241;alar que en los casos constatados y judicialmente declarados, la 
sentencia condenatoria ha conllevado siempre la imposici&#243;n al culpable del deber de 
indemnizar a la victima. Tiene raz&#243;n el se&#241;or Relator Especial al afirmar que no recuerda 
un s&#243;lo caso en que el Estado haya satisfecho esa indemnizaci&#243;n; pues nunca hasta la fecha 
ha habido necesidad de ello al resultar siempre suficiente el patrimonio de los mismos 
culpables.  
</p>
<p> 6&#176;. Todas las personas privadas de libertad en Guinea Ecuatorial, sin que importe la 
nacionalidad o causa por la que accedieron a esa situaci&#243;n, disfrutan de asistencia 
alimenticia, sanitaria y farmacol&#243;gica. La voluntad de garantizar y mejorar la prestaci&#243;n de 
esa asistencia explica que el Gobierno haya incrementado la correspondiente partida 
presupuestaria en casi un 700% para el pr&#243;ximo ejercicio, pasando de 3.000.000 a 
20.000.000 de Francos Cefas.  
</p>
<p> Ahora bien, nada impide que el interno que lo desee y cuya familia pueda 
permit&#237;rselo se alimente de v&#237;veres suministrados desde el exterior del Centro. Ello es 
posible, entre otras razones, por la existencia de un r&#233;gimen flexible de visitas que permite 
el contacto del interno con sus familiares y amistades varias veces a la semana.  
</p>
<p> Se&#241;alar, en contra de la aseveraci&#243;n recogida en el Informe preliminar, que las 
personas privadas de libertad en Guinea Ecuatorial tambi&#233;n son potenciales beneficiarias 
del Programa Nacional de Lucha contra el VIH/SIDA, cuya eficacia seria bien nula si no 
estuviere destinado a todos los residentes en el territorio nacional.  
</p>
<p> 7&#176;. El Gobierno asume como recomendaci&#243;n positiva el llamamiento del se&#241;or 
Relator Especial a que el Estado redoble esfuerzos para la persecuci&#243;n y represi&#243;n eficaz de 
los casos de torturas protagonizados por particulares.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/39/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>8&#176;. Por &#250;ltimo, el Gobierno reafirma su determinaci&#243;n de seguir profundizando en la 
pol&#237;tica de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos fundamentales y libertades dimanantes 
de la dignidad humana de las personas; y el deseo de continuar implicando a los 
Organismos Internacionales especializados, a efectos de recibir los asesoramientos y 
asistencias t&#233;cnicas necesarias.
