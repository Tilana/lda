                         (An Exploration Stage Company)
                        NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  June 30, 2012
                                   (UNAUDITED)
Note 1  Basis of Presentation
        ---------------------
The accompanying  unaudited interim  financial  statements of Colorado
          Gold  Mines,  Inc.  (formerly  Cascade  Springs,  Ltd.)  ("CGM" or the
          "Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
          generally  accepted  in the United  States of America and the rules of
          the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"),  and should be read in
conjunction  with the audited  financial  statements and notes thereto
          contained in the  Company's  Annual  Report filed with the SEC on Form
          10-K on June 14, 2012. In the opinion of management,  all adjustments,
          consisting  of  normal  recurring  adjustments,  necessary  for a fair
          presentation  of financial  position and the results of operations for
          the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The results
          of operations for the interim periods are not  necessarily  indicative
          of the  results  to be  expected  for  the  full  year.  Notes  to the
          financial statements that would substantially duplicate the disclosure
          contained in the audited  financial  statements  for fiscal  2012,  as
          reported on the Form 10-K of the Company, have been omitted.
General
The  Company is in the  exploration  stage,  and is in the  process of
          exploring  and  evaluating  its  mineral  properties  and  determining
          whether they contain ore reserves that are  economically  recoverable.
          The  recoverability  of any amounts  shown for mineral  properties  is
          dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable ore reserves,
          the  ability  of the  Company  to obtain the  necessary  financing  to
          complete  development,  confirmation of the Company's  interest in the
          underlying  mineral  claims and upon future  profitable  production or
          proceeds  from  the   disposition  of  all  or  part  of  its  mineral
          properties.
Note 2  Going Concern
        -------------
These  financial  statements  have been  prepared in  accordance  with
          generally  accepted  accounting   principles  applicable  to  a  going
          concern,  which  assumes  that  the  Company  will be able to meet its
          obligations  and  continue  its  operations  for its next fiscal year.
          Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values
          as  shown  and  these  financial  statements  do not  give  effect  to
          adjustments  that  would  be  necessary  to the  carrying  values  and
          classification of assets and liabilities  should the Company be unable
          to continue as a going concern.  At June 30, 2012, the Company had not
          yet  achieved  profitable   operations,   has  accumulated  losses  of
          $(109,180) and expects to incur further  losses in the  development of
          its business, all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company's
          ability to  continue  as a going  concern.  The  Company's  ability to
          continue as a going concern is dependent  upon its ability to generate
          future profitable  operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing
          to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities  arising from normal
          business  operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan
          in place to address this concern but  considers  that the Company will
          be able to obtain  additional  funds through equity  financing  and/or
          related  party  advances,  however there is no assurance of additional
          funding being available.

Part of the  related  party  loan is due to a former  director  of the
          Company  for  funds  advanced.  The  loan is  unsecured,  non-interest
          bearing and has no specific terms for repayment. The other part of the
          related  party loan is due to a consultant  and warrant  holder of the
          Company  for  funds  advanced  with a 10%  interest  rate  and  has no
          specific terms for repayment.

Note 4  Commitments
        -----------
On July 1, 2011, the Company entered into a consulting  agreement (the
          "Agreement") with a consultant.  In accordance with the Agreement, the
          Company granted the consultant  warrants to purchase  5,400,000 shares
          of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per share.
          The  warrants  were held in escrow  and were  given to the  consultant
          quarterly.  The warrants expire on July 1, 2014. The fair value of the
          warrants was $2,900 and was  recognized  over the twelve  months ended
          June 30, 2012.
Note 5  Subsequent Events
        -----------------
On July 3, 2012 Denver Equity Corporation, a corporation controlled by
          Kelly Fielder,  purchased  41,250,000  shares of the Company's  common
          stock from  William  Delahunte,  then an officer  and  director of the
          Company.
On July 6, 2012  William  Delahunte  and Todd  Grano  appointed  Kelly
          Fielder as a director of the Company and then resigned as officers and
          directors of the Company.  Mr.  Fielder was then  appointed  the Chief
          Executive,  Financial  and  Accounting  Officer  of the  Company.  The
          appointment of Mr. Fielder and  resignations of Messrs:  Delahunte and
          Grano resulted in a change of control of the Company.
On July 9, 2012 the Company's  directors,  and shareholders  holding a
          majority of the  outstanding  common  stock of the  Company,  approved
          amendments to the  Company's  Articles of  Incorporation  changing the
          name of the Company to Colorado Gold Mines,  Inc. and  authorizing the
          issuance of 10,000,000  shares of preferred  stock.  The amendment was
          filed with the Nevada  Secretary of State on July 12, 2012. The change
          in the Company's name became effective in the over-the-counter  market
          on July 30, 2012.
On July 27,  2012 the  Company,  through  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary,
          acquired a 50% interest in Union Milling  Company,  LLC ("Union") from
          Denver  Equity  Corporation  in exchange for  5,000,000  shares of the
          Company's  common stock.  Union's assets consist of  approximately  21
6
<PAGE>
acres of real  property,  an ore processing  mill and various  milling
          equipment.  The mill has been inactive since 1997 and was purchased by
Union in 2007.
FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
The   information   contained   in  this   Form   10-Q   contains   certain
forward-looking  statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended,  Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended,  and the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act of  1995.  These
forward-looking  statements  involve risks and  uncertainties,  including  among
other things,  statements  regarding our capital  needs,  business  strategy and

forward-looking  statements  by  terminology  such as "may",  "will",  "should",
"expect",  "plan", "intend",  "anticipate",  "believe",  "estimate",  "predict",
"potential"  or  "continue",  the  negative  of such  terms or other  comparable
terminology.  In evaluating  forward  looking  statements,  you should  consider
various factors outlined in our latest Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities
Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") on June 14, 2012, and, from time to time, in other

differ materially from any forward-looking statement. We disclaim any obligation
to publicly  update these  statements,  or disclose any  difference  between our
actual results and those reflected in these statements.
Item 2. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Plan of
        Operation.
The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 2010. The Company has not
generated any revenues since its formation.  The Company plans to acquire mining
properties in Colorado and process ore  generated  from its own  properties  and
that of unrelated third party mine operators. Prior to July 2012 the Company was
inactive.
On July 9,  2012  the  Company's  directors,  and  shareholders  holding  a
majority of the outstanding  common stock of the Company,  approved an amendment
to the Company's  Articles of Incorporation  changing the name of the Company to
Colorado Gold Mines,  Inc. The amendment was filed with the Nevada  Secretary of
State on July 12, 2012. The change in the Company's name became effective in the
over-the-counter market on July 30, 2012.
On July 27, 2012 the Company, through a wholly owned subisidiary,  acquired
a 50%  interest in Union  Milling  Company,  LLC  ("Union")  from Denver  Equity
Corporation  in exchange for  5,000,000  shares of the  Company's  common stock.
Denver  Equity  Corporation  is  controlled  by the  Company's  sole officer and
director.
Union's assets consist of approximately  21 acres of real property,  an ore
processing mill and various milling equipment.  The mill has been inactive since
1997 and was purchased by Union in 2007.
Union currently holds permits from the Colorado  Department of Reclamation,
Mining and Safety that allow Union to process up to 70,000 tons of ore annually.
In addition,  Union is  currently  the holder of one of the only  tailings  pond
permits in Colorado.

<PAGE>
As of July  31,  2012 the mill  was not in  operation.  Union is  currently
engaged in renovating  the mill and  constructing  a tailings pond so that Union
can begin processing ore.
After making  improvements to the mill, at a cost estimated to be $500,000,
Union plans to secure  additional  permits  and ore  processing  contracts  with
various gold,  silver and other  metallurgic mines in Colorado to allow Union to
process an unlimited  amount of ore. Union plans to complete its improvements in
August 2012.
Union  has  entered  into one  agreement  to  process  ore from a gold mine
located in Boulder  County and  currently  has executed two letters of intent to
process ore from gold mines in Clear Creek and La Plata Counties, Colorado.
As of June 30, 2012, the Company did not have any sources of capital or any
commitments  from anyone to provide the Company  with  capital.  There can be no
assurance  that the Company will be successful in raising any capital  required,
or  that  if  capital  is  offered,  it  will be  subject  to  terms  considered
acceptable.
The Company did not have any off balance sheet  arrangements as of June 30,
2012.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.
(a) The Company  maintains a system of controls and procedures  designed to
ensure that  information  required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("1934 Act"), is recorded,
processed,  summarized and reported  within time periods  specified in the SEC's
rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by it in
the  reports  that it files or  submits  under the 1934 Act is  accumulated  and
communicated  to the Company's  management,  including  the Company's  Principal
Executive  and  Financial  Officer,  as  appropriate  to allow timely  decisions
regarding  required  disclosure.  As of June 30 2012,  the  Company's  Principal
Executive and Financial  Officer  evaluated the  effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure  controls and procedures.  Based on that evaluation,
the  Company's  Principal  Executive and Financial  Officer  concluded  that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
(b) There were no changes in the Company's  internal control over financial
reporting  during the quarter ended June 30, 2012 that materially  affected,  or
are reasonably likely to materially  affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.
