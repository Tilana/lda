<p><b>     Tenth Session 
</b></p>
<p><b> Resolution 10/22.  Combating defamation of religions  
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the pledge made by all States under the Charter of the United Nations to 
promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the 2005 World Summit Outcome adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005, in which the Assembly emphasized the responsibilities of 
all States, in conformity with the Charter, to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms for 
all, without distinction of any kind, and acknowledged the importance of respect and 
understanding for religious and cultural diversity throughout the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the valuable contribution of all religions to modern civilization and the 
contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make towards improved awareness and 
understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted 
by the General Assembly on 8 September 2000, to take measures to eliminate the increasing acts 
of racism and xenophobia in many societies and to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all 
societies, and looking forward to its effective implementation at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>in this regard the importance of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia 
and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, in 2001, welcoming the progress 
achieved in implementing them, and emphasizing that they constitute a solid foundation for the 
elimination of all scourges and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>all international and regional initiatives to promote cross-cultural and interfaith 
harmony, including the Alliance of Civilizations and the International Dialogue on Interfaith 
Cooperation for Peace and Harmony, and their valuable efforts in the promotion of a culture of 
peace and dialogue at all levels, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming also</i> the reports of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance submitted to the Council at its fourth, 
sixth and ninth sessions (A/HRC/4/19, A/HRC/6/6 and A/HRC/9/12), in which the Special 
Rapporteur highlighted the serious nature of the defamation of all religions and the need to 
complement legal strategies, </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 2 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with deep concern </i>the instances of intolerance, discrimination and acts of violence 
against followers of certain faiths occurring in many parts of the world, in addition to the 
negative projection of certain religions in the media and the introduction and enforcement of 
laws and administrative measures that specifically discriminate against and target persons with 
certain ethnic and religious backgrounds, particularly Muslim minorities following the events 
of 11 September 2001, and that threaten to impede their full enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that defamation of religions is a serious affront to human dignity leading to a 
restriction on the freedom of religion of their adherents and incitement to religious hatred and 
violence, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with concern </i>that defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in 
general could lead to social disharmony and violations of human rights, and alarmed at the 
inaction of some States to combat this burgeoning trend and the resulting discriminatory 
practices against adherents of certain religions and, in this context, stressing the need to 
effectively combat defamation of all religions and incitement to religious hatred in general and 
against Islam and Muslims in particular, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that respect for cultural, ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity, as well as 
dialogue among and within civilizations, are essential for global peace and understanding, while 
manifestations of cultural and ethnic prejudice, religious intolerance and xenophobia generate 
hatred and violence among peoples and nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining </i>the important role of education in the promotion of tolerance, which involves 
acceptance by the public of and its respect for diversity, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the various regional and national initiatives to combat religious and racial 
intolerance against specific groups and communities, and emphasizing, in this context, the need 
to adopt a comprehensive and non-discriminatory approach to ensure respect for all races and 
religions, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolution 7/19 of 27 March 2008 and General Assembly resolution 63/171 
of 18 December 2008, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Takes note </i>of the study of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
on the compilation of existing legislation and jurisprudence concerning defamation of and 
contempt for religions (A/HRC/9/25) and the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (A/HRC/9/12) 
presented to the Council at its ninth session; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>at the negative stereotyping and defamation of religions and 
manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief still evident in 
the world, which have led to intolerance against the followers of these religions; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Strongly deplores </i>all acts of psychological and physical violence and assaults, and 
incitement thereto, against persons on the basis of their religion or belief, and such acts directed 
against their businesses, properties, cultural centres and places of worship, as well as targeting of 
holy sites, religious symbols and venerated personalities of all religions; </p>

<p> 3
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>at the continued serious instances of deliberate stereotyping 
of religions, their adherents and sacred persons in the media, as well as programmes and agendas 
pursued by extremist organizations and groups aimed at creating and perpetuating stereotypes 
about certain religions, in particular when condoned by Governments; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Notes with deep concern </i>the intensification of the overall campaign of defamation of 
religions and incitement to religious hatred in general, including the ethnic and religious 
profiling of Muslim minorities in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recognizes </i>that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, defamation of religions 
and incitement to religious hatred in general have become aggravating factors that contribute to 
the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms of members of target groups, as well as to their 
economic and social exclusion; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>in this respect that Islam is frequently and wrongly 
associated with human rights violations and terrorism and, in this regard, regrets the laws or 
administrative measures specifically designed to control and monitor Muslim minorities, thereby 
stigmatizing them and legitimizing the discrimination they experience; 
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Reaffirms</i> the commitment of all States to the implementation, in an integrated 
manner, of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, adopted without a vote by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006 and reaffirmed by the Assembly 
in its resolution 62/272 of 5 September 2008, in which it clearly reaffirms, inter alia, that 
terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or 
group, as well as the need to reinforce the commitment of the international community to 
promote, among other things, a culture of peace and respect for all religions, beliefs and cultures 
and to prevent the defamation of religions; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Deplores </i>the use of the print, audio-visual and electronic media, including the 
Internet, and any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or related intolerance and 
discrimination against any religion, as well as the targeting of religious symbols and venerated 
persons; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, as stipulated in international human rights law, including 
articles 19 and 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 19 and 20 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, everyone has the right to hold opinions 
without interference and the right to freedom of expression, the exercise of which carries with it 
special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to limitations only as provided 
for by law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, protection of 
national security or of public order, public health or morals and general welfare; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Reaffirms </i>that general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulated that the prohibition of the 
dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with freedom of 
opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the question of incitement to religious hatred; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Strongly condemns </i>all manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities 
and migrants and the stereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or 
belief, and urges all States to apply and, where required, reinforce existing laws when such </p>

<p> </p>
<p> 4 
</p>
<p>xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or expressions occur, in order to deny impunity for 
those who commit such acts; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Urges </i>all States to provide, within their respective legal and constitutional systems, 
adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination, intimidation and coercion resulting 
from defamation of religions and incitement to religious hatred in general, and to take all 
possible measures to promote tolerance and respect for all religions and beliefs; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Underscores </i>the need to combat defamation of religions and incitement to religious 
hatred in general by strategizing and harmonizing actions at the local, national, regional and 
international levels through education and awareness-building; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to make the utmost effort, in accordance with their national 
legislation and in conformity with international human rights and humanitarian law, to ensure 
that religious places, sites, shrines and symbols are fully respected and protected, and to take 
additional measures in cases where they are vulnerable to desecration or destruction; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Calls for</i> strengthened international efforts to foster a global dialogue for the 
promotion of a culture of tolerance and peace at all levels, based on respect for human rights and 
diversity of religions and beliefs, and urges States, non-governmental organizations, religious 
leaders as well as the print and electronic media to support and foster such a dialogue; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Expresses its appreciation </i>to the High Commissioner for holding a seminar on 
freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence, in October 2008, and requests her to continue to build on 
this initiative, with a view to contributing concretely to the prevention and elimination of all such 
forms of incitement and the consequences of negative stereotyping of religions or beliefs, and 
their adherents, on the human rights of those individuals and their communities; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to report on all manifestations of defamation 
of religions, and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia, on the enjoyment of 
all rights by their followers, to the Council at its twelfth session; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner to report to the Council at its twelfth session on the 
implementation of the present resolution, including on the possible correlation between 
defamation of religions and the upsurge in incitement, intolerance and hatred in many parts of 
the world.
