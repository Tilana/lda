<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including 
its causes and consequences, was established by the Human Rights Council at its sixth 
session, in 2007, in resolution 6/14. It was renewed by the Council in resolution 15/2 and 
more recently, on 26 September 2013, in resolution 24/3 for an additional period of three 
years. 
</p>
<p>2. In May 2014, the Human Rights Council appointed Urmila Bhoola from South 
Africa as the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes 
and consequences; she assumed her mandate on 2 June 2014. The Special Rapporteur 
gratefully acknowledges the trust that has been placed in her by the Human Rights Council 
in appointing her as mandate holder. She also thanks the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and its staff for their continuing support and 
assistance.  
</p>
<p>3. Given the short time between the appointment of the Special Rapporteur and the 
report submission deadline, the present report contains her preliminary reflections on her 
priorities for the first term of her mandate. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report also contains a review of the activities of the previous mandate 
holder, Gulnara Shahinian, from the time of the submission of her report to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session until the completion of her tenure. During that 
period, the mandate holder undertook an official mission to Ghana and two follow-up 
missions to Mauritania and Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>5. The report on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s follow-up mission to Mauritania from 24 to 
27 February 2014 is contained in Addendum 1 to the present report and the report of the 
follow-up mission to Kazakhstan from 25 to 27 March 2014 is contained in Addendum 2. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her deep appreciation and admiration to 
her predecessor for her important work in combating slavery and slavery-like practices 
during her two terms as mandate holder. Through her thematic work, for example on forced 
labour, bonded labour and child labour, domestic servitude and servile marriages, she 
contributed greatly to promoting anti-slavery action and law and significantly enhanced the 
understanding of the United Nations and the international community of contemporary 
forms of slavery by identifying challenges as well as good practices. Through her country-
specific work and 12 official country visits, she not only provided valuable analysis and 
insight into country situations and drew attention to the concerns and issues of slavery and 
slavery-like practices therein, but also made constructive and action-oriented 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the mandate  
</b></p>
<p>7. The six-year tenure of the previous mandate holder, Gulnara Shahinian, ended on 1 
June 2014. During the reporting period, she continued her work towards the eradication of 
contemporary forms of slavery through a range of activities.  
</p>
<p>8. On 13 September 2013, during the twenty-fourth session of the Human Rights 
Council, the previous Special Rapporteur participated, as a panellist, in a side event, 
&#8220;Challenges and lessons learned in combating contemporary forms of slavery&#8221;, which she 
had organized jointly with the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Trust 
Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery. At that side event, she gave a speech entitled 
&#8220;Key challenges and recommendations in combating contemporary forms of slavery&#8221;. On </p>


<p>the basis of observations from the numerous activities carried out in the performance of the 
mandate, the Special Rapporteur highlighted the challenges that need to be addressed in 
order to combat contemporary forms of slavery, gave an analysis of issues relating to 
legislation, awareness-raising, discrimination and rehabilitation, and an overview of various 
multi-stakeholder initiatives to combat contemporary forms of slavery. In the ensuing panel 
discussion, participants reflected on the different challenges, effective practices and lessons 
learned in combating slavery-like practices, from different perspectives. Drawing on the  
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s remarks, a central point of the discussion related to good practices 
that could be promoted by civil society organizations and governments in combating 
slavery and slavery-like practices. 
</p>
<p>9. From 25 to 27 September 2013, the previous Special Rapporteur participated, as a 
key speaker, in a conference on the theme &#8220;Data protection and right to privacy for 
marginalized groups: a new challenge in anti-trafficking policies&#8221; organized in Berlin by 
DatACT (data protection in anti-trafficking action). The conference brought together 
experts from the political sphere, academia and civil society to discuss issues relating to 
data protection and privacy rights for marginalized groups. During a panel discussion on 
&#8220;Data protection, human rights and anti-trafficking politics: a new challenge in the digital 
age?&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur pointed out that data collection on slavery-like practices was 
a challenge, particularly because of the social and economic invisibility of those in slavery. 
She also highlighted the gender dimension of the phenomenon, as women and girls were 
often denied their right to identity documents. Moreover, most victims of slavery were not 
registered as part of the labour force and their contribution to the economy was invisible 
because the work they did, such as domestic work, was not included in the labour laws of 
some countries. 
</p>
<p>10. On 19 and 20 November 2013, the Special Rapporteur participated in the 
International Labour Organization Regional Tripartite Conference &#8220;Preventing forced 
labour, human trafficking and slavery-like practices in Africa&#8221;, held in Lusaka. She  spoke 
on governments taking action against forced labour. 
</p>
<p>11. On 3 and 4 March 2014, the previous Special Rapporteur participated in a two-day 
international conference, &#8220;Enforcement of international human rights law through the 
mechanism of UN special rapporteurs&#8221;, hosted in Bologna, Italy, by Johns Hopkins 
University. The purpose of the conference was to examine the work of United Nations 
special rapporteurs and analyse their impact on the implementation of international human 
rights law in States. In her presentation, the Special Rapporteur addressed the issue of 
constructive diplomacy and other methods developed to work with States. 
</p>
<p>12. On 14 March 2014, the previous Special Rapporteur delivered a lecture at the 
University of California, Berkeley, United States of America, entitled, &#8220;Modern-day 
slavery &#8211; a reality close to home?&#8221;, which was sponsored by the Institute of Slavic, East 
European and Eurasian Studies and the Armenian Studies Program, with the support of 
Stanford Armenian Students Association and the International Justice Mission, Stanford 
University. The Special Rapporteur elaborated on the clandestine nature of modern slavery 
and explained that it often occurred in remote areas within States or in the &#8220;private realm&#8221; 
in homes or in the community. She said that the victims often lived in secluded areas and in 
fear of social, legal and financial consequences, such as stigmatization. She pointed out that 
identifying, locating and accessing those victims and, at the same time, protecting data and 
privacy rights, presented a major challenge. The Special Rapporteur also addressed the 
need to adopt a human rights-based approach and employ existing legal and practical 
instruments to help prevent human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>13. From 2 to 4 April 2014, the previous Special Rapporteur participated in the  </p>
<p>International Juridical Conference on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, held at the 
University of Granada, Spain, of which she gave the opening lecture. The conference </p>


<p>focused on, inter alia, new slavery and forced labour and considered institutional and 
jurisdictional action at the international level, human trafficking as an instrumental crime 
leading to other forms of exploitation, with particular attention to sexual slavery through 
the prostitution and non-consensual sexual exploitation of minors. Finally, the conference 
addressed victim assistance and protection. 
</p>
<p><b>  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>14. From 22 to 29 November 2013, the previous Special Rapporteur conducted an 
official mission to Ghana, where she visited various fishing communities in the Lake Volta 
region, a rehabilitation centre, outdoor markets as well as other areas in Accra. She pointed 
out that the Government of Ghana had taken the important step of recognizing the existence 
of slavery and had adopted a legislative framework and put in place a number of 
institutional mechanisms and programmes to address the problem. However, she noted that 
further progress on eradicating the various forms of modern-day slavery and exploitation 
that existed in Ghana could only be achieved by addressing the root causes that sustained 
those practices, including poverty, regional disparities and the lack of access to livelihoods, 
education and health care. Despite the adoption of the National Plan of Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which aims to eradicate such practices by 
2015, the Special Rapporteur remains particularly concerned about widespread child labour 
in Ghana.  
</p>
<p>15. From 24 to 27 February 2014, the previous Special Rapporteur undertook a follow-
up mission to Mauritania to assess new developments since her first visit to the country in 
2009 and the initiatives taken by the Government in response to her recommendations (see 
A/HRC/15/20/Add.2). She noted that her follow-up mission was a continuation of the frank 
and fruitful human rights dialogue that had been initiated in 2009. Reflecting on and 
acknowledging the very good progress made so far, the Special Rapporteur said that she 
would report on the commitment of the Government of Mauritania to the eradication of all 
forms of slavery and slavery-like practices. She applauded the Government for the adoption 
of a road map on the implementation of her recommendations resulting from her mission 
and said that the road map would determine the way forward in addressing the remaining 
challenges, as the cohesive cooperation of all stakeholders was required in order to work 
towards its full implementation. The report on the follow-up mission to Mauritania will be 
issued as document A/HRC/24/53/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>16. From 25 to 27 March 2014, the previous Special Rapporteur conducted a follow-up 
mission to Kazakhstan to assess new developments since her first visit to the country in 
2012 and to discuss the measures adopted and their impact on ending slavery and slavery-
like practices, such as forced labour and bonded labour, in Kazakhstan. The Special 
Rapporteur noted that the follow-up mission provided her with an opportunity to support 
the Government in its fight against slavery. She commended the Government for the swift 
action taken in response to some of her recommendations and its continuous cooperation, 
emphasizing that it was essential to urgently put in place enforcement and monitoring 
mechanisms to ensure the full implementation of the new laws and policies for eliminating 
all forms of slavery in the country. The report on the follow-up mission to Kazakhstan will 
be issued as document A/HRC/24/53/Add.2. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Priorities of the Special Rapporteur for the period 2014&#8211;2017 
</b>17. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 24/3, the newly appointed 
Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences, will examine and report on all contemporary forms of slavery and slavery-
like practices, in particular those defined in the Slavery Convention of 1926 and the </p>


<p>Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions 
and Practices Similar to Slavery of 1956, as well as all other issues covered previously by 
the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery. She will also continue to promote 
the effective implementation of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Forced Labour 
Convention, 1930 (No. 29) and the 2014 Protocol thereto,1 as well as ILO Convention 
No. 189 (2011) and Recommendation No. 201 concerning decent work for domestic 
workers, which represent a significant advance in the international legal framework 
protecting the rights of domestic workers, including the right to education for child 
domestic workers. 
</p>
<p>18. During her tenure, the Special Rapporteur will continue to address the different  
forms of contemporary slavery, including subtler forms of slavery that deserve specific 
attention, such as bonded labour, domestic servitude, early and forced marriage, child slave 
work, servile marriages and caste-based forms of slavery, which affect the lives of many 
and are not confined to developing and poor countries. She will also continue to work on 
the remaining challenges to the eradication of contemporary forms of slavery, as 
highlighted by her predecessor in her report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-
fourth session (A/HRC/24/43).  
19. The Special Rapporteur will continue to investigate, monitor and address, relying on 
the support of governments, other United Nations agencies and mechanisms, civil society 
organizations, trade unions, employers and activists, various contemporary manifestations 
of slavery involving children in agriculture, tobacco tilling, cotton picking, entertainment, 
construction, mining and quarrying.  
</p>
<p>20. In particular, the Special Rapporteur views the elimination of domestic servitude as 
a key priority of the mandate, as that form of slavery continues to exist across both 
developed and developing countries. Women, low-skilled migrant workers, indigenous 
people, internally displaced persons and other marginalized groups and groups that are 
discriminated against are the most vulnerable to exploitation in domestic servitude.2  
</p>
<p>21. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur will follow up on the key recommendations 
made by her predecessor for the elimination of all forms of domestic servitude. In her 
report to the Human Rights Council at its fifteenth session (A/HRC/15/20), the previous 
Special Rapporteur addressed the root causes of domestic servitude and its impact on 
women and children and made concrete recommendations for the monitoring and 
enforcement of labour standards. Besides the implementation of existing recommendations, 
which remains a key challenge, more research, notably qualitative reporting and situational 
analysis, is required on the often invisible workers in domestic servitude, including their 
existence in developed economies, which is often obscured.3  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the continued high prevalence of 
children in domestic servitude, bonded labour and other forms of slavery. Children in 
domestic work present a particular concern globally, in both developed and developing 
countries. Many child domestic workers are not only subject to exploitation and hazardous 
work, but often work in circumstances amounting to slavery or bonded labour in order to 
fulfil debts that they or their parents have incurred to the employer or to recruitment agents.

</p>
<p>(London, March 2013). </p>


<p>An estimated 15.5 million children below the age of 18 are in paid or unpaid domestic work 
in the home of a third-party employer, of whom 10.5 million are estimated to be child 
labourers, either because they are under the legal minimum working age or are working in 
hazardous conditions or conditions tantamount to slavery.4 Furthermore, girls outnumber 
boys and they face specific additional vulnerabilities in the context of migration and are 
more likely to end up being trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. The Special 
Rapporteur is committed to working with the International Labour Organization, non-
governmental organizations and other stakeholders towards eliminating every vestige of 
child slavery in the world. Children should be at school or play, not at work; and the 
continued violation of their human rights should be an urgent global priority for Member 
States and the international community.  
</p>
<p>23. In addition to children in domestic servitude and other forms of slavery, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned about the uneven implementation, and in some areas retrogression, 
of the human rights of women as guaranteed under international law, including the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women are 
disproportionately affected by forced labour. Of the estimated 21 million people in 
situations of forced labour, 11.4 million (55 per cent) are women and girls.5 
24. Another area of focus for the Special Rapporteur is the role of business, in particular 
transnational corporations, in promoting and using forced labour in global supply chains.6 
Recent estimates suggest that the total profits obtained from the use of forced labour in the 
private economy worldwide amount to US$ 150 billion per year.<footnote name="7">Ibid. </footnote> Victims of forced labour 
exploitation, including in domestic work, agriculture and other economic activities, such as 
construction, manufacturing, mining or utilities, generate an estimated US$ 51 billion in 
profits per year. 
</p>
<p>25. While the profit motive drives the demand for forced labour and other contemporary 
forms of slavery, it is underpinned by &#8220;push&#8221; factors such as increasing household 
vulnerability to income shocks, which push more households below the absolute poverty 
line; lack of education and illiteracy; as well as loss of work and deprivation of land, which 
force increased informal-sector work, migration and trafficking. The disproportionate 
impact of those factors on women and girls, who constitute more than half of the victims of 
forced labour, has been widely documented.  
</p>
<p>26. There is thus a need to address the structural and systemic causes of poverty and 
inequality, which render the poor and marginalized most vulnerable to slavery and labour 
exploitation. The proposed post-2015 sustainable development goals provide a 
comprehensive framework for addressing those issues and setting clear targets and 
indicators for both developed and developing countries to eliminate labour exploitation and 
manifestations of contemporary forms of slavery once and for all. 
</p>
<p>27. It is essential to ensure standardized disaggregated data collection (with due regard 
to individuals&#8217; rights to privacy and data protection) and the strengthening of national 
legislative frameworks to ensure that violations of human and labour rights resulting in 
slavery are effectively monitored and swiftly eradicated through strict legal, judicial and 
institutional enforcement of measures, with appropriate rehabilitation and remedies. In 
addition, the early identification and prevention of forced labour through the cooperation of

</p>

<p>multiple stakeholders, including governments, civil society organizations, the private 
sector, trade unions and consumers, are critical.  
</p>
<p>28. Another key area of focus of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, is child and forced 
marriage. The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and 
Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery obligates Member States to take all 
&#8220;practicable and necessary legislative and other measures to bring about progressively and 
as soon as possible the complete abolition or abandonment&#8221; of, inter alia, any institution or 
practice which amounts to forced marriage, such as when a woman, without the right to 
refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment to her parents, guardians, family or 
another person or group; when a husband, his family or his clan transfers his wife to 
another person for value received or for any other reason; or the inheriting by another 
person of a woman on the death of her husband (see art. 1). Early and forced marriage can, 
under certain circumstances, constitute servile marriage or result in domestic servitude or 
other forms of slavery. The previous mandate holder drew links between child marriage and 
slavery, and pointed out that Member States were obliged to prohibit and eliminate slavery 
as a non-derogable and fundamental principle of international law. 8  Child marriage is 
linked to the thematic issues of trafficking for forced labour, commercial sexual 
exploitation, migration and contemporary forms of slavery, which reinforces the need for 
cooperation among the respective mandate holders as part of a comprehensive multi-agency 
and multi-stakeholder effort to eradicate those practices from society, as women and girls in 
child and forced marriages may experience conditions within the marriage that meet 
&#8220;international legal definitions of slavery and slavery-like practices&#8221;, including forced 
labour. Furthermore, &#8220;a potentially high proportion of child marriage cases appear to 
constitute the worst forms of child labour under the 1999 ILO Convention No. 182.&#8221;9  
</p>
<p>29. The mandate calls for a coherent global response, involving evidence-based 
analysis, together with technical assistance to Member States which are committed to 
eradicating the scourge of contemporary slavery from their labour markets. It requires 
strengthening of the global partnership, involving unions, civil society organizations, non-
governmental organizations, human rights advocates, the private sector, the legal sector and 
the judiciary, governments and public-sector institutions, United Nations agencies and 
mechanisms, academic and research institutions, as well as international foundations 
committed to research and advocacy.  
</p>
<p>30. The mandate also requires a multi-faceted approach combining law and policy 
frameworks which provide for prevention, protection, prosecution and redress at the 
national and international levels, with consumer and civil society advocacy, rejecting goods 
produced through forced labour or other forms of slave labour and generating consumer 
awareness. It also requires that business practices be congruent with human rights, ethical 
and environmentally sound sustainable development, and durable peace and security for all. 
It requires a concerted global initiative to eradicate poverty and enforce the basic principles 
of justice, dignity and human rights for all. At the most basic level, it requires resources, 
mechanisms and processes for the effective implementation of recommendations made 
pursuant to fact-finding missions and consultations conducted as part of the mandate.

<p><b> IV. Conclusion 
</b>31. <b>The Special Rapporteur looks forward to fulfilling the requirements of her 
mandate, as outlined in Human Rights Council resolution 24/3, and to constructive 
and fruitful cooperation with diverse stakeholders in all regions towards that end. She 
particularly emphasizes her desire for constructive engagement with United Nations 
Member States and encourages Member States to respond positively to her requests 
for information or for country visits, while emphasizing that the mandate remains 
available to provide assistance to States and to respond to their requests, including in 
the area of technical cooperation, to the fullest extent possible. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates the importance that she places on the role and views of non-
governmental organizations, including in providing information to her and engaging 
with and assisting her fully as she conducts her work on slavery and slavery-like 
practices.
