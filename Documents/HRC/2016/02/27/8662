<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 15 of its resolution 62/145, the General Assembly requested the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to convene 
regional governmental consultations on traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as 
a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination, in particular regarding the effects of the activities of private military and 
security companies (PMSCs) on the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>2. In line with the above-mentioned resolution and Human Rights Council resolution 
7/21, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights 
and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination1 held its final 
regional consultation, with the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) in Geneva, 
Switzerland, on 14 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group had held four previous regional consultations, the first in 
Panama City for the Latin American and Caribbean Region on 17 and 18 December 2007, 
the second in Moscow for the Eastern European Group and Central Asian Region on 17 and 
18 October 2008, the third in Bangkok for Asia and the Pacific on 26 and 27 October 2010 
and the fourth in Addis Ababa for the African Group on 3 and 4 March 2010.2 
</p>
<p>4. Representatives of the following WEOG member States attended the consultation: 
Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland and the United States of America, together with representatives from the 
European Union. The Working Group had a separate meeting with the Israeli delegation 
during which it informed the delegation of its progress towards the development of a new 
international instrument to regulate and monitor the activities of private military and 
security companies. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group was represented by its Chairperson-Rapporteur, Jos&#233; Luis 
G&#243;mez del Prado, and its members, Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez, Shaista Shameem and 
Alexander Nikitin. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of the meeting 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>6. The consultation was opened by Karim Ghezraoui, Chief, Groups in Focus Section, 
Special Procedures Branch, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR), who welcomed all participants on behalf of OHCHR. He said that, with 
this consultation, the Working Group was completing a series of five regional consultations 
held over a period of two and a half years. During these consultations, participants 
exchanged views on good practices and lessons learned on the monitoring and regulation of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The Working Group on the use of mercenaries was established by resolution 2005/12 of the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights. The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving 
in their personal capacities. As of March 2010, Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado (Spain) is the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur. The other members are Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia), Alexander 
Nikitin (Russian Federation), Shaista Shameem (Fiji) and Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya).

<p>the activities of mercenaries and private military and security companies at the national and 
regional level. Discussion also revolved around different approaches for a possible new 
international framework for the regulation of the industry, including the Working Group&#8217;s 
proposed elements for a possible new international convention on PMSCs. Finally he noted 
the timeliness of this last consultation and the added value of member States&#8217; input in this 
final stage of the project as the Working Group was preparing to submit its report on the 
progress achieved in the development of a possible draft legal instrument for consideration 
and action by the Human Rights Council in September 2010. 
</p>
<p>7. In his opening remarks, Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado thanked all representatives of 
the Western Group for their participation and in particular the ambassador of Norway for 
coordinating this regional consultation in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>8. He emphasized that the new instrument on PMSCs proposed by the Working Group 
was geared to regulate and monitor the activities of private military and security companies 
in order to prevent, and protect individuals from, serious human rights violations, which 
unfortunately were regularly committed, and also to establish mechanisms of accountability 
and to provide effective remedies to the victims. 
</p>
<p>9. He expressed the gratitude of the Working Group to the Governments which had 
already provided written comments and constructive observations on the elements for a 
possible draft convention on PMSCs that had been circulated in early January 2010. The 
Working Group had thoroughly studied their comments and their reservations regarding the 
proposal of a possible new convention on PMSCs. He emphasized that the Working Group 
shared the views of a number of countries regarding the necessity of more effective 
regulation of the private military and security industry. 
</p>
<p>10. Within this context, Mr. G&#243;mez del Prado stressed that such concerns regarding 
PMSCs&#8217; activities had led 15 countries from WEOG to express their support for the non-
binding <i>Montreux Document on pertinent International Legal Obligations and Good 
Practices for States related to Operations of Private Military and Security Companies 
during Armed Conflict</i>.3 
11. He also referred to the efforts deployed under the Swiss initiative to draw up a 
global code of conduct for the industry. He pointed out some of the differences between the 
Working Group&#8217;s proposal for a legally binding document and initiatives for self-
regulation, emphasizing that these initiatives were not mutually exclusive but 
complementary to each other, given that both are aimed at strengthening regulation of 
PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>12. Analysing some of the comments provided by States, Mr. G&#243;mez del Prado stated 
that the Working Group was in agreement with some observations, in particular that 
PMSCs are not mercenaries and that the definition of mercenaries as established by 
international law is not applicable to the personnel of PMSCs. He stressed that the legal 
status of PMSCs continued to be a grey area that needed further clarification. He also said 
that the proposed draft convention would apply to all situations, not only in armed conflict 
and that, therefore, the draft convention aimed at stressing the human rights obligations of 
States vis-&#224;-vis PMSCs and their personnel. He concluded by reiterating that the proposed 
instrument aimed at ensuring that States take the necessary measures to ensure respect for 
human rights by PMSCs together with accountability and effective remedies for victims. 
The Working Group considered that the United Nations would constitute the best 
framework for the development of a new international instrument for the regulation, 
oversight and monitoring of PMSCs.

</p>
<p>13. In her opening remarks, Ms. Bente Angell-Hansen, ambassador of Norway, 
speaking as coordinator of WEOG, stressed that WEOG attached great importance to 
dialogue with all Special Procedures and considered their independence to be crucial. She 
referred to the sensitive nature of this topic for WEOG, underlining that the group did not 
coordinate its position on substantive issues. She called for a fruitful exchange of 
information. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Elements for a possible draft international convention on the 
regulation, oversight and monitoring of PMSCs 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Chair of the Working Group gave a comprehensive presentation4 on the 
activities, regulations and oversight of PMSCs, with a specific emphasis on activities and 
initiatives in WEOG countries. He started by presenting the conclusions of the previous 
four regional consultations. He went on to discuss regional initiatives, in particular at the 
level of the Council of Europe (CoE). He specifically mentioned that the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the CoE had adopted two relevant reports on PMSCs and the erosion of the 
State monopoly on the use of force. He pointed out that both reports recommended that the 
Committee of Ministers draw up a Council of Europe convention aimed at regulating the 
relations of its member States with PMSCs and laying down minimum standards for the 
activity of these private companies.5 Mr. G&#243;mez del Prado also highlighted examples of the 
impact of PMSC activities on the enjoyment of human rights, several new areas of activity 
in which PMSCs have become involved and the extent of the privatization of war and the 
subsequent use of PMSCs in particular in the context of Iraq and Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>15. The Chair then underlined the existing gaps in international and national legislation. 
He raised the concerns of the Group regarding diffused responsibility, the absence of 
effective vetting mechanisms and a general lack of accountability of PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>16. Mr. G&#243;mez del Prado then introduced the elements of the proposed draft convention, 
including the purposes, the scope of application, the general principles, the domestic regime 
of regulation and oversight, the responsibilities of States regarding the activities of PMSCs 
and the international mechanism proposed to monitor the implementation of the convention 
by States parties.  
</p>
<p>17. After this introduction, the States representatives engaged in a dialogue with the 
members of the Working Group, focusing their comments on the proposed draft convention 
in particular. Several expressed appreciation for the opportunity to comment on the draft 
convention developed by the Working Group. Some representatives emphasized that their 
Governments did not consider PMSCs as mercenaries. 
</p>
<p>18. Most delegates stated that they fully supported effective regulation of the private 
security industry. Several mentioned that their countries were signatories to the Montreux 
Document and agreed as to the necessity of adopting measures to ensure that PMSCs and 
their personnel were respecting human rights and were held accountable when crimes 
occurred. Some comments stated that the Montreux Document should be tested for its 
effectiveness before a legally binding instrument on the use of PMSCs could be considered.

<p>One representative pointed to the complementarity between the Swiss initiative for a code 
of conduct for the industry and the Working Group&#8217;s proposal for a convention. 
</p>
<p>19. Several representatives stated that their Governments did not believe there was a 
demonstrated need for a legally binding convention on the use of PMSCs. One 
representative said that the current legal framework provided effective oversight and 
accountability for the industry and that there were promising efforts under way to improve 
this framework further. Others pointed out that the human rights questions arising from the 
activities of PMSCs were adequately covered by existing human rights instruments and 
concluded that a new instrument would simply have the effect of overburdening the 
existing system of international protection of human rights. Another indicated that the work 
in this area needed to be focused on increasing the implementation of States&#8217; existing 
obligations with respect to PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>20. Several comments noted the fact that there was little agreement internationally over 
what should be considered as inherently governmental functions and that this was not a 
settled matter in international law. In addition, some noted that there was great variation 
among States as to the degree to which they were using private contractors. They said that 
these differences would complicate the task of standardizing fundamental principles for 
national regulation of the industry. 
</p>
<p>21. Several delegates stated that their countries considered that the issue of mercenaries 
remained an important one but that it was not within the remit of the Human Rights Council 
and that it should not be dealt with as a human rights problem. One representative indicated 
that the issues at stake were not primarily human rights issues but mainly issues covered by 
humanitarian law, international criminal law and other relevant international law. 
</p>
<p>22. Some raised concerns over what they see as serious obstacles to enforcing a 
licensing regime as envisioned in the draft convention and the high implementation cost for 
States parties. Finally some stressed that a broad consensus on both the process and draft 
instrument would be crucial to ensuring that the convention could be implemented 
effectively. 
</p>
<p>23. Members of the Working Group provided additional information in response to 
some comments. Ms. Benavides de P&#233;rez reiterated that the Working Group did not 
consider PMSCs as mercenaries, as had been noted by some delegates. She stressed the 
difficulties in implementing existing national legislation given the transnational nature of 
the activities of PMSCs. She also underlined the complementarity between the Swiss 
initiative and the Working Group&#8217;s proposal for a draft convention, notably with regard to 
the purposes and scope of application. 
</p>
<p>24. Alexander Nikitin stated that the proposal for a possible new convention had 
received support from countries in all other regions. He mentioned several initiatives geared 
towards increased oversight of PMSCs at the national level, including in the United States 
of America and Afghanistan. He also recalled that industry associations were not opposed 
to the idea of international regulation for companies. He stressed that PMSCs lacked 
international standards and international oversight mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>25. Finally, Ms. Shameem emphasized the complementary nature of both a self-
regulation mechanism and a legally binding treaty, indicating that these had erroneously 
been presented as an &#8220;either/or&#8221; exercise. She added that there was a need for self-
regulation, national regulations and an international legal framework for the activities of 
PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>26. In her concluding remarks, the representative of Norway indicated that the exchange 
of views had demonstrated that the two approaches presented a number of commonalities as 
well as differences. She underlined the importance of the distinction between mercenaries </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-14928 
</p>
<p>and PMSCs and the need to strengthen national legislation to fight against impunity. The 
Ambassador stressed that several questions remained, including that of the need for a new 
international treaty and that of whether the Human Rights Council was the appropriate 
forum for consideration of these issues. She also recalled that experience at the Human 
Rights Council had shown that a broad consensus would facilitate effective implementation 
of the treaty. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and observations of the Working Group 
</b>27. <b>The Working Group would like to thank all Governments who have responded 
positively to the invitation of the Working Group to attend this important consultation 
and for submitting written comments to the Working Group regarding elements for a 
possible draft convention on PMSCs.</b> 
</p>
<p>28. <b>The Working Group notes the reservations expressed by some Governments 
about the need for a possible new convention on PMSCs on account that the existing 
legal framework provides effective oversight and accountability for the industry. The 
Working Group believes that the experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, in particular 
but not exclusively, have shown that the existing framework is not sufficient and that 
there is a need for internationally agreed standards and oversight mechanisms for the 
activities of PMSCs. It also recalls States&#8217; responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil 
human rights and to ensure that PMSCs are held accountable if and when they are 
responsible for crimes or human rights violations.</b> 
</p>
<p>29. <b>The Working Group is of the view that the Montreux Document, the initiative 
for a self-regulation mechanism for the industry and the Working Group&#8217;s proposal 
for a legal instrument share the same goal of increased regulation of the industry and 
that they are not mutually exclusive but complementary mechanisms. The Working 
Group supports a &#8220;three-tier approach&#8221; to regulation of PMSCs, including self-
regulation, regulation at the national level and international regulatory legal 
standards and oversight mechanisms.</b> 
</p>
<p>30. <b>The Working Group regrets that some States continue to object to the mandate 
of the Working Group on the ground that the matter should not be dealt with by the 
Human Rights Council as a human rights issue. The Working Group is of the opinion 
that given the impact of the activities of PMSCs on the enjoyment of human rights, the 
United Nations Human Rights Council is the best forum for discussion of these issues. 
It therefore invites those States to reconsider their position and to engage in a 
substantive discussion aimed at the adoption of specific measures to regulate and 
monitor the activities of PMSCs.</b> 
</p>
<p>31. <b>The Working Group would like to emphasize its utmost concern at the impact 
of the activities of PMSCs on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular when 
operating in conflict, post-conflict or low-intensity armed situations and calls upon 
Member States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to take 
effective action in accordance with international human rights law to ensure 
accountability of PMSCs and their personnel.</b> 
</p>
<p>32. <b>The Working Group fully agrees that the broadest possible support for a new 
international instrument on PMSCs is needed for the implementation of such a treaty. 
It therefore calls on all States and intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations to constructively engage with this process. </b></p>
