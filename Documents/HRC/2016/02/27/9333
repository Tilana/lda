<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of Burkina Faso and in pursuance of his mandate, 
the independent expert on the effects of economic reform policies and foreign debt on the 
full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, visited 
Burkina Faso from 23 to 27 April 2007. During his consultations with government 
representatives, non-State actors and the international community the independent expert 
gathered first-hand information on the impact on all human rights of Burkina Faso&#8217;s foreign debt 
burden, ongoing economic reform and the country&#8217;s poverty reduction strategy.  
</p>
<p> The independent expert concludes that there is a clear and demonstrable commitment of 
the Government of Burkina Faso to addressing human rights challenges, as manifested by a 
progressive legal framework and recent institutional improvements. While significant steps have 
been undertaken to improve the enforcement of human rights principles, continued and increased 
sensitization efforts are still needed in areas where human rights principles are not in harmony 
with the traditional cultural context of the country, and in particular with regard to gender 
equality. 
</p>
<p> Recent debt relief initiatives have substantially reduced the foreign debt burden. Debt 
sustainability indicators are now well below the thresholds defined by international financial 
institutions and foreign debt does not currently appear to threaten the capacity of Burkina Faso to 
comply with its human rights obligations. The independent expert encourages the Government to 
continue its prudent debt policy and calls on the donor community to help by ensuring that the 
national development strategy is financed to the largest possible extent with grants. The 
independent expert also recommends that accountability and participation elements within the 
foreign debt planning and decision process are strengthened, in particular through a more 
systematic recourse to parliamentary and civil society advice. 
</p>
<p> Burkina Faso allocates debt service savings obtained through debt relief to a special 
anti-poverty account. Although the definition of the expenditure priorities of this account is not 
explicitly human rights-based, the independent expert gained the impression that resources have 
generally been used in areas relevant for economic, social and cultural rights. In the education 
and health sectors the account has helped to address bottlenecks in the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals and the corresponding rights to health and education.  
</p>
<p> The objectives of the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) and the focus of 
corresponding resource allocation are generally congruent with a progressive realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights. Human rights principles such as equality and participation 
have been part of the PRSP process. The independent expert recommends strengthening this 
process through a human rights-based approach, stipulating more clearly the obligations of the 
State under international human rights law and elaborating on the means to implement them. The 
process of PRSP elaboration would also benefit from empowerment and capacity-building of 
civil society organizations, which are strongly committed to contributing to the PRSP process 
but do not yet have the human and material resources and organizational capacity to comment 
on, inform and influence all stages of this highly complex process. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/9/Add.1 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> In the area of economic policy, the impact of important reform steps has not been 
systematically assessed in the past, which has led in some cases to negative effects on 
employment, poverty reduction and economic growth. Economic reform should be guided and 
informed more systematically by impact assessments that not only include economic and social 
objectives but also the State&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law. With regard to 
external trade, the independent expert noted the negative impact of the subsidies provided by 
industrialized countries for cotton on Burkina Faso&#8217;s export potential in this sector. The 
international community should refrain from this practice in order to allow Burkina Faso to 
accelerate its economic development and its compliance with international human rights 
obligations. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Burkina Faso, the independent expert on the 
effects of economic reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights, undertook a country visit to Burkina Faso 
from 23 to 27 April 2007. 
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2000/82, which established 
the mandate of the independent expert, the objectives of the mission were: (a) to examine the 
effects of the burden of foreign debt and the policies adopted to face them on the capacity of the 
Government to adopt policies and programmes for the enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights; (b) to examine the effects of economic reform policies on the full enjoyment of 
all human rights, in particular the policies adopted in the framework of the poverty reduction 
strategy; (c) to engage in dialogue with the Government, United Nations and international 
agencies and civil society on their efforts to secure all human rights, in particular economic, 
social and cultural rights; and (d) to recommend measures and actions linked to the areas of 
foreign debt, economic reform policies and human rights. The independent expert also examined 
possible inter-linkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, bearing in mind 
resolution 2004/18 of the Commission on Human Rights requesting him to further explore these 
aspects. 
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert was particularly interested in visiting Burkina Faso in order to 
examine the country&#8217;s ability to comply with its human rights obligations in the context of the 
following economic reform and foreign debt-related issues: 
</p>
<p> (a) The country has established a good track record on macroeconomic performance 
over the past 10 years, with sustained real growth rates of more than 5 per cent per annum. 
Since 1991 the country has experienced substantial economic and social reform, including 
liberalization of the economy and development of the private sector. Despite its efforts 
Burkina Faso is still one of the countries with the weakest and most fragile levels of human 
development in sub-Saharan Africa, ranking 174 out of 177 on the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) human development index;<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p> (b) In the area of foreign debt, Burkina Faso has benefited from significant debt relief 
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief (MDRI) 
initiatives; 
</p>
<p> (c) Burkina Faso has a long-standing experience with the concept of Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP), as it was one of the first countries to launch this process in 
the year 2000. 
</p>
<p>4. During his mission the independent expert had the opportunity to meet with the Minister 
for the Promotion of Human Rights and the Minister of Finance. He also met with senior 
officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Cooperation, the Ministry of Economy 
</p>
<p>

<p>and Development, the Ministry for the Promotion of Women, the Ministry for Basic Education 
and Alphabetization, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Trade, Enterprise Promotion and 
Crafts and the Ministry of Health. 
</p>
<p>5. The independent expert had meetings with the President of the <i>Cour de Cassation</i> 
(High Court), the national ombudsman (mediator), the national director of the Central Bank, 
representatives of the national ethics committee, the chamber of commerce and the national 
human rights committee. He consulted the President of the economic commission of the 
West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA)<b>2</b> and donor representatives. In addition, 
the independent expert had the opportunity for an extensive exchange of views with 
representatives of civil society and with the United Nations country team. The mission was 
undertaken during the final stage of the legislative election campaign and the independent expert 
could unfortunately not meet with Members of Parliament. 
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert undertook a half-day field visit which allowed him to receive a 
first-hand impression of the impact of economic reform and the benefits of debt relief on the 
education and health systems in a rural area. 
</p>
<p>7. The independent expert wishes to thank the Government of Burkina Faso and in particular 
the Ministry for the Promotion of Human Rights for the assistance and support provided to the 
mission and for its indispensable coordination role. He also wishes to thank the United Nations 
country team and all those organizations and individuals who provided valuable information. 
</p>
<p><b>I. GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT IN THE FIELD OF  
ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Burkina Faso has ratified all major international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). In its preamble, the 
Constitution makes reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the 
international treaties on economic, political, social and cultural rights. <i>Titre</i> I, chapters III and IV 
explicitly state that the Constitution &#8220;recognizes and aims to promote&#8221; economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The Constitution of Burkina Faso gives precedence to international agreements, such as 
ratified human rights conventions, over national legislation. The national commission of 
codification has however undertaken to integrate international human rights obligations into 
national law, a work that is still ongoing. This integration exercise is meant to provide easier 
access to human rights law, in particular for professionals within the justice system. In spite of 
training and sensitization efforts, judges cannot always access relevant international texts or have 
the necessary experience to give effect to international norms, especially in remote areas.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>10. The legal system entitles right holders to institute proceedings for appropriate redress 
before a court if the State or other duty bearers fail to comply with economic, social and cultural 
human rights norms and standards. Most interlocutors considered Burkina Faso&#8217;s legal codes to 
be progressive in this regard. However, there are currently no concrete cases before local courts 
in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, which refer to international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>11. Most interlocutors admitted the limits of the formal legal system with regard to the 
enforcement of human rights norms. The access of women to ownership of land was cited as a 
prominent example. Burkina Faso has signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and in legal terms there is no difference between men and 
women regarding access to land ownership. However, interlocutors admitted that the vast 
majority of women do not in reality benefit from the possibility of owning land. Parts of society, 
in particular in rural areas, do not recognize the formal law promoting the equality of men and 
women in this field, as it is seen to be in contradiction with cultural traditions. Related cases are 
rarely brought to justice, but are dealt with by traditional chiefs. When brought to justice, court 
decisions are often not well received by the majority of society, thus putting social pressure on 
the complainant. In this context the need for continued extensive information and sensitization 
efforts to redress the situation was emphasized by all interlocutors. These efforts should also 
include the translation of relevant legal provisions, currently only available in French, into local 
languages. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. In recent years Burkina Faso has undertaken significant institutional efforts in the area of 
human rights. In December 2001 the Government established a National Commission on Human 
Rights as a permanent framework for dialogue between public and non-governmental actors 
concerned with human rights issues. Commission members include representatives of human 
rights non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade union representatives, representatives of 
the relevant government departments, and representatives from professional associations. 
</p>
<p>13. The Ministry for the Promotion of Human Rights was created in June 2002. The main 
tasks of this Ministry include the promotion and protection of human rights through: 
(a) information, training and awareness creation on democratization, human rights and citizen&#8217;s 
obligations; (b) popularization of human rights-related texts and documents; (c) support to civil 
society regarding human rights-related action; (d) action to ensure better protection of individual 
and collective rights; (e) implementation and follow-up of international human rights 
agreements; (f) implementation of specific measures to promote, consolidate and protect the 
rights of vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>14. The Ministry&#8217;s National Human Rights Action Plan identifies the following priority areas 
in the field of economic, social and cultural rights: 
</p>
<p> (a) Better access to education, in particular development of a programme for access to 
education for girls, promotion of the creation of libraries and laboratories, promotion of 
enrolment of vulnerable groups of children; </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/9/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> (b) Better access to health, in particular access to generic drugs and the launch of a 
national debate on a national health insurance system; 
</p>
<p> (c) Reinforcement of the right to work, in particular contributing to the reform and 
reinforcement of the social security system, the development of an action plan against child 
labour and the reform of the pension system; 
</p>
<p> (d) Protection of citizens and consumers, in particular support to consumer associations, 
establishment of laws and institutions related to consumer protection, establishment of rules on 
the responsibility of medical doctors and public hospitals; 
</p>
<p> (e) Consolidation of the right to adequate housing, proposals for an urbanization policy 
and a habitat improvement policy, support for the integration of international recommendations 
on housing in national legislation. 
</p>
<p>15. The national ombudsperson (mediator) is an independent authority, appointed for a 
five-year, non-renewable term, by presidential decree. He/she deals with disagreements between 
private citizens, associations, and the administration or other State agencies. The 
ombudsperson&#8217;s office does not have any decision-making power but it can request government 
authorities to revise their decisions. The ombudsperson reports directly to the Head of State, 
including on cases where government entities have refused to accept a suggested amicable 
solution. In the past, the suggestions of the ombudsperson have been accepted in 85 per cent of 
all submitted cases. Most cases involving the ombudsperson concern conflicts between the State 
and its civil servants and land property cases, but also complaints from government suppliers and 
cases of non-implementation of court decisions. Cases regarding economic, social and cultural 
rights are rarely submitted to the ombudsperson. However, it was learnt that in some instances 
the ombudsperson intervened against the denial of access to public health facilities or the closure 
of public schools. In all such cases the parties accepted the suggestions of the ombudsperson&#8217;s 
office. 
</p>
<p>16. The Economic and Social Council is an advisory body that renders opinions on 
government bills, ordinances or decrees that are submitted to it. The Head of State can seek 
advice from the institution on any social and economic issue. In addition the Council can 
provide, on its own initiative, judgements on the way social and economic policy is carried out 
by the Government. While the Council could be an important tool for strengthening government 
accountability in areas linked to economic, social and cultural rights, it currently lacks the 
necessary human and material resources to undertake comprehensive evaluations of the 
Government&#8217;s policies. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Reporting obligations in the area of economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>17. Two initial government reports to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(CESCR), which were due in the years 2000 and 2005, have not yet been submitted. The 
independent expert was informed that capacity constraints within the Ministry for the Promotion 
of Human Rights, in particular in terms of human resources and training of staff, have delayed 
submission of the reports. He was, however, assured that the reports were currently being 
prepared and would be submitted in the near future. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/9/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>II. BACKGROUND ON THE EDUCATION AND  
HEALTH SECTORS IN BURKINA FASO 
</b></p>
<p>18. About 25-30 per cent of the national budget is currently spent in the social sectors. 
The health sector receives about 10 per cent of national budget allocations and the education 
sector about 12 per cent. The share of the budget spent on the justice system increased 
from 0.3 per cent in 2000 to 1.1 per cent in 2006. 
</p>
<p>19. The Government considers basic education a national priority. Activities in this area are 
based on a basic education sector plan,<b>3</b> which is the main implementation tool of Burkina Faso&#8217;s 
poverty reduction strategy regarding education. The main objectives of the plan are: increased 
enrolment and literacy rates, a better coverage of preschool education, increased quality of 
education, and strengthened school management capacity. The plan is financed through the 
national budget, a common financial protocol with several development partners and through 
HIPC debt relief funds. 
</p>
<p>20. Efforts undertaken by the Government, in particular massive mobilization campaigns in 
rural areas have led to an impressive increase in net enrolment rates for basic education, 
from 41 per cent in 2001 to 66 per cent in 2006/2007. As a consequence, the Government is 
now facing a big demand for additional teachers and infrastructure such as classrooms. 
Government representatives stated that, in many cases, a standard classroom, built for 50 pupils, 
hosted only 10 children prior to the mobilization campaigns, but now accommodates about 
100-150 children. The independent expert was informed that certain communities have started 
setting up their own improvised classrooms but expect the Government to provide a sufficient 
number of qualified teachers. 
</p>
<p>21. The independent expert was informed that the relative success in increasing enrolment has 
not been sustainable in all cases. High dropout rates during the first month of the school year can 
mainly be attributed to poverty because: (a) the income of many families relies on the additional 
wages children earn in small businesses or the cotton sector; and (b) while Burkina Faso does not 
charge or levy school fees for basic education, not all expenses related to basic education are 
covered by the Government. These expenses constitute important economic obstacles for many 
families and are generally considered as equivalent to and sometimes greater than school fees. 
Usually, these expenses include mandatory contributions to parents&#8217; associations,<b>4</b> as well as 
expenses for school materials, textbooks, school meals, uniforms and in some cases transport. 
</p>
<p>22. A second serious problem concerns the quality of basic education. Several interlocutors 
pointed out that the national Constitution guarantees access to education, but not its quality. 
Consequently, the relatively high enrolment rates for basic education contrast with low 
graduation rates of only 36 per cent, which is partly attributable to a lack of well-trained 
teachers. 
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/7/9/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>23. Gender equality in basic education has not yet been fully achieved. Several interlocutors 
pointed out that the discrimination regarding girls&#8217; education is not primarily due to economic 
constraints, but is a question of cultural traditions and mentality that can only be changed in the 
long run through sensitization and civic education. In fact, priority is often given to the education 
of boys as they are expected to carry on the family line, while girls would eventually become 
part of a different, i.e. their husband&#8217;s, family. Sensitization campaigns, in particular through the 
creation of mothers&#8217; associations, as well as economic incentives, have recently led to an 
increase in the enrolment of girls. The parity index for enrolment in basic education is 
currently 0.85 girls per 1 boy. The Government&#8217;s objective is to reach parity, within the 
framework of obligatory, free and universal basic education, by 2015. 
</p>
<p>24. Several interlocutors emphasized that the Government&#8217;s focus on basic education has 
created a bottleneck regarding the passage from primary to secondary education. They pointed 
out that sustainable economic development cannot be based on basic education alone and would 
require a higher proportion of the population receiving secondary or higher education. 
</p>
<p>25. As for health, Burkina Faso&#8217;s Constitution recognizes basic health as a right. The 
Government&#8217;s National Health Development Plan 2001-2010, set up to implement its health 
sector policy, gives priority to increased national health coverage, improved quality of health 
services, improved measures to combat both transmittable and non-transmittable diseases 
including HIV/AIDS, measures against malnutrition, and increased institutional capacities. 
While the Government has identified health as a priority area, its commitment to 
invest 15 per cent of the national budget in health has not yet been achieved.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>26. Significant efforts by the Government, the donor community and NGOs have led to 
a decrease in the incidence of HIV/AIDS from 4.7 per cent of the population in 2003 
to 2.3 per cent in 2007. The medium-term objective of the Government is to bring the incidence 
of HIV/AIDS below 1 per cent. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  DEBT AND DEBT RELIEF 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The debt situation in Burkina Faso 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the 1980s a lack of domestic resources to finance development-related investments 
led to an accumulation of foreign debt, which reached a level at the beginning of the 1990s 
which creditors considered to be excessive. Burkina Faso&#8217;s debt was subsequently treated several 
times by the Paris Club, in 1991 under Toronto terms, in 1993 under London terms and in 1996 
under Naples terms.<b>6</b> However, Paris Club debt accounted for only 15 per cent of Burkina Faso&#8217;s 
overall foreign debt burden, while 85 per cent of loans had been contracted with multilateral 
institutions. In 1996 Burkina Faso&#8217;s external debt stock reached US$ 683.5 million and debt

</p>
<p>service absorbed 30 per cent of the national budget. With a net present value (NPV) of debt to 
export ratio of 240 per cent, the debt stock was considered unsustainable by the international 
financial institutions. 
</p>
<p>28. In 1997 Burkina Faso became eligible for debt relief under the original HIPC initiative that 
included for the first time debt owed to multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The country reached its &#8220;completion point&#8221; under 
the original HIPC initiative and eligibility under the enhanced HIPC initiative in the summer of 
2000. Despite HIPC relief, Burkina Faso&#8217;s external debt stock had increased to US$ 1.75 billion 
by the end of 2004 and reached US$ 2 billion by the end of 2005. Over 70 per cent of this 
debt was owed to multilateral creditors, such as the International Development Association 
(49.2 per cent), the African Development Bank (18.1 per cent) and the IMF (5.3 per cent).<b>7</b> 
In 2006 Burkina Faso qualified for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) leading to 
cancellation of outstanding debts to the World Bank, IMF and African Development Bank. 
In the framework of MDRI, 75 per cent of all debt was cancelled and the debt stock dropped to 
US$ 980 million.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>29. The goal of the HIPC initiative and MDRI was to contribute to growth and poverty 
reduction by increasing Burkina Faso&#8217;s &#8220;fiscal space&#8221;, i.e. the amount of resources available to 
finance poverty-related expenditure. According to World Bank estimates or calculations, 
Burkina Faso&#8217;s annual debt service dropped from US$ 58.9 million or 2.1 per cent of gross 
domestic product (GDP) before HIPC and MDRI (1998) to US$ 31.5 million or 0.5 per cent 
of GDP in 2006. Debt service savings from MDRI alone are estimated to amount to 
US$ 17.6 million in 2006. 
</p>
<p>30. Illegitimate or odious debt: Government authorities informed the independent expert that 
Burkina Faso has not contracted illegitimate or odious debt in the past. The country does not 
hold debt incurred by a past Government or regime for purposes that do not serve the interest of 
society. Debt was essentially contracted to finance the country&#8217;s development process, in 
particular through projects in the infrastructure and social sectors. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Debt sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>31. The joint World Bank-IMF debt sustainability assessment framework uses policy 
dependent thresholds in order to determine the sustainability of a country&#8217;s debt. Burkina Faso 
received a rating of 3.76 in the latest Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), which 
qualifies it as a strong performer. Indicative debt burden thresholds for countries in this category 
are a net present value (NPV) of debt to exports ratio of 200 per cent; a debt to GDP ratio of 
50 per cent; and a debt to revenues ratio of 300 per cent. Debt service ratios to exports and to 
revenues are 25 and 35 per cent respectively. With an NPV of debt to exports of 85.8 per cent, to 
GDP of 10.6 per cent, to revenues of 85.4 per cent and debt service ratios to exports and to 
revenues of 5.5 per cent each, Burkina Faso was well below these thresholds in 2006.

</p>
<p>32. The IMF and World Bank expect ratios to increase in the coming years, without surpassing 
the indicative thresholds under a baseline scenario.<b>9</b> Debt sustainability would however be 
threatened: (a) in case of major shocks in the cotton sector, due to the dominance of this sector 
in the economy; and (b) in case of increased public borrowing on less favourable terms (meaning 
a 2 per cent increase in interest for new borrowing). 
</p>
<p>33. The notion of debt sustainability currently employed by the Government of Burkina Faso 
is based upon the above-mentioned framework. Government authorities do not currently take 
alternative indicators into account, such as the financial ability to reach the Millennium 
Development Goals on time, or the ability to comply with economic, social and cultural rights 
obligations under international human rights law. However, given the relatively low debt burden 
following HIPC and MDRI debt relief, it is unlikely that foreign debt service (US$ 31.5 million 
per annum) is currently a decisive factor for Burkina Faso&#8217;s financial ability to honour its 
human rights obligations, especially when compared to the annual amount of official 
development assistance (US$ 659.6 million)<b>10</b> or the volume of overall government 
expenditure (US$ 1.12 billion).<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>34. Several of Burkina Faso&#8217;s development partners pointed out that indebtedness might 
increase quickly to dangerous levels if the Government had recourse to loans in order to combat 
the country&#8217;s development challenges. The Government affirmed its intention to take an 
appropriately cautious approach to new borrowing, without however excluding an expansion of 
loans if available grants do not meet development ambitions. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Accountability and participation 
</b></p>
<p>35. In order to improve the supervision of debt accumulation and debt management, 
Burkina Faso has established a number of institutional bodies. These include a National Public 
Debt Committee<b>12</b> which examines all new loan requests. The Committee assesses in particular 
the conformity of loan projects with the country&#8217;s development objectives. The Government can 
only negotiate a loan agreement if the corresponding project has been positively assessed and 
recommended by the Committee. 
</p>
<p>36. The National Public Debt Committee is an important tool for supervising Burkina Faso&#8217;s 
foreign debt situation and ensuring debt sustainability. However, currently only State institutions

<p>and the Central Bank are members of this entity.<b>13</b> A more systematic participation of Parliament 
and relevant civil society stakeholders could strengthen the accountability and participation 
elements of Burkina Faso&#8217;s debt process. Currently Parliament is only involved at the stage of 
ratification of loan agreements. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Impact of debt relief on economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>37. Poverty reduction expenditure is included in the budget both as regular appropriations and 
as allocations to a special anti-poverty account, which is credited with HIPC and MDRI debt 
relief funds that the State would otherwise have repaid to international creditors.<b>14</b> Sixty per cent 
of available HIPC funds have been used for education and health, of which 60 per cent for 
education and 40 per cent for health. Since 2003, the scope of priority sectors has been extended 
and now also includes the promotion of women&#8217;s rights, employment, social action, and, since 
2004, justice, mines, quarries and energy, as well as economy and development.<b>15</b> The extension 
of eligible sectors has led to a relative decrease of the share attributed to health and education 
sectors. However, as the overall amount of available HIPC and MDRI resources has increased, 
the contribution to these sectors has not decreased in absolute terms. The independent expert was 
informed that in 2007 all available HIPC funds had been spent on infrastructure investments in 
the above-mentioned sectors. 
</p>
<p>38. The basic education sector has benefited from HIPC resources since 2000/2001 and most 
funds have been used for classroom construction, recruitment of teachers, scholarships and 
textbooks in the 20 most disadvantaged provinces of the country. While some representatives of 
civil society pointed out that it was difficult to observe tangible effects of HIPC funds on the 
ground, most interlocutors recognized an overall positive impact. 
</p>
<p>39. In the area of basic health, HIPC funds have essentially been used for infrastructure, 
recruitment of health workers, vaccines, equipment, training measures and to facilitate access to 
drugs. The main target was access to health for children and pregnant women, consistent with 
Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5, i.e. the reduction of child mortality and improvement of 
maternal health. As a result of HIPC funding, medical consultation and preventive medical care 
can be provided free of charge to pregnant women and children under the age of 3. In addition, 
the Government intends to provide free health care to extremely poor parts of the population. 
However, this intention is currently facing several operational obstacles.<b>16</b> The Government&#8217;s

</p>
<p>approach, focusing on basic health, is reflected in the eligibility rules for the use of HIPC 
resources. Some interlocutors pointed out that training of specialists such as gynaecologists, 
paediatricians, and surgeons is expensive and time-consuming, but cannot be financed with 
HIPC funds. 
</p>
<p>40. HIPC funds have also been used in areas such as women&#8217;s rights. The construction of 
<i>maisons des femmes</i>, autonomous places where women can meet without permission of their 
husbands, was among the main priorities identified by the beneficiaries themselves. 
</p>
<p>41. The independent expert gained the overall impression that HIPC resources have been used 
in areas relevant for economic, social and cultural rights. In the education and health sectors 
funds have been focused on addressing identified bottlenecks and ensuring a better fulfilment of 
the corresponding rights to health and education. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. ECONOMIC REFORMS AND THE POVERTY REDUCTION  
STRATEGY PAPER 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process in Burkina Faso 
</b></p>
<p>42. In 2000, Burkina Faso became one of the first developing countries to prepare a full 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and donors have progressively aligned support to the 
PRSP. The central objective of the PRSP is the improvement of the living conditions of the 
population. To this end, the vision outlined in the 1995 Letter of Intent for Sustainable Human 
Development, based on the concept of human security, has been harmonized with the intention 
of accelerating the realization of the Millennium Development Goals. The main pillars of 
Burkina Faso&#8217;s PRSP are: (a) accelerating broad-based growth; (b) promoting access to basic 
social services for the poor; (c) increasing employment and income-generating activities for the 
poor; and (d) promoting good governance. A general update of the strategy was undertaken in 
October 2004, aimed in particular at the creation of an enabling environment for business, 
competition and private investment, a more extensive mobilization and more efficient and 
effective use of financial resources, better targeting and acceleration of social sector reforms 
(with free primary education, the improvement of health services and the fight against 
HIV/AIDS as key elements), and a more explicit partnership with civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>43. The elaboration of the PRSP did not explicitly follow a human rights-based approach built 
on the obligations of duty bearers under international human rights law. However, economic, 
social and cultural rights objectives are generally congruent with the PRSP, in particular 
regarding the focused allocation of resources to the areas of health and education. Also, human 
rights principles such as equality and participation have been part of the PRSP process and 
should now guide and inform its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Ownership, participation and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>44. The elaboration of the first PRSP was dominated by the Government in coordination with a 
number of international partners. The document contained several elements defined by the 
international partners as conditionalities for development funding. Civil society participation did 
not play a major role in the elaboration process - only some consultative workshops were 
organized. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/9/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>45. With the general review of the PRSP in 2004, the process significantly improved: civil 
society was more involved and is now more interested in strategic poverty reduction issues. 
Government officials pointed out that in contrast to earlier Structural Adjustment Programmes in 
which the World Bank and IMF were the only major relevant partners, the current PRSP 
approach is a more broadly participatory process, including civil society actors and other donors. 
This ensures that the policy suggestions of the international financial institutions are assessed in 
a more critical way. In turn, these assessments by domestic partners can help the Government to 
better resist external requests and conditionality. The results of PRSP implementation are 
evaluated each year against several poverty indicators and, in this context, the Government 
considers itself to be under strong scrutiny, not only from development partners, but also from 
civil society. Government officials see the inclusion of civil society as an interesting framework, 
even if it limits the Government&#8217;s room for manoeuvre. 
</p>
<p>46. In the context of the PRSP review, civil society organizations were requested to nominate 
representatives for the overall process as well as for the sectoral and thematic committees. The 
<i>Cellule nationale de renforcement des capacit&#233;s</i> participated on behalf of civil society 
organizations in the PRSP process. However, several civil society organizations criticized the 
way the participation process was conducted and claimed that civil society input and 
recommendations had not been sufficiently taken into account. 
</p>
<p>47. The independent expert gained the impression that the PRSP process is open to full civil 
society involvement and that civil society organizations are strongly committed to contributing 
to the process. However, civil society does not currently have the capacity to follow and 
influence all elements of this highly complex process. In contrast to other partners such as the 
international community or governmental authorities, civil society does not yet possess the 
necessary human and material resources to deal with voluminous and complex technical policy 
proposals and documents within very tight deadlines, and to formulate detailed alternatives to all 
sector policies. Several government interlocutors regretted the absence of tangible civil society 
input on several important thematic issues. 
</p>
<p>48. The independent expert suggests that empowerment of civil society organizations should 
be an integral part of the PRSP process and donors should support programmes set up to this 
end. Government authorities reconfirmed their commitment to support civil society. The 
institution of new support instruments, such as objective-based contracts, is envisaged in order to 
strengthen civil society capacities and involvement. 
</p>
<p>49. Due to the then ongoing legislative election campaign, the independent expert was 
unfortunately not able to meet with Members of Parliament involved in the PRSP process. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Reform policies 
</b></p>
<p>50. Since the 1990s Burkina Faso has implemented a wide range of economic reform policies. 
However, the impact of important reform steps has not been systematically assessed and the 
Government monitors their effects only through global indicators at macro level, such as poverty 
indicators, or through other indicators linked to the Millennium Development Goals. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/9/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>51. As an example, the privatization process of public enterprises has not been analysed with 
regard to its impact on employment, poverty reduction and economic growth. In general, 
interlocutors pointed out that the first wave of privatizations during the 1990s was not properly 
monitored by government authorities and led to mixed results. In some cases new owners did not 
respect commitments made and privatization resulted in workers being made redundant, with 
serious social and economic consequences. The agricultural sector, where Burkina Faso has an 
important economic potential, was cited as a negative example, in particular the privatization of 
the public fruit and vegetables export company, Flex Faso, which disappeared some years after 
its privatization. Other sectors, such as banking and insurance, have benefited from privatization. 
This sector is now considered less vulnerable, with expanded activities and providing services 
not available in Burkina Faso before privatization. The independent expert gained the impression 
that the privatization process, including the social commitments of private owners, is now better 
monitored and accomplished. The most recent privatization of the telephone company, 
ONATEL, did not lead to the massive dismissal of workers. 
</p>
<p>52. Better integration of Burkina Faso into the international trade system would have an 
important positive impact on the country&#8217;s development process and its ability to better comply 
with economic, social and cultural rights. However, any liberalization in this area should be 
based on an extensive impact assessment and designed and sequenced with a view to 
maximizing its development and human rights benefits. In the context of regional Economic 
Partnership Agreements currently negotiated with the European Union, Burkina Faso is in the 
process of defining sectors that are not yet competitive in an international context. The country is 
establishing a list of sensitive products that will be excluded from liberalization during a 
transition period. The European Commission and other development partners have reiterated 
their commitment to increasing trade-related development aid in order to progressively improve 
the competitiveness of Burkina Faso&#8217;s economy. 
</p>
<p>53. The independent expert was informed, and he duly noted, that vulnerable regions in 
Burkina Faso currently face important food security problems, despite record harvests during the 
last year. Interlocutors mentioned increased food exports to neighbouring countries as one 
element responsible for this phenomenon. The Government should assess the impact of regional 
trade flows on the availability of food and implement trade safeguarding clauses, if and when 
necessary, in order to comply with right to food obligations. 
</p>
<p>54. Cotton is Burkina Faso&#8217;s most important export product and domestic production costs are 
among the lowest in the world. According to government information, about 40 per cent of the 
population earns its living from the cotton sector. This natural comparative advantage is 
undermined by the international trade regime which allows developed countries to subsidize 
production and export of cotton. In the case of Burkina Faso, the pressure on world market prices 
generated by subsidies leads to a loss of export income that NGOs estimate to be higher than the 
country&#8217;s HIPC debt service savings.<b>17</b>

<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> On the basis of the numerous discussions held and observations made during his visit, 
the independent expert concluded that there is a clear and demonstrable political 
commitment by the Government of Burkina Faso to address human rights challenges, as 
manifested by progressive legislation and recent institutional improvements. Significant 
efforts have been undertaken to improve the enforcement of human rights principles 
enshrined in international and domestic law, such as equality and non-discrimination. 
However, formal law faces major implementation problems in areas where it is in 
contradiction with Burkina Faso&#8217;s traditional cultural context, and in particular with 
regard to gender equality. The Government and civil society actors are encouraged to 
continue and increase sensitization efforts in this area, in particular in rural areas and with 
regard to discrimination against women. 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> Debt relief obtained through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and Multilateral 
Debt Relief initiatives has substantially reduced Burkina Faso&#8217;s foreign debt burden, which 
currently does not appear to threaten the country&#8217;s capacity to comply with its human 
rights obligations. The Government is, however, encouraged to continue its prudent debt 
policy and to avoid new non-concessional loans to finance its development ambitions. The 
Government and its international development partners are encouraged to make sure that 
the national development strategy can be financed to the largest possible extent by grants. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> In order to strengthen the accountability and participation elements within the 
foreign debt planning and decision process, recourse to Parliament and civil society advice 
should be more systematically undertaken. The consultation of human rights actors in 
particular would be an important added value to the process. This could be achieved 
through institutionalized civil society participation in the work of the National Public Debt 
Committee. 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The achievement of the Millennium Development Goals is the central objective of 
Burkina Faso&#8217;s PRSP. However, compliance with the Goals does not automatically 
engender progress regarding international human rights obligations. Future reviews of the 
strategy should aim at strengthening the PRSP by clearly stipulating the obligations of the 
State under the international human rights treaties it has ratified, and by elaborating on 
the means to implement them. Human rights norms and principles such as equality, 
non-discrimination, participation, inclusion, accountability and the rule of law should 
guide and inform the implementation of the PRSP. In this context the independent expert 
commends the inclusive approach and participatory process adopted in the PRSP. 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> Burkina Faso&#8217;s civil society organizations are strongly committed to contributing to 
the PRSP process. However, civil society does not yet have the human and material 
resources and organizational capacity to comment on, inform and influence all stages of 
this highly complex process. Empowerment and capacity-building of civil society 
organizations should be an integral part of the PRSP process. To this end, the Government 
and the donor community should continue and increase their support to civil society 
organizations in order to allow their more effective involvement. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/9/Add.1

</p>
<p>60.<b> The ongoing privatization of public enterprises and current negotiations in the area 
of foreign trade should be guided and informed more systematically by impact assessments 
that not only include economic and social objectives but also the State&#8217;s obligations under 
international human rights law. With regard to the right to food, the Government should 
assess the impact of regional trade flows on the ability to provide food for all, and 
implement trade safeguarding measures if necessary. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The production and export subsidies provided by industrialized countries for cotton 
undermine the development potential of this sector in Burkina Faso. The international 
community should refrain from this practice, in the context of the international trading 
system, in order to allow Burkina Faso to accelerate its economic development and its 
compliance with international obligations in the area of economic, social and cultural 
rights.
