</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions on the problem of trafficking in persons, 
especially women and children, in particular General Assembly resolutions 63/156 of 18 
December 2008 and 64/178 of 18 December 2009, and Council resolutions 8/12 of 18 June

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and 
declarations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol 
thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Optional Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its fourteenth session (A/HRC/14/37), chap. I. 
</p>

<p>United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and recalling the 
Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the 
Prostitution of Others, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29) and the Worst Forms 
of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour Organization, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and the Committee against Torture about the persistence of trafficking and the 
vulnerability of victims to human rights violations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming </i>that trafficking in persons violates and impairs the enjoyment of human 
rights, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted 
international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among 
countries of origin, transit and destination for its eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are 
often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of 
gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as national or social origin, 
and that these forms of discrimination may themselves fuel trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to 
prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate instances of trafficking and punish 
perpetrators, to rescue victims and to provide for their protection, and that not doing so 
violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of victims, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular 
problem of trafficking in women and children, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> the challenges to combating trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, owing to the lack of adequate legislation and implementation of 
existing legislation, the lack of availability of reliable sex- and age-disaggregated data and 
statistics and the lack of resources, and recognizing the role of international cooperation in 
this regard, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by 
trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that policies and programmes for prevention, rehabilitation, return and 
reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and 
multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the 
full enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of 
origin, transit and destination, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming in particular</i> the efforts of Governments, United Nations bodies and 
agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the 
problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, including at the national, 
subregional and regional levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the convening of the seminar on the theme &#8220;A human rights approach to 
combating human trafficking: challenges and opportunities&#8221; by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva on 27 and 28 May 2010, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting also </i>the panel discussion on the theme &#8220;Giving voice to the victims and 
survivors of human trafficking&#8221;, held on 2 June 2010 during the fourteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council, </p>


<p><i> Noting further</i> efforts to consider a possible review mechanism on the 
implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
and the Protocols thereto, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the ongoing work at the United Nations in New York to elaborate the Global 
Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its concern</i> at:

</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime groups 
and others who profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without

</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for the 
purposes of exploitation of the prostitution of others and other forms of sexual exploitation, 
for trafficking in women as brides and for sex tourism, child pornography, paedophilia and 
any other form of sexual exploitation of children;

<p> 4. <i>Encourages</i> Governments to refer to the Recommended Principles and 
Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking developed by the Office of the United

<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> Governments to consider signing and ratifying, as a matter of 
priority, in the case of Governments that have not yet done so, and for States parties to 
implement relevant United Nations legal instruments, such as the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, in particular 
the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women 
and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime, and to take immediate steps to incorporate provisions of the Protocol into 
domestic legal systems;

immigration officials and members of Governments and diplomatic and consular personnel, 
as well as relevant stakeholders providing assistance to victims of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To support the adoption or strengthening of legislative or other measures to 
discourage the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women 
and children, that leads to trafficking in persons, including the demand created by sex 
tourism, especially in children, and forced labour, and the enhancement in this regard of 
preventive measures, including legislative measures, to deter exploiters of trafficked 
persons and ensure their accountability; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To support the adoption or strengthening of measures to alleviate the factors 
that make persons vulnerable to trafficking, such as poverty, underdevelopment, lack of
