4. Aggravating Factors

According to the information revealed by the Summary of Facts placed before Court, you have breached trust of your employer.

5. Mitigating Factors:

I consider following mitigating factors which were brought before me on your behalf. That you are;

32 years of age, married with one child, currently unemployed, sought forgiveness, committed the offence as you were not paid overtime, remorseful, promises not to re-offend, seek a lenient and a non custodial sentencing, the sole breadwinner of the family and have to pay rent for the house.

6. Statutory Indication

According to section 291 (1) of the Crimes Decree No.44 of 2009; A person commits a summary offence if he or she dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the property.

The offence of theft carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.

It was held in Tikoitoga v State (2008, FJHC 44, HAM 088 2007) The Tariff for larceny is 18 months to 2 years. Learned Judge Daniel Gounder held in State v Vatunalaba (2010, FJHC 99; HAC 134.2008) that the tariff for theft offences arising from breach of trust range from 18 months to 3 years imprisonment. Suspended sentences are reserved for cases where the offenders have shown remorse or the value of the property is small.

7. Sentence

In sentencing you the Court acknowledges the factors that you;

i.      
Pleaded Guilty at the first available opportunity to save the Court's time and Prosecution's time in calling witnesses for a full trial.
ii.     
You are remorseful for your action.
iii.    
 I also note that the stolen items were partially recovered.

In the light of Sentencing Guidelines under section 4 (1) and (2) and General Sentencing PROVISIONS under section 15(3) ) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree I consider an appropriate sentences on you. I select 24 months as a starting point for your sentence.

In considering your early guilty plea in the first available opportunity I reduce 08 months. In view of aforementioned aggravating factors I increase 03 months, to reach the period of 13 months. I further reduce 03 months for the mitigating factors. You have one previous conviction, therefore you do not entitle for further deductions for your previous good character. Now your sentence stands for 10 months of imprisonment period for count 1-4.

In considering whether is it appropriate in the circumstances of this case to suspend your sentence The Court notes that you have admitted the allegations and you have entered a guilty plea at the earliest opportunity available and you are remorseful. Taking into account all the circumstances of this case, I am of the view of that you should not be sentence to imprisonment and given another opportunity to reform away from a custodial sentence. I suspend your sentence for 03 years in pursuant to section 26 (2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decrees. 

Accordingly, I sentence you 10 months imprisonment period for four counts of theft, contrary to section 291(1) of Crime Decree No 44 of 2009. 

All counts to be run concurrently.

If you commit any crime during the period of 03 years and found guilty by the court you are liable to be charge and prosecute for an offence in pursuant to section 28 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

28 days to appeal
