There’s no better way to

to be our customers.
Every day our people live in the 
houses and communities we 
create, frequent the iconic 
buildings we build, buy our
products from the same places 
our customers shop at and use 
the roads and infrastructure we
construct. This first hand
understanding of the customer

delivery partners really need.

Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Dear shareholders,
We are pleased to present our report to 
you for the 2016 financial year. The theme 
of this year’s report is our customers and 
how we work with them. Increasingly, 
our success is being derived from our 
ability to provide our customers with 
end-to-end solutions. Our strategies 
are built around the manufacture and 
distribution of not only high-quality 
building materials but also the delivery 
of outstanding service propositions and 
whole-of-project building solutions. 
When we achieve these, we become 
a valued member of our customer’s 
supply chain rather than simply a 
product supplier or contractor.
In addition to this emphasis on building 
customer solutions, we have also had a 
particular focus on the following areas 
over the past year:
•  Ensuring our New Zealand businesses
capture the growth in construction 
activity
•  Lifting the performance of our
Australian businesses
•  Leveraging the capability we have 
built through FBUnite, augmented 
by additional capability, to deliver a 
sustained uplift in performance over 
the medium term
•  Continuing to build our people
capability through ongoing 
recruitment and employee 
development and through 
entrenching the vision and 
values launched last year
•  Executing on our growth agenda 
through expansion of activities in 
our distribution, construction and 
residential development businesses
•  The business portfolio rationalisation 
with non-core businesses divested or 
otherwise restructured.
We have made substantial progress in all 
of these areas and detail below the key 
achievements in respect of each one.
FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 
30 JUNE 2016
Net earnings for the year ended 30 June 
2016 were $462 million, compared with 
$270 million in the prior year. This year’s 
result included a net gain within significant 
items totalling $37 million. Net earnings 
before significant items were $418 million, 
5% higher than the comparable figure 
of $399 million recorded in the 2015 
financial year.
Operating earnings (earnings before 
interest and tax) were $719 million, 
compared with $503 million in the 
prior year. Operating earnings excluding 
significant items were $682 million, up 
4% on the prior year and in line with the 
earnings guidance we provided at the 
annual shareholders’ meeting.
The increase in earnings was driven 
by the 29% uplift in operating earnings 
before significant items from our 
Australian businesses, coupled with 
strong growth in operating earnings 
in New Zealand in the Distribution, 
Residential and Construction divisions.
Operating earnings before significant 
items from our businesses beyond 
Australia and New Zealand were down 
11%, owing mainly to performance issues 
with our Formica plant in the United 
Kingdom, which offset stronger reported 
earnings in North America and Asia. 
With a refreshed management team and 
good progress achieved during the year 
in improving manufacturing operations, 
we are confident of a significant 
turnaround in performance in 2017.
A highlight of the result was the increase 
in cash flow from operations, which 
was 15% higher at $660 million than the 
$575 million we achieved in the prior year. 
The increase was due to the growth in 
underlying operating earnings and 
reductions in working capital.
CAPTURING THE GROWTH IN THE 
NEW ZEALAND CONSTRUCTION MARKET
The past year has seen a continued 
uplift in construction activity levels 
in New Zealand, with all sectors – 
residential, commercial and infrastructure 
construction – showing strong growth. 
Total construction activity in New Zealand 
has now surpassed the previous peak 
level experienced in the mid-2000s, 
and we expect this heightened level 
of activity to continue for several years. 
New housing construction is responding 
to strong market demand, driven in part 
by the record net migration levels into 
New Zealand. Similarly, we have seen 
increased activity in the commercial 
sector across most building types, 
and government spending on core 
infrastructure, such as roads, education 
and health facilities, has continued apace.
In most of our New Zealand businesses, 
volume growth tracked the broader 
increase in overall construction activity. 
We experienced 7% growth in concrete 
volumes and 6% growth in cement 
volumes and plasterboard volumes 
were 11% higher.
2015: 575 ▲ 15%
Cash flow from operating activities $m
$660
Net earnings $m$462
Revenue $m$9,004
2015: 270 ▲ 71%
2015: 8,661 ▲ 4%
Operating earnings $m
$719
2015: 503 ▲ 43%
Total construction activity 
in New Zealand has now 
surpassed the previous 
peak level experienced 
in the mid-2000s, and we 
expect this heightened 
level of activity to continue 
for several years.
12  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Chairman and chief executive officer’s report
What was equally pleasing was the 
continued growth in earnings from our 
New Zealand distribution businesses, 
which increased 16% on the prior year.
Earnings in our residential business 
were 12% higher, despite the reduction 
in contributions from the Stonefields 
development in Auckland. We have seen 
the efforts of the residential team in 
identifying and developing new sites 
successfully offset the impacts of the 
build out of Stonefields.
The New Zealand Construction division 
reported 29% growth in revenue, and a 
13% increase in future contracted work, 
reflecting the strength of the domestic 
construction market, as well as success 
in delivering for customers and securing 
new work.
LIFTING THE PERFORMANCE OF 
OUR AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES
Conditions in the Australian construction 
industry have been more mixed over 
the past year. While new housing 
construction has been running at record 
levels, the industry has had to digest the 
impact of the slow-down in capital 
expenditure in the mining and resources 
sectors and the negative impact on 
regional economies and government-
funded infrastructure investment plans.
Despite the mixed economic backdrop 
in Australia, our focus on improving 
business performance has seen stronger 
earnings from our Australian portfolio 
of businesses. Operating earnings in 
Australia were 29% higher at $154 million. 
This strong performance was driven in 
part by the success of the turnaround 
of the Iplex plastic pipes business, 
which finished the year on a positive 
earnings run rate, having operated at a 
loss for most of 2015. Also contributing 
significantly was the Stramit steel 
roll-forming business, where earnings 
were 43% higher than for the prior year 
and Fletcher Insulation which more 
than doubled its operating earnings.
LEVERAGING OUR CAPABILITY TO FURTHER 
LIFT PERFORMANCE IN THE MEDIUM TERM
During the year, we undertook a 
substantial review to identify the potential 
to further grow shareholder value from 
our existing portfolio of businesses. 
Following on from this analysis, we 
developed a new approach that would 
enable us to deliver on the opportunity 
we had identified, over a three year 
timeframe and beyond.
Using the benchmarks refined following 
the initial assessment phase, targets have 
been established for each business unit, 
with the opportunities grouped under the 
following categories:
•  Commercial – revenue and product
margin growth
•  Cost – both external expenditure
and overhead costs
•  Manufacturing and operational
efficiency – including manufactured 
products, distribution costs and 
construction-delivered margin.
Called Accelerate, the programme 
leverages the capability built under 
FBUnite, particularly around procurement, 
property management, information 
technology, manufacturing excellence 
and sales and marketing centres 
of excellence.
The initiatives identified within Accelerate 
are driven by the management teams 
in each business unit, supported by 
the centres of excellence. In addition, 
a Transformation Office has been 
established to oversee the governance 
of the Accelerate programme, provide 
support and tools to each business unit 
and coordinate resources. To date, more 
than one thousand initiatives have been 
started. These are captured in an online 
system that tracks their validation and 
delivery timeframe.
The success of the  
Accelerate programme  
will be reflected in the  
results of each business 
unit over the next three years 
with the aim of delivering 
higher revenue growth, 
market share gain, improved 
gross margins and lower 
operating costs.
BUILDING OUR PEOPLE CAPABILITY
To better serve our customers and 
grow returns to our shareholders, we 
understand that we must continue to 
invest in our people and capability. 
This past year has seen a continuation of 
our mission to make Fletcher Building a 
great company to work for. This means 
ensuring that our people go home safe 
every day, building deep leadership talent 
pipelines and investing to build capability 
across all levels of the organisation in an 
environment that fosters both high 
performance and high engagement 
across the workforce.
Our people strategy is formed around 
three key priorities: talent and 
leadership, workplace culture and 
capability. You will find more detailed 
discussion of our achievements in the 
past year further on in this report.
We were pleased to welcome 1,200 
Higgins employees to Fletcher Building 
at the end of July, with the completion 
of the Higgins acquisition. Critical to 
the success of the Higgins business 
within Fletcher Building will be the 
integration of the newly acquired 
business with our existing construction 
and quarrying activities.
EXECUTING ON OUR GROWTH AGENDA
Last year we clearly outlined the areas 
we had identified as offering the most 
opportunity for growth. These were 
New Zealand residential development, 
construction in New Zealand and the 
South Pacific and trade distribution in 
New Zealand and Australia. In each of 
these businesses we have differentiated 
capabilities, cost positions, customer 
relationships and end-markets that offer 
substantial room for growth.
1. Residential
Fletcher Living, our residential 
development business, had a record 
year in 2016, with operating earnings of 
$74 million, which were up 12% on the 
prior year. This was driven by the strong 
increase in the number of homes we sold 
in the year, and also owing to the strength 
of house prices, particularly in Auckland.
We have ambitious plans to further 
expand this business, with the ultimate 
goal of lifting the number of homes 
we bring to market each year from 
an historical average of 300 to 1,500. 
To achieve this, we are working on 
three fronts.
13  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
The first is a continuation of our 
traditional activity where we buy 
completed lots from land developers. 
The second is the purchase of bare 
land for development with which we 
master-plan whole new communities. 
Third are our partnerships with the 
Government to develop existing land 
with increased density to cater for a 
wider range of housing needs. 
The expansion of our 
residential development 
business continues to 
require investment in land 
inventory to enable us to 
meet the goal of delivering 
1,500 homes a year. 
In 2016 we invested a further $89 million 
(net) in land and work in progress, and 
expect to invest a further $160 million 
in the 2017 financial year.
2. Construction
Fletcher Construction is continuing to 
build on its outstanding track record. 
With a number of new contracts secured 
during the year, its total contracted order 
book now stands at $2.7 billion.
We had signalled for some time our 
desire to extend our activities into the 
road construction and maintenance 
sector, where we have identified 
significant opportunity. With the 
completion in July of the acquisition 
of the Higgins contracting business in 
New Zealand and Fiji, we are now in a 
position to fulfil this aspiration. Higgins 
was a logical choice for Fletcher Building, 
as we have partnered with them on 
road construction projects for over 
25 years and have forged a close 
working relationship.
The acquisition included the Higgins 
aggregates business in New Zealand, 
and the total purchase price was 
NZ$303 million.
We believe that a  
combination of Fletcher 
Building and Higgins will 
provide our customers with 
a stronger proposition for 
both new road projects and 
maintenance contracts.
We also see further benefits for a number 
of group businesses in being able to work 
more closely with Higgins and believe 
that we can derive further value from the 
acquisition through operational synergies.
Higgins has achieved strong growth in 
Fiji and this business complements our 
existing South Pacific construction 
activities. We will be looking to extend 
the sphere of operations beyond Fiji into 
other South Pacific territories over the 
next few years.
3.  Distribution
The third area of growth is in our 
New Zealand and Australian distribution 
businesses. In New Zealand, we have 
seen PlaceMakers achieve record 
earnings, and Mico go from loss making 
two years ago to strongly profitable this 
year. In addition, we have seen further 
gains in the Steel Distribution businesses.
In Australia, we have continued to 
implement the turnaround of Tradelink. 
The focus has been on cost-effectively 
expanding the store footprint, 
implementing a service guarantee 
oriented around the core requirements 
of the trade plumber, and on lifting the 
capability of people within the business. 
There remains much to be done to get 
that business to acceptable returns 
but we are clear on our strategy and 
the early signs of customer acceptance 
are encouraging.
Across all our distribution businesses 
we have identified further organic growth 
opportunities, from improving our store 
footprint, developing complete customer 
solutions, expanding our product range 
into adjacent categories and expanding 
into entirely new but complementary 
categories. We will continue to invest in 
online platforms and increasingly 
leverage our procurement capabilities 
to further source from low-cost countries. 
Our portfolio of strong distribution brands 
provides us with the opportunity to drive 
deeper customer connections through 
the services and products we procure 
or supply.
REFOCUSING THE BUSINESS PORTFOLIO
Over the past two years we have been 
working to rationalise our portfolio of 
businesses and have actively sought to 
divest those businesses that we did 
not see as being core to our future. 
The most significant event during the 
year was the sale of the Rocla Quarries 
business for $212 million. This transaction 
gave rise to a one-off gain of $85 million. 
The Rocla Quarries business was a sound 
one but it was an isolated asset that 
was not integrated with the rest of our 
Australian portfolio and we were able to 
sell the business for greater value than it 
could add as part of Fletcher Building.
We have also combined the Fletcher 
Aluminium windows and doors business 
with Nalco in a new joint venture aimed at 
better serving the New Zealand market.
With these actions we have made 
significant progress in reshaping our 
portfolio, with non-core businesses 
divested and investments made where 
we see the strongest opportunity to 
further grow earnings.
REFINED DIVISIONAL STRUCTURE 
TO SUPPORT STRATEGY EXECUTION
As a result of these changes we 
announced a refined organisation 
structure in February. This new structure 
saw the company organised into five 
divisions, centred on the manufacture 
of building products, distribution, 
residential and land development, 
construction, and the group’s 
international businesses. The new 
structure accommodates the changes 
to the portfolio made over the past two 
years and at the same time allows like 
activities to be grouped together and 
operating efficiencies to be pursued.
A further change to the structure this 
year was the establishment of the role 
of chief transformation officer and 
the appointment of Lee Finney to 
the position.
With the creation of this role we now have 
a dedicated senior executive focused on 
supporting the Accelerate programme 
and overseeing the activities of the 
centres of excellence.

DIVIDEND
The total dividend for the year increased 
to 39 cents per share, from 37 cents 
per share last year, and the increase 
is consistent with the growth in net 
earnings before significant items for the 
year. This corresponds to a pay-out ratio 
of 64% of net earnings before significant 
items, which is within the target pay-out 
range of 50% to 75%.
The dividend will be fully imputed for 
New Zealand tax purposes. For the 2017 
financial year, we expect to be able to 
fully impute both the interim and final 
dividends for New Zealand tax purposes 
and for at least the next two years beyond 
2017. We do not expect to be in a position 
to fully frank a dividend for Australian tax 
purposes in 2017.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
The total return to shareholders for 
the year to 30 June 2016 was 11%, 
representing a combination of positive 
share price appreciation over the year 
and dividends paid. This past year has 
been one of exceptional volatility in 
equity markets which has at times 
impacted Fletcher Building’s share 
price dramatically despite a steady 
financial and operating performance.
BALANCE SHEET
An ongoing priority has been to manage 
the business so as to maintain a strong 
financial position at all times. We have 
continued to target financial metrics
that are consistent with an investment 
grade credit rating and that ensure we 
are in line with our industry peers.
As at our balance date of 30 June 2016, 
we had received the $212 million in 
proceeds from the sale of the Rocla 
Quarries business but had yet to settle 
the $303 million acquisition of Higgins. 
Consequently, we had relatively low net 
debt levels at year end, which resulted 
in gearing (measured by the ratio of 
net debt to net debt plus equity) being 
temporarily below our target range of 
30% to 40%, at 27%.
OUTLOOK
For the 2017 financial year we expect 
operating earnings (earnings before 
interest and tax and significant items) 
to be in the range of $720 million to 
$760 million.
In New Zealand, we expect residential 
activity to peak in 2018 and then 
gradually slow to 2014 levels over the 
next three years. However, owing to the 
lag between consents being granted 
and work actually being undertaken, 
the peak in consents will continue to 
impact activity beyond 2017, prolonging 
the strength in the building market for 
at least another year.
Non-residential activity is forecast to 
remain relatively steady at elevated 
levels compared to the historical 
average. Infrastructure work undertaken 
is expected to maintain its upward 
trajectory over the course of 2017 
and beyond.
The New Zealand dollar is expected to 
gradually weaken throughout the year 
against key currencies, particularly the 
Australian and US dollar.
Australian residential activity is expected 
to gradually decline over the next three 
years following its peak in 2016. Little 
growth is forecast in non-residential activity.
In Asia, the China market is expected to 
grow moderately but at lower rates than 
in recent years. Taiwan and South East 
Asian markets are expected to show 
modest growth.
North American market growth is expected 
to be relatively low but slightly higher in 
the USA than Canada.
Market growth estimates vary across 
continental Europe from negative in 
some markets to flat and low growth 
in others, while the UK is expected to 
show modest growth.
In terms of the outlook for each of 
our divisions:
•  Building Products: continued focus
will be on further improving the 
performance of its Australian business 
units and ensuring the New Zealand 
businesses continue to capture the 
growth in volumes arising from the 
strong market conditions
•
International: the turnaround of 
Formica‘s European business, 
particularly in the UK market, will 
drive earnings uplift and all regions 
are targeting improved trading 
performances
•  Distribution: pursuing top line growth, 
particularly in higher margin product 
categories, will be key enablers 
for further earnings growth. The 
performance of Tradelink’s turnaround 
plan will require network plumber 
share gains, although the benefits will 
be partly offset by the operating costs 
from expansion of the branch network
•  Residential and Land Development:
the acceleration of home building 
in Auckland and Christchurch, 
along with maximising development 
opportunities from industrial land 
holdings, will drive operating results 
for the year
•  Construction: continued strong
revenue growth is expected, driven 
by the elevated levels of construction 
activity in New Zealand. Operating 
results will be positively impacted by 
the Higgins acquisition, offset in part 
by the wind down of the Canterbury 
Earthquake Recovery (EQR) home 
repair programme and a reduction 
in South Pacific activity.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Our people, across each
of our five business divisions, are
united in their commitment to 
driving ongoing operational 
performance improvements. 
As a result, we are delivering 
enhanced experiences for our 
customers and better outcomes
for our communities and
for our shareholders.

Business review
Building 
Products
During the year the 
Building Products 
division was formed 
under the leadership 
of Matt Crockett to 
bring together the 
group’s interests in 
manufacturing and 
distributing building 
materials, supplying 
a broad range of 
industries across 
Australasia.
The division comprises Firth, 
Humes, GBC Winstone, Iplex 
Pipelines (New Zealand and 
Australia), Rocla Products, 
Winstone Wallboards, Tasman 
Insulation, Fletcher Insulation  
and Fanalco.
HIGHLIGHTS
We have turned around performance 
in our Australian business units, while 
maximising the performance of the 
New Zealand businesses, delivering 
increased year-on-year earnings.
Solid progress was made in our Australian 
turnaround businesses. Iplex Australia is 
close to returning to profitability after the 
significant losses it sustained in the 2015 
financial year and Fletcher Insulation 
more than doubled its earnings in this 
financial year.
In New Zealand, our market share in 
the concrete value chain was defended 
despite intensifying competition and 
while successfully executing a complex 
national cement distribution strategy 
following the end of the Holcim reciprocal 
arrangements. Our New Zealand building 
materials businesses had another strong 
year delivering significant earnings growth 
with superior customer value propositions 
and service. Volume growth reflected the 
increase in construction activity.
This year has also seen the completion 
of the successful divestment of the 
New Zealand Pacific Steel and the 
Australian Rocla Quarries businesses, 
resulting in a more focused portfolio.
FUTURE FOCUS
We will continue to focus on improving 
the performance of our turnaround 
Australian businesses (Iplex Australia, 
Fletcher Insulation and Rocla Products). 
We will grow market share with superior 
customer value propositions and service 
promises, while continuing to drive 
for further operational efficiencies. 
In New Zealand, we will defend share 
and optimise pricing and margins to 
ensure our businesses capture the 
growth in construction activity.

International
The International 
division created 
during the year under 
the leadership of 
Francisco Irazusta, 
makes and delivers 
a range of laminates, 
decorative surfaces 
products and roofing 
materials.
The division comprises Formica, 
which manufactures its products 
in Europe, Asia and North America, 
Laminex which produces decorative 
wood panels and laminate, particle 
board, medium density fibre board 
and other decorative products in 
New Zealand and Australia, and the 
Roof Tile Group, which supplies 
pressed metal roof tiles in North 
America, Europe, New Zealand, 
Africa and Asia.
HIGHLIGHTS
International continued to remain at the 
forefront of a highly competitive and 
cost-conscious market. We pursued 
the growth of the business through 
the development of new capabilities, 
enhancements of existing systems and 
processes and by continuing to improve 
our people capabilities. Key focus areas 
all aimed at making it easier and better 
for our staff to perform their roles, while 
at the same time increasing the emphasis 
on providing improved experiences and 
service for our customers.
The division continued its programme 
of manufacturing and supply chain 
excellence at its 20 major manufacturing 
sites across the world and continued the 
programme of upgrading its global ERP 
systems. This upgrade has revolutionised 
the way that our European business 
interacts with its customers and has led 
to significant improvements in service 
capability across the market.
In Asia our business improved efficiencies 
and increased capacity at the recently 
built high-pressure laminate factory at 
Jiujiang, which serves regional markets.
In addition, the business continues to 
focus on supplying new products with 
anti-microbial qualities into the growing 
hospital, healthcare and education 
sectors, as well as government projects 
with high hygiene expectations.
Our German metallic laminate business, 
Homapal, continued to expand its range 
of highly successful and innovative 
products. This range includes white and 
black magnetic boards, and continues 
to grow and prove successful in the 
education and commercial sectors.
FUTURE FOCUS
The division is focused on making capital 
investment and system improvements 
across the business to enhance 
competitiveness and also capture 
market opportunities. We are investing 
heavily in our European laminate business 
and will install upgraded modern 
state-of-the-art laminate manufacturing
equipment at our Newcastle laminate 
facility which will help to address the 
manufacturing issues encountered 
during the year. Focus will remain on 
optimising and fully loading our new 
laminate plant in China and our expanded 
roof tile facility in California. Optimising 
our manufacturing facilities in Asia and 
improving logistics and service, remain 
key initiatives for the coming year. We will 
continue with a programme of enhancing 
digital and ERP capabilities across the 
business. Extending product ranges and 
applications through innovation and new 
products remain the key priority, as we 
seek to drive revenue across all segments 
of the business.

Distribution
The Distribution 
division, under the 
leadership of Dean 
Fradgley, has market-
leading positions in 
New Zealand and 
Australia thanks 
to its focus on 
customer service.
Distribution is a Trans Tasman 
portfolio of businesses, 
incorporating over 420 locations. 
PlaceMakers, Mico, Pacific 
Coilcoaters, Fletcher Reinforcing, 
Dimond and Easysteel operate 
in New Zealand, with Tradelink, 
Stramit and Tasman Sinkware 
operating in Australia.
HIGHLIGHTS
Over the last year the Distribution division 
has combined the previously separate 
New Zealand and Australian Distribution 
divisions to drive greater alignment, 
synergistic strategies and further deploy 
to each business a tailored customer 
service promise with a differentiated 
service offering in the market.
This financial year saw record domestic 
sales levels and double-digit operating 
earnings growth at PlaceMakers, Mico, 
Pacific Coilcoaters and Fletcher 
Reinforcing. At the same time we saw 
material improvements in our customer 
service metrics, a direct output of our 
businesses and our people becoming 
increasingly more customer focused.
PlaceMakers took an industry-leading 
position to externally publish its customer 
service scores in trade publications, 
reinforcing the focus on putting the 
customer at the heart of our business. 
Following the transition of the Australian 
businesses into the enlarged Distribution 
division during the year, customer value 
propositions have now been deployed 
for these businesses as well.
The Distribution division continues 
to leverage its scale and operational 
efficiencies, with the co-location of 
eight branches in New Zealand, 
integrating Dimond into the operations 
of Easysteel, and further leveraging 
operational support and management 
functions, enabling synergy realisation 
and cost savings. The co-location 
programme also reduced carbon 
emission by almost 100 tonnes per 
year. Three new PlaceMakers branches, 
three new Mico branches and four 
new Tradelink branches were opened 
during the year making it easier for our 
customers to do business with us.
FUTURE FOCUS
Our customer leading focus is on 
implementing and evolving our 
differentiated service model, growing 
profitably, developing and extending 
categories for each business. For example, 
front-of-wall bathroom products for Mico 
and kitchens in PlaceMakers. Growth will 
be pursued in key sectors of the market, 
such as small medium enterprise and 
servicing the growing group home 
builder sector. Our growth strategy 
includes Tradelink opening a further 
20 branches in the coming year.

Construction
The Construction 
division under the 
leadership of Graham 
Darlow is a builder of 
commercial buildings 
and infrastructure 
across New Zealand 
and the South Pacific.
Projects range from New Zealand’s 
largest transport and commercial 
building projects through to small 
interior works and road improvements. 
Customers include New Zealand’s 
key infrastructure providers from 
the central and local government 
sectors, health and education 
providers, utilities and commercial 
property owners. The Construction 
division comprises:
•
Infrastructure, including Brian 
Perry Civil, Seovic, Pipeworks 
and Piletech
•  Building + Interiors, including 
Forman Commercial Interiors
•  South Pacific, operating in Fiji,
Samoa, Tonga, American Samoa, 
Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands 
and Papua New Guinea
•  Canterbury Earthquake 
Recovery, responsible for 
organising the repair of 
earthquake damaged 
homes in that region.
HIGHLIGHTS
The division’s backlog of work has 
continued to grow throughout the year 
– the value of work won and yet to be 
completed, increased from $2.4 billion in 
the prior year to $2.7 billion as at 30 June.
The division’s level of work, turnover and 
profitability have reached record levels, 
with Building + Interiors revenue up 32% 
and Infrastructure revenue up 28%.
The Building + Interiors business has been 
awarded over $1.4 billion of work in the 
last year and the Infrastructure business 
has begun works on the 21.8km Hamilton 
section of the Waikato Expressway, 
Waikato's largest roading project.
The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery 
business has been winding down its 
operations over the last year, as it 
completes its contractual arrangements 
with the Earthquake Commission.
South Pacific has turned over a similar 
level of work to the previous financial 
year, with the Momi Bay resort in Fiji 
the most significant project in progress. 
This year a significant highlight was 
securing wharf work in Vanuatu and 
American Samoa, as well as initial 
construction of the Star Mountain 
development in Papua New Guinea.
Work has continued on major 
infrastructure and commercial building 
and interiors projects. See map for 
Construction’s 24 key projects in 
New Zealand.
FUTURE FOCUS
With the largest pipeline of business 
on record, the Construction division 
remains focused on delivering excellence 
for our customers, finding innovative 
ways to increase efficiencies and making 
sure we have the right people, skills and 
processes to fit the future needs of our 
business and our customers.
In February the acquisition of Higgins was 
announced. Higgins is a New Zealand and 
Fiji road construction and maintenance 
business, operating a number of asphalt 
plants and quarries. The Construction
division will have responsibility for the 
construction and maintenance parts of 
the business including asphalt plants, 
while the quarries will be integrated into 
the GBC Winstone business. Higgins is 
recognised by infrastructure agencies 
for its expertise in road paving and 
maintenance, which will add to Fletcher’s 
transport project construction attributes.
The Higgins business acquisition 
positions the division well for the 
increasingly favoured ‘construct and 
maintain’ contractual arrangements used 
for transport projects. The acquisition of 
Higgins was completed on 29 July 2016.

Residential 
and Land 
Development
In February 2016 the 
Residential and Land 
Development division 
was separated from 
the Construction 
division and is led 
by Steve Evans.
The newly created division 
expanded to include the 
development of Fletcher Building’s 
current property portfolio to its 
highest and best use. The division 
comprises two business units – 
Fletcher Living and Land 
Development.
Fletcher Living specialises in 
building master-planned residential 
communities in Auckland and 
Christchurch, being a vertically 
integrated builder, encompassing 
design through to sales.
Land Development’s business 
comprises a combination of 
residential and commercial land 
developments for on sale to 
third parties.
The division currently has 28 projects 
providing a secured pipeline of in 
excess of 6,000 dwellings.
HIGHLIGHTS
Home building commenced at eight 
new locations during the year as the 
business transitioned from planning 
and consenting to execution in a 
number of areas. New developments 
include Beachlands, Hobsonville Point, 
Ormiston, Red Beach, Swanson, Waiata 
Shores, Tatua on Eden and Whenuapai 
in Auckland.
The division has a number of significant 
residential land developments undergoing 
infrastructure works in Auckland at the 
former Three Kings Quarry, Eugenia Rise 
and former Manukau Golf Course. These 
developments will provide the residential 
business access to lots in good locations 
at a reasonable cost for the next three 
years and beyond. Additionally, the 
business has a number of significant 
commercial subdivisions in progress.
During the year, major partnership 
arrangements were secured with the 
Government for the release of surplus 
Crown land in Auckland. The first of these 
projects, announced in June 2016, is an 
almost 200 dwelling subdivision at Moire 
Road in West Auckland.
In Christchurch, formal agreement was 
reached with the Government to develop 
900 dwellings at East Frame over 10 years. 
Work is also under way on the Awatea, 
Atlas Quarter and 350 Colombo projects, 
all in partnership with the Government. 
These projects will see around 400 
dwellings delivered between 2016 and 
early 2018.
FUTURE FOCUS
Creating communities is the vision that 
drives Fletcher Living. We consider the 
needs and desires of existing and new 
communities to make sure we build 
connected neighbourhoods that add life, 
soul and value to the land they occupy.
Today’s homes need to be designed 
around modern lifestyles. Our 
communities have varied architecture 
and housing types to meet the diversity 
of households and cultures that we sell 
to. At Fletcher Living we build homes 
from the inside out. Our customer 
proposition is to ‘create more space for 
living’ and in doing so we create more 
desirable homes and communities for 
the future.
Our focus for now and the future is to 
continue to execute on our three-prong 
strategy first presented to the market in 
June 2015, which you can find in the 
investor centre of www.fbu.com.

FOCUS AREAS
The building industry has  
always been about people.
The places they love, share and live.
The products and services they
need to do all the things they want,
in the way that's right for them.
That's why our focus
is on people first. This means 
prioritising our customers,
our people and their safety, our
communities and the sustainability
of the wider environment.
30  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Focus areas
Customers
Without customers we 
don’t have a business 
– it is as simple as that. 
Being customer leading 
is about being ahead 
of the game for our 
customers every single 
day. It’s important to me 
that all Fletcher Building 
employees understand 
the impact they have on 
customer satisfaction. No 
company can get it 100% 
right all the time and it is 
the individual interactions 
customers remember. 
They may remember 
exceptional service and 
they may remember poor 
service but customers 
never forget when you 
got it wrong and then 
made it right.”
MARK ADAMSON
Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director
CUSTOMER LEADING
Being customer leading is one of Fletcher 
Building’s values and a strategic priority 
for all business units and divisions. 
We have a huge depth and breadth 
of different customers, from home 
owners and individuals in the trades and 
professions, including builders, plumbers, 
architects, specifiers, designers and 
engineers to commercial and civic 
organisations, including group home 
builders, developers, universities, 
hospitals and central and local 
governmental groups.
No matter the customer, our overarching 
priority is to ensure we have an indepth 
understanding of their needs and 
market trends. We use these insights 
to improve our products and services 
and we seek out digital solutions that 
create customer advocacy and increase 
operational efficiencies.
It is the business units that own customer 
relationships and each has specific plans 
in place to deliver value. Their work is 
supported by the Sales and Marketing 
Centre of Excellence established this 
year. This team provides global best 
practice strategies, processes and tools 
and works alongside the business units to 
support the execution of positive change. 
Fostering a culture of being customer-
focused and insight-led has been a key 
priority, along with building marketing 
and sales capability, increasing 
commercial acumen and delivering 
win-win solutions to our customers.
SERVICE AND PRODUCT INNOVATION
Across all our divisions there has been 
a renewed focus on defining our 
commitment to deliver excellent service. 
Almost every business has introduced 
Customer Service Promises, which set 
out our commitments to our customers 
in clear unambiguous terms. In addition, 
all businesses have a Net Promoter Score 
to measure customer engagement.
More than a poster on a wall, the 
Customer Service Promises define key 
deliverables that each business must 
meet, measure and report. To deliver 
these promises, our businesses have 
made fundamental changes, large and 
small, from changing opening hours 
and rationalising product lines to 
introducing new products, investing 
in new equipment and in some cases 
re-engineering the business.
From our earliest days, product 
innovation has been key to Fletcher 
Building. Recent innovations include the 
Smartfit® window manufactured by our 
new joint venture Fanalco on a state-of-
the-art extrusion press. Smartfit® is a 
ready-to-fit window system that saves 
installation time for builders, is functional

Formica™ is a design-led business 
constantly updating the colour and 
textures of its high-pressure laminates 
to ensure products are on trend. The 
180fx® collection is a large format range 
that provides the true-to-scale granite 
patterns customers desire.
In a similar manner, New Zealand 
concrete business Firth continues 
to innovate into its 90th year of 
manufacturing, with the introduction 
of four new series of designer pavers 
and two architectural masonry ranges 
to bring renewed design desirability to 
the product range.
For our infrastructure customers in 
Australia, Rocla Products has introduced 
a new product offering – the custom 
concrete pit. A pit is a junction box to 
join pipes and has been developed for 
customers who have expressed the 
desire to buy pipes and pits from the 
same supplier.
DIGITAL SOLUTIONS
Our new Digital Innovation Lab works 
with our businesses to understand 
customer needs and identifies 
opportunities to develop digital solutions. 
With 24 digital solutions delivered, the 
Lab directly supports business units in 
creating closer relationships with their 
customers and making it easier for 
customers to do business with us.
For example, Fletcher Insulation and 
Tasman Insulation have both introduced 
specification tools that use new technology 
for more accurate specification of 
product requirement for jobs, reducing 
waste and saving money for customers. 
Laminex New Zealand has introduced 
a kitchen rendering service to help 
customers better visualise new and 
renovated kitchen designs.
The Digital Innovation Lab keeps abreast 
of digital trends and disruptions, including 
big data, virtual and augmented reality and 
other innovations for future consideration 
of customer leading solutions.
From the first time we 
met with Paula and the 
team at Fletcher Living, 
they were all very 
informative, honest, 
polite and full of positive 
energy. Along with the 
amazing packages they 
have for first home 
buyers, we knew we 
were making the right 
decision to buy with 
Fletcher Living. We love 
our new home and the 
community created by 
Fletcher Living.”

Focus areas
People
The value of a company 
is determined by the 
quality of its employees. 
At Fletcher Building we 
are focused on making 
this company a great 
place to work. This means 
ensuring our people go 
home safe every day, 
building deep leadership 
talent pipelines, investing 
to build capability 
across all levels of 
the organisation in an 
environment that fosters 
both high performance 
and high engagement 
across the workforce.
Our people strategy is formed around 
three key priorities: talent and leadership, 
workplace culture and capability.
This year, Fletcher Building chief 
executive officer Mark Adamson 
received the Supportive CEO of the Year 
award at the Human Resource Institute 
of New Zealand (HRINZ) awards. Mark 
was recognised for his contribution and 
ongoing commitment to diversity, talent 
development, employee engagement 
and significant advancements in human 
resource technology at Fletcher Building. 
At the HRINZ awards we also had finalists 
for the HR Specialist of the year and the 
HR Innovation award.
LEADERSHIP, TALENT AND CAPABILITY
We continue to invest in developing 
our leadership strength across our 
business to ensure that we have a 
strong pipeline of internal leadership 
talent. We have invested in building 
a leadership curriculum that is award 
winning with four key programmes: 
– Step Up, Leader’s Edge, Branching 
Out and Leadership Insights.
All of our leadership programmes are 
developed to ensure we have strong
talent pipelines across all levels of the 
company globally. Through the Workday 
HR software system we will be mapping 
talent across our salaried workforce to 
ensure we continue to promote internally 
where possible.
In New Zealand, we partnered with the 
Tertiary Education Commission to roll 
out manufacturing and supply chain 
qualifications. Nearly 650 people will 
successfully complete these qualifications 
by the end of 2016.
We continue to strengthen our global 
sales capability. Our custom built Sales 
Learning Pathway programme was 
launched last year. Following its success 
we will launch a service-focused 
programme later this year.
Aspire, our new organisation-wide learning 
management system was launched in 
November 2015. Aspire manages learning 
for all employees across the company 
and helps managers and staff to better 
access, track and evaluate their learning 
and development.
Our learning curriculum, which continues 
to grow in strength, was delivered to 
close to 7,500 employees globally.

DIVERSITY
Our Diversity Council, chaired by Mark 
Adamson, continues to focus on developing 
a strong pipeline of diverse talent, creating 
an inclusive workplace and working with 
community and government organisations 
to provide employment opportunities to 
young people.
In New Zealand we are proud to have 
received accreditation from Rainbow 
Tick, which identifies Fletcher Building 
as an inclusive employer. Part of our 
commitment to inclusivity is our active 
internal network that supports our 
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and 
Intersex community. Also, in February we 
sponsored Auckland Pride Festival and 
took part in the annual Pride Parade.
Gender diversity has been a focus 
over the past three years, with 26% of 
leadership and 21% of the total workforce 
now women. Our FAB women's series 
and mentoring programme have played 
vital roles in providing networking and 
development opportunities for the 
women in our workforce. We continue 
to be principal sponsors of Global 
Women and we support its Breakthrough 
Leaders Programme by committing one 
of our female leaders to attend this 
programme annually.
One component of our diversity strategy 
is to ensure we are bringing greater focus 
on developing our Māori and Pasifika 
leaders. This year the Whakatupu 
Programme was launched, supporting 
Māori participants to explore what their 
heritage and leadership means for them 
and to develop their future.
We continue to support training and 
development for young people to enter 
the workforce in collaboration with the 
New Zealand Defence Force, Ministry 
of Social Development, Te Puni Kōkiri 
and local council programmes and the 
First Foundation.
Our youth employment strategy has 
helped over 200 young people into 
the workforce to date with an additional 
81 people gaining employment, learning 
opportunities and valuable skills this year.
The remuneration committee reviews 
progress against the diversity objectives 
and initiatives developed by the group
to deliver outcomes against the Diversity 
Policy. The board is satisfied with the 
initiatives being implemented by the 
company and its performance with 
respect to the Diversity Policy.
Fletcher Building’s Diversity Policy is 
available on www.fbu.com.  
COLLABORATION
Our emphasis this year has been on 
building a more engaged workforce 
through increased collaboration across 
levels and areas of the business. We 
continue to bring our people together 
through regional forums and technology 
enablement. Mark Adamson launched 
Day In The Shoes, where senior leaders 
spent a day working in another's role. 
Mark worked at Firth to mix and deliver 
concrete to customers.
Supporting our global intranet, Matrix, 
we had the successful launch of the 
social enterprise tool Yammer, giving 
individuals a platform to engage with the 
business, collaborate and problem-solve 
no matter where they are.
I'm lucky I work for Fletcher 
Building, a company that 
has gone out of its way to 
achieve the Rainbow Tick to 
mark itself as an inclusive 
and non-judgemental 
workplace. For me as 
someone whose gender has 
always been questionable, 
this makes a big difference.”

Opportunities
For five young Kāpiti locals, the 
Mackays to Peka Peka (M2PP) 
Expressway opened doors to new 
opportunities in construction and 
employment. With a shortage of 
trained steel fixers on the Kāpiti 
Coast, M2PP and WelTec teamed up 
to deliver an on-the-job training 
course for Kāpiti youth seeking a 
career in construction. The students 
completed 60 hours of learning, 
gaining unit standards in fixing steel 
for concrete construction and steel 
fabrication, which they are putting to
great use on the M2PP project.60HOURS OF VALUABLE STUDENT

35  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
We have three areas of  
focus for sustainability:
on the environment
1 Protecting and minimising impacts 
2  Protecting the health, safety and 
3  Investing in and supporting the
communities in which we operate.
wellbeing of our employees
Sustainability is about resource efficiency, 
improving the way the business is run, 
using and manufacturing environmentally 
responsible products and managing 
environmental impacts. Fletcher Building 
believes sustainability is important to 
the customer, delivers real value and 
is crucial to the life of our business. 
The environment is a key consideration 
in the way we operate. All of our 
sustainability initiatives work within a 
framework of economic innovation.
When it comes to environmental 
protections and minimising our 
impact on the environment, it is 
our business strategy in action that 
makes the difference. Our approach 
is to have strong business units 
supported by an active centre. We 
have a central Environment, Health 
and Safety team providing direction 
and key performance indicators, 
including the monitoring of our carbon 
emissions. This team has developed 
a sustainability framework, which 
provides direction for our focus areas.
It is our 34 business units that have the 
greatest ability to make a difference for 
the environment. Within our diverse 
portfolio we have many inspiring 
examples of businesses that are reducing 
waste, being more energy efficient, 
creating new and more sustainable 
products and new ways of doing things.
This year, Fletcher Building businesses 
have been involved in all kinds of 
environmental initiatives. They have 
relocated endangered geckos, 
introduced lean construction methods 
and been nominated for environmental 
awards in recognition of their commitment 
to rehabilitate former quarry sites and 
innovations that significantly reduce 
waste. One project site alone has planted 
over 700,000 trees.
For the future we will continue to focus 
on improving our performance in the area 
of health, safety and the environment, in 
developing our people and in supporting 
our communities. We look forward to 
reporting our progress in the coming year.
Fletcher Building commits to:
•  Working together to protect the
environment
•  Reducing the impacts associated
with our manufacturing, construction 
and extraction operations
•  Reducing the impacts associated
with the distribution and use of our 
building materials
•  Building leadership capability
•  Supporting and investing in the
communities in which we operate
•  Managing health and safety risks
across our business
•  Working collaboratively with central 
and local government stakeholders 
to facilitate employment or training 
opportunities for disadvantaged youth
•  Having workplaces that strive to
provide development opportunities 
for our people, focused on high 
engagement and high performance.

Focus areas
Health and Safety
At Fletcher Building 
we take very seriously 
the safety and health 
of our employees and 
continually encourage 
safety excellence and 
improvements through 
our value of being 
Better Every Day.
HEALTH AND SAFETY GOVERNANCE 
Our health and safety governance 
programme within Fletcher Building is 
demonstrated through our executive 
Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) 
Council, chaired by the chief executive 
officer. This council develops the EHS 
strategy, makes regular decisions and 
drives actions to reduce risk and build 
engagement across the health and safety 
function. The board is represented 
through the safety, health, environmental 
and sustainability committee, chaired by 
Fletcher Building director Kate Spargo, 
which provides oversight and challenge 
on direction and action. Divisional chief 
executives and general managers provide 
the link between the group direction and 
business units.
Businesses and sites proactively reduce 
their risks on site and have active health 
and safety committees to address local 
issues, identify initiatives and programmes 
to improve environmental, occupational 
health and safety issues relevant to work 
areas and build engagement across their 
wider teams. An annual improvement 
plan is reviewed and signed off by 
chief executives.
Fletcher Building continues to progress 
a programme of creating and distributing 
EHS standards to provide clarity of 
minimum expectations. An external 
review of compliance to our standards 
is organised through the EHS Council.

TOTAL RECORDABLE INJURY FREQUENCY 
RATE (TRIFR)
Preventing injuries is a matter we take 
seriously, therefore addressing areas of 
risk within our business is a high priority. 
Despite progress in health and safety 
management, Fletcher Building had an 
unacceptable number of serious injuries 
in the 2016 financial year. There were 
22 significant incidents reported and 
three fatalities in China, Papua New 
Guinea and New Zealand. The fatalities 
were the result of accidents involving 
vehicles and working at height. Fletcher 
Building has extended its deepest 
sympathy to the families of those affected 
and provided support and assistance. 
For the serious injuries, the hazards 
included material and equipment 
handling and powered tools.
Oversight of the recordable injury rates 
is retained by recording the 12 month 
rolling average Total Recordable Injury 
Frequency Rate per million employee 
and contractor hours (TRIFR). Total 
injuries are the sum of lost time and 
medical treatment injuries. In the last 
year this rate was 6.68 as of 30 June 2016 
and continues the flat trend of the 
past three years. Recordable rates of 
reportable injuries have plateaued owing 
to a focused priority of addressing our 
actual and potential critical risks.
Improved analysis of our incidents is 
providing greater depth of knowledge 
about risks within our business and 
where  priority of action is required. 
For the coming year we have a renewed 
focus on safety, with a particular emphasis 
on work at height, vehicles and mobile 
plant use. We are committed to improving 
our safety record.

CASE STUDY
Little change  
eliminates big risk
TOOWOOMBA
Iplex Toowoomba has proved that a little 
change can have a big impact, after the 
creation of a simple platform that 
operators can use to change the tools on 
any of the site’s four medium-sized 
manufacturing lines. This change makes 
the work safer, easier and more 
comfortable to complete.
The safety of employees who change 
the pins and dies on the manufacturing 
line at the Queensland-based site in 
Australia is of utmost importance to 
the Iplex business.
Toowoomba team members had raised 
concerns about safety risk when 
changing tooling on a machine in the 
manufacturing site. To eliminate the risk, 
National Processing Technician Peter 
Cameron designed a light, portable 
aluminium platform for operators to use.
“I asked the senior operators for their 
input and got a local engineering 
company to help me measure it and work 
on the connection points, making sure we 
factored in the standard requirements for 
handrails,” says Peter.
The platform is lightweight and simply 
‘clips into position’ when required. It can 
hold up to four people (up to 600kg total) 
and the handrail and kick plates have 
been engineered to Australian safety 
standards. The platform also packs up 
onto a pallet for storage in racking when 
it is not needed.
THE HEIGHT OF THE PLATFORM MEANS 
THAT OPERATORS CAN WORK AT THE 
SAME LEVEL AS THE TOOLING MACHINE.
All the operators really 
like it and have no 
concerns or worries 
about doing tooling 
changes. They feel 
safe on the platform 
and it has considerably 
reduced, if not 
eliminated, the risk 
from the task at hand.”

Focus areas
Community
Fletcher Building is 
committed to supporting 
the communities in 
which we operate and 
the people who call these 
communities home.  
We act honestly, in 
good faith and in the 
best interests of Fletcher 
Building to ensure that  
all stakeholders are  
treated fairly.
We engage with our employees, 
our customers and our communities 
with respect and a core set of values, 
understanding that human rights, 
labour practices, fair operating practices, 
respect for the environment, community 
involvement and development and 
consumer issues are all drivers of 
long-term sustainability.
Our 34 business units are active in their 
communities and implement many 
sponsorships and corporate giving 
programmes. As a group we support 
sporting, community, cultural, 
educational, environmental and 
health organisations and initiatives.
In the sporting world, Stramit has been 
a proud supporter of Surf Life Saving 
NSW for a decade. Stramit supports 
the work done by surf lifesavers all 
over Australia in addition to the annual 
country championships where 1,200 surf 
lifesavers compete in the competition 
that is a highlight on the annual surfing 
sports calendar.
In New Zealand, Fletcher Living has 
supported grass roots hockey and soccer 
at both high school and representative 
level for the past two years. The GBC 
Winstone quarry at Otaki continues to 
encourage community use of the site 
through waka racing on the quarry lake 
and canoe polo in a purpose-built facility. 
Winstone Wallboards sponsors the 
Canterbury Crusaders rugby team 
and hosted a community day where 
over 160 children got to meet their 
rugby heroes.
Our community support involves a range 
of initiatives, including PlaceMakers 
sponsorship of The Prostate Cancer 
Foundation of New Zealand for eight 
years, which has seen over $1.7 million 
raised for research and public education 
programmes. Another community 
initiative is in the area of men’s health 
with the Fair Dinkum Shed sponsorship 
of the Australian Men’s Shed Association, 
providing supportive spaces for men 
to talk and be part of a community.
Fletcher Building teams around the world 
have dedicated their time to cooking 
meals for the Ronald MacDonald House 
Charity in their cities. The proceeds from 
Easysteel's sculpture design competition 
auction will also go to Ronald McDonald 
House, which supports families throughout 
their childrens’ medical journeys.
In Canada, Formica North America 
continues to partner with Les Ateliers 
from Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu to help 
people with physical or mental 
disabilities to join the workforce.

Director independence
Information on the skills, experience and expertise of current directors and their independence status is contained under 'Board 
Profiles'. The company follows recommendations that the chairman be an independent director, who is not the same person as 
the chief executive officer and that a majority of the board are independent directors. The board considers all directors to be 
independent, with the exception of Mark Adamson.
Director induction and professional development
The board ensures that new directors are appropriately introduced to Fletcher Building and are acquainted with relevant industry 
knowledge and economics. The induction and continuing professional development includes visits to specific company operations 
and briefings from key executives. Directors are provided with material health and safety information relevant to the business and 
attend site visits.

Governance
Committees
The current standing committees of the board are audit and risk, 
remuneration, nominations and safety, health, environment and 
sustainability. From time to time, the board may create ad hoc 
committees to examine specific issues on its behalf. No ad hoc 
committees were formed during the year.
Each committee is governed by a charter setting out its 
responsibilities. Committees do not take action or make 
decisions on behalf of the board unless specifically mandated 
by prior board authority to do so.

SAFEGUARDING INTEGRITY IN FINANCIAL REPORTING
Audit and risk committee
The board has formed an audit and risk committee, which is 
subject to a formal charter available on the company’s website. 
The charter sets out the roles and responsibilities of the audit 
and risk committee.
The audit and risk committee has four members, whose 
names and qualifications are presented with directors under 
‘Board Profiles’. The committee is chaired by John Judge and all 
members are non-executive, independent directors. The audit 
and risk committee held four meetings during the year and 
attendance at those meetings is recorded under the heading 
‘Committees’ above.
Approval of financial statements
Prior to approving the interim and full year financial statements, 
the board received from the chief executive officer and chief 
financial officer a representation confirming the adequacy of 
the financial statements and their compliance with the Financial 
Markets Conduct Act 2013.
External auditor
The audit and risk committee considers and discusses the 
performance of the external auditor on an annual basis to 
ensure ongoing quality and effectiveness. This discussion is 
held without management present, but is informed by the 
results of surveys completed  by management.
EY was appointed as external auditor following a competitive 
tender process during FY15.
The Auditor Independence Policy includes requirements for the 
rotation of external audit engagement partners. The Auditor 
Independence Policy is available at www.fbu.com/investors/
governance. In addition, the policy covers the provision of 
non-audit services by the company’s auditor. Auditor's fees 
and expenses paid to EY are presented within Note 3 of the 
group financial statements included in this Annual Report. 
The other work performed by the external auditors beyond
43  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
the statutory audit was pre-approved in accordance with 
the Auditor Independence Policy and is not considered to 
compromise independence as the services did not constitute 
material sums of money.
The company’s external auditor attends its annual shareholders’ 
meeting and is available to answer questions from security 
holders relevant to the audit.
MAKE TIMELY AND BALANCED DISCLOSURE
Continuous disclosure
The company has in place a Market Disclosure Policy 
designed to ensure compliance with its continuous disclosure 
requirements under NZX Listing Rules. The Market Disclosure 
Policy is available on the company’s website.
RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS
Informed shareholders
Fletcher Building maintains a website, which includes current 
information about Fletcher Building’s activities and governance, 
including information of specific relevance to investors. Core 
policies on communicating with shareholders are formalised 
in a Shareholder Communication Policy, which is available on 
the website.
The company operates an investor relations programme, which 
includes scheduled interactions with institutional investors, 
analysts and other market commentators. Presentations are 
also disclosed on the company’s website and the NZX and ASX 
announcement platforms. The chairman meets with major 
shareholders of the company in New Zealand and Australia on 
an annual basis. The board also obtains annually research on the 
perceptions that the New Zealand and Australian investment 
community have on the company, management and performance.
Electronic communications
Shareholders have the option to receive communications from, 
and send communications to, Fletcher Building electronically 
and shareholders are actively encouraged to take up this option.

decision to acquire the Higgins business. Comprehensive due 
diligence was performed on the Higgins business, including 
financial, accounting, tax, legal and operational matters. PwC 
and Bell Gully advised in respect of the transaction. Other 
significant capital expenditure during the period included:

1  Operating earnings before significant items is a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess the performance of the business and has been
derived from Fletcher Building Limited’s group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016. Details of significant items can be found in note 4 of 
the group’s financial statements.
•  External revenue of $9,004 million was $343 million or 4%
higher than the prior year. Of this increase $362 million related 
to increased New Zealand revenue, partly offset by lower 
revenue in Australia. In local currencies, revenue increased by 
8% in New Zealand but declined by 4% in Australia and 9% in 
the Rest of World.
•  Reported operating earnings before interest and tax of
$719 million were 43% higher than the prior year.
•
•
In New Zealand, earnings benefited from continued strong 
residential, commercial and infrastructure construction activity, 
as well as strong operational performance in many businesses. 
Residential consents were 29,097, up from 25,154 in the prior 
year, an increase of 16%.
In Australia, market conditions were mixed, with new housing 
construction at record levels but activity in the mining and 
resources sectors down significantly and other sectors relatively 
subdued. Despite this, operating earnings before significant 
items increased 38% in local currency when adjusted for the 
divestment of the Rocla Quarries business, driven by operational 
performance improvements in Iplex Australia, Stramit and 
Fletcher Insulation.
•
In the Rest of World, earnings in local currency were flat in the 
major markets of Asia and North America, while earnings in 
Europe were down as a result of adverse operational 
performance in the UK.
•  Reported operating earnings include a net gain within significant
items of $37 million relating to:
– A gain on the sale of the Rocla Quarries business of $85 million;
– A $5 million gain on the divestment of the Fletcher Aluminium
business to the joint venture with Nalco;
– Costs of $5 million associated with the acquisition of the
Higgins business;
– Costs of $16 million relating to the closure of sites in Iplex
Australia, Rocla Products, Formica Europe and Dimond;
– Charges of $26 million in the Formica India business, with 
impairments of fixed assets, goodwill and working capital 
adjustments; and
– $6 million of costs incurred investigating and resolving
payroll system issues as a result of complexities in applying 
the New Zealand Holidays Act 2003.
•  Operating earnings before significant items were $682 million,
4% higher than the prior year.
•  Funding costs of $115 million were 9% lower than the prior year,
due to lower debt levels and borrowing costs.
•  The tax expense of $131 million represents an effective tax rate
for the year of 22% (2015: 26%).
•  Earnings per share were 67.0 cents, an increase of 71% from
39.2 cents per share in the prior year.
•  Earnings per share before significant items were 60.6 cents,
an increase of 4% from 58.0 cents in the prior year.

1  Operating earnings before significant items is a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess the performance of the business and has been
derived from Fletcher Building Limited’s group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016.
2  Details of significant items can be found in note 4 of the group’s financial statements.
Building Products reported operating earnings of $353 million, 
compared with $184 million in the prior year.
The result includes a positive significant item of $79 million 
comprising a gain on the sale of the Rocla Quarries business 
($85 million), and a gain on divestment of the Fletcher Aluminium 
business to the Fanalco joint venture ($5 million), partly offset 
by site closures in Iplex Australia and Rocla Products ($11 million).
The division’s operating earnings before significant items were 
$274 million, 6% higher than $259 million in the prior year. 
The increase was attributable largely to improved performance 
in Plastic Pipes and Building Materials, offset by decreased 
earnings in the Concrete Pipes & Products businesses and 
reduced Cement & Aggregates earnings following the Rocla 
Quarries divestment.
Reported gross revenue decreased by 8%, however, was up 1% 
when adjusted for divested businesses.
Whilst gross revenue of the Concrete Pipes & Products businesses 
increased 1%, operating earnings before significant items declined 
25% to $59 million or 14% when excluding prior year land sales 
($10 million). New Zealand concrete volumes were 7% higher, and 
prices were up slightly on last year. New Zealand concrete pipe 
volumes were down by 8%, due to lower market volumes in the 
first half of the year; volumes and market share recovered in the 
second half. Australian concrete pipe revenue was down 4% due 
to weak demand in Western Australia and Queensland and 
intensifying price competition in other regional markets.
Gross revenue of the Cement & Aggregates businesses decreased 
12% but was flat on an underlying basis if the divested Quarries 
business is excluded. The businesses recorded a 3% decrease
in operating earnings before significant items to $87 million. 
Key factors impacting year-on-year performance were lower land 
sales than the prior year ($4 million) and one-off restructuring 
costs in 2016 ($3 million). Adjusting for these and the divestment 
of Rocla Quarries, the underlying operating earnings were 11% 
higher than the prior year, with 6% year-on-year volume growth 
in New Zealand cement and stable market share, coupled with 
higher cement and aggregate prices.
Gross revenue of the Building Materials businesses increased 8%, 
whilst operating earnings before significant items increased 21% 
to $93 million. New Zealand plasterboard volumes were up 11% on 
the prior year and market share was stable. Both the New Zealand 
and Australian Insulation businesses achieved strong year-on-year 
volume growth, with earnings having doubled in the year.
The Plastic Pipes businesses recorded $14 million operating 
earnings before significant items after reporting a loss of 
$8 million in the prior year. This was primarily due to a significant 
turnaround in the performance of Iplex Australia. Australian gross 
revenue increased 3%, with volumes up 6%, whilst indirect costs 
reduced by 16% reflecting the successful execution of the 
turnaround programme.
Earnings from Joint Ventures & Other businesses were $21 million, 
in line with the prior year, with increased earnings from Fletcher 
Aluminium offsetting lower earnings from the Steel business, 
which ceased production in September 2015. A key achievement 
was the formation of the joint venture between Fletcher Aluminium 
and Nalco on 30 June 2016, which is well positioned to leverage its 
scale and capability in a strong New Zealand market.

1  Operating earnings before significant items is a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess the performance of the business and has been
derived from Fletcher Building Limited’s group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016.
2  Details of significant items can be found in note 4 of the group’s financial statements.
Operating earnings for the International division were $103 million 
compared with $143 million in the prior year. Gross revenue 
increased by 6% over the prior year.
The result includes significant items of $30 million, $26 million 
relating to impairing the operations of Formica India and $4 million 
for site closure costs in Formica Europe. Operating earnings before 
significant items decreased 7% to $133 million.
Laminex’s operating earnings were $80 million compared to 
$81 million in the prior year. Gross revenue increased 3% over the 
prior year, with increases of 2% in Australia and 8% in New Zealand.
Operating earnings in Australia were $72 million, up 3% on the 
prior year. Favourable market conditions in the residential sector 
were partly offset by a significant decline in the Western Australia 
residential market. Earnings were positively impacted by optimised 
pricing and operational efficiency improvements, with a significant 
reduction in overheads.
Operating earnings in New Zealand were $8 million. When adjusting 
for $1 million restructuring costs in the current year and a $3 million 
property gain in the prior year, earnings increased by 13% on the 
prior year.
Operating earnings before significant items for Formica were 
$62 million, a decrease of 9% on the prior year.
Formica reported gross revenue of $980 million, an increase 
of 10% on the prior year, largely due to the translation effect 
resulting from a lower New Zealand dollar relative to the US dollar 
in particular. In local currencies revenue was largely flat although 
this varied by region.
In North America revenue growth in local currency was up by 4% 
on the prior year, driven by volume growth of 2% and increased 
pricing. Operating earnings were $56 million, up 14% on the prior 
year, with 11% attributable to favourable currency translation, 
coupled with the strong operational performance of the 
manufacturing plants in the US and Canada.
In Asia growth rates in local currency varied significantly by 
country. The key markets of Taiwan, Thailand and Hong Kong 
generated revenue growth of 4%, 6% and 6% respectively. 
Revenue in China was up 2% on the prior year with revenue in 
Malaysia and Singapore behind last year. Earnings in Asia 
increased 21% to $23 million driven largely by lower raw material 
prices and improved manufacturing efficiencies across the two 
factories in China as both domestic and export volumes increased.
Gross revenue in Europe fell by 4% in local currency with the main 
driver being a decrease in sales in export markets. Most major 
Western European markets were stable. Formica Europe reported 
a  loss of $17 million compared with a breakeven result in the prior 
year, due to lower sales and adverse operational performance at 
the business’ key UK manufacturing plant, particularly in the first 
half. In addition, restructuring costs of $3 million impacted the 
result, and the business operated at breakeven in the second half.
Operating earnings in the Roof Tile Group were stable at $14 million. 
In the key markets of the Americas, Asia and New Zealand, volumes 
increased by 1%, 3% and 12% respectively but were offset by 
volume declines of 6% in Europe, driven by competitive pressures, 
along with deteriorating economic conditions in Africa, where 
volumes were down by 8%.
International divisional costs of $23 million increased $3 million on 
the prior year, largely due to currency translation, as a significant 
portion are incurred in US dollars.

1  Operating earnings before significant items is a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess the performance of the business and has been
derived from Fletcher Building Limited’s group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016.
2  Details of significant items can be found in note 4 of the group’s financial statements.
The Distribution division reported operating earnings of $175 million, 
compared with $93 million in the prior year.
Operating earnings before significant items were $176 million, 
compared with $148 million in the prior year, an increase of 19%, 
with strong earnings growth in both New Zealand and Australia.
Gross revenue increased by $103 million, or 3%, to $3.2 billion. 
In New Zealand gross revenue growth of 8% was driven by share 
gains and the positive macro environment.
The NZ Building Supplies businesses achieved gross revenue 
growth of 10% and reported increased earnings of 13%. PlaceMakers' 
gross revenue of $1.2 billion was up 10% on the prior year, with 
growth in the core categories of timber, frame & truss and 
concrete, as well as further accelerated growth in margin accretive 
categories, including kitchens and power tools. The Mico business 
increased gross revenue by 12% to $235 million, with strong 
growth in both bathroom and plumbing sectors, as it attracted 
new customers and increased sales from existing customers.
The NZ Steel Distribution businesses reported earnings before 
significant items of $44 million, an increase of $8 million or 22%. 
This reflected strong market share growth in Pacific Coilcoaters, 
record sales volumes in Easysteel, coupled with improved 
operational capabilities in Fletcher Reinforcing. Strong activity 
levels across the NZ Steel Distribution businesses were partially 
offset by the impacts of lower year-on-year global steel prices, 
which were at a 15-year low.
Additional synergies in New Zealand were realised in the year 
through combining the Dimond roll-forming business with 
Easysteel and continued co-locations of PlaceMakers and Mico.
The Australian businesses reported earnings of $47 million, 
an increase of 27%. During the year the businesses were further 
aligned, with the overall Distribution strategy focusing on operating 
efficiency. This entailed a change from State to functional 
management structures in both Stramit and Tradelink, further 
leveraging resources and driving synergies across the division.
Tradelink reported earnings of $22 million, which encompassed 
a $14 million gain from property sales, net of restructuring costs 
and inventory write offs. A 2% like-for-like decline in Tradelink 
revenue to $775 million followed the strategic reset of its core 
focus back to the small trade plumber and activity in the market. 
Whist a decline was still seen in the trade plumber area, the decline 
slowed in the second half, with traction gained from initiatives 
such as the Customer Service Promise launch. This focus is 
continuing with the launch of a customer loyalty scheme in 
July and network densification, with 20 new stores planned to 
open in the 2017 financial year.
Operating earnings in Stramit increased by 43% to $20 million. 
This was driven by improved levels of customer service, coupled 
with operational efficiency initiatives, while revenue was up 1% 
on the prior year.

The Residential and Land Development division reported operating 
earnings of $84 million, a 27% increase on the prior year.
NZ Residential operating earnings were $74 million, 12% higher 
than the prior year. Contrary to earlier expectations, the decreased 
earnings contribution from the Stonefields development in 
Auckland was more than offset by an accelerated build 
programme, including sales from a number of new locations.
Revenue for the year was $343 million, up from $238 million in the 
prior year, driven by increasing volumes of homes sold, as well as 
strong market pricing, particularly in the Auckland region.
Strong sales volumes and margins were delivered in the 
established areas of Greenhithe, Karaka and Stonefields. The 
second half of the year also delivered a meaningful contribution 
from the new subdivisions of Beachlands and Hobsonville, as well 
as early margin contribution from the Government partnership 
projects in Canterbury.
Land Development operating earnings were $10 million. This 
business comprises a combination of residential and commercial 
land developments for on sale to third parties. This included stage 
1 at James Fletcher Drive in Auckland and residential lot sales at 
Beachlands, Auckland and the remaining portion of Jack’s Point 
in Queenstown.
Whilst Land Development earnings will be irregular, it is anticipated 
that the business will earn at least $25 million per annum over the 
next five years.
Funds employed increased to $355 million from $211 million in the 
prior year of which $54 million related to land transfers from other 
divisions. This was driven by a combination of land development 
on previously acquired sites; an increase in work in progress, as the 
business builds towards its targeted volume of 1,500 dwellings per 
annum, and the settlement of lots purchased from other 
developers in Auckland, including Beachlands, Penihana, 
Hobsonville, Karaka and Whenuapai.

1  Operating earnings before significant items is a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess the performance of the business and has been
derived from Fletcher Building Limited’s group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016.
2  Details of significant items can be found in note 4 of the group’s financial statements.
The Construction division reported operating earnings of $78 million, 
an increase from $54 million in the prior year. The prior year included 
significant items of $20 million and therefore operating earnings 
before significant items increased 5%.
Gross revenue of $1,648 million, up 23% from the prior year, is the 
highest level achieved by the division, with the New Zealand 
businesses delivering record revenue and earnings.
Revenue growth exceeded operating earnings for a number of 
reasons, including a different mix of projects undertaken between 
years, EQR workload reducing and a number of projects 
commencing in the latter part of the year. In these cases the 
division has recognised revenue but no margin contribution to date.
The division has been very successful at winning work, with the 
backlog, being the value of contracted work awarded but not 
yet completed, increasing from $2.4 billion in the prior year to 
$2.7 billion at 30 June 2016. All parts of the business increased 
their backlog during the year, with construction projects secured 
across both the commercial and public sectors. In August 2016 
Fletcher Construction was announced as the preferred bidder 
on the Puhoi to Warkworth motorway extension as part of the 
Northern Express Group consortium.
The Infrastructure business has almost completed work on 
several major infrastructure projects, including the Waterview 
tunnel project, Rangiriri realignment and MacKays to PekaPeka 
on the Ka-piti Coast. Work has started, or is about to commence, 
on a number of significant projects, including the Kirkbride 
Alliance and Hamilton Bypass Alliance.
The Building + Interiors business has had a significant workload 
across the country, continuing with the construction of major 
projects such as the new headquarters for Fonterra, the University 
of Auckland Science Building, Victoria University of Wellington 
Science Building, the University of Waikato Law School and 
Christchurch Justice Precinct. It has also commenced work on the 
New Zealand International Convention Centre, National 
Biocontainment Lab in Wellington and Commercial Bay 
development in downtown Auckland.
The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery business has been winding 
down its operations over the last year, as it completes its contractual 
arrangements with the Earthquake Commission. Operating earnings 
reduced in line with the declines in workload; only a small level of 
work is still to be completed, expected to be by December 2016.
The South Pacific business reported operating earnings of 
$20 million, a decrease of 13% on the prior year. The reduction 
in earnings was due to the completion of a number of significant 
projects in the prior year.
In the current year the Momi Bay Resort in Fiji is now nearing 
completion, while work has commenced on new projects secured 
during the year, including wharves in Vanuatu and American Samoa, 
Government buildings in Samoa and a convention, hotel and 
commercial development in Papua New Guinea.
The acquisition of the Higgins road maintenance, road construction 
and aggregates businesses was completed on 29 July 2016. Total 
consideration was $303 million.

1  Operating earnings before significant items is a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess the performance of the business and has been
derived from Fletcher Building Limited’s group financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2016.
Detailed disclosure of the above line items is included in Fletcher Building Limited’s group financial statements.
Cash flows from operating activities of $660 million were $85 million, or 15%, higher than the prior year. Cash flows from operations 
before working capital movements were $562 million, down from $616 million due to increased provision utilisation and cash tax paid. 
The improvement in working capital, notwithstanding continued investment in residential land, reflected the success of specific inventory 
and debtor management initiatives during the year, along with the collection of $81 million of final working capital balances following the 
closure of the Pacific Steel operations.

Capital expenditure was $300 million, compared with $278 million in the prior year. Of this total, $194 million was for stay-in-business 
capital projects, including $26 million on IT projects and $106 million related to new growth initiatives.
For 2017 capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million.
53  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Funding
Total available funding as at 30 June 2016 was $2,224 million. 
Of this, $608 million was undrawn and there was an additional 
$356 million of cash on hand. Drawn debt facilities maturing 
within the next 12 months total $345 million and a further 
$68 million of capital notes are subject to interest rate and 
term reset. These maturities are more than covered by the 
undrawn facilities, a private placement that was completed 
on 20 July 2016 and available cash.
The group’s gearing1 at 30 June 2016 was 27.3% compared with 
31.8% at 30 June 2015. Whilst outside of the group’s target range 
of 30-40%, gearing has returned to the target range following 
completion of the Higgins acquisition.
The group’s leverage2 at 30 June 2016 was 1.6 times compared 
with 2.0 times at 30 June 2015. Again, this has returned to within 
the target range of 2.0-2.5 times following the Higgins acquisition.
The average maturity of the debt is 3.5 years and the hedged 
currency split is 47% Australian dollar; 32% New Zealand dollar; 
14% US dollar; and 7% spread over various other currencies.
Approximately 61% of all borrowings have fixed interest rates with 
an average duration of 2.5 years and a rate of 6.25%. Inclusive of 
floating rate borrowings, the average interest rate on the debt is 
approximately 5.4%.
Interest coverage3 for the year was 5.9 times compared with 
5.1 times in the prior year.
1  Interest bearing net debt (including capital notes) to interest bearing net
debt (including capital notes) and equity.
2  Interest bearing net debt (including capital notes) to EBITDA before
significant items.
3  EBIT before significant items to total interest paid, including capital
notes interest.
Dividend 
The 2016 final dividend is 20 cents per share. The final dividend 
will be fully imputed with New Zealand tax credits and unfranked 
for Australian tax purposes. The imputed amount per share on the 
dividend is 7.7778 cents.
As a fully imputed dividend, a supplementary dividend is payable 
to non-New Zealand non-portfolio shareholders and has the 
effect of removing or reducing the cost of New Zealand non-
resident withholding tax (NRWT). For most Australian resident 
shareholders receiving a supplementary dividend, the after tax 
return of the fully imputed dividend is equivalent to receiving a 
41% franked dividend.
The dividend will be paid on 12 October 2016 to holders registered 
as at 5.00 pm Friday 23 September 2016 (NZT). The shares will be 
quoted on an ex-dividend basis from 22 September 2016 on the 
NZX and ASX.
The interim dividend of 19 cents per share was paid on 13 April 2016.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Fletcher Building shareholders (excluding those in jurisdictions 
where the issue of shares is not permitted by law) can participate 
in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (‘the Plan’), under which they 
have the opportunity to reinvest their dividends in additional 
shares. The Plan will be operative for this dividend payment. 
There will be no discount to the price applied to ordinary shares 
issued. Documentation for participation is available from the share 
registry or the website www.fbu.com and must be received by the 
registry before 5.00 pm Monday 26 September 2016. The price 
used to determine entitlements under the Plan is the average of 
the individual daily volume weighted average sale prices of 
price-setting trades of the company’s shares sold on the NZX on 
each of the five business days from and including the ex-dividend 
date of 22 September 2016. The new shares will rank equally with 
existing shares and will be issued on the dividend payment date 
of 12 October 2016.
Dividend Policy
Fletcher Building seeks to maintain dividends through economic 
cycles, and to progressively grow the dividend over the medium 
term. The target dividend pay-out ratio, in the range of 50% to 75% 
of net earnings, is intended to provide sufficient flexibility for 
dividends to be maintained despite variations in economic 
conditions. Maintenance of a dividend in this range will be subject 
to there being no material adverse change in circumstances or 
outlook. In determining a dividend for any year a number of factors 
are taken into consideration, including current and forecast 
earnings and operating cash flows, capital requirements, and the 
company’s debt equity position.
Beyond dividends, Fletcher Building will consider other means 
of distribution, should cash flows and future investment 
requirements allow.
Tax Crediting Policy
Following a review of its forecast tax position, Fletcher Building has 
amended its tax crediting policy such that it intends to fully impute 
both the interim and final dividends with New Zealand tax credits 
each year (or to the maximum extent possible) and fully frank the 
final dividend with Australian tax credits where possible.
Fletcher Building expects to be able to fully impute both the 
interim and final dividend with New Zealand tax credits for at least 
the next two years but does not expect to be in a position to fully 
frank the 2017 final dividend with Australian tax credits.

The directors are responsible on behalf of the company for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance 
with New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards, and for 
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand). These auditing standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements 
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we have considered the internal control relevant to the 
entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also 
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe we have obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
We provide tax advisory, tax compliance and other assurance services to the Group. We have no other relationship with, or interest in, 
the Group.
Partners and employees of our firm may deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the 
business of the Group.
OPINION
In our opinion, the financial statements on pages 56 to 93 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as 
at 30 June 2016 and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand 
Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards.

62  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Statement of accounting policies
For the year ended 30 June 2016
GENERAL INFORMATION 
The financial statements presented are those of Fletcher Building 
Limited (the company) and its subsidiaries (the group). The group 
is primarily involved in the manufacturing and distribution of 
building materials and residential and commercial construction.
Fletcher Building Limited is a company domiciled in New Zealand. 
The registered office of the company is 810 Great South Road, 
Penrose, Auckland.
The company is registered under the Companies Act 1993 
and is a Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 reporting entity 
in terms of the Financial Reporting Act 2013. The group is a 
profit-oriented entity.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in New Zealand, 
which is the New Zealand equivalent to International Financial 
Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS). They also comply with International 
Financial Reporting Standards.
These financial statements are presented in New Zealand dollars($), 
which is the group’s functional and presentation currency and 
rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements comprise the income statement, 
statement of comprehensive income, statement of movements 
in equity, balance sheet, statement of cash flows and significant 
accounting policies, as well as the notes to these financial statements.
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
The financial statements are based on the general principles 
of historical cost accounting, except that financial assets and 
liabilities, as described below are stated at their fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by 
all group entities throughout all periods presented, except as 
disclosed in note 1, changes in accounting policies.
SEGMENTAL REPORTING
Segmental information is presented in respect of the group’s 
industry and geographical segments. The use of industry 
segments as the primary format is based on the group’s 
management and internal reporting structure, which recognises 
groups of assets and operations with similar risks and returns. 
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with NZ IFRS 
requires the directors to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses 
during the reporting period. Estimates and judgements are 
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience 
and other factors, including expectations of future events that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The estimates and judgements that are critical to the 
determination of the amounts reported in the financial statements 
relate to the following:
Revenue from construction contracts 
The construction contract accounting policy below requires 
estimates to be made of the outcome under each contract, which 
requires assessments and judgements to be made on a range of 
factors, such as: recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in the 
scope of work, contract programmes, maintenance and defects 
liabilities and changes in costs.
Intangible assets 
Assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life brands 
requires management to estimate future cash flows to be 
generated by the related cash-generating unit or brand. The key 
assumptions used in the valuation models include the expected 
rate of growth of revenues and earnings, the terminal growth rate 
and the appropriate discount rate to apply. Refer to notes 16 and 
17 for further details.
Deferred tax assets
Estimates are required relating to the availability and utilisation of 
losses to be carried forward (refer to note 23 for further details).
Retirement plan assets and liabilities
Principal assumptions made in the actuarial calculation of the 
defined benefit obligation relate to the discount rate, rate of salary 
inflation and life expectancy (refer note 31 for further details).
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Management consults with legal counsel on matters related to 
litigation, with respect to matters in the ordinary course of 
business. In respect of all claims and litigation, the group provides 
for anticipated costs in line with the accounting policy stated 
below. Refer to note 21 and note 28 for further details.
Fair value of derivatives
The valuation of derivatives is determined in accordance with the 
accounting policy stated below and as discussed in note 25(g).
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements comprise the company and 
its subsidiaries and the group’s interest in associates, partnerships 
and joint arrangements. Intercompany transactions are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. The 
group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct 
the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements using the acquisition method of 
consolidation, from the date control commences until the date 
control ceases.
Non-controlling interests are allocated their share of profit for the 
year in the income statement and are presented separately within 
equity in the balance sheet. The effect of all transactions with 
non-controlling interests that change the group’s ownership interest 
but do not result in a change in control, are recorded in equity.
63  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Associates
The equity method has been used for associate entities over which 
the group has significant influence but not control.
Goodwill on acquisition
Fair values are assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities 
of subsidiaries and associates of the group at the date they are 
acquired. Goodwill arises to the extent of the excess of the cost 
of the acquisition over the fair value of the assets and liabilities.
Goodwill is stated at cost, less any impairment losses. Goodwill 
is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is 
tested annually for impairment. Goodwill in respect of associates 
is included in the carrying amount of associates. Any discount 
on acquisition is recognised directly in earnings.
Intangible assets (other than goodwill)
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangibles 
are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised 
but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at 
the cash-generating unit level. Intangible assets with finite lives 
are amortised on a straight-line basis.
Joint arrangements 
A joint arrangement is an arrangement where two or more parties 
have joint control. The group classifies its joint arrangements as 
either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the legal, 
contractual and other rights and obligations.
Where the interest in the joint arrangement is in the net residual 
value of the business, the arrangement is a joint venture. Joint 
ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the 
equity method of accounting, investments in joint ventures are 
initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
consolidated financial statements include the group’s share of 
profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity 
accounted investees.
Where the group has rights to the assets and obligations for 
the liabilities of the joint arrangement, this is a joint operation. 
The group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenue and 
expenses of each joint operation.
VALUATION OF ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of purchasing land, buildings, plant and machinery, 
fixtures and equipment is the value of the consideration given to 
acquire the assets and the value of other directly attributable costs 
that have been incurred in bringing the assets to the location and 
the condition necessary for their intended service, including 
subsequent expenditure.
The costs of self-constructed assets include, where appropriate, 
the costs of all materials used in construction, direct labour on the 
project, site preparation and installation costs, costs of obtaining 
resource consents, financing costs attributable to the project, 
variable and fixed overheads and unrecovered operating costs 
incurred during planned commissioning. Costs cease to be 
capitalised as soon as the asset is in the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended 
by management. All feasibility costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases in which the group assumes substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases and are 
measured at the lower of their fair value or the present value of 
the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
Land, buildings, plant and machinery, finance leased assets 
and fixtures and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation.
Site development costs incurred in order to commence extraction 
are capitalised as resource extraction assets. Resource extraction 
assets are held at historic cost and depleted over the shorter of 
the life of the site or right to use period.
Other investments
Other investments are valued at historical cost. Impairments in 
the value of investments are written off to earnings as they arise.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value, 
determined principally on the first-in, first-out basis. Cost includes 
direct manufacturing costs and manufacturing overheads at 
normal operating levels.
Land and developments are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost includes the cost of acquisition and 
development. Costs incurred after completion of development 
are expensed as incurred.
Debtors
Debtors are valued at estimated net realisable value. The valuation 
is net of a specific provision maintained for doubtful debts. All known 
losses are written off to earnings in the period in which it becomes 
apparent that the debts are not collectable. Trade debtors normally 
have 30 to 90 day terms.
Construction work in progress
Construction work in progress is stated at cost plus profit recognised 
to date, less progress billings and any provision for foreseeable 
losses. Cost includes all expenditure directly related to specific 
projects and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred 
in the group’s contract activities based on normal operating capacity.
Cash and deposits
Cash and deposits comprise cash and demand deposits with 
banks or other financial institutions and highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to cash.
Impairment
Impairment is deemed to occur when the recoverable amount of 
an asset falls below its carrying value. The recoverable amount is 
determined to be the greater of the fair value, less disposal costs 
or the sum of expected future discounted net cash flows arising 
from the ownership of the asset. Future net cash flows take into 
account the remaining useful life and the expected period of 
continued ownership, including any intended disposals, and 
any costs or proceeds expected to eventuate at the end of the 
remaining useful life or the end of the expected period of 
continued ownership.
64  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Statement of accounting policies
For the purposes of considering whether there has been an 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there 
are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash 
flows of other groups of assets. When the book value of a group of 
assets exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss arises 
and is recognised in earnings immediately.
Goodwill and brands with an indefinite life are tested for impairment 
annually and when an indication of impairment exists. Other assets 
are tested for impairment when an indication of impairment exists.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise borrowings, trade 
and other payables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and 
other receivables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair 
value. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial 
instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any impairment losses.
Brands
Brands for which all relevant factors indicate that there is no limit 
to the foreseeable net cash flows, are considered to have an 
indefinite useful life and are held at cost and are not amortised 
but are subject to an annual impairment test.
Retirement plans
The group’s plan assets and liabilities in respect of individual 
retirement plans are calculated separately for each plan by an 
independent actuary, as being the fair value of the plan’s assets 
less the present value of the future obligations to the members. 
The value of the asset recognised cannot exceed the present 
value of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future 
contributions to the plans, unless a constructive right to a refund 
of the surplus exists, in which case the amount to be refunded is 
recognised as an asset. In the group’s balance sheet plans that 
are in a surplus position are not offset with plans that are in a 
liability position.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are 
translated into New Zealand currency at the rates of exchange 
ruling at balance date. The revenue and expenditure of these 
entities are translated using an average exchange rate reflecting 
an approximation of the appropriate transaction rates. Exchange 
variations arising on the translation of these entities, and other 
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, 
are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. 
The cumulative exchange variations would be reclassified 
subsequently to earnings if the overseas operation to which 
the reserve relates were to be sold or otherwise disposed of.
Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates 
at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at balance date 
are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at balance date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions are recognised in earnings, except where 
deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow 
hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are 
translated at the exchange rates in effect when the amounts 
of these assets and liabilities were determined.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange 
contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps, options, forward 
rate agreements and commodity price swaps are utilised to 
reduce exposure to market risks.
Group policy specifically prohibits the use of derivative financial 
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All the group’s 
derivative financial instruments are held to hedge risk on underlying 
assets, liabilities and forecast and committed trading transactions.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined 
by applying quoted market prices, where available, or by using 
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability. Further information 
is included in note 25(g).
The group holds derivative instruments until expiry except 
where the underlying rationale from a risk management point 
of view changes, such as when the underlying asset or liability 
that the instrument hedges no longer exists, in which case early 
termination occurs.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value 
and are then revalued to fair value at balance date. The gain or loss 
on revaluation is recorded either in earnings or equity, depending 
on whether the instruments qualify for hedge accounting, and the 
nature of the item being hedged. For a derivative instrument to be 
classified and accounted for as a hedge, it must be highly correlated 
with, and effective as, a hedge of the underlying risk being 
managed. This relationship must be documented from inception.
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge 
of a recognised asset or liability, or of a firm commitment, any gain 
or loss is recognised directly in earnings, together with any changes 
in the fair value of the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge 
of the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities, or of a highly 
probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or 
loss is recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve within 
equity and the ineffective part is recognised immediately in 
earnings. The effective portion is transferred to earnings when 
the underlying cash flows affect earnings.
Net investment hedges 
Where the derivative financial instruments are designated as a 
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the derivative 
financial instruments are accounted for on the same basis as cash 
flow hedges through the currency translation reserve within equity.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Where a derivative financial instrument does not qualify for hedge 
accounting, or where hedge accounting has not been elected, any 
gain or loss is recognised directly in earnings.
65  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
VALUATION OF LIABILITIES
Taxation
The provision for current tax is the estimated amount due for 
payment during the next 12 months by the group. The provision 
for deferred tax has been calculated using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax is recognised on the temporary 
difference between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities 
and their taxable value except for when the deferred tax liability 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability 
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time 
of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are not recognised on temporary differences 
and tax losses unless recovery is considered probable.
Finance leases
Finance leases are capitalised to reflect the borrowings incurred 
and the cost of the asset acquired. Such obligations are classified 
within borrowings. The finance cost portion of lease payments is 
expensed to earnings over the lease period. The leased asset is 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life 
of  the asset with regard to residual values.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value on 
transaction date, less directly attributable transaction costs and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Creditors
Trade creditors and other liabilities are stated at cost or estimated 
liability where accrued.
Annual leave
Annual leave is recognised on an accrual basis.
Long service leave
The liability for long service leave is recognised in the employee 
entitlements liability and is measured as the present value of 
expected future payments to be made in respect of services 
provided by employees. Consideration is given to expected 
future wage and salary levels, experience of employee turnover 
and periods of service.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the group has a current obligation 
and it is probable that an economic benefit will be required to 
settle it.
EQUITY
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ funds. Costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in shareholders’ funds as a reduction from the proceeds.
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they 
are declared.
Where a member of the group purchases the company’s share 
capital, the consideration paid is deducted from equity under the 
treasury stock method as if the shares are cancelled, until they are 
reissued or otherwise disposed of.
INCOME DETERMINATION
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised in accordance with the terms of sale when 
the benefits of ownership and risk of loss passes to the customer.
Construction contracts
Earnings on construction contracts (including sub-contracts) are 
determined using the percentage-of-completion method. Earnings 
are not recognised until the outcome can be reliably estimated. 
The company uses its professional judgement to assess both the 
physical completion and the forecast financial result of the 
contract. Provision is made for estimated future losses on the 
entire contract from the date it is first recognised that a contract 
loss may be incurred.
Investment revenue
Dividends and distributions are taken to earnings when received 
and are accrued where declared prior to balance date.
Significant items
Transactions are classified as significant items when they meet 
certain criteria approved by the group’s audit and risk committee. 
Significant items are determined in accordance with the principles 
of consistency, relevance and clarity. Transactions considered for 
classification as significant items include: acquisition and disposal 
costs, impairment or reversal of impairment of assets, business 
integration and transactions or events outside of the group’s ongoing 
operations that have a significant impact on reported profit.
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation 
of definite lived intangible assets are calculated on the straight-line 
method. Expected useful lives, which are regularly reviewed on a 
weighted average basis are:
Buildings  
Plant and machinery  
Fixtures and equipment  
Leased assets capitalised 
Intangible assets
30 years
13 years
5 years
10 years
5 to 10 years
Leasing commitments
Expenditure arising from operating leasing commitments is written 
off to earnings in the period in which it is incurred.
66  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Statement of accounting policies
Funding costs
Net funding costs comprise interest expense, interest income, 
amortisation of prepaid expenses and gains/losses on certain 
financial instruments that are recognised in earnings.
Retirement plan expense
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognised in earnings as incurred. The actuarial cost of providing 
benefits under defined benefit plans is expensed as it accrues 
over the service life of the employees, after taking account of the 
income expected to be earned by the assets owned by the plans.
All retirement plan related actuarial gains or losses are recognised 
in other comprehensive income in the pension reserve in the year 
in which they arise.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in earnings as 
incurred. Significant development expenditure is recognised as 
an asset if certain criteria, relating to technical feasibility and future 
economic benefits, are met. All other development expenditure is 
recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Executive share scheme
The group has a long-term share-based performance incentive 
scheme targeted at certain group executives most able to 
influence the results of the group.
The executive long-term share scheme introduced in 2008 allows 
group executives to acquire shares in the company at market price, 
funded by an interest-free loan from the group. The executives are 
entitled to vote on the shares and to receive cash dividends, the 
proceeds of which are used to reduce the loan. The shares are 
held in trust for the executives by the Trustee, Fletcher Building 
Share Schemes Limited. Payment of half of any entitlement under 
the executive long-term share scheme is dependent upon the 
group’s total shareholder return exceeding the 51st percentile of 
the total shareholder return of a comparative group of companies 
over a three-year restricted period.
Payment of the other half of any entitlement is dependent 
upon the group achieving an earnings per share target. 
Additionally, in respect of the entitlement that is dependent 
on total shareholders’ return, the three-year restrictive period is 
automatically extended for up to one year if total shareholders’ 
return is less than the 51st percentile. Executives can elect to 
extend the restrictive period for up to one year if total shareholders 
return is between the 51st and 75th percentile. No extension is 
permitted for the entitlement that is dependent upon achieving an 
earnings per share target.
At the end of the restrictive period or any extension, the group 
will pay a bonus to the executives to the extent that performance 
targets have been met, the after-tax amount of which will be 
generally sufficient for the executives to repay the balance of the 
loan in respect of the shares that are to be transferred. Due to the 
integrated nature of the scheme, for accounting purposes the 
group accounts for the incentive scheme as being equity-settled.
If the performance obligations are not met or are only partially 
met, the trustee will acquire the beneficial interest in some or all 
of the shares. The loan provided in respect of those shares which 
do not transfer to the executives (the forfeited shares) will be 
novated to the Trustee and will be fully repaid by the transfer of 
the forfeited shares.
The group will recognise an expense in earnings, with a 
corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve, 
over the restrictive period. If the performance targets based on 
total shareholder return are not met and the shares do not transfer 
to the executives, the amount in the share-based payments 
reserve will remain in equity and will not be released to earnings. 
If the performance targets based on earnings per share are not 
met and the shares do not transfer, the amount in the share-based 
payments reserve will be released to earnings.
The group accounts for the share schemes under the treasury 
stock method. The receivable owing from the executives, 
representing the shares held in the company, is deducted from 
the group’s paid up capital. The shares are deducted from equity 
until the end of the restrictive period, at which point they transfer 
to the executive or novate to the Trustee.
Employee share purchase scheme – FBuShare
The global employee share purchase scheme, FBuShare, allows 
eligible group employees to regularly save up to NZ$5,000 per 
annum of their after-tax pay and purchase shares in the company 
(purchased shares) at market prices. At the end of rolling three-
year qualification periods, and provided they remain employed 
by a group company, employees will be awarded one free award 
share for every two purchased shares acquired in the first year of 
each three-year qualification period and still held at the end of 
those periods.
Dividends payable will be re-invested in additional shares. 
Employees will receive award shares on any additional shares, 
subject to the same conditions set out above. The employees are 
responsible for any income tax liability payable on dividends and 
on the value of any award shares.
At the end of each three-year qualification period, employees may 
continue to hold any purchased, additional and award shares or 
they may sell some or all of the shares.
The group accrues the liability to pay for award shares over the 
three-year qualification periods.

Notes to the financial statements
1  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following sets out the new accounting standards and amendments to standards that were applicable to the group from 1 July 2015.
No new standards have been adopted in the year to 30 June 2016, however, certain comparatives have been restated to conform with 
the current year’s presentation.
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and the 
External Reporting Board in New Zealand that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the group. Those which may be 
relevant to the group are set out below:
NZ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. 
It will eventually replace NZ IAS 39 Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement and is required to be adopted by the group in 
the financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2019.
NZ IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, was issued on 3 July 2014 and addresses recognition and measurement of 
revenue. It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts currently included in IAS 11 Construction 
Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. It is required to be adopted by the group in the financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2019.
NZ IFRS 16 Leases, was issued on 11 February 2016 and requires all leases to be recognised on the balance sheet. Currently, under 
IAS 17 Leases only those leases categorised as finance leases are required to be recognised on the balance sheet. NZ IFRS 16 is 
required to be adopted by the group in the financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2020.
The group has not applied these new standards in preparing these financial statements and has commenced an exercise to assess the 
impact on the group’s results.

1  On 18 August 2015, the group entered into an agreement to sell the operations of Rocla Quarry Products to Hanson Construction
Materials Pty Limited. The transaction, which had been subject to ACCC clearance, completed on 29 January 2016.
The aggregate consideration received for the entire Rocla Quarry Products business was $212 million and $205 million after
transaction costs. The gain on sale after tax amounted to $80 million.
On 2 February 2016, the group entered into an agreement to acquire the New Zealand road construction and maintenance business 
Higgins Group Holdings Limited (‘Higgins’) and other related assets, together with Higgins’ Fiji contracting business. At 30 June 2016, 
the transaction remained conditional on regulatory approval and accordingly the acquisition is not accounted for in the year ended 
30 June 2016. During July 2016 all relevant approvals had been obtained and the transaction completed on 29 July 2016. Total 
consideration payable is $303 million, subject to customary completion adjustments.
During the year ended 30 June 2016, expenses associated with the transaction were incurred amounting to $5 million.
On 17 February 2016, the group entered into an agreement to create a 50-50 joint venture between its Fletcher Aluminium windows
and doors business and Nalco, the new entity being ‘Fanalco Limited’. The transaction completed on 30 June 2016. As a result a 
$5 million gain before tax arises on divestment of the Fletcher Aluminium business to the joint venture.
2  The group has recognised a charge of $16 million for costs associated with closing a number of sites:
•  $2 million relating to the closure of two sites in Iplex Australia in July 2015; 
•  $9 million relating to the closure of Rocla Products operations in Western Australia and the Atlantic Civil business;
•  $4 million relating to the closure of a Formica Europe plant in Spain; and
•  $1 million relating to the closure of a Dimond site in Palmerston North.
3  A strategic review of the Formica India manufacturing business was completed during the year ended 30 June 2016. The review
identified that medium-term earnings prospects had deteriorated and the group has recorded an impairment expense of $26 million, 
comprising write offs of goodwill, plant and equipment and working capital to estimated recoverable values.
71  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
4  The group has incurred costs during the year investigating and resolving certain payroll system issues in the group related to the
calculation of bereavement leave, alternative holidays, public holidays and sick leave (together, ‘BAPS leave’). Complexities in applying 
the New Zealand Holidays Act 2003 to calculations of BAPS leave led to net underpayments over several years in a small number of the 
group’s businesses. The group has conducted a thorough review of payroll systems to investigate, calculate and verify the previous net 
underpayment. Payments have subsequently been made to affected employees, or, where not possible to be made by 30 June 2016, 
have been accrued. The total expense recorded is $6 million, which includes back-payments to affected employees and the costs of 
investigating and resolving the payroll system issues.

The diluted net earnings per share calculation uses the weighted average number of shares as determined for basic net earnings per 
share, adjusted for dilutive securities. Capital notes and options are convertible into the company’s shares and may therefore result in 
dilutive securities for purposes of determining the diluted net earnings per share. Fletcher Building may, at its option, purchase or redeem 
the capital notes for cash at the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest.

Cash and deposits include the group’s share of amounts held by joint operations of $16 million (2015: $25 million).
At 30 June 2016, approximately $35 million (2015: $40 million) of total cash and deposits were held in subsidiaries that operate in 
countries where exchange controls and other legal restrictions apply and are therefore not immediately available for general use by 
the group.

Goodwill impairment review
Goodwill was tested for impairment in June 2016. Each CGU that carries goodwill is valued on a value in use or fair value less costs of 
disposal basis using a discounted cash flow. Management has used its past experience of sales growth, operating costs and margin, and 
external sources of information where appropriate, to determine its expectations for the future. These cash flow projections are principally 
based on the group’s three-year strategic plan approved by the directors, which has been extended for a further two years. Cash flows 
beyond five years have been extrapolated using estimated terminal growth rates, which do not exceed the long-term average growth rate 
for the industries and countries in which the business units operate. The terminal growth rates used range from 2.5%-3% (2015: 2.5%-
3%), with the majority of the business units using 2.5% (2015: 2.5%).
The cash flows are discounted using a nominal rate after tax of 9.5% (2015: 9.5%) for New Zealand, 8.5% (2015: 8.5%) for Australia, 7.0% 
(2015: 8.0%) for Europe, 8.0% (2015: 8.0%) for North America and 9.0% (2014: 9.0%) for Asia, reflecting the risk profile for the regions in 
which the CGUs operate. The valuation models used are most sensitive to changes in the terminal year earnings and cash flows.
A strategic review of the Formica India manufacturing business was completed during the year ended 30 June 2016. The review 
identified that medium-term earnings prospects had deteriorated and the group has fully impaired the goodwill balance ($3 million), 
along with adjustments to property, plant and equipment and working capital balances.
Sensitivity to reasonable possible changes in assumptions
The impairment assessment confirmed that, for all other business units, the recoverable amounts exceed carrying values as at 30 June 2016. 
With the exception of Iplex Australia, Formica Europe, Formica Asia and Tradelink, management considers that no reasonably possible 
change in assumptions would cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.
For Iplex Australia, which has goodwill of $33 million and brands of $36 million, a 39% decrease in the expected level of terminal EBIT or 
a 3% increase in the post-tax discount rate would result in the elimination of the $163 million excess of recoverable amount over carrying 
amount. For Formica Asia, which has goodwill of $256 million and brands of $nil, a reduction of 11% in the expected level of terminal 
EBIT, a 0.6% increase in the post-tax discount rate or a 0.7% decrease in terminal growth rate would result in the elimination of the 
$46 million excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount. For Tradelink, which has goodwill of $196 million and brands of 
$50 million, a reduction in expected terminal year EBIT of 23% or an increase in the post-tax discount rate of 1.9%, would result in the 
elimination of the $118 million excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount. For Formica Europe, which has goodwill of 
$83 million and brands of $13 million, a 35% decrease in the expected level of terminal EBIT or a 2% increase in the post-tax discount 
rate, would result in the elimination of the $158 million excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount.

Brands are considered to have an indefinite useful life as there are no factors that indicate that there is a limit on their capacity to generate 
foreseeable cash flows. Factors considered before arriving at this conclusion are whether the businesses that own the brands are going 
concerns, whether there is any evidence of obsolescence due to changes in either technology or regulatory conditions, whether the 
businesses are trading profitably and whether there are any other market-based indications.
Brands have been tested for impairment in June 2016. Each CGU that carries a brand value, and determined to be not separately 
identifiable, has prepared a discounted cash flow of the CGU on a value in use or fair value less costs of disposal basis as described in 
note 16. The impairment review confirmed that, for all intangible assets (excluding goodwill for which impairments are disclosed in note 
16), the recoverable amounts exceed carrying values as at 30 June 2016.
Sensitivity analysis was performed on the key assumptions used in the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal calculations and 
further disclosure has been made for certain CGUs in note 16.

will have future assessable income. The tax losses have been recognised on the basis of the forecast earnings before interest and taxation 
set out in the companies’ strategic plans. The group reviews future loss utilisations annually.
The group has unrecognised tax losses in France, Spain, Sweden, UK, India and China of $116 million representing $419 million of gross

Negative pledge 
The group borrows certain funds based on a negative pledge arrangement. The negative pledge includes a cross guarantee between 
a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries and ensures that external senior indebtedness ranks equally in all respects and includes the 
covenant that security can be given only in very limited circumstances. At 30 June 2016 the group had debt subject to the negative 
pledge of $1,163 million (June 2015: $1,418 million).
Bank loans
At 30 June 2016 the group had a syndicated revolving credit facility on an unsecured, negative pledge and borrowing covenant basis 
with ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, The Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Bank of New Zealand, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Citibank 
N.A., The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and Westpac New Zealand Limited. The funds under this facility can be 
borrowed in United States, Australian and New Zealand dollars. The borrowing covenants relate to net debt to EBITDA and interest cover 
and at 30 June 2016, and throughout the year, the group was in compliance with the covenants.
Private placements 
The group has borrowed funds from private investors (primarily US & Japanese based) on an unsecured, negative pledge and borrowing 
covenant basis. These borrowings comprise AU$231 million, US$525 million and YEN10,000 million with maturities between 2016 and 
2027. The borrowing covenants relate to net debt to EBITDA and interest cover and at 30 June 2016, and throughout the year, the group 
was in compliance with the covenants.
On 20 July 2016, the group had completed further borrowing from US debt investors through a private placement. The private placement 
has maturities between 2026 and 2028. The borrowing comprised US$251 million, €41 million, GBP10 million and CAD15 million. The 
borrowings are on an unsecured, negative pledge and borrowing covenant basis. The proceeds from the private placement will be used 
to repay the maturing private placement in September 2016 and to part fund the Higgins acquisition. The group had a commitment from 
Westpac New Zealand Limited to provide a short-term funding facility of NZ$325 million in support of this borrowing activity and this 
commitment has now ceased.
83  Fletcher Building Annual Report 2016
Other loans
At 30 June 2016 the group had $1 million (June 2015: $22 million) of loans which are secured against the subsidiaries’ own balance 
sheet, or against specific assets, and had unsecured loans at 30 June 2016 of $80 million (June 2015: $95 million) some of which were 
subject to the negative pledge. Other loans include bank overdrafts, short-term loans, working capital facilities, financial leases, 
amortising loans and discounted receivables.
Capital notes
Capital notes are long-term fixed rate unsecured subordinated debt instruments. On each election date the coupon rate and term to the 
next election date of that series of the capital notes are reset. Holders may then choose either to keep their capital notes on the new 
terms or to convert the principal amount and any interest into shares, at approximately 98% of the current market price. Instead of issuing 
shares to holders who choose to convert, Fletcher Building may, at its option, purchase or redeem the capital notes for cash at the 
principal amount plus any interest.
Under the terms of the capital notes non-payment of interest is not an act of default although unpaid interest is accrued and is interest 
bearing at the same rate as the principal of the capital notes. Fletcher Building Limited has covenanted not to pay dividends to its 
shareholders while interest due and payable on these capital notes has not been paid.
The capital notes do not carry voting rights and do not participate in any change in value of the issued shares of Fletcher Building Limited. 
If the principal amount of the capital notes held at 30 June 2016 were to be converted to Fletcher Building shares, 45 million (June 2015: 
48 million) would be issued at the share price as at 30 June 2016 of $8.58 (June 2015: $8.12).
As at 30 June 2016, the group held $116 million (30 June 2015: $142 million) of its own capital notes.
Fair value adjustment included in borrowings 
This is the revaluation of certain borrowings that have been designated in fair value hedge relationships for changes in benchmark 
interest rates.
Credit rating
The company has not sought and does not hold a credit rating from an accredited rating agency.
25  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial risk management overview
Exposures to credit, liquidity, currency, interest rate and commodity price risks arise in the normal course of the group’s business. 
The principles under which these risks are managed are set out in policy documents approved under board delegated authority by the 
CEO. The policy documents identify the risks and set out the group’s objectives, policies and processes to measure, manage and report 
the risks. The policies are reviewed periodically to reflect changes in financial markets and the group’s businesses. Risk management is 
carried out in conjunction with the group’s central treasury function, which ensures compliance with the risk management policies and 
procedures set by the board.
The group enters into derivative financial instruments to assist in the management of the identified financial risks. The group does not 
enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative transactions entered into are to hedge 
underlying exposures arising from normal business activities.
Risks and mitigation
(a) Credit risk
To the extent the group has a receivable from another party, there is a credit risk in the event of non-performance by that counterparty 
and arises principally from receivables from customers, derivative financial instruments and the investment of cash.
(i) Trade receivables 
The group has a credit policy in place under which customers are individually analysed for credit worthiness and assigned a purchase 
limit. If no external ratings are available, the group reviews the customers’ financial statements, trade references, bankers’ references 
and/or credit agencies’ reports to assess credit worthiness. These limits are reviewed on a regular basis. Due to the group’s industry and 
geographical spread at balance date there were no significant concentrations of credit risks in respect of trade receivables. Refer to note 
13 for debtor ageing analysis.
Most goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the group may have a secured claim. Credit 
risks may be further mitigated by registering an interest in the goods sold and the proceeds arising from that supply. The group does not 
otherwise require collateral in respect of trade receivables.
(ii) Derivative financial instruments and the investment of cash
The group enters into derivative financial instruments and invests cash with various counterparties in accordance with established limits 
as to credit rating and dollar value but does not require collateral or other security except in limited circumstances. In accordance with 
the established counterparty restrictions, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk in respect of the financial instruments and 
no loss is expected.
The group has not renegotiated the terms of any financial assets that would otherwise be overdue or impaired. The carrying amount of 
non-derivative financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The carrying amount of derivative financial assets are at their 
current fair value.

Notes to the financial statements
25  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued
(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial commitments as they fall due. The group manages 
its liquidity risk by maintaining a target level of undrawn committed credit facilities and a spread of the maturity dates of the group’s debt 
facilities. The group reviews its liquidity requirements on an ongoing basis.
The following maturity analysis table sets out the remaining contractual undiscounted cash flows, including estimated interest payments 
for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments. Creditors and accruals are excluded from this analysis as they 
are not part of the group’s assessment of liquidity risk because these are offset by debtors with similar payment terms.

(c) Foreign currency risk
(i) Currency translation risk
Currency translation risk arises from net investments in foreign operations. It is the group’s policy to hedge this foreign currency translation 
risk by borrowing in the currency of the asset in proportion to the group’s long-term debt to debt plus equity ratio. This reduces the 
variability in the debt to debt plus equity ratio due to currency translation. Where the underlying debt in any currency does not equate to 
the required proportion of total debt, debt derivatives, such as foreign exchange forwards, swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps 
are entered into for up to 12 years. Net investment, cash flow and fair value hedge accounting is applied to these instruments.
In addition, the group has entered into foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the taxation exposure arising from the translation of certain 
assets for a period of up to two years. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to these instruments.
The group’s exposure to foreign currency risk on foreign currency borrowings after hedging is summarised as follows:

(ii) Currency transaction risk
Currency transaction risk arises from committed or highly probable trade and capital expenditure transactions that are denominated in 
currencies other than the operation’s functional currency. The objective in managing this risk is to reduce the variability from changes in 
currency exchange rates on the operation’s income and cash flow to acceptable parameters. It is group policy that no currency exchange 
risk may be entered into or allowed to remain outstanding should it arise on committed transactions. In addition, the group hedges some 
highly probable forecast transactions for up to five years. When exposures are incurred by operations in currencies other than their 
functional currency, foreign exchange forwards and swaps are entered into to eliminate the exposure. The majority of these transactions 
have maturities of less than one year. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to forecast transactions. The main currencies hedged are 
the Australian dollar, the United States dollar, the Japanese yen, the Euro and the British pound. The gross value of these foreign exchange 
derivatives at 30 June 2016 was $744 million (June 2015: $543 million).
(d) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument, will change due to 
changes in market interest rates and arises primarily from the group’s interest-bearing borrowings. The group manages the fixed interest 
rate component of its debt and capital notes obligations and aims to maintain this ratio between 40-70% and at 30 June 2016 the group 
was within the range at 61% fixed (June 2015: 56% fixed). The position in this range is managed depending upon underlying interest rate 
exposures and economic conditions. Cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, forward-rate agreements and options are 
entered into to manage this position. The financial instruments entered into are in Australian dollars, United States dollars, Euros, Japanese 
Yen and New Zealand dollars and will mature over the next 12 years.
Hedge accounting is applied on these instruments for floating-to-fixed instruments as cash flow hedges or for fixed-to-floating 
instruments as fair value hedges.

(e) Commodity price risk
Commodity price risk arises from committed or highly probable trade and capital expenditure transactions that are linked to traded 
commodities. Where possible the group manages its commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and, for certain 
commodities, by using commodity price swaps and options. The group manages its commodity price risk depending on the underlying 
exposures, economic conditions and access to active derivatives markets. Currently, the group’s guideline is to hedge up to 50% of 
certain New Zealand business units’ electricity requirements for up to 12 months. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to commodity 
derivative contracts.
At balance date, the notional value of fixed electricity exposure was less than $1 million, as follows:

(f) Sensitivity analysis
The numbers in the sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk have not been adjusted for tax 
and are based only on the group’s financial instruments held at balance date and assumes that all other variables remain constant, except 
for the change in the chosen risk variable.
(i) Foreign currency risk
It is estimated a 10% weakening of the New Zealand dollar against the major foreign currencies the group is exposed to on the net assets of 
its foreign operations would result in an increase to equity of approximately $220 million (June 2015: $250 million) and no material impact 
on earnings.
(ii) Interest rate risk
It is estimated a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the group’s interest costs in a year by approximately 
$6.2 million on the group’s debt portfolio exposed to floating rates at balance date (June 2015: $8.3 million).
(iii) Commodity price risk
It is estimated a 10% increase in the New Zealand electricity spot price at balance date would not materially impact the group’s earnings 
or equity position.

Fair value measurement
All of the group’s derivatives are in designated hedge relationships and are measured and recognised at fair value. All derivatives are 
level 2 valuations based on accepted valuation methodologies. Forward exchange fair value is calculated using quoted forward exchange 
rates and discounted using yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturity of the contract. The fair value of electricity 
price swaps is measured using a derived forward curve and discounted using yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching 
the maturity of the contract. Interest rate derivatives are calculated by discounting the future principal and interest cash flows at current 
market interest rates that are available for similar financial instruments.
(Level 1) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
(Level 2) Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) other than quoted 
prices included within level 1.
(Level 3) Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Fair value disclosures
The fair values of borrowings used for disclosure are measured under level 2 by discounting future principal and interest cash flows at the 
current market interest rate plus an estimated credit margin that is available for similar financial instruments with a similar credit profile to 
the group.
The interest rates across all currencies used to discount future principal and interest cash flows are between 1.42% and 8.79% (June 2015: 
1.49% and 9.05%) including margins, for both accounting and disclosure purposes.
(h) Capital risk management
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The group monitors capital on the basis of net debt to net debt plus equity and the target gearing range is 30-40%. A target leverage 
range has been introduced that reflects the ratio of debt to cash flow. Expressed as a ratio of net debt to EBITDA, the target range is 
2.0-2.5 times. It is intended that the group will not be materially outside the target gearing and leverage ranges on a long-term basis.

Fletcher Building Limited is the principal sponsoring company of a plan that provides retirement and other benefits to employees of the 
group in New Zealand. Participation in this plan has been closed for a number of years, although defined contribution savings plans have 
been made available. Various defined benefit and defined contribution plans exist in Australia following the acquisition of Crane, Amatek, 
Tasman Building Products and the Laminex groups, which companies contribute to on behalf of their employees. Various defined benefit 
plans and medical plans exist in other countries as a result of the acquisition of the Formica group, which companies contribute to on 
behalf of their employees. Where the plans have a deficit in their funded status, the companies are making additional contributions, as 
recommended by the trustees of the plans, to improve the funded status.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligations are based on years of service and the employee’s compensation during their years of 
employment. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be 
earned in the future. These obligations are accounted for in accordance with NZ IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which has the effect of 
recognising the volatility in the returns earned by the plans in the pension reserve.
Fletcher Building Limited has an obligation to ensure that the funding ratio of the New Zealand plan’s assets is at least 115% of the plan’s 
actuarial liability. This is based upon any two consecutive annual actuarial valuations as calculated by the plan’s actuary. This calculation is 
done on the plan’s funding basis, which differs from the calculation under NZ IAS 19. At 31 March 2016 the value of the assets was 140% 
of the actuarial liability and the funded surplus was $78 million (31 March 2015: 137%, $77 million).
During the year the group contributed $1 million (2015: $3 million) in respect of its Australian defined benefit plans and $21 million (2015: 
$22 million) in respect of its Formica defined benefit and medical plans. It contributed $48 million (2015: $43 million) in respect of its 
defined contribution plans worldwide, including KiwiSaver.

Share options
On 1 October 2012 the company issued 500,000 options under the executive option scheme. At 30 June 2016 the exercise price of 
these share options was $7.08. The restrictive period ended on 1 October 2015 and the final exercise date is 1 October 2018.
On 1 October 2015 the company issued a further 500,000 options under the executive option scheme. At 30 June 2016 the exercise 
price of these share options was $7.15. The restrictive period ends on 1 October 2018 and the final exercise date is 1 October 2021.
The options carry no dividend or voting rights. The company has calculated the fair value of granting these options and has expensed 
$0.1 million during the year in respect of the 2015 options to a share-based payments reserve.
500,000 share options issued by the company on 1 September 2009 lapsed on their final exercise date of 1 September 2015.

Remuneration report
The company seeks to ensure that it 
remunerates management and directors 
fairly and responsibly. Remuneration 
policies are designed to attract, retain and 
motivate talented executives and senior 
management as a way of enhancing the 
performance of the company and aligning 
their interests with the creation of value 
for shareholders.
EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION
The company’s remuneration strategy aims to attract, retain and 
motivate high calibre employees at all levels of the organisation, 
and so drive performance and sustained growth in shareholder 
value. The company’s remuneration committee is kept appraised 
of relevant market information and best practice, obtaining advice 
from external advisors when necessary. Remuneration levels are 
reviewed annually for market competitiveness and alignment with 
strategic and performance priorities.
The remuneration committee engaged PwC to provide remuneration 
benchmark data for the chief executive officer and other executive 
committee roles during the year. The peer group consisted of 
New Zealand and Australian listed companies of comparable size, 
complexity and industry to Fletcher Building. An additional global 
peer group was considered in respect of the chief executive 
officer role, which included comparable companies from other 
regions where Fletcher Building has operations.
Total remuneration for executives and senior management 
comprises:
•
fixed remuneration, including the value of base remuneration 
and any other benefits;
•  a short-term variable incentive in the form of an annual
performance-related cash bonus; and
•  participation in the Executive Long-Term Share Scheme or
Executive Long-Term Incentive Scheme.
For the purposes of determining total remuneration within the 
executive and senior management group, it is assumed that 
executives and senior management will, on average, achieve their 
target short-term incentive and 75% of their long-term potential 
incentives over time, such percentages to be reassessed 
periodically in the light of the actual earnings achieved over 
the business cycle.
Fixed remuneration
It is the company’s policy to pay fixed remuneration comparable to 
the median, but total remuneration comparable to the upper 
quartile for equivalent roles in the country or region in which the 
employee is located. The New Zealand and Australian peer group 
data compiled by PwC was used for this comparison for 
executives based in New Zealand and Australia.
Participation in retirement savings plans is made available 
to employees as required by remuneration practices in 
relevant jurisdictions.
Short-term variable incentive 
Short-term variable incentives (STI) are designed to incentivise 
growth in earnings and operating cash by rewarding employees’ 
performance against financial and personal objectives. Short-term 
variable incentive targets are expressed as a percentage of base 
remuneration. Participation in the plan is by annual invitation at 
the discretion of the company, at which time financial targets and 
personal objectives are established.
Financial component: For executives and corporate senior 
management, the financial target is based on the group or division 
EBIT and operating cash, as applicable. For operating senior 
management, the financial target is based on the EBIT and funds 
employed for the applicable business unit. The financial targets 
allow normalisation adjustments as agreed by the remuneration 
committee in advance for acquisitions, divestments and 
significant items, such as impairments. Financial targets are set 
at three levels; a threshold level, which must be met before any 
STI is paid, a target level and a maximum level, above which 
the STI paid will remain constant. For FY16, the financial threshold 
is set at achieving 90% of target. The maximum financial level 
is set at achieving 110% of target for the chief executive officer, 
executives and corporate senior management and 120% of 
target for operating senior management. Achievement of the 
maximum financial level results in a payment of 150% of the 
financial component of STI for all executives and senior 
management.
Personal component: Personal objectives comprise several 
challenging, measurable personal objectives. Objectives are 
aligned to, and support, the company strategy and are cascaded 
through the management team according to role. Mark Adamson’s 
objectives include employee engagement and customer measures 
and are approved directly by the chairman. Payment for the personal 
component is calculated by reference to the individual performance 
against the personal objectives for the financial year. Maximum 
uplift for the chief executive officer personal component is set at 
150% and 100% for all other executives. If the threshold financial 
level of the EBIT related measure is not met, no personal 
component of the STI will be payable.

The board has the discretion to require repayment of an 
employee’s STI for a period of up to three years where the 
company’s reported financial statements are subsequently 
restated or there is misconduct that causes a financial trading 
loss that has not been taken into account in the STI calculations.
Senior executives are contractually required to build and maintain 
share ownership of 50% of base remuneration or other percentage 
as notified by the company from time to time (Refer to ‘Holding 
the Company’s Securities’).
Executive Long-Term Share Scheme and Executive Long-Term 
Incentive Scheme
Long-term performance incentives are designed to align employee 
remuneration with financial outcomes for shareholders over 
the longer term. The company has implemented an Executive 
Long-Term Share Scheme (ELSS), targeted at the employees 
most able to influence financial results. In circumstances where 
shares cannot be acquired under applicable securities legislation 
in certain jurisdictions, equivalent economic entitlements are 
conveyed by way of cash bonus entitlements under an Executive 
Long-Term Incentive Scheme (ELIS). Participation in any year is by 
annual invitation at the discretion of the company.
The board made an additional grant of shares under the ELSS to 
the executive team and some members of senior management 
during FY16. This additional grant is designed to incentivise 
management to deliver on targets set for the Accelerate 
programme referred to in the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer’s Report.
Under the ELSS, participants purchase shares in the company 
at the offer price with an interest-free loan. The offer price is 
established at market value at the time of offer. The shares are 
held by a trustee on behalf of participants until the end of a 
restrictive period. Provided certain performance criteria are met 
and participants remain employed with the company throughout 
the restrictive period, a cash bonus is paid to meet the repayment 
of the interest-free loan, and legal title in the shares is then 
transferred to the participants. To the extent that the performance 
criteria are not met or the participant ceases to be employed by 
the company, the shares will be forfeited and proceeds used to 
repay the interest-free loan.
The performance criteria under the ELSS and ELIS are split into 
two components as follows:
•  Total shareholder return (TSR) – 50% of shares
The TSR of the group for the period is compared with the 
average consolidated TSR for the same period of a comparator 
group to derive a percentile ranking. The 2015 offer is for the 
period 1 October 2015 – 30 September 2018, which may be 
extended for up to one more year until 30 September 2019. 
The  comparator group used for the 2015 offer comprises 
Adelaide Brighton, Amcor, BlueScope, Boral, Brickworks, 
CSR, Downer EDI, GWA International, James Hardie, Leighton 
Holdings, Nuplex, Reece, Sims Group, Spark and Steel & Tube. 
The entitlement to the TSR tranche is determined as follows:
TSR percentile
< 51st
51st
between 51st – 75th
> 75th
Percentage entitlement %
nil
50
50 – 100 linear pro-rata
100
•  Earnings per share (EPS) – 50% of shares
An EPS target for the year ended 30 June 2018 is set based 
on a required increase from the year ended 30 June 2015. 
The EPS for the year ended 30 June 2015, adjusted for 
significant items, was 58.0 cents and is required to increase 
by a minimum of 5% per annum before any of the EPS tranche 
will vest. The EPS tranche will fully vest if the EPS increases by 
8% or more per annum. The entitlement to the EPS tranche is 
determined as follows:
EPS for year ended 30 June 2018¹
< 67.0 cents
67.0 cents per share
between 67.1 – 73.1 cents per share

FBuShare
FBuShare is a broad-based employee share plan that promotes 
employee engagement and retention. Employees acquire shares in 
the company and, if they continue to be employed after a three 
year qualification period, they become entitled to receive one 
award share for every two shares purchased in the first year of the 
qualification period and still owned at the end of that period. 
FBuShare does not require any performance criteria to be met. 
FBuShare has a maximum contribution rate of NZ$5,000 per 
annum (or the equivalent currency in other countries). Employees 
in certain countries are invited to participate in the Phantom Plan, 
which replicates the benefits of FBuShare. The chief executive 
officer is not eligible to participate in FBuShare.

As an executive director, Mark Adamson did not receive any 
further remuneration in his capacity as director of Fletcher Building 
Industries Limited or other subsidiaries.
2012 Share Options Plan – chief executive officer
Shareholders approved the issue of up to 1,000,000 options to 
acquire ordinary shares in the company to Mark Adamson at the 
annual shareholders’ meeting on 20 November 2012, pursuant 
to NZX Listing Rule 7.3.1 and ASX Listing Rule 10.14. Each option 
is issued for no cash consideration. Mark Adamson is the only 
eligible recipient under the 2012 Share Options Plan.
An initial issue of 500,000 options was made with effect on 
1 October 2012 with an exercise price of $6.22, being the volume 
weighted average price of Fletcher Building shares sold on the 
NZSX in the five business days immediately preceding the 
announcement of Mark Adamson’s appointment on 18 June 2012. 
A further issue of 500,000 options was made with effect on 
1 October 2015 with an exercise price of $6.89, being the volume 
weighted average price of Fletcher Building shares sold on the 
NZSX in the five business days immediately preceding 
30 September 2015.
The exercise price is adjusted annually, with effect from the date of 
grant, by the company’s cost of capital, less any dividends actually 
paid. There is a restrictive period of three years from the date of 
grant during which the options may not be exercised. Subject to 
the company’s rules on the trading of securities, options may be 
exercised at any time between the third and sixth anniversary of 
the date of grant. As at 30 June 2016, no options had been exercised.

All non-executive directors were also paid a non-vouchable 
expense reimbursement allowance of $5,000 per annum. 
Where an ad hoc committee is convened, such as for due 
diligence, additional remuneration may be payable at $1,200 
per half day. However, no payments for ad hoc committees 
were made in the current year. Directors do not receive any 
further remuneration for also being directors of Fletcher 
Building Industries Limited, the NZX listed issuer of the 
group’s debt securities.
Director fees are reviewed annually in the last quarter of the 
calendar year. The company engaged PwC to benchmark 
directors’ fees against the director fees paid by a peer group 
consisting of New Zealand and Australian listed companies of 
comparable size, complexity and industry to Fletcher Building.
The maximum aggregate remuneration able to be provided to all 
non-executive directors was set at $2,000,000 at the 2011 annual 
shareholders’ meeting. The remuneration paid to non-executive 
directors in the year ended 30 June 2016 was as follows:

Non-executive directors do not participate in any company share 
or option plan. However, the Board Charter requires non-executive 
directors (or their associates) to hold at least 20,000 shares in the 
company to demonstrate their commitment and alignment with 
the company. This shareholding can be acquired at any time prior 
to the annual meeting of shareholders at which they are first 
subject to re-election. There are no schemes for retirement 
benefits for non-executive directors.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE
The company has arranged a programme of directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance covering directors, executives and employees 
acting on behalf of the company. Cover is for damages, 
judgments, fines, penalties, legal costs awarded and defence costs 
arising from wrongful acts committed whilst acting for the 
company. Actions not covered include dishonest, fraudulent or 
malicious acts or omissions, wilful breach of a statute, regulation 
or a duty to the company, improper use of information to the 
detriment of the company and breach of professional duty.
The insurance cover is supplemented by an indemnity from the 
company. However, the indemnity does not cover liabilities that 
cannot be indemnified under the Companies Act 1993 or other 
statutes, including liability arising from criminal acts or a failure to 
act in good faith and in the best interests of the company.
HOLDING THE COMPANY’S SECURITIES
A standard term in the executive and senior management 
employment contract is a requirement that, over time, executives 
and senior managers must acquire and maintain a holding in the 
company’s ordinary shares until such time as the greater of the 
sum invested or the market value of their shareholding exceeds 
50% of their base remuneration. In meeting this obligation, 
executives and senior managers may not sell any shares that vest 
under the ELSS, or any similar scheme, until the shareholding 
equals or exceeds the shareholding threshold. For executives or 
senior managers who are domiciled outside New Zealand or 
Australia, any net after-tax payments made under the ELIS, or any 
similar scheme, are to be used to acquire shares on or before 
31 March of the following financial year (i.e. 31 March immediately 
following the payment from the scheme) until the shareholding 
equals or exceeds the shareholding threshold. In addition, for 
members of the executive committee who are domiciled in 
New Zealand or Australia, if at the time of appointment to an 
executive role, the greater of the market value or cost of the 
individual shareholding is less than the value of 10% of nominal 
base remuneration, the executive is required to apply no less than 
25% of the after-tax value of any short-term incentive payment to 
acquire Fletcher Building Limited shares on or before 31 March of 
the following financial year (i.e. 31 March immediately following the 
short-term incentive payment). This requirement applies for the 
first two years of employment as an executive unless the 
shareholding equals or exceeds the shareholding threshold.
The company believes this shareholding strengthens the 
alignment of executives and senior management with the interests 
of shareholders and puts their own remuneration at risk to 
long-term company performance. Directors may, in any year at 
their discretion, ease the share investment percentage required in 
respect of any incentive payment arising in that year.
Shares issued to executives and senior management under the 
ELSS, but still subject to the restrictive period, do not count 
towards the required minimum shareholding. The company does, 
however, allow New Zealand-based executives or senior 
management to include an economic exposure to the shares 
through a defined contribution investment account in the Fletcher 
Building Retirement Plan, the value of which is calculated by 
reference to the Fletcher Building share price.
The company has a policy that prohibits entering into transactions 
in associated products that limit the economic risk of participating 
in unvested entitlements under equity-based remuneration 
schemes.
EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION
Section 211(1)(g) of the New Zealand Companies Act 1993 requires

Investor information
ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING
The annual shareholders’ meeting of Fletcher Building Limited will 
be held at The Great Hall, The Arts Centre, 2 Worcester Boulevard, 
Christchurch, at 10.30am on Tuesday 18 October 2016.
FINAL DIVIDEND INFORMATION
The company has declared a final dividend for the year of 20 cents 
per share payable on 12 October 2016. This is in addition to the 
interim dividend of 19 cents per share paid on 13 April 2016. The 
final dividend has imputation credits attached at a 28% tax rate. 
There are no Australian franking credits attached.
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
Fletcher Building shareholders (excluding those in jurisdictions 
where the issue of shares is not permitted by law) can participate 
in a Dividend Reinvestment Plan, under which they have the 
opportunity to reinvest their dividends in additional shares. To 
participate, please contact the share registry. The Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan will operate for the FY16 final dividend.
FURTHER INFORMATION ONLINE
Details on Fletcher Building, its governance policies and its 
operations for the year ended 30 June 2016 can be viewed on the 
Fletcher Building website at fbu.com. This website contains all 
announcements to NZX and ASX and financial presentations made 
by the company.
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS
The company is not required to send printed copies of the annual 
report and half year review to shareholders. Instead, Fletcher 
Building sends an annual snapshot, which is a summary of the 
company’s operational and financial activities for the year. 
Shareholders can view the annual report and half year review on 
the company’s website. In addition, shareholders have a right to 
receive a copy of these reports on request.
DIRECT CREDITING OF DIVIDENDS
To minimise the risk of fraud and misplacement of dividend 
cheques, shareholders are strongly recommended to have all 
payments made by way of direct credit to their nominated 
New Zealand or Australian bank account. This can be done by 
simply giving the share registry written notice.
SHARE REGISTRIES
Details of the company’s share registries are given in the Directory 
on the inside back cover of this report.
Shareholders with enquiries about share transactions, changes of 
address or dividend payments should contact the share registry in 
the country in which their shares are registered.

can be viewed and updated online: investorcentre.com/nz
