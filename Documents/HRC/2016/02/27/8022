many different forums. Although some fundamental aspects of the relationship are now 
firmly established, the Independent Expert explains that many issues related to the 
obligations that human rights law imposes regarding environmental protection need greater 
study and clarification. Therefore, the first priority of his mandate is to provide greater 
conceptual clarity to the application of human rights obligations related to the environment. 
He intends to take an evidence-based approach to determining the nature, scope and content 
of these obligations. To inform his work, the Independent Expert will actively consult and 
seek input from a wide spectrum of relevant stakeholders.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/10, adopted on 22 March 2012, the Human Rights Council 
decided to appoint an Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating 
to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, with a mandate to: <b> 
</b></p>
<p>(a) Study the human rights obligations, including non-discrimination obligations, 
relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment;  
</p>
<p>(b) Identify, promote and exchange views on best practices relating to the use of 
human rights obligations and commitments to inform, support and strengthen 
environmental policymaking, especially in the area of environmental protection, and, in that 
regard, to prepare a compendium of best practices;  
</p>
<p>(c) Make recommendations that could help with the realization of the 
Millennium Development Goals, especially Goal 7 (ensuring environmental sustainability);  
</p>
<p>(d) Take into account the results of the 2012 United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development and contribute a human rights perspective to follow-up processes; 
and  
</p>
<p>(e) Take into account a gender perspective by, inter alia, considering the 
particular situation of women and girls and identifying gender-specific discrimination and 
vulnerabilities. 
</p>
<p>2. Resolution 19/10 requests the Independent Expert to submit a report, including 
conclusions and recommendations, to the Council at its twenty-second session and to report 
annually thereafter. It also requests the Independent Expert to consult with and take account 
of the views of a wide range of stakeholders, including Governments, international bodies, 
national human rights institutions, civil society organizations, the private sector and 
academic institutions. Moreover, the resolution provides that the Independent Expert shall 
work in close coordination, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with other special 
procedures and subsidiary organs of the Human Rights Council, as well as other relevant 
United Nations bodies and human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>3. On 6 July 2012, the Council appointed Professor John H. Knox as the Independent 
Expert.1 His mandate formally began on 1 August 2012.  
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with the mandate, the Independent Expert has begun his work by 
conducting extensive consultations with States, international organizations, human rights 
bodies, environmental and human rights civil society organizations, legal experts, and other 
special procedures on the substance of the mandate and how best to carry it out. 
Consultations have been arranged in Geneva, Washington and Nairobi. Subject to the 
availability of voluntary contributions, the Independent Expert plans to convene additional 
multi-stakeholder consultations in the near future, including in Latin America and Asia. He 
also plans to employ other means of receiving views from stakeholders, including through 
surveys.  
</p>
<p>5. For assistance in the legal research required by the mandate, the Independent Expert 
intends to draw on pro bono research and advice from legal practitioners and scholars. He 
has received very helpful offers of such assistance and would welcome additional help from 
legal experts, in particular from developing countries.

<p>6. In his future reports, the Independent Expert will respond to each of the elements of 
the mandate in greater detail. This first report is intended only to place the mandate in a 
historical context, present some of the outstanding issues and describe the current and 
planned programme of activities. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The evolution of environmental rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. Environmental rights &#8211; that is, rights understood to be related to environmental 
protection &#8211; are late arrivals to the body of human rights law. The drafters of the seminal 
human rights instrument, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, did not include 
environmental rights. Nor, at the time, did the national constitutions to which the drafters 
looked for inspiration. The silence was understandable. Although humans have always 
known of our dependence on the environment, we were only beginning to realize how 
much damage our activities could cause to the environment and, as a result, to ourselves. 
Efforts to mitigate environmental degradation were then still in their infancy.  
</p>
<p>8. As scientific knowledge of the environment has grown over the succeeding decades, 
so has our awareness of the importance of safeguarding it. From the 1960s to the present, 
the modern environmental movement has transformed our relationship with the 
environment. Virtually every State in the world has enacted domestic laws aimed at 
reducing air and water pollution, regulating toxic substances and conserving natural 
resources, among other goals. At the international level, States have negotiated a vast 
number of agreements to address environmental challenges, including trade in endangered 
species, conservation of biological diversity, transportation and disposal of hazardous 
substances, marine pollution, depletion of the ozone layer and climate change. 
</p>
<p>9. In short, environmental concerns have moved from the periphery to the centre of 
human efforts to pursue economic and social development. Since the early 1990s, the 
international community has repeatedly emphasized that development must be sustainable 
and, in particular, must protect the environment on which present and future generations 
depend. In the words of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, adopted at 
the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, 
&#8220;in order to achieve sustainable development, environmental protection shall constitute an 
integral part of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from it&#8221; 
(principle 4). Goal 7 of the Millennium Development Goals is to ensure environmental 
sustainability, including by integrating principles of sustainable development into country 
policies and programmes, and reversing the loss of environmental resources.2 In June 2012, 
at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, States again renewed their 
commitment &#8220;to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally 
</p>
<p>sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations&#8221;.3  
</p>
<p>10. With the rise of a stronger environmental consciousness came calls for formal 
recognition of the importance of environmental protection to human well-being. These calls 
often sought expression in the language of human rights. This is unsurprising, even 
inevitable. Human rights are grounded in respect for fundamental human attributes such as 
dignity, equality and liberty. The realization of these attributes depends on an environment 
that allows them to flourish. At the same time, effective environmental protection often 
depends on the exercise of human rights that are vital to informed, transparent and 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Other targets include reducing biodiversity loss, halving the proportion of people without access to 
</p>
<p>safe drinking water and basic sanitation, and improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers.  
 3 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development resolution I &#8220;The future we want&#8221;, contained 
</p>
<p>in its report, A/CONF.216/16, para. 1, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288.  </p>


<p>responsive policymaking. Human rights and environmental protection are inherently 
interdependent. 
</p>
<p>11. The recognition of the close relationship between human rights and the environment 
has principally taken two forms: (a) adoption of an explicit new right to an environment 
characterized in terms such as healthy, safe, satisfactory or sustainable; and (b) heightened 
attention to the relationship to the environment of already recognized rights, such as rights 
to life and health.4  
</p>
<p><b> A. A right to a healthy environment 
</b></p>
<p>12. As the importance of environmental protection has become clearer, many countries 
have added explicit environmental rights to their constitutions. In 1976, Portugal became 
the first country to adopt a constitutional &#8220;right to a healthy and ecologically balanced 
</p>
<p>human environment&#8221;. Since then, more than 90 States have adopted similar rights in their 
national constitutions.5 About two thirds of the constitutional rights refer to health; 
alternative formulations include rights to a clean, safe, favourable or wholesome 
environment.6 Some States have included more detailed rights, such as rights to receive 
information and to participate in decision-making about environmental matters.  
</p>
<p>13. At the regional level, human rights agreements drafted after the 1970s have also 
included such rights. The 1981 African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights provides 
that &#8220;all peoples shall have the right to a general satisfactory environment favorable to their 
development&#8221; (art. 24) and the 1988 Additional Protocol to the American Convention on 
Human Rights states that &#8220;everyone shall have the right to live in a healthy environment&#8221; 
(art. 11, para. 1). In 2003, the African Union adopted the Protocol to the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, which states that women 
&#8220;shall have the right to live in a healthy and sustainable environment&#8221; (art. 18) and &#8220;the 
right to fully enjoy their right to sustainable development&#8221; (art. 19). The 2004 Arab Charter 
on Human Rights includes a right to a healthy environment as part of the right to an 
adequate standard of living that ensures well-being and a decent life (art. 38). Similarly, the 
Human Rights Declaration adopted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 
November 2012 incorporates a &#8220;right to a safe, clean and sustainable environment&#8221; as an 
</p>
<p>element of the right to an adequate standard of living (para. 28 (f)). Although the European 
human rights system does not include an explicit right to a healthy environment, the 1998 
Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access 
to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention), drafted under the auspices of the 
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, refers to &#8220;the right of<b> </b>every person of 
</p>
<p>  
 4 A great deal of scholarship has addressed human rights and the environment. Good overviews are 
</p>
<p>provided by the analytical study prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), A/HRC/19/34 and Corr.1, which the Council noted with appreciation in 
Resolution 19/10, and a joint report prepared by OHCHR and the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP) for the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled 
&#8220;Human Rights and the Environment: Rio+20&#8221;. A detailed survey of the entire field is <i>Environmental 
</i></p>
<p><i>Protection and Human Rights</i>, by Donald K. Anton and Dinah L. Shelton (Cambridge University 
Press, 2011).

Human Rights, and the Environment</i> (Vancouver, Toronto, UBC Press, 2012). <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 6 For the remainder of this report, the phrase &#8220;right to a healthy environment&#8221; includes the various 
alternative formulations of such a right. </p>


<p>present and future generations to live in an environment adequate to his or her health and 
well-being&#8221; (art. 1).7 
</p>
<p>14. In contrast to these developments at the national and regional levels, no global 
agreement sets out an explicit right to a healthy (or satisfactory, safe or sustainable) 
environment.8 Were the Universal Declaration to be drafted today, it is easy to imagine that 
it would include a right recognized in so many national constitutions and regional 
agreements. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that the United Nations has not 
taken advantage of subsequent opportunities to recognize a human right to a healthy 
environment. The instrument that comes the closest may be the 1972 Declaration of the 
United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm Declaration), whose 
principle 1 states that: &#8220;man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate 
conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-
being, and he bears a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for 
present and future generations&#8221;. The 1987 report of the World Commission on Environment 
and Development (A/42/427), which brought forward the concept of sustainable 
development, included legal principles drafted by an experts group, the first of which 
declared, &#8220;all human beings have the fundamental right to an environment adequate for 
their health and well-being&#8221;.9 Rather than adopt this language, however, the 1992 Rio 
Declaration states: &#8220;Human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature&#8221; 
(principle 1). Nor have the later conferences on sustainable development in Johannesburg in 
2002 and Rio de Janeiro in 2012 proclaimed a right to a healthy environment.  
</p>
<p>15. In the United Nations human rights bodies, the most sustained attention to the 
possible adoption of such a right came in the early 1990s. In 1990, the Sub-Commission on 
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities appointed Fatma Zohra<b> </b>Ksentini 
as its Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment. Her final report 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/1994/9), in 1994, included draft principles on human rights and the 
environment drawn up by a group of experts, stating that everyone has &#8220;the right to a 
secure, healthy and ecologically sound environment&#8221; and listing a number of related rights, 
including rights to freedom from pollution, to protection and preservation of the air, soil, 
water, sea-ice, flora and fauna, to safe and healthy food and water, and to information 
concerning the environment (ibid., annex I).  
</p>
<p>16. Although the Human Rights Commission considered the report, it did not adopt or 
endorse the draft principles or appoint a Special Rapporteur itself. The Commission and 
Council, as well as other United Nations human rights bodies and mechanisms, have 
continued to study the interaction of human rights and the environment, but their attention 
has been directed primarily at the relationship of the environment with already recognized 
</p>
<p>  
 7 It may also be noted that the European Committee of Social Rights has interpreted the right to 
</p>
<p>protection of health in article 11 of the European Social Charter to include the right to a healthy 
environment. See complaint No. 30/2005, <i>Marangopoulos Foundation for Human Rights </i>v. <i>Greece</i>, 
decision on the merits (2006), para. 195.   
</p>
<p> 8 Articles 1 of the International Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on Civil and 
Political Rights, on the right of self-determination, provide that &#8220;all peoples may, for their own ends, 
freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources&#8221; and &#8220;in no case may a people be deprived of its 
</p>
<p>own means of subsistence&#8221;. But this language speaks more to the relationship of a people with its 
natural resources than to a human right to a healthy environment. The International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child do refer to the 
environment in the context of specific rights, as the next section explains.  
</p>
<p> 9 In 1990, in its resolution 45/94, the General Assembly adopted a softened version of this language: 
&#8220;all individuals are entitled to live in an environment adequate for their health and well-being.&#8221;   </p>


<p>human rights. In other words, they have concentrated not on proclaiming a new right to a 
healthy environment, but rather on what might be called &#8220;greening&#8221; human rights &#8211; that is, 
examining and highlighting the relationship of existing human rights to the environment.  
</p>
<p>17. This effort, as well as similar efforts in other forums, has identified two sets of rights 
closely related to the environment: (a) rights whose enjoyment is particularly vulnerable to 
environmental degradation; and (b) rights whose exercise supports better environmental 
policymaking. At the risk of oversimplification, many of the rights in the first category &#8211; 
that is, those at risk from environmental harm &#8211; are often characterized as <i>substantive 
</i>rights, while many of the rights in the second category &#8211; those whose implementation 
supports stronger environmental policies &#8211; are often considered <i>procedural </i>rights. 
Examples of the former are rights to life, health and property; examples of the latter are 
rights to freedom of expression and association, to information, to participation in decision-
making and to effective remedies. The next two sections of the present report describe the 
developing awareness of the environmental aspects of each of these sets of rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights vulnerable to environmental harm 
</b></p>
<p>18. The recognition that environmental harm can interfere with the full enjoyment of 
human rights is not new; it dates from the very beginning of the modern environmental 
movement. In the 1968 resolution deciding to convene the Stockholm Conference, the 
General Assembly, in the preamble of its resolution 2398 (XXIII), noted its concern about 
the effects of &#8220;the continuing and accelerating impairment of the quality of the human 
environment &#8230; on the condition of man, his physical, mental and social well-being, his 
dignity and his enjoyment of basic human rights, in developing as well as developed 
countries&#8221;. And the first paragraph of the proclamation of the 1972 Stockholm Declaration 
states that &#8220;both aspects of man&#8223;s environment, the natural and the man-made, are essential 
to his well-being and to the enjoyment of basic human rights &#8211; even the right to life itself&#8221; 
(para. 1).  
</p>
<p>19. In a real sense, all human rights are vulnerable to environmental degradation, in that 
the full enjoyment of all human rights depends on a supportive environment. However, 
some human rights are more susceptible than others to certain types of environmental harm. 
In recent years, in addition to reaffirming the general point that &#8220;environmental damage can 
</p>
<p>have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human 
rights&#8221; (res. 16/11, preamble), the Human Rights Council has identified environmental 
threats to particular rights. To give three examples, it has: affirmed that illicit traffic in, and 
improper management and disposal of, hazardous substances and wastes constitute a 
serious threat to a range of rights, including the rights to life and health;10 underlined that 
climate change has a wide range of implications for the effective enjoyment of human 
rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water, housing and self-determination;11 and 
recognized that &#8220;environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are 
</p>
<p>exacerbating destitution and desperation, causing a negative impact on the realization of the 
right to food, in particular in developing countries&#8221;.12  
</p>
<p>20. The Human Rights Council has also led other human rights bodies and mechanisms 
within the United Nations system to examine in more detail the effects of environmental 
</p>
<p>  
 10 Commission on Human Rights res. 2005/15; Council res. 9/1, 12/18,  18/11. See also Vienna 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action, para. 11.  
 11 Council res. 7/23, 10/4, 18/22. It has also held two panel discussions, in 2009 and 2012, that have 
</p>
<p>elaborated on those implications.  
 12 Council res. 7/14, 10/12, 13/4.  </p>


<p>degradation on human rights. For example, at the request of the Council, the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) conducted a study in 2008&#8211;2009 on the 
effects of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights (A/HRC/10/61). The study 
concluded that climate change will pose direct and indirect threats to many rights, 
including: the rights to life and food, as a result of malnutrition and extreme weather 
events; the right to water, as a result of melting glaciers and reductions in snow cover; and 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health, as a result of malnutrition, extreme 
weather, and an increasing incidence of malaria and other diseases that thrive in warmer 
weather. The study noted that rising sea levels caused by global warming threaten the very 
existence of small island States, which has &#8220;implications for the right to self-determination, 
as well as for the full range of rights for which individuals depend on the State for their 
protection&#8221; (para. 41). In December 2009, before the Copenhagen meeting of the parties to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the special procedure 
mandate holders issued a joint statement drawing attention to the dangers that climate 
change presents to the enjoyment of human rights.13  
</p>
<p>21. Special procedures have further analysed the effects of environmental degradation 
on human rights. One mandate, in particular, was created to examine the human rights 
effects of a specific environmental problem: the illicit disposal of hazardous substances and 
waste in developing countries. Since 1995, the special rapporteurs appointed to carry out 
this mandate have identified many human rights that may be infringed by such toxic 
dumping, including not only the rights to life and health, but also &#8220;such fundamental rights 
</p>
<p>as the right of peoples to self-determination and permanent sovereignty over natural 
resources, the right to development, the rights to &#8230; adequate food and safe and healthy 
working conditions, freedom of expression, the right to form and join trade unions, the 
rights to strike and to bargain collectively, the right to social security and the right to enjoy 
the benefits of scientific progress and its applications&#8221;.14<b> 
</b></p>
<p>22. Other special procedures have drawn the connections between environmental harm 
and impairment of the rights within their mandates. The following are a few of many 
possible examples. The former Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of 
the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this 
context informed the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development that &#8220;the realization 
of the right to adequate housing loses its meaning unless processes are put into place to 
ensure that people and communities can live in an environment that is free from pollution 
of air, water and the food chain&#8221;15 and the current Special Rapporteur has issued a detailed 
report on the effects of climate change on the right (A/64/255). The Special Rapporteur on 
the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation has carefully examined the effects of 
climate change on those rights.16 The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health has underscored 
that the right extends to the underlying determinants of health, such as safe water, adequate 
sanitation, and healthy environmental conditions generally (A/62/214, para. 104).17 The

</p>
<p> 17 This is also the position of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (see general 
comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard of health, para. 4).  </p>


<p>Special Rapporteur on the right to food has emphasized that agricultural productivity 
depends on the services rendered by ecosystems (A/HRC/13/33/Add.2, para. 21) and his 
most recent report focuses on the impact of the destruction of the world&#8223;s fisheries on the 
right to food (A/67/268). 
</p>
<p>23. Some global human rights treaties explicitly refer to environmental threats to human 
rights, particularly the right to health. The Convention on the Rights of the Child states that 
environmental pollution poses &#8220;dangers and risks&#8221; to nutritious foods and clean drinking-
water, which Parties are required to take appropriate measures to provide in the course of 
pursuing full implementation of the right of the child to the highest attainable standard of 
health (art. 24, para. 2 (c)).18 Similarly, article 12, paragraph 2 (b) of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provides that the steps Parties must take 
to achieve the full realization of the right to health &#8220;shall include those necessary for &#8230; the 
improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene&#8221;. The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has interpreted this phrase to comprise, inter alia, &#8220;the requirement to ensure an adequate supply of safe and potable water and basic 
</p>
<p>sanitation; [and] the prevention and reduction of the population&#8223;s exposure to harmful 
</p>
<p>substances such as radiation and harmful chemicals or other detrimental environmental 
conditions that directly or indirectly impact upon human health&#8221;.19  
</p>
<p>24. Finally, the regional human rights tribunals have contributed a great deal of 
jurisprudence to the relationship of human rights and the environment. In a series of 
carefully reasoned decisions, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights, the 
European Court of Human Rights, and the Inter-American Commission and Court of 
Human Rights have found that environmental harm can give rise to violations of rights to 
life,20 health,21 property22 and privacy,23 among others.

<p>relationship of already recognized rights with the environment is to identify rights whose 
implementation is vital to environmental policymaking. In general, these are rights whose 
free exercise makes policies more transparent, better informed and more responsive.24 They 
include rights to freedom of expression and association, rights to receive information and 
participate in decision-making processes, and rights to legal remedies. When directed at 
environmental issues, the exercise of such rights results in policies that better reflect the 
concerns of those most concerned and, as a result, that better safeguard their rights to life 
and health, among others, from infringement through environmental harm.25  
</p>
<p>26. Procedural rights are protected by many human rights instruments. For example, 
rights of freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, 
participation in government and effective remedies for violations of rights are recognized in 
the Universal Declaration (arts. 7, 8, 19, 20 and 21) and elaborated on in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (arts. 2, 19, 21, 22 and 25), both of which also make 
clear that the rights are not subject to discrimination.26 Even though these instruments do 
not explicitly address environmental issues, they undoubtedly encompass the exercise of 
the rights for environmental ends.  
</p>
<p>27. Another important instrument in this regard is the Declaration on the Right and 
Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which sets out, inter 
alia: rights to meet peacefully to promote and protect human rights; to seek and obtain 
information about human rights, to disseminate information about human rights and to draw 
attention to whether they are observed in practice; to have effective access to participation 
in government; and to benefit from remedies for human rights violations, including by 
having complaints of such violations promptly reviewed by independent and competent 
legal authorities and receiving redress. Again, these rights apply no less to human rights 
defenders seeking to exercise them for the protection of the environment than they do for 
other purposes protective of the full enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>28. In practice, environmental human rights defenders have proved to be especially at 
risk when trying to exercise these rights. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders has reported (A/HRC/19/55) that she receives many communications 
concerning environmental activists, &#8220;including those working on issues related to extractive 
industries, and construction and development projects; those working for the rights of 
indigenous and minority communities; women human rights defenders; and journalists&#8221; 
(ibid., para. 64). Environmental rights defenders face a high risk of killings, attacks, assault, 
threats and intimidation from both State and non-State actors (ibid., paras. 64&#8211;92). Needless 
</p>
<p>  
 24 To be clear, these are not the only types of rights whose fulfilment may benefit environment 
</p>
<p>policymaking. As noted below, environmental rights may also give rise to <i>substantive</i> standards to 
inform and guide environmental policies. And the implementation of some rights, such as the right to 
sanitation, may have direct environmental benefits. See report of the independent expert on the issue 
of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, A/HRC/12/24, 
para. 35.  
</p>
<p> 25 See Council resolution 16/11, preamble (&#8220;human rights obligations and commitments have the 
potential to inform and strengthen international, regional and national policymaking in the area of 
environmental protection and promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes&#8221;); 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/19/34, para. 8 (&#8220;rights such as access to information, participation in public affairs and access 
to justice are central to securing governance structures that enable society to adopt fair decision-
making processes with respect to environmental issues&#8221;).   
</p>
<p> 26 See also Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 34 (2011) on article 19 (freedom of opinion 
and expression) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (stating in paragraph 18 
that article 19, paragraph 2, of the Covenant &#8220;embraces a right of access to information held by public 
bodies&#8221;).  </p>


<p>to say, the primary effect of these human rights violations is felt by the individuals and 
communities who suffer from them. But the violations also have secondary effects on the 
environment that the individuals were trying to protect and on all of those whose full 
enjoyment of human rights depends upon that environment.  
</p>
<p>29. The procedural rights that support environmental protection may be found in sources 
other than human rights instruments. One of the most often-cited sources is principle 10 of 
the 1992 Rio Declaration, which states:  
</p>
<p>Environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, 
at the relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate 
access to information concerning the environment that is held by public 
authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their 
communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. 
States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making 
information widely available. Effective access to judicial and administrative 
proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided. 
</p>
<p>30. Principle 10 has been influential in the development of international and domestic 
environmental law and policy. The clearest example may be the Aarhus Convention, which 
sets out detailed obligations with respect to access to information, public participation and 
access to justice in environmental matters. 
</p>
<p>31. Although principle 10 does not characterize access to information, opportunity to 
participate in decision-making and access to legal remedies as human rights, there are 
obvious parallels between those norms and those of human rights law. More explicitly, the 
Aarhus Convention does describe access to information, participation and remedies as 
rights, and provides that each Party shall guarantee them, in accordance with the terms of 
the Convention, &#8220;in order to contribute to the protection of the right of every person of 
</p>
<p>present and future generations to live in an environment adequate to his or her health and 
well-being&#8221; (art. 1). <b> 
</b></p>
<p>32. Similarly, although the Rio Declaration does not refer to principles of non-
discrimination in the exercise of procedural rights, it does emphasize the role of certain 
vulnerable groups, including women, youth, indigenous people and people under 
oppression, in environmental policymaking (principles 20&#8211;23). The Aarhus Convention 
includes a clear requirement of non-discrimination, stating that within the scope of the 
Convention, &#8220;the public shall have access to information, have the possibility to participate 
in decision-making and have access to justice in environmental matters without 
discrimination as to citizenship, nationality or domicile&#8221; (art. 3, para. 9). Again, there are 
strong similarities to requirements of non-discrimination in human rights law. The final 
outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development 
(A/CONF.216/16, para. 1, resolution I &#8220;The future we want&#8221;) connects non-discrimination 
more explicitly to human rights norms in its treatment of gender equality, citing the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and stating 
the resolve of the State participants to &#8220;unlock the potential of women as drivers of 
</p>
<p>sustainable development&#8221;, including by repealing discriminatory laws and ensuring equal 
access to justice and legal support (ibid., paras. 236 and 238). 
</p>
<p>33. The procedural rights of indigenous peoples have received detailed recognition in 
international instruments. International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 
(1989) concerning the protection and integration of indigenous and other tribal and semi-
tribal populations in independent countries includes a general requirement that governments 
consult with the peoples concerned whenever giving consideration to measures that may 
affect them directly (art. 6). More specifically, it provides for the assessment of 
environmental impacts of proposed development activities and makes clear that the rights </p>


<p>of indigenous peoples to the natural resources pertaining to their lands include the right to 
participate in &#8220;the use, management and conservation of these resources&#8221; (art. 15; also arts. 
7 and 14). Similarly, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
recognizes the right of indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making on matters that 
would affect their rights and provides that States shall consult with the indigenous peoples 
concerned to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and 
implementing measures that may affect them, particularly with respect to projects involving 
the development, use or exploitation of natural resources (arts. 18, 19, 29 and 32). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Framing the issues 
</b></p>
<p>34. As this brief description of the evolution of environmental rights makes clear, some 
aspects of the relationship between human rights and the environment are now firmly 
established. To highlight two: first, as many human rights bodies at the global, regional and 
national levels have recognized, environmental degradation can and does adversely affect 
the enjoyment of a broad range of human rights, including rights to life, health, food and 
water. Second, the exercise of certain rights can and does benefit environmental 
policymaking, resulting in better environmental protection and, as a consequence, greater 
protection of the human rights that may be threatened by environmental degradation. These 
protective rights include rights of free expression and association, rights of information and 
participation, and rights to remedy. They have been affirmed in a wide range of 
international instruments, including environmental as well as human rights agreements.   
</p>
<p>35. The <i>obligations </i>that human rights law imposes regarding environmental protection 
are less clearly understood. In the words of resolution 19/10, &#8220;certain aspects of human 
rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable 
environment require further study and clarification&#8221;. To provide that study and clarification 
is a principal focus of this mandate. To that end, the Independent Expert will rely not only 
on research, but also, in accordance with the terms of the mandate itself, on the views of 
interested stakeholders, including Governments, international bodies, national human rights 
institutions, civil society organizations, the private sector and academic institutions. Until 
that work is completed, it would be premature to draw general conclusions about the human 
rights obligations relating to the environment.  
</p>
<p>36. Nevertheless, it may be helpful to frame some of the issues that are likely to arise in 
the course of this study, including those concerning: the relationship between human rights 
obligations and best practices; the connections between substantive and procedural rights 
and duties; vulnerable groups and non-discrimination; human rights obligations relating to 
transboundary and global environmental harm; the application of human rights norms to 
non-State actors; and the relationship between a right to a healthy environment and other 
human rights. It is important to emphasize that this list is far from exhaustive. Nor is the 
study of these issues by the mandate certain to address all of these aspects in detail; its 
content will depend on the results of the consultations and research to come. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights obligations and best practices 
</b></p>
<p>37. As the previous chapter of the present report illustrates, the relationship between 
human rights and the environment has become the subject of serious, sustained attention in 
many different forums, including United Nations human rights treaty bodies, special 
procedures, regional human rights bodies, international conferences on sustainable 
development, multilateral environmental agreements, domestic legislatures and courts, and 
academic studies. This diversity of perspectives demonstrates the importance that 
international organizations, States, civil society organizations and scholars place on these </p>


<p>issues and their relevance to a wide range of actors in the fields of human rights and 
environmental policymaking.  
</p>
<p>38. At the same time, the multitude of relevant forums makes the study of human rights 
obligations pertaining to the environment conceptually challenging. The development of 
this field has been rapid and widely dispersed, but it has also been highly fragmented. 
Although the various bodies engaged in the process of developing and implementing a 
rights-based approach to environmental policy occasionally look to one another for 
guidance, they often have different sources of authority, different audiences and different 
mandates. For example, the increasing attention devoted by treaty bodies and special 
procedures to environmental issues, while highly valuable, is necessarily focused on 
particular rights or problems. While the opinions of a regional human rights tribunal are of 
great importance for States within the region, the relevance for countries outside it may be 
less clear. The use of environmental rights in domestic law varies from State to State and 
may not always shed light on the scope of the rights at the international level. Moreover, 
the application of human rights law to environmental issues has often developed on a case-
by-case basis. In sum, while there is no shortage of statements on human rights obligations 
relating to the environment, the statements do not come together on their own to constitute 
a coherent set of norms.  
</p>
<p>39. Nevertheless, as the previous chapter also indicates, the human rights and 
environmental bodies that have examined these issues do seem to have reached some areas 
of convergence in their approaches. Wherever possible, the independent expert will seek to 
find such areas with respect to human rights obligations. In that respect, he will be guided 
by the language of resolution 19/10. By requesting study of the human rights obligations 
relating to the environment and a compilation of best practices in the use of human rights 
obligations to improve environmental policymaking, in consultation with interested actors 
in all areas, the resolution encourages the Independent Expert to examine the use of rights-
based approaches to environmental protection through a wide lens. Human rights 
obligations relating to the environment may fall along a spectrum, from duties that are 
generally binding on all States, to those that bind a smaller number of States that have 
accepted them through regional agreements or that have adopted them in their own 
constitutions or other laws. Obligations that bind only some States may nevertheless be 
worthy of consideration by other States as possible best, or good, practices.27  
</p>
<p><b> B. Substantive and procedural rights and duties 
</b></p>
<p>40. In examining the obligations pertaining to the human rights vulnerable to 
environmental degradation, perhaps the most basic set of issues concerns the substantive 
and procedural content of those obligations. One interesting development in this respect 
concerns possible links between substantive rights and procedural duties. Some human 
rights bodies have, in effect, closed the circle between the (largely substantive) rights that 
are most likely to suffer environmental harm, and the (largely procedural) rights whose 
implementation helps to ensure environmental protection. In order to safeguard the 
environment from the types of harm that violate the first set of rights, they have concluded 
that States have obligations to respect and ensure the second set of rights.  
</p>
<p>  
 27 The Independent Expert agrees with the statement of the then Independent Expert on the issue of 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations related  to access to safe drinking water and sanitation that &#8220;rarely can a 
</p>
<p>practice be qualified as best and that the concept of good practices is preferable&#8221;  (A/HRC/10/6, para. 
34, footnote 37).   </p>


<p>41. Much of this analysis has come from the regional human rights tribunals. For 
example, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights has said that Government 
compliance with the spirit of the rights to health and to a satisfactory environment in the 
African Charter must include &#8220;ordering or at least permitting independent scientific 
</p>
<p>monitoring of threatened environments, requiring and publicising environmental and social 
impact studies prior to any major industrial development, undertaking appropriate 
monitoring and providing information to those communities exposed to hazardous materials 
and activities and providing meaningful opportunities for individuals to be heard and to 
participate in the development decisions affecting their communities&#8221;.28 In a series of cases 
construing the right to privacy, the European Court of Human Rights has similarly held that 
States must follow a decision-making process that includes &#8220;appropriate investigations and 
studies&#8221;, gives the public access to information, and provides those concerned effective 
legal remedies.29 In construing indigenous and tribal property rights, the Inter-American 
Court of Human Rights has stated that the State must consult with the community regarding 
any proposed concessions or other activities that may affect their lands and natural 
resources, ensure that no concession is issued without a prior assessment of its 
environmental and social impacts and guarantee that the community receives a reasonable 
benefit from any such plan if approved. With respect to &#8220;large-scale development or 
investment projects that would have a major impact&#8221;, the State must do more than consult; 
it must obtain the community&#8223;s &#8220;free, prior, and informed consent, according to their 
customs and traditions&#8221;.30  
</p>
<p>42. Making this connection can create a kind of virtuous circle: strong compliance with 
procedural duties produces a healthier environment, which in turn contributes to a higher 
degree of compliance with substantive rights such as rights to life, health, property and 
privacy. The converse is also true. Failure to meet procedural obligations can result in a 
degraded environment, which interferes with the full enjoyment of other human rights.  
</p>
<p>43. To be clear, a relationship of this type between substantive rights and procedural 
duties does not preclude the possibility of other human rights obligations relevant to 
environmental protection. Obligations to respect procedural rights obviously have legal 
bases separate from any such obligations arising from environmental threats to substantive 
rights. And environmental rights may also give rise to certain minimum <i>substantive 
</i>environmental standards that apply regardless of whether procedural requirements are 
followed. For example, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its 
general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, has construed the right to health as 
encompassing &#8220;taking steps on a non-discriminatory basis to prevent threats to health from 
unsafe and toxic water conditions &#8230; States parties should ensure that natural water 
resources are protected from contamination by harmful substances and pathogenic 
microbes&#8221; (para. 8). The scope and content of the substantive components of environmental 
rights like these also require further study.  
</p>
<p>  
 28 African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights, <i>Ogoniland Case</i>, para. 53.   
 29 Ta&#351;kin v. <i>Turkey</i>, para. 119.    
 30 Inter-American Court of Human Rights, <i>Saramaka People </i>v.<i> Suriname</i>, paras. 129 and 134. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has also explained in a report to the Council, 
in the context of extraction of natural resources from indigenous land, that requirements of 
consultation and consent help to safeguard indigenous peoples&#8223; substantive rights, including rights to 
property, health and culture (A/HRC/21/47, paras. 49 and 50).   </p>


<p><b> C. Vulnerable groups and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>44. As the Council has recognized in its resolution 16/11, &#8220;environmental damage is felt 
most acutely by those segments of the population already in vulnerable situations&#8221;. 
Resolution 19/10 instructs the Independent Expert to apply a gender perspective by, inter 
alia, considering the particular situation of women and girls and identifying gender-specific 
discrimination and vulnerabilities,31 and it is clear that women and children are among the 
groups vulnerable to environmental harm. The special procedures and OHCHR have 
identified other groups as well. For example, the then Independent Expert on the question 
of human rights and extreme poverty pointed out in a report to the General Assembly 
(A/65/259) that &#8220;environmental degradation disproportionately affects those living in 
extreme poverty&#8221; (para. 37). The then representative of the Secretary-General on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons highlighted in a report (A/HRC/10/13) &#8220;normative 
gaps in the current legal framework for protection of those displaced by the effects of 
global warming&#8221; (para. 22). And the OHCHR report on climate change (A/HRC/10/61) 
emphasized that, in addition to creating large numbers of migrants, climate change will 
particularly affect other vulnerable groups, including women, children and indigenous 
peoples (paras. 42&#8211;54). 
</p>
<p>45. Indigenous peoples are at particular risk from many kinds of environmental damage 
because of their cultural and economic dependence on environmental resources. As the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people has explained in a report (A/HRC/15/37, para. 71), &#8220;in recognition of the 
special ties that indigenous peoples maintain with the natural habitats of the territories in 
which they live, international standards widely acknowledge indigenous peoples&#8223; &#8222;right to 
</p>
<p>the conservation and protection of the environment&#8223; and of the &#8222;productive capacity of their 
lands or territories and resources&#8223; ([United Nations] Declaration [on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples], art. 29.1) and at the same time call for the adoption of &#8222;special 
measures ... for safeguarding&#8223; their environment (ILO Convention No. 169, art. 4.1)&#8221;.32 In 
2011, the Special Rapporteur33 concluded that &#8220;the implementation of natural resource 
extraction and other development projects on or near indigenous territories has become one 
of the foremost concerns of indigenous peoples worldwide, and possibly also the most 
pervasive source of the challenges to the full exercise of their rights&#8221; (A/HRC/18/35, para. 
57). 
</p>
<p>46. Although the environmental threats to vulnerable groups are coming into sharper 
focus, the applicable human rights obligations are still not always as clear as they should 
be. Issues include the scope and application of duties of non-discrimination, as well as 
duties relating to special procedural and substantive rights reflective of the groups&#8223; 
</p>
<p>vulnerable situation. 
</p>
<p>  
 31 As the father of three daughters, the Independent Expert understands the importance of such a 
</p>
<p>perspective.   
 32 More generally, article 7, paragraph 4, of the Convention requires Governments to &#8220;take measures, in 
</p>
<p>co-operation with the peoples concerned, to protect and preserve the environment of the territories 
they inhabit&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 33 Mandate had by then changed to Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples.  </p>


<p><b> D. Human rights obligations relating to transboundary and global 
</b></p>
<p><b>environmental harm 
</b></p>
<p>47. Many environmental problems involve transboundary harm. In the words of the 
2011 OHCHR report on human rights and the environment, &#8220;One country&#8223;s pollution can 
</p>
<p>become another country&#8223;s environmental and human rights problem, particularly where the 
polluting media, like air and water, are capable of easily crossing boundaries&#8221; 
(A/HRC/19/34, para. 65). Such problems have given rise to much of international 
environmental law, from bilateral and regional agreements on cross-border air and water 
pollution to multilateral environmental agreements on global challenges such as marine 
pollution, ozone depletion and climate change.  
</p>
<p>48. The application of human rights law to transboundary and global environmental 
harm requires consideration of questions regarding the extraterritorial reach of human rights 
norms. Those questions are often complex, not least because human rights treaties employ 
varying language to define the scope of their application. Recent years have seen 
heightened attention to the extraterritoriality of human rights obligations,34 but there is still 
a need for more detailed clarification (see A/HRC/19/34, para. 64). These issues are of 
particular importance in the environmental context, in the light of the number and intensity 
of transboundary and global environmental threats to the full enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Human rights obligations and private actors 
</b></p>
<p>49. Another set of issues concerns the application of human rights obligations to 
environmental harm caused by non-State actors, including businesses. In a review of the 
scope and pattern of more than 300 alleged corporate-related human rights abuses, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises found in a report 
(A/HRC/8/5/Add.2, para. 27) that &#8220;nearly a third of cases alleged environmental harms that 
had corresponding impacts on human rights &#8230; In these cases, various forms of pollution, 
contamination, and degradation translated into alleged impacts on a number of rights, 
including on the right to health, the right to life, rights to adequate food and housing, 
minority rights to culture, and the right to benefit from scientific progress&#8221;. The report 
noted that the environmental concerns were raised with respect to all business sectors, 
including heavy manufacturing, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, and retail and 
consumer products.  
</p>
<p>50. In principle, the obligations of States to protect human rights from infringement 
from private actors extends to infringement from environmental harm, as many human 
rights bodies have explained.35 However, the specific application of such obligations in the 
environmental context needs closer examination. In that respect, the &#8220;Protect, Respect and

</p>
<p><b> F. The relationship between existing human rights and a right to a healthy 
</b></p>
<p><b>environment 
</b></p>
<p>51. Some cross-cutting issues that arise in almost all of the above contexts concern the 
relationship between the two approaches to environmental rights described in the second 
chapter of this report &#8211; that is, the relationship between efforts to recognize a single, 
overarching right to a healthy environment and efforts to &#8220;green&#8221; existing human rights by 
</p>
<p>identifying their environmental implications. That the two approaches are not inconsistent 
with one another seems apparent from their simultaneous use in many national and regional 
legal systems. But many aspects of their relationship remain unclear. 
</p>
<p>52. Possible relationships include: that the two approaches are separate from one 
another; that the definition and content of the right to a healthy environment are informed 
by experience with greening existing human rights; and that the right to a healthy 
environment may be derived from one or more existing rights, as it is in the Arab Charter 
and the Human Rights Declaration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Here, 
too, further study may produce greater clarity.    
</p>
<p><b> G. Other issues 
</b></p>
<p>53. The issues briefly described above are not the only ones raised by this mandate. 
Other issues that deserve closer examination include those concerning: the potential rights 
of future generations; the application of human rights obligations to especially pressing 
environmental challenges, including climate change, armed conflict and the 
environmentally displaced; and, last, but not least, the relevance of human rights to 
protection of non-human aspects of the environment. One of the longest-standing criticisms 
of a human rights-based approach to environmental protection is that it is likely to ignore 
important aspects of the environment that are not readily reducible to human needs and 
interests. As the mandate proceeds, it will be necessary to bear in mind not only the 
potential, but also the possible limits, of looking to human rights for environmental 
standards. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Planning the programme of activities  
</b></p>
<p>54. The first priority of the mandate is to provide greater conceptual clarity to the 
application of human rights obligations related to the environment. The Independent Expert 
intends to take an evidence-based approach to determining the nature, scope and content of 
the obligations. He plans to spend much of his time in the next year compiling such 
evidence, with a view to mapping the obligations in as much detail as possible. He will seek 
to highlight areas of coherence in the development of the obligations. Where coherence 
may not exist, he will be alert to the possibility of describing gaps and suggesting ways that 
the law may be developing to fill them.  
</p>
<p>  
 36 See report of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
</p>
<p>transnational  corporations and other business enterprises, Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights: Implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework, A/HRC/17/31.  </p>


<p>55. To inform his work, he will hold a series of consultations, to the extent that funding 
sources permit, devoted to particular sets of thematic issues. To facilitate widespread 
participation, he will seek to hold the consultations in different regions of the world. The 
Nairobi consultation  in February 2012 begins this process with a focus on procedural rights 
and duties. Later consultations should address the rights of vulnerable groups, substantive 
rights and obligations, and duties relating to transboundary and global harm, as well as 
other issues. He will also seek the views of interested stakeholders through alternative 
methods, such as surveys.  
</p>
<p>56. As part of the consultations&#8223; examination of human rights obligations relating to the 
environment, they will also seek to identify, promote and exchange views on best (or good) 
practices relating to the use of such obligations to inform, support and strengthen 
environmental policymaking, in accordance with the mandate, with the eventual aim of 
leading to a compilation of such practices. The Independent Expert also intends to 
undertake country missions, including at least one in 2013, to further inform his study of 
human rights obligations and good practices. As time and funding allow, he will also attend 
conferences and expert meetings related to human rights and the environment.  
</p>
<p>57. As the human rights obligations and good practices become more clearly identified, 
the Independent Expert will draw on them in carrying out two other elements of the 
mandate: making recommendations that could help the realization of the Millennium 
Development Goals, especially Goal 7 on ensuring environmental sustainability; and 
contributing a human rights perspective to follow-up processes to the 2012 United Nations 
Conference on Sustainable Development. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> In the last two decades, the relationship of human rights and the environment 
has received much attention. Some fundamental aspects of that relationship are now 
</b></p>
<p><b>firmly established, but many issues are still not well understood. Clarification of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable environment is necessary in order for States and others to better 
</b></p>
<p><b>understand what those obligations require and ensure that they are fully met, at every 
</b></p>
<p><b>level from the local to the global. 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> At this preliminary stage in the work of the mandate, it may be too early for 
recommendations. The Independent Expert does have two requests, however, of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>States and other interested stakeholders. First, he asks for continuing support and 
</b></p>
<p><b>feedback as he goes forward. In particular, he welcomes comments and reactions to 
</b></p>
<p><b>this report.  
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> Second, he urges States and other stakeholders to remember that the lack of a 
complete understanding as to the content of all environmentally related human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations should not be taken as meaning that no such obligations exist. Indeed, 
</b></p>
<p><b>some aspects of the duties are already clear. Perhaps most obviously, otherwise 
</b></p>
<p><b>applicable human rights obligations are not lessened merely because the environment 
</b></p>
<p><b>is concerned.  
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> For example, State</b>s&#8217; fundamental obligations to refrain from arbitrary 
<b>deprivation of life and to undertake due diligence to protect against the deprivation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>life by non-State actors do not become inapplicable merely because the deprivation 
</b></p>
<p><b>involves the environment. Simil</b>arly, States&#8217; obligations regarding freedom of 
</p>
<p><b>expression and association apply fully to those seeking to exercise those freedoms for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the purpose of improving environmental protection. Environmental defenders have 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights just as others do but, as the Special Rapporteur on human rights </b></p>


<p><b>defenders explained in her report last year, they may be more at risk than most for 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercising them. To echo her words, States should recognize the important work 
</b></p>
<p><b>carried out by human rights defenders working on land and environmental issues in 
</b></p>
<p><b>trying to find a balance between economic development and environmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection, should not tolerate their stigmatization and should ensure prompt and 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartial investigations into alleged violations of their rights.</b>37<b>  
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> More generally, States should continue to take account of all of the decisions 
and recommendations from the many other forums, from international conferences to 
</b></p>
<p><b>special procedures to regional human rights tribunals, which are actively developing 
</b></p>
<p><b>and implementing the human rights norms relevant to environmental protection. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>present mandate is intended to increase understanding of those norms, but it is 
</b></p>
<p><b>important to remember that they are not frozen in place while this mandate proceeds. 
</b></p>
<p><b>On the contrary, their development will, and should, continue to flourish in the years 
</b></p>
<p><b>to come.
