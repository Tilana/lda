Law & Analysis

9. The gist of prosecution application is that all accused persons have previous convictions. That majority of stolen items has not been recovered and still at large and two of the accused were on suspended sentences when the current allegation came about. According to prosecution it's not in the public interest that accused persons be released on bail.
 On the other hand the underlying basis of the three accused person's application is the likelihood of them appearing in court to answer the charges. None of them have any previous convictions for breach of bail and they will comply with all bail conditions 

10. According to section 3(1) of the Bail Act 2002 "Every accused person has a right to be released on bail unless it is not in the interest of justice that bail should be granted." 

11. There is always a presumption in favor of bail for every accused person nonetheless the party opposing bail may rebut that presumption by proving on a balance of probability that accused ought not to be released on bail.

12. Section 19 of the Bail Act 2002 sets out the relevant criteria for the courts consideration when determining whether bail should be refused i.e.

(i) That accused is unlikely to surrender to custody and appear in court;

(ii) The interest of the accused will not be served through granting bail;

(iii) Granting bail would endanger the public interest or make the protection of the community more difficult.

13. The court need only be satisfied with any of the criteria's above for bail to be refused. (see para 13: Wakaniyasi v State [2010] FJHC 20)

14. I bear in mind that bail hearings are not for the purpose of determining innocence or guilt of any suspect. It is for the purpose of resolving whether an accused should be released on bail or refused bail in the interest of justice, pending the outcome of the substantive charge. 

15. Apparently two accused in this matter namely Kulinio and Apolosi were on duration of their respective suspended terms when the current matter arose. The two accused by being charged for the current offences have brought suspicion upon themselves and therefore they cannot be trusted.

16. In addition the first and second accused persons have previous convictions that are theft related and said to be offences of dishonesty. The court thus has reservation that they will comply with bail conditions if released on bail. Further there are admissions by the second and third accused persons in their caution interview. A confession if accepted by the court will result in a conviction and accused persons will likely face immediate custodial sentences due to their background. In addition I further note that most of the stolen property are yet to be located and accused persons are likely to interfere with them if released on bail. Moreover I've also considered the likely time accused persons will have to spend in custody before hearing nonetheless the court can consider that for purpose of sentencing assuming there's a conviction. 

17. I've considered what has been placed before the court by all three accused persons that none of them has previous offending for breach of bail. However when balancing their right with the interest of justice and the public interest, I find that the interest of justice and public interest far outweighs accused persons right to be released on bail. 

18. I'm satisfied on the balance of probability that prosecution has rebutted the presumption in favor of granting bail. It's not in the interest of justice and public interest that accused persons be released on bail.

19. I therefore refuse bail and order that all accused are be remanded in custody pending hearing of the matter. All three accused are at liberty to appeal this decision to the High Court.

20. The court will ensure that this matter is heard as soon as practicably possible.
