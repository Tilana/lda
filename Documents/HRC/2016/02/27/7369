<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-eighth session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 7 
</p>
<p><b>Human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the independent international commission of 
inquiry established pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolution S-21/1* 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution S-21/1, the Human Rights Council decided to establish an 
</p>
<p>independent, international commission of inquiry to investigate all violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in 
</p>
<p>the context of the military operations conducted since 13 June 2014, whether before, during 
</p>
<p>or after, to establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and of the crimes 
</p>
<p>perpetrated and to identify those responsible, to make recommendations, in particular on 
</p>
<p>accountability measures, all with a view to avoiding and ending impunity and ensuring that 
</p>
<p>those responsible are held accountable, and on ways and means to protect civilians against 
</p>
<p>any further assaults, and to report to the Council at its twenty-eighth session.  
</p>
<p>2. On 9 March 2015, the Chairperson of the commission of inquiry addressed a letter 
</p>
<p>to the President of the Human Rights Council in which she invited the Council to consider 
</p>
<p>postponing the submission and presentation of the above-mentioned report until June 2015. 
</p>
<p>The request for additional time to prepare the report was based on the commission&#8217;s need to 
</p>
<p>adjust its work owing to the late resignation of its former chairperson and to analyse with 
</p>
<p>the utmost objectivity the large number of additional submissions and documents received 
</p>
<p>from both sides in previous weeks, relating to the fact-finding dimension of its mandate. 
</p>
<p>3. At its 32nd meeting, held on 16 March 2015, the Human Rights Council decided by 
</p>
<p>consensus that the commission of inquiry should present a short oral update to the Council 
</p>
<p>on 23 March 2015, at its twenty-eighth session, and that the Council would consider the 
</p>
<p>report of the commission at its twenty-ninth session. 
</p>
<p>    
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission.
