SUMMING UP

Madam and Gentlemen of Assessors,

01.     
It is now my duty to sum up this case to you. I will direct on matters of Law which you must accept and act upon. On matters of facts however, which witnesses to accept as reliable, which version of the evidence to accept, these are matters for you to decide for yourselves. So if I express my opinion to you about facts of the case or if I appear to do so it is a matter for you whether you accept what I say, or form your own opinions. In other words you are the judges of facts. All matters of facts are for you to decide. It is for you to decide the credibility of the witnesses and what parts of their evidence you accept as true and what parts you reject.

02.     
You have to decide what facts are proved and what inferences drawn from those facts. You then apply law as I explain it to you and form your opinion as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty.

03.     
Prosecution and accused, appearing in person, made submissions to you about the facts of this case. That is their duty. But it is a matter for you to decide which version of the facts to accept or reject.

04.     
You will not be asked to give reasons for your opinions but merely your opinions of yourself and your opinion need not be unanimous but it would be desirable if you agree on them. Your opinions are not binding on me but I can tell you that they carry great weight with me when I deliver my judgement.

05.     
On the question of proof, I must direct you as a matter of law that the onus of burden of proof lies on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts. There is no obligation on the accused person to prove his innocence. Under our criminal justice system accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. This is the golden rule.

06.     
The standard of proof in a criminal trial is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This means you must be satisfied so that you are sure of the accused's guilt before you can express an opinion that he is guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt about his guilt then you must express an opinion that he is not guilty.

07.     
Proof can be established only through evidence. Evidence can be from Direct Evidence that is the evidence that who saw the incident or felt the offence being committed. The other kind of evidence is Circumstantial Evidence that you put one or more circumstances together and draw certain irresistible inferences. Probative matter furnished by items that are actually on view, as opposed to a verbal description of them by a witness is called Real Evidence. 

08.     
Your decisions must be solely and exclusively upon the evidence, which you have heard in this court and upon nothing else. You must disregard anything you have heard about this case outside of this court room. 

09.     
Your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence apply the law to those facts. Approach the evidence with detachment and objectivity. Do not get carried away by emotions.

10.     
Now let's look at the charge.

FIRST COUNT

Statement of Offence

AGGRAVATED ROBBERY: Contrary to Section 311(b) of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009.

Particulars of Offence

EPARAMA MANI on the 01st day of May 2010 at Samabula in the Central Division, armed with an offensive weapon stole $350.00 cash, a black berry mobile phone valued at $800.00 and a Gold diamond ring valued at $1000.00, all to the total of $2,150.00 from ANTHONY PRICE.

SECOND COUNT

Statement of Offence

GRIEVOUS HARM: Contrary to Section 258 of the Crimes Decree No: 44 of 2009

Particulars of Offence
EPARAMA MANI, on the 1st of May 2010 at Samabula in the Central Division, unlawfully and maliciously did grievous harm to FILIMONI BOGILEKA.

11.     
In order to prove the offence of aggravated robbery, the prosecution must lead evidence which satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt of several elements. Firstly, that the accused stole property of the complainant. Stealing is the taking of something without the consent of the owner with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of the property.

12.     
The offence of aggravated robbery also has an element of force or violence. It is the stealing of something by an act of force. The force can be either implied from the carrying of weapons, or from the number of people involved in the incident. So when a group of people enter a house for an instance, to take money without the owner's consent with no intention of returning it, then the offence of robbery is committed.

13.     
Grievous Harm means any bodily hurt which seriously or permanently injures health, or which is likely to seriously or permanently injure health. 

14.     
The caution interview statement of the accused person is in evidence. What an accused says in his caution interview is evidence against him. These are my direction of law.

15.     
 Now let's look at the evidence led by the prosecution in this case.

1.      
Filimoni Bogileka was the personal security officer of Abzan Khan whose house is situated at No: 11 Deoji Street, Tamavua. He was working there for 13 years.

With the help of house lights he could see the man. When he went closer to the intruder he had shouted in Fijian language not to come closer. He was armed with an iron rod and when he went closer to the intruder he warned him again. Though he aimed at the intruder but he missed the target. Then the intruder had stabbed him with a silver coloured knife. The intruder was wearing ¾ pants and a T-shirt. His face was covered with a T-shirt. He could not identify him at that time.

Analysing of the Evidence

8.      
As assessors and judges of facts, in this case, the information was read out in this court before commencement of the trial. The accused had been charged for two counts.

9. As assessors and judges of facts, you can remember that Filimoni Bogileka gave evidence in this court. On the day of the incident he had struggled with the intruder but he could not neither apprehend the intruder nor identified him. But due the struggle the intruder had dropped his mobile phone and the vest which was wearing to cover his face. According to him he had handed over both items to police before he went to the hospital. But according D/C Prashneel he had recovered the phone which was laying at the crime scene. D/C Jone confirm this and further said that the vest and the knife were given to him by members of Ready Action Unit. You must consider there evidence very carefully. 

10.     
In this case a doctor gave evidence with regard to a medical report. But the medical report does not contain the name of the patient. According to the doctor the 1st page should be filled by the police. According to the doctor the 2nd and 3rd pages had been filled by another doctor while he had completed the last page. In the conclusion witness said that the injuries consistent with trauma from a sharp object. Filimoni Bogileka giving evidence said that he sustained stab injuries on his abdomen. Due to his injuries he was hospitalized and under gone a surgery.

11.     
As assessors and judges of facts, you must consider the evidence of D/C Jone Veitaqomaki very carefully. He is the investigating officer and interviewing officer. He had gone to crime scene with D/C Prashneel and recovered productions. D/C Prashneel had given a phone which had been found at the crime scene. He could not record a statement from the members of Ready Action Unit with regard to recovery of a vest and a knife. He examined the phone and found accused's photograph. He recorded accused's caution interview statement at Samabula Police Station. He could not call a witnessing officer due to shortage of police officers. He denied assault while recording the interview. Accused took up the position that he was assaulted during recording of his interview. To support he called witnesses.

12.     
Defence witnesses Salesi, Osea and Sunia all said that the accused was seen with black eye of left and was limping. Further accused had told them that officers from Samabula Police had assaulted him. But the accused was produced before Suva Magistrate Court on 07/05/2010. The accused did not complaint to Learned Magistrate about police assault. Further he had not taken any action to report this to a higher ranking officer of the police Department.

13.     
As assessors and judges of facts, accused claimed the ownership of the phone which was recovered from crime scene. According to him phone had gone missing while it was being charged at his sister's place. But he had not taken any endeavour to search for the phone. He had not lodged any complaint in the police with regard to lost of the phone. When police informed about the phone to his sister Emili Adi she did not inform the police about the lost of the phone. When her sister informed about the recovery of the phone from crime scene accused did not take any meaning full action to claim the same from the police. You have to consider this evidence very carefully. 

14.     
As assessors and judges of facts, Original Caution Interview Statement of the accused was marked and produced as P7 and its typed copy marked as P8. What an accused say in his caution interview statement is evidence against him. Accused took up the position that his caution interview statement was not recorded voluntarily. It was obtained through fear and assault. To support his argument he called witnesses and marked his medical report as D1. In his caution interview statement he admitted the charges in this case. You have to consider this evidence with great caution. 

15.     
Prosecution not called the complainant to give evidence before this court. The first count is solely based on the complaint of the complainant. 

16.     
You have heard all the prosecution witnesses. You have observed them giving evidence in the court. You have observed their demeanour in the court. Considering my direction on the law, your life experiences and common sense, you should be able to decide which witness's evidence, or part of his evidence you consider reliable, and therefore to accept, and which witness's evidence, you consider unreliable and therefore to reject. Use the tests mentioned above to assess the evidence of witnesses.

17.     
You must also carefully consider the accused's position as stated above. Please remember, even if you reject the version of the accused that does not mean that the prosecution had established the case against the accused. You must be satisfied that the prosecution has established the case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused.

18.     
You can also consider whether the evidence is consistence and corroborative of each other or whether they fall apart. That is, whether the evidence of witnesses supports each other fully or in material parts or whether they go in opposite directions.

19.     
Remember, it is for the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is not for the accused to prove his innocence. The burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and that burden stays with them throughout the trial.

20.     
Once again, I remind, that your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence, apply the law to those facts and come to a correct finding. Do not get carried away by emotions.

21.     
This is all I have to say to you. You may now retire to deliberate. The clerks will advise me when you have reached your decisions, and we will reconvene the court. 

22.     
Any re-direction?\par
