<p><b>S-6/&#8230; Human rights violations emanating from Israeli military attacks and

<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the Israeli military attacks and incursions in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank city of 
Nablus, constitute grave violations of the human and humanitarian rights of the Palestinian 
civilians therein, exacerbate the severe humanitarian crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory

<p>and undermine international efforts, including the Annapolis Conference and the Paris Donors&#8217; 
Conference for the Palestinian State, aimed at invigorating the peace process and establishing a 
viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State by the end of 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that the Israeli siege imposed on the occupied Gaza Strip, including the 
closure of the border crossings and the cutting of the supply of fuel, food and medicine, 
constitutes collective punishment of the Palestinian civilians and leads to disastrous humanitarian 
and environmental consequences, 
</p>

Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, which have resulted in 
loss of life and injuries among Palestinian civilians, including women and children; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> urgent international action to put an immediate end to the grave violations 
committed by the occupying Power, Israel, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the 
series of incessant and repeated Israeli military attacks and incursions therein and the siege of the 
occupied Gaza Strip; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Demands</i> that the occupying Power, Israel, lift immediately the siege it has imposed 
on the occupied Gaza Strip, restore continued supply of fuel, food and medicine and reopen the 
border crossings; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> immediate protection of the Palestinian civilians in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory in compliance with human rights law and international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> all parties concerned to respect the rules of human rights law and international 
humanitarian law and to refrain from violence against the civilian population; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the 
Council, at its next session, on the progress made in the implementation of the present resolution.
