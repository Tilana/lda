</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Secretary-General has submitted to the Commission on Human Rights an annual 
report on the question of the death penalty. These reports provided interim supplements to the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s quinquennial reports to the General Assembly on capital punishment and 
implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death 
penalty. Following Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/59, a report was submitted to 
the Commission at its sixty-second session<b>1</b> The Human Rights Council in its decision 2/102 
requested the Secretary-General to continue with the fulfilment of his activities, in accordance 
with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, and to update relevant 
reports and studies. The present report is submitted in this context as an update of previous 
reports on the question of the death penalty. As such it updates the Secretary-General&#8217;s latest 
quinquennial report of 2005,<b>2</b> and the final report of the Secretary-General to the Commission on 
Human Rights.<b>3</b> The present report covers developments on the question of the death penalty 
since 1 January 2006. 
</p>
<p>2. Following the practice adopted in quinquennial reports, countries are classified in the 
present report as completely abolitionist, abolitionist for ordinary crimes, de facto abolitionist, or 
&#8220;retentionist&#8221;. Countries that are abolitionist for all crimes, whether in peacetime or in wartime, 
are regarded as completely abolitionist. Countries that are regarded as abolitionist for ordinary 
crimes are those that abolished the death penalty for all ordinary offences committed in time of 
peace. In such countries, the death penalty is retained only for exceptional circumstances, such as 
those which may apply in time of war for military offences, or for crimes against the State, such 
as treason or armed insurrection. Countries that retain the death penalty for ordinary crimes but 
have not executed anyone during the past 10 years or more are considered abolitionist de facto. 
All other countries are defined as retentionist, meaning that the death penalty is in force and 
executions do take place, although in many retentionist countries such executions might be quite 
rare. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  CHANGES AND PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p>3. Changes in law may include new legislation abolishing or reinstating the death penalty, or 
restricting or expanding its scope, as well as ratifications of international instruments that 
provide for the abolition of the death penalty. Changes in practice may cover non-legislative 
measures with a significant new approach regarding the use of the death penalty; for example, 
countries may, while retaining the death penalty, announce a moratorium on its application. 
Based on the information received and collected from available sources, the following changes 
in law and practice can be reported since 1 January 2006. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  E/CN.4/2006/83. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Countries which have abolished the death penalty for all crimes 
</b></p>
<p>4. In June 2006 the Philippines abolished the death penalty for all crimes, after having 
reinstated it in 1994. In 2007 the Cook Islands, Rwanda and Kyrgyzstan abolished the death 
penalty for all crimes. In 2007, Albania ratified Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on 
Human Rights, abolishing the death penalty in all circumstances. In 2000 it had ratified 
Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention, abolishing the death penalty for peacetime offences. 
Uzbekistan abolished the death penalty for all crimes effective from 1 January 2008. In addition, 
in 2006 both Georgia and Moldova removed from their constitutions provisions allowing for the 
application of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>5. In December 2006 the Constitutional Court of South Africa ruled that the process of 
substituting all death sentences in the country with alternative sentences had been completed. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Countries which have abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes 
</b></p>
<p>6. No countries abolished the death penalty for only ordinary crimes during the reporting 
period. 
</p>
<p><b>C. Countries which have restricted the scope of the death penalty  
or are limiting its use 
</b></p>
<p>7. An amendment of 21 May 2007 to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
abolished the death penalty in all cases save for acts of terrorism entailing loss of life and for 
especially grave crimes committed in wartime. In August 2006, draft legislation was prepared in 
Jordan which will reduce the number of crimes that carry the death sentence, including 
drug-related offences, possession of illegal firearms and explosives. In May 2006 the 
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom decided in the case of 
<i>Forrester Bowe v. The Queen</i> that the mandatory imposition of the death sentence in the 
Bahamas was in breach of international human rights guarantees. In November 2006 the 
Caribbean Court of Justice found illegal the decision by Barbados to issue execution warrants 
while a review by the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights was pending. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Countries which have ratified international instruments that  
provide for the abolition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>8. There are one international and three regional instruments in force which commit States 
parties to abolishing the death penalty: the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on 
Human Rights (ECHR); Protocol No. 13 to the ECHR; and the Protocol to the American 
Convention on Human Rights (ACHR) to Abolish the Death Penalty. Protocol No. 6 to the 
ECHR concerns the abolition of the death penalty in peacetime. The Second Optional Protocol to 
the ICCPR and the Protocol to the ACHR provide for the total abolition of the death penalty, but 
allow States wishing to do so to retain the death penalty in wartime, if they make a reservation to 
that effect upon ratification. Protocol No. 13 concerns the abolition of the death penalty in all 
circumstances, including for acts committed in times of war and of imminent threat of war. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>9. During the reporting period, five States acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the 
ICCPR, namely, Albania on 17 October 2007, France on 2 October 2007, Mexico on 
26 September 2007, Moldova on 20 September 2006, and Ukraine on 25 July 2007. Three States 
ratified the Optional Protocol, namely Andorra on 22 September 2006, Honduras on 
1 April 2008, Turkey on 2 March 2006 and the Philippines, which had signed it on 
20 September 2006 before ratifying on 20 November 2007. Argentina signed the 
Optional Protocol on 20 December 2006. Turkey signed the Second Optional Protocol to the 
ICCPR on 6 April 2004. Following its declaration of independence in June 2006, Montenegro 
ratified the Optional Protocol on 23 October 2006. 
</p>
<p>10. On 6 June 2006 Protocol No. 6 to the ECHR entered into force for the newly independent 
Montenegro. 
</p>
<p>11. Six States ratified Protocol No. 13 to the ECHR, namely, Albania on 6 February 2007, 
France on 10 October 2007, Luxembourg on 21 March 2006, Moldova on 18 October 2006, the 
Netherlands on 10 February 2006, and Turkey on 20 February 2006. Armenia signed the 
Protocol on 19 May 2006. Protocol No. 13 entered into force for the newly independent 
Montenegro on 6 June 2006. 
</p>
<p>12. Mexico ratified the Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the 
Death Penalty on 20 August 2007. Argentina had signed this protocol in 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Countries observing a moratorium on executions 
</b></p>
<p>13. Prior to abolishing the death penalty for all crimes in 2007, Kyrgyzstan had renewed a 
moratorium on its application in 2006. A de facto moratorium in place in the Russian Federation 
since August 1996 continued to be observed. In the United States of America, following the 
decision of the Supreme Court to consider the constitutionality of lethal injections in <i>Baze et al. 
v. Rees, Commissioner, Kentucky Department of Corrections, et al.</i>, a de facto moratorium of 
executions occurred from September 2007 until the Court rejected the petitioners&#8217; arguments in 
April 2008. A further execution took place in May 2008 in the state of Georgia. 
</p>
<p><b>F. Countries which have reintroduced the use of the death penalty,  
extended its scope or resumed executions 
</b></p>
<p>14. In December 2006 Bahrain carried out its first execution in 10 years. In September 2006, 
the Military Commissions Act of the United States Congress allowed for the imposition of the 
death penalty on &#8220;alien unlawful enemy combatants&#8221;. In January 2008 the Islamic Republic of 
Iran extended the death penalty for certain offences related to the production of pornographic 
materials. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ENFORCEMENT OF THE DEATH PENALTY 
</b></p>
<p>15. According to the available figures, at least 7,208 persons were sentenced to death and at 
least 2,843 prisoners were executed during 2006 and 2007.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>16. On 18 December 2007, the General Assembly adopted resolution 62/149 entitled 
&#8220;Moratorium on the use of the death penalty&#8221;. In the resolution, the Assembly inter alia called on 
&#8220;all States that still maintain the death penalty &#8230; to establish a moratorium on executions with a 
view to abolishing the death penalty&#8221;. In doing so, it recalled &#8220;the important results 
accomplished by the former Commission on Human Rights on the question of the death penalty&#8221; 
and envisaged &#8220;that the Human Rights Council could continue to work on this issue&#8221;. Under the 
terms of the resolution, the Secretary-General is to report to the Assembly at its sixty-third 
session on the resolution&#8217;s implementation. In a note verbale addressed to the Secretary-General 
dated 2 February 2008, the Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York of 
58 member States expressed, inter alia, their &#8220;persistent objection to any attempt to impose a 
moratorium on the use of the death penalty or its abolition in contravention to existing 
stipulations under international law&#8221;.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>17. In his report to the sixty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights in 
March 2006,<b>6</b> the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions again 
considered the issue of lack of transparency in relation to the death penalty, and its impact on 
those facing the death penalty, their families, public debate and effective monitoring. In his 
report to the fifth session of the Human Rights Council in March 2008,<b>7</b> the Special Rapporteur 
addressed two aspects of the application of the death penalty. The first was the requirement of 
human rights law that the death penalty should be imposed only for the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221;, 
on which the Special Rapporteur concluded that &#8220;the death penalty can only be imposed in cases 
where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life&#8221;. 
The second aspect was the mandatory imposition of the death penalty, on which the 
Special Rapporteur concluded that such a practice risks cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment 
and the arbitrary deprivation of life. 
</p>
<p>18. The Human Rights Committee continues to address the question of the death penalty under 
the ICCPR in both concluding observations following examination of State party reports and in 
considering individual communications under the First Optional Protocol to the Covenant. In its

 <p> 
</p>
<p>concluding observations adopted during the relevant period, the Committee expressed its 
concern to one State party that its Criminal Code listed a large number of crimes punishable by 
death, including stealing cattle, but took assurance in the fact that in practice the sentences 
imposed are automatically commuted to life imprisonment.<b>8</b> It welcomed the abolition of the 
death penalty in two State parties.<b>9</b> It expressed its concern to one State party about a law which 
permits limitation of the length of time granted to condemned prisoners, including those 
sentenced to death, to appeal to, or to consult external bodies (such as the Committee itself). In 
addition, while taking note that the death penalty had not been applied for 24 years, it remained 
concerned about the mandatory nature of the death penalty in respect of certain crimes.<b>10</b> To one 
State party, the Committee noted with appreciation the de facto moratorium on executions and 
the commutation to imprisonment of many death sentences, but remained concerned at the high 
level of persons remaining on death row. It also reiterated its view that aggravated robbery with 
the use of a firearm, is not a most serious crime under article 6, paragraph 2, for which the death 
penalty may be imposed.<b>11</b> The Committee stated that the death penalty for embezzlement by 
officials, robbery with violence and drug trafficking, as well as practices which should not be 
criminalized, such as committing a homosexual act and illicit sex, is incompatible with article 6. 
It also expressed its concern that the death penalty can be imposed on minors.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>19. The Committee expressed its concern that under the current legislation of one State party 
the death penalty can be applied for offences which are vague and broadly defined and which 
cannot necessarily be characterized as the most serious crimes under article 6, paragraph 2.<b>13</b> It 
noted with satisfaction the progress that two State parties had made towards the abolition of the 
death penalty, in one case, by reducing the number of crimes punishable by death and in both 
cases by commuting the sentences of some prisoners. However, it also expressed its concern that 
some individuals do not automatically benefit from commutation and that in the latter case the 
authorities take into account the length of time a convict has spent on death row in taking a 
decision on commutation.<b>14</b> It expressed its regret to one State party that it intended to retain the 
death penalty, as well as its concern with the practice of the secrecy of execution dates, and the

<p>fact that the body of the executed person is not returned to the family for burial.<b>15</b> The 
Committee noted its satisfaction to one State party that a de facto moratorium on the death 
penalty is in force.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>20. The Human Rights Committee also continued the examination of individual cases 
involving capital punishment under the ICCPR. In several cases adopted during 2007,<b>17</b> the 
Committee recalled that the imposition of a death sentence upon conclusion of a trial, in which 
the provisions of the Covenant have not been respected, constitutes a violation of article 6. In 
these particular cases, the death sentence was pronounced without the requirements for a fair trial 
set out in article 14 having been met. The Committee therefore concluded that the right protected 
under article 6 had also been violated. 
</p>
<p>21. In July 2007 the Committee adopted General Comment 32 on article 14 of the Covenant 
(Right to equality before courts and tribunals and to fair trial).<b>18</b> In the general comment, the 
Committee surveyed the extent of States&#8217; obligations under article 14 of the Covenant, including 
the relationship between this article and other articles of the Covenant such as articles 4 
(derogations during a state of emergency) and 6 (the right to life). The Committee made a 
number of observations relevant to the application of the death penalty. It reaffirmed the position 
that scrupulous respect of the guarantees of fair trial is particularly important in trials leading to 
the imposition of the death penalty, and thus that the imposition of a sentence of death upon 
conclusion of a trial, in which the provisions of article 14 have not been respected, constitutes a 
violation of the right to life (article 6 of the Covenant).<b>19</b> Further, it affirmed that this 
consequence would not change during a declared public emergency under article 4 of the 
Covenant, because the right to life is non-derogable under that article.<b>20</b> The Committee also 
affirmed the position that those accused of capital offences must be effectively assisted by a 
lawyer at all stages of the proceedings (including on appeal), and misbehaviour or incompetence 
on Counsel&#8217;s part (for example the withdrawal of an appeal without consultation or the absence 
during the hearing of a witness in such cases) may entail the responsibility of the State concerned

<p>for a violation of article 14, provided that it was manifest to the judge that the lawyer&#8217;s 
behaviour was incompatible with the interests of justice.<b>21</b> Where a person sentenced to death 
seeks available constitutional review of irregularities in a criminal trial but does not have 
sufficient means to meet the costs of legal assistance in order to pursue such remedy, the State 
would be obliged to provide free legal aid.<b>22</b>

</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>The trend towards abolition continues. The number of countries that are completely 
abolitionist has risen from 85 to 93. The overall number of retentionist countries decreased 
from 65 to 60. There was also a significant increase in the number of countries which have 
ratified international instruments providing for the abolition of the death penalty.
