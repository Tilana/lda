SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS 
 
ATP 594 Cooper-Eromanga Basin Queensland
(cid:120)  ATP 594 was renewed by the Department of Natural Resources and Mines, with a renewal 
date  of  17  April  2015.  The  current  approved  term  of  ATP  594  is  for  4  years,  with  an 
opportunity to apply for a renewal at the end of the 4 year time period. There is a further 
29
opportunity  to  renew  after  8  years,  which  if  granted,  would  take  the  maximum  term 
allowable for the ATP to 12 years.
(cid:120)  ATP 594 is currently in the first half of Year 2 of the first 4-year period following its renewal
in April 2015.
(cid:120)  A preliminary technical evaluation has indicated a high degree of prospectivity within the
permit, which has helped to focus future exploration activity.
(cid:120)  Landholder Conduct and Compensation Agreement’s (CCA’s) are currently being finalised 
through the landholders’ legal representatives in preparation for access to their land to 
carry out field operations.
(cid:120)  Preparations  continue  towards  acquiring  a  3D  seismic  survey  in  the  permit  to  enable
accurate structural definition of the sub-surface.
Queensland Cooper Basin 2015 Acreage Release
(cid:120)
Icon has applied for additional Tenures offered by the Queensland Government in the 
Cooper Basin as part of the 2015 Acreage Release. The Tender process closed in October 
2015, but the results of the tenders have not yet been announced by the Department of 
Natural Resources and Mines.
ATP 855 Cooper-Eromanga Basin Queensland
(cid:120)  The Stage 1 program in ATP 855 achieved all the exploration and technical objectives that 
were set by the Joint Venture partners. This included flowing natural gas from five wells, 
achieving the highest flow rate of 4.5 MMscf/d from a shale gas well (Halifax-1) in the 
Cooper Basin, having six Petroleum Discoveries and identifying a significant natural gas 
resource within the Permian Formations of the Nappamerri Trough.
(cid:120)  The Joint Venture is currently reviewing the results of the Stage 1 program in order to 
prepare for the next phase of activity in the permit and ultimately progress the project 
towards commerciality.
ATP 626 Surat Basin Queensland
(cid:120)  ATP 626 is currently in the last term with the Later Work Program covering the period from
1 January 2014 to 31 August 2017.
(cid:120)  As part of the year end process, the Company decided to take a conservative approach 
and  impair  the  exploration  expenditure  of  the  three  suspended  wells  in  the  tenement, 
Eolus-1, Mindagabie-1 and Stitch-1, at the end of 2016 financial year.
30
(cid:120)  These three wells will be plugged and rehabilitated in the first quarter of 2017 financial
year.
ATP 549 (West) Cooper Basin Queensland
(cid:120)  There has been no activity in ATP 549 (West) in the Cooper Basin throughout the year. 
Icon has a 33.33% interest in the permit, which is now operated by Beach Energy following 
its merger with Drillsearch Energy Limited which was completed at the beginning of March 
2016.
ATP 794 Cooper Basin Queensland
(cid:120)  There has been no activity in the Springfield and Regleigh Blocks within ATP 794 located 
on the eastern flank of the Cooper Basin. The permit is operated by Senex Energy Limited 
and Icon has a 60% interest in both blocks.
PEP 170, 172 and 173 Gippsland Basin Victoria
(cid:120)  PEP 170, 172 and 173 remain subject to the General Moratorium covering all drilling in 
onshore Victoria. Icon has suspended all field work in PEP 170 and the granting of PEP 
172 and PEP 173 has been deferred until the Moratorium issue is resolved.
PRLs 33 to 49 South Australia
(cid:120)
In PRLs 33 to 49 in South Australia, which was formerly PEL 218, there has been no 
activity throughout the year. Icon has a 33.33% interest in the Post-Permian section in 
these licenses, which are operated by Beach Energy.
Corporate
(cid:120)
Icon Energy held the Company’s 2015 Annual General Meeting on 24 November 2015 
with all resolutions adopted.
(cid:120)  On 26 February 2015, the Company announced it intended to undertake an on-market 
share buy-back over the next 12 months of up to 10% of Icon Energy ordinary shares on 
issue, totalling up to 61.9 million shares. The buy-back provides Icon with an opportunity 
to strengthen the Company’s capital position at a cyclical low point in the resources market 
and also demonstrates the Board’s strong belief in the underlying value of the Company’s 
assets. The timing and actual number of shares purchased under the buy-back will depend 
on the prevailing share price, market conditions and other considerations. The Company 
reserves the right to suspend or terminate the buy-back at any time and to buy-back less 
than the full amount of 61.9 million shares. All shares purchased will be cancelled. 
 
In  February  2016,  the  buyback  period  was  extended  to  12  March  2017.  As  at  30 
June 2016, 21,160,565 shares were purchased and cancelled.
(cid:120)
31

1.  REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK
The Company’s Remuneration framework is designed to ensure that:
  Executive and Senior Managers receive competitive and reasonable market based levels of
base remuneration;
  Employees and Executive and Senior Managers who perform well have the opportunity to be
rewarded through an annual short term incentive plan;
  Long term incentives are aligned to the achievement of strategic objectives and creation of
value for shareholders.
2.  ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION, NOMINATIONS AND SUCCESSION COMMITTEE
The  Remuneration,  Nominations  and  Succession  Committee
is  responsible
for  making
recommendations to the Board on remuneration policies. The Committee, where necessary, obtains
independent advice on the remuneration packages offered to potential employees. The Company’s
broad  remuneration  policy  ensures  that  each  remuneration  package  is  properly  aligned  to  the
person’s duties and responsibilities and that remuneration is competitive in attracting, retaining and
motivating people of the highest quality. The Company has structured an executive remuneration
framework that is competitive and complementary to the reward strategy of the organisation.
The Remuneration, Nominations and Succession Committee Charter sets out the Board's policy for
the nomination and appointment of directors and the process for the evaluation of the performance
of senior executives. The performance of the Managing Director is evaluated by the Committee on
an annual basis in July in accordance with the procedures set out in the Committee’s Charter. The
Corporate Governance Statement  provides further  information  on  the  role  of  the  Committee. The
Committee also reviews and approves the outcomes for the Managing Director’s direct reports on
the  recommendation  of  the  Managing  Director  and  reviews  incentive  programs  and  employment
terms offered to the wider group.
3.  METHODOLOGY USED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF REMUNERATION
Non-Executive Directors
Fees paid to Non-Executive Directors reflect the demands made on, and responsibilities of, such
directors. Non-Executive Directors' fees are reviewed by the Board on an annual basis. Since 2014,
the Board has determined that Non-Executive Directors are paid a base fee of $70,000 per annum
together with the payment of additional fees to Directors serving on Board Committees to recognise
their contribution to the Company together with superannuation. An additional $7,500 per annum per
Committee is paid to Committee members and $8,500 per annum per Committee for the Chairmen
of the Committees.
37
The maximum total amount available for payment of all Non-Executive Director fees is $500,000 per 
annum which was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. The total amount 
of fees actually paid to Non-Executive Directors during the financial year was $371,752.  
Non-Executive  Directors  do  not  receive  performance  based  remuneration.    The  Board  has 
determined not to increase these fees in the current financial year. 
 
Executive Managers and Senior Management 
Executive and Senior Managers are remunerated through a combination of:
(cid:120)  Fixed Remuneration (FR); 
(cid:120)  Short-term Incentive (STI) – an annual cash and/or equity based incentive awarded at the 
discretion of the Board on achievement of specified company and individual performance 
goals;
(cid:120)  Long-term Incentive (LTI) – equity grants which may be granted on an annual basis, at the 
discretion of the Board, and have the potential to vest following achievement of specified 
company objectives measured over a 3 year period
STI and LTI represent the 'at-risk' portions of remuneration. 
 
Consistent with market practice, the proportion of remuneration attributable to each component of 
the Icon Energy Remuneration Policy is dependent on the level of seniority of the employee. The 
Managing  Director  has  the  highest  level  of  ‘at-risk’  remuneration  reflecting  the  greater  level  of 
responsibility of this role. Table 2 sets out the relative proportion of at-risk remuneration for senior 
executives and managers.  
 
Generally, the LTI will only be available to the executive directors and senior executives; whereas 
STI may be made available to employees throughout the Company.

The  Icon  Energy  Limited  Performance  Rights  Plan  ("Plan")  was  presented  and  approved  by 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 22 April 2010,  under which the Company is 
able  to  grant  appropriately  structured  short  and  long-term  incentives  to  employees  (including 
Executive Directors) in addition to their fixed remuneration. The structure of the STI and LTI plans 
and achievement of predefined STI and LTI targets is reviewed by the Board, and modified where 
appropriate, on an annual basis. In accordance with ASX listing rule 7.2 Exception 9 the Plan was 
resubmitted to shareholders for approval and was approved at the 2014 AGM.
38
4. FIXED REMUNERATION
Fixed remuneration consists of the base remuneration calculated on a total cost basis and including 
FBT charges on employee benefits, as well as contributions to superannuation funds. Remuneration 
levels are reviewed annually. Senior executives were restricted to CPI increases over the financial 
year.
5. SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES
The Company did not issue Short-term Incentives (STI) for the 2015-16.
6. LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
The Company did not issue Long-term Incentives (LTI) for the 2015-16. The only LTI plan award in 
operation during the year was 2013-14 LTIs.

7. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REMUNERATION POLICY AND PERFORMANCE
Icon Energy's remuneration policy seeks to encourage an alignment between the performance of 
the Company and remuneration of its executive KMPs. It does this by including short-term and long-
term  'at  risk'  incentives  that  only  vest  when  executives  achieve  pre-determined  key  corporate 
performance objectives. The long-term incentive plan in particular links vesting of LTI plan rights to 
achievement  of  long-term  company  objectives  such  as  growth  in  share  price  and  market 
capitalisation and exploration performance which contributes to long-term shareholder value.
The following table shows the Company's Profit/Loss (after tax) for the last four years as well as the 
share price and market capitalisation over those years.

Short Term & Long Term Incentive
The  Icon  Energy  Limited  Performance  Rights  Plan  allows  the  Icon  Board  to  make  offers  of
performance  rights  to  eligible  employees  in  the  Board’s  absolute  and  unfettered  discretion.  The
Board set corporate key performance indicators at 1st June 2015 meeting in anticipation of offers
being made under the Plan later in 2016 financial year (Corporate KPIs).
The STI corporate key performance indicator for the 2016 financial year was that the Icon Energy
share price must achieve and maintain a price of 23.5 cents per share for at least 20 consecutive
days over the year commencing 1st July 2015.
The LTI key performance indicator for the 2016 financial year was that the Icon Energy share price
must achieve and maintain a price of 45 cents per share for at least 30 consecutive days over the 3
years commencing 1 July 2015.
However, due to the impact of the oil price, the Oil and Gas industry have suffered significantly in
terms  of  profit  and  share  price.  Icon  Energy  share  price  has  suffered  a  40%  decrease  in  2016
financial year, the Board agreed not to make any offers under the Plan in respect of either the 2016
financial year STI or 2016 financial year LTI.
8.  SERVICE AGREEMENTS
The Company has a policy that service agreements with Executive and Senior Managers are limited
in term and include termination clauses of between one and twelve months.
Service agreements are in place for the Managing Director (Mr Raymond James), the Chief Financial
Officer & Company Secretary (Dr Kevin Jih) (both “Executives”) and the Exploration Manager (Mr
Martin Berry).
The  service  agreements  with  the  Executives  run  for  a  period  of  five  years,  from  the  date  of
engagement  or  renewal  and  set  out  the  duties  and  obligations  of  the  respective  parties.  The
contracts  provide  that  the  agreements  may  be  terminated  by  either  party  providing  up  to  twelve
months’ notice as shown in the table below. The Company may make a payment in lieu of notice
equal to the base amount  prescribed in the service agreement for a specified period. In addition,
accrued statutory benefits and superannuation benefits are payable.
40
For the Executives, if the Board terminates an Executive’s employment, the Executive will receive, 
in addition to any payment in lieu of notice:
a  termination  payment  of  the  greater  of  the  amount  calculated  under  subsection  3  and 
subsection 4 of Section 200G of the Corporations Act 2001 or that determined by the Board 
and subject to shareholder approval at the time. 
a pro-rata payment in respect of the Executive’s participation in the Performance Rights Plan 
for the year in which the Executive’s termination occurs in accordance with the Plan Rules 
as varied from time to time. As the employment relationship has ceased, the Executive will 
not be eligible for any further share or option grants in that year. The Executive will receive 
the equivalent value of this benefit in cash based on achievement of the Plan’s performance 
targets for the part year that the Executive serves with the Company running from the date 
of the yearly grant to Executive’s Termination Date. 
Any shares or bonuses that would be paid are payable and all “rights” granted but have not 
vested will vest as at the termination date;

Independent Auditor’s Report
To the members of Icon Energy Limited
Report on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Icon Energy Limited, which comprises the 
consolidated statements of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statements of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes in equity and the 
consolidated statements of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the company and the 
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time to 
time during the financial year.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and 
fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such 
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that 
gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 1, the 
directors also state, in accordance with the Accounting Standard AASB101 Presentation of Financial 
Statements that the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit.  We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.  Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial report.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk 
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s preparation of the financial 
report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation 
of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 
2001.
Crowe Horwath Brisbane is a member of Crowe Horwath International, a Swiss verein. Each member of Crowe Horwath is a separate and independent

In 2016, Exploration and Evaluation expenditure immediately expensed in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income amounted to $150,062 (30 June 2015: $155,142) and consisted of amortisation costs of 
restoration asset and unwinding of discounting on the restoration provision.
Liabilities arising from Exploration and Evaluation activities amounted to $233 and formed part of trade and other payables 
(Note 10) (30 June 2015: $565,410)
Exploration and Evaluation expenditure incurred is carried forward for each area of interest. This expenditure is only carried 
forward if it is expected to be recovered through the successful development, commercial exploitation or alternatively sale of 
respective areas of interest or where the activities in the area of interest have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable 
assessment of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in the area of interest are continuing. 
In assessing the recoverability of Exploration and Evaluation expenditure in the financial report, the directors have considered 
the impacts of relationships with joint venture operators, future funding arrangements and planned future expenditure in 
relation to mining leases held.

NOTE 11 - PROVISIONS
Restoration provision
Restoration provision represents the present value of estimated costs for future restoration of land explored by the 
consolidated entity at the end of the exploration activity.
The restoration provision recognised for each tenement is periodically reviewed and updated based on the facts and 
circumstances available at the time. Changes to the estimated future costs are recognised in the statement of financial 
position by adjusting both the restoration and rehabilitation asset and provision. Such changes trigger a change in future 
depreciation and financial charges.
Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical and on other various factors including 
expectations of future events, management belives to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The consolidated entity does not have any derivative instruments at 30 June 2016 (30 June 2015: Nil).
Significant Accounting Policies
Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis for 
measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, 
financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 27 to the financial statements.
Capital Risk Management
The consolidated entity manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern and provide optimal 
return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the consolidated entity consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity comprising issued capital, 
net of reserves and accumulated losses as disclosed in notes 5 and 12 respectively.
The board of directors review the capital structure on a regular basis. As a part of the review the board considers the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The consolidated entity's overall strategy remains unchanged from 2015.
Financial Risk Management
The main risks the consolidated entity is exposed through its financial assets and liabilities are credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management is carried out by the board of directors, the audit and risk management committee, and key management 
personnel.
(a)
Market Risk
The consolidated entity’s risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of the financial markets and 
seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of the financial performance of the consolidated entity, by way of 
various measures detailed below.
Interest rate risk

NOTE 21 - FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
The consolidated entity does not use long-term debt to finance its exploration activities.The company has a policy 
that when production operations commence in Australia, the interest rate risk will be managed with a mixture of 
fixed and floating rate debt.
The consolidated entity’s exposure to interest rate risk, which is the risk that a financial instrument’s value will 
fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates and the effective weighted average interest rates on those 
financial assets and financial liabilities, is as follows:

Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
The sensitivity analyses have been determined based on the exposure of the consolidated entity to variable 
interest rates for non-derivative financial instruments at the reporting date at the stipulated change taking place at 
the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. A 0.5% increase or 
decrease is used when reporting interest rates internally to the board of directors and represents management’s 
assessment of the possible change in interest rates.

ICON ENERGY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 21 - FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(b)
At 30 June 2016, if the interest rates had increased / decreased by 0.5% from the period-end rates with all other 
variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year for the consolidated entity would have been $52,967 
higher/$52,870 lower (30 June 2015: $64,420 higher/$64,149 lower), mainly as a result of the consolidated 
entity’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to 
the consolidated entity. The consolidated entity enters into legally binding contracts and management monitors 
the progress of these contracts in accordance with contract values, as a means of mitigating the risk from 
The consolidated entity does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty of any group 
of counterparties having similar characteristics. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the 
counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, 
represents the consolidated entity’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any 
collateral obtained.
Credit quality of financial assets neither past due or impaired.
(c)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the financial liabilities of the consolidated entity and its subsequent ability to meet its 
obligations to repay their financial liabilities as and when they fall due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk rests with the board of directors, who have an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the consolidated entity’s short, medium and long-term funding 
and liquidity requirements.
The consolidated entity manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity 
profiles of the financial assets and liabilities and entering into contracts in accordance with an approved Authority 
for Expenditure. 
The following are contractual maturities of financial liabilities:

The consolidated entity’s liquidity risk relating to financial liabilities at 30 June 2016 is limited to the repayment of 
the trade payables. Trade payables are short-term in nature. The consolidated entity does not finance exploration 
activities through debt.
Fair value estimation
The carrying values less provision for impairment of financial assets and financial liabilities of the consolidated entity, as 
stated in the Statement of Financial Position and accompanying explanatory notes at 30 June 2016, are a reasonable 
approximation of their fair values due to the short-term nature of the instruments.
No financial assets and financial liabilities are traded in active markets.

NOTE 23 - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
On 12 May 2015, Southern Fairway Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Babcock & Brown Australia Infrastructure Pty Ltd) and 
Ronald Baldwin submitted a Further Amended Statement of Claim and on 17 July 2015 the plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged 
that there were still deficiencies in that pleading. Directions were made to allow for the submission of a further amendment to 
the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim, which was filed.  A costs order was made in favour of Icon Energy.
On the 15 October 2015, Justice McMurdo ordered that the majority of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim be 
struck out.  Justice McMurdo allowed the plaintiffs the liberty to re-plead on two matters.  On 18 February 2016, Justice 
McMurdo awarded Icon Energy 100% of its costs of the application determined on 15 October 2015 to be recovered from 
Southern Fairway Investments and Ronald Baldwin. 
Icon received a costs recovery of $33,000 from the first strike out application in August 2015.  Icon will pursue a cost recovery 
against Southern Fairway Investments and Ronald Baldwin for the costs payable by them pursuant to the costs orders made 
on 18 February 2016.
Mr Baldwin and Southern Fairway Investments filed a Third Further Amended Statement of Claim on 1 March 2016. Icon filed 
its Notice of Intention to Defend on 7 June 2016 and the discovery process is expected to be completed by 14 October 2016.   
Icon gives no credence to the alleged estimate of loss given by Southern Fairway Investments Pty Ltd and Mr Baldwin. It is 
estimated that the extent of the Company’s exposure to this dispute will be limited to approximately $200,000 to $500,000 
representing future legal fees.
NOTE 24 - EVENTS AFTER BALANCE DATE
There are no after balance sheet date events at the date of signing (30 June 2015: Nil).
NOTE 25 - CORRECTION OF PRIOR PERIOD ERROR
During the year, the following prior period error was noted in the financial statements to the year ended 30 June 2016. An 
intercompany loan was written off in the 2013 financial year, however, the foreign currency reserve relating to this loan was 
not accounted for. The impact of this for the year ended 30 June 2015 was Nil (30 June 2014: reclassification of $2.24 million 
from foreign exchange reserve to accumulated losses).
The abovementioned misstatement in the previous year's consolidated financial statements represents a prior period 
accounting error which must be accounted for retrospectively. The error has been corrected by restating each of the affected 
financial statement line items for the period as follows:

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
NOTE 27  -  STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a summary of the material accounting policies adopted by the consolidated entity in the preparation of the 
financial statements. The accounting policies have been consistently applied unless otherwise stated.
(a)
Changes in Accounting Policies
Standards and Interpretations adopted
The consolidated entity has adopted all the new, revised or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. 
Any new, revised or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been 
early adopted.
Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet adopted
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 30 June 
2016 reporting periods. Some of them are available for early adoption at 30 June 2016, but have not been applied 
in preparing this financial report. The consolidated entity's assessment of the impact of these new standards and 
interpretations is set out below: 
AASB 9  Financial Instruments  includes requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets 
resulting from the first part of Phase 1 of the project to replace AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement . AASB 9 is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The entity 
has not yet determined the potential effect of the standard.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use 
in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. AASB 15 will supersede the current revenue  
recognition guidance including AASB 118 Revenue , AASB 111 Construction Contracts  and the related 
Interpretations when it becomes effective. Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018.
AASB 16 Leases  provides a comprehensive model to identify lease arrangements and mainly affects the 
accounting by lessees.The standard removes the distinction between operating and financing leases and requires 
lessees to recognise all leases on the statement of financial position, except for short-term leases and low value 
assets leases. A "right-of-use" asset  and a financial liability to pay rentals will be recognised in the statement of 
financial position. Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
AASB 2014-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint 
Operations . The amendments to AASB 11 provide guidance on how to account for the acquisition of a joint 
operation that constitutes a business as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations .  The amendments to AASB 
11 apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
AASB 2014-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of 
Depreciation and Amortisation . The amendments to AASB 116 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based 
depreciation method for items of property, plant and equipment. The amendments apply prospectively for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
AASB 2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an 
Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture . Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018.
AASB 2015-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Annual Improvements to Australian Accounting 
Standards 2012-2014 Cycle . Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
AASB 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 
101 . Effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.

NOTE 27 - STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Principles of Consolidation
A controlled entity is any entity controlled by Icon Energy Limited.  Control exists where Icon Energy Limited is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. A list of controlled entities is contained in Note 19 to the accounts. All 
controlled entities have a June financial year end.
All inter-company balances and transactions between entities in the consolidated entity, including any unrealised 
profits or losses, have been eliminated on consolidation.
Where controlled entities have entered or left the consolidated entity during the year, their operating results have 
been included from the date control was obtained or until the date control ceased. 
Income Tax
The income tax expense/(benefit) for the year comprises current income tax expense/(income) and deferred tax 
expense/(income).
Current income tax expense/(benefit) charged or credited to the profit or loss is the tax payable/(receivable) on 
taxable income calculated using applicable income tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted, as at the 
reporting date.  Current tax liabilities/(assets) are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid 
to/(recovered from) the relevant taxation authority.
Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances 
during the period as well as unused tax losses.
Current and deferred income tax expense/(benefit) is charged or credited directly to equity instead of the profit or 
loss when the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also result 
where amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions are available. No deferred income tax will be 
recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a business combination, where there is no 
effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date.  
Their measurement also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying 
amount of the related asset or liability.
Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be 
utilised.
Where temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint 
ventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that 
net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different 
taxable entities where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the 
respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or 
liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.
Tax Consolidation
Icon Energy Limited ("Head entity") and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax 
consolidated group under tax consolidation legislation. Each entity in the Group recognises its own current and 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such taxes are measured using the ‘stand-alone taxpayer’ approach to 
allocation. Current tax liabilities/(assets) and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and tax credits in 
the subsidiaries are immediately transferred to the head entity. The Group notified the Tax Office that it had 
formed an income tax consolidated group to apply from 1 July 2008.

(f)
Goods and Services Tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), except 
where the amount of GST incurred by a purchaser is not recoverable from the taxation authority. Under these 
circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of an asset or as part of an item of 
expense.
Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, 
or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial 
position.
Cash flows are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows on a gross basis. The GST component of 
cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation 
authority is classified as operating cash flows.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are brought to account at cost less, where applicable, any accumulated 
depreciation or amortisation. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is reviewed annually by 
directors to ensure it is not in excess of the recoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is 
assessed on the basis of the expected net cash flows which will be received from the assets employment and 
subsequent disposal.  
The depreciable amount of all property, plant and equipment including capitalised leased assets, but excluding 
freehold land, are depreciated over their useful lives using the diminishing method commencing from the time the 
asset is held ready for use. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the shorter of either the unexpired period 
of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Depreciation rates and methods are reviewed 
annually and, if necessary, adjustments are made.
The depreciation rates used for each class of depreciable asset are:
Class of Asset
Plant and Equipment
Buildings
Fixtures and Fittings
Depreciation Rate
20 – 40%
2.50%
3 - 20%
The gain or loss on disposal of all property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the 
carrying amount of the asset at the time of disposal and the proceeds of disposal, and is included in operating 
profit before income tax in the year of disposal.
Exploration, Evaluation and Development Expenditure
Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable area 
of interest. These costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through the 
successful development of an area or sale of the respective area of interest or where activities in the area have 
not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable 
reserves and active and significant.
Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit/(loss) in the year in which 
the decision to abandon the area is made.
When commercial production commences, the accumulated costs for the relevant area of interest are amortised 
over the life of the area according to the rate of depletion of the economically recoverable reserves. Any costs of 
site restoration are provided for during the relevant production stages and included in the costs of that stage. The 
capitalised costs relating to site restoration are amortised over the life of the petroleum asset.
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry 
forward costs in relation to that area of interest.
Any changes in the estimates for the costs are accounted on a prospective basis. In determining the costs of site 
restoration, there is uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of the restoration due to community expectations 
and future legislation. Accordingly, the costs have been determined on the basis that the restoration will be 
completed within one year of abandoning the site.

Research and Development Tax Incentive 
The Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) is a 45% Refundable tax offset that is calculated as 45% of 
the eligible research and development expenditure that has been incurred by the company. The Directors 
consider any payment arising from the RDTI to be a form of government assistance and are of the view that it is 
appropriate to develop an accounting policy that is anagoulous to AASB120 Accounting for Governement Grants 
and Disclosure of Government Assistance .
As such, RTDI refund are recognised when there is sufficient degree of certainty that the company will comply 
with the conditions attaching to RDTI and that the payment will be received. Such refund are recognised in the 
Statement of Profit or loss and Other Comprehensive Income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the 
company recognises as expenses the related costs for which the assistance is intended to compensate. The 
proportion of the refund that relates to capitalised exploration expenditure is deducted against the carrying amount 
of the related non-current assets. Any remaining proportion that cannot be recognised on either of the preceding 
basis is recognised in the Statement of Profit or loss and Other Comprehensive Income as “income from research 
and development claim”. 
Interests in Joint Arrangements
Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures. The classification of 
joint arrangements is determined based on the contractual rights and obligations of parties to the joint 
arrangements rather than the legal structure of joint arrangement. The entity has only joint operations.
Joint Operations
The consolidated entity has interests in joint arrangements that are joint operations. As a joint operator, the 
consolidated entity recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations 
and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These are included in the 
respective items of the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.  
The entity accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in 
accordance with the AASBs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
Trade Creditors
A liability is recorded for the goods and services received prior to balance date, whether invoiced to the company 
or not that remain unpaid. Trade creditors are normally settled within 30 days.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 3 months or less that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and cash 
equivalents as above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  
Provisions
Other provisions for make good obligations are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is 
a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

Restoration provision
The entity recognises a restoration provision to meet all future obligations for the restoration of petroleum assets 
when the petroleum assets are abandoned. Site restoration costs include the dismantling and removal of mining 
plant, equipment and building structures, waste removal, and rehabilitation of the site in accordance with clauses 
of the mining permits. The liability for restoration is discounted to present value and capitalised as part of the 
exploration expenditure of an area of interest and revised at the end of each reporting period through the profit 
and loss. The capitalised costs are amortised over the life of the petroleum asset. The periodic unwinding of the 
discount is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as part of 
finance costs.
Changes in the estimates of restoration costs are dealt with prospectively by recognising an adjustment to the 
restoration liability and a corresponding adjustment to the asset to which it relates. If any reduction in the 
restoration liability exceeds the carrying amount of that asset, any excess is recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
Segment Reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker. The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Managing Director.
Comparative Figures
Where required by Accounting Standards, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in 
presentation for the current financial year. Refer to note 25 for more information on correction of prior period error.
Financial Instruments
Recognition
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value at settlement date, which includes transaction costs, 
when the related contractual rights or obligations exist. Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are 
measured as set out below.
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market and are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses 
are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. Loans and 
receivables are classified as current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the 
reporting period which are classified as non-current assets. The entity classifies cash and cash equivalents, trade 
and other receivables and performance guarantees as loans and receivables.
Held-to-maturity investments 
These investments have fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities, and it is the group’s intention to 
hold these investments to maturity. Any held-to-maturity investments held by the group are stated at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss when the 
investments are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. These assets are 
included in non-current assets, except for those with maturities less than 12 months from the end of the reporting 
period, which would be classified as current assets. The entity classifies term deposits as held-to-maturity 
investments.
Financial liabilities 
Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost, comprising original debt less principal 
payments and amortisation. The entity classifies trade and other payables and borrowings as financial liabilities.
Amortised cost
The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial 
liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation 
using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, and 
minus any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectibility.

Impairment 
At each reporting date, the consolidated entity assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial 
instrument has been impaired. 
Impairment of Assets
At each reporting date, the directors review the carrying values of its assets which include exploration, evaluation 
and development expenditures and property, plant and equipment, to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have been impaired. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the 
higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use, is compared to the asset’s carrying value. Any 
excess of the asset’s carrying value over its recoverable amount is expensed and included in profit or loss.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the consolidated entity 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Foreign Currency Transactions and Balances
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency of each of the controlled entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which that entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian 
dollars which is the parent entity’s functional and presentation currency.
Group 
The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the group’s 
presentation currency are translated as follows:
 -  assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date;
 -  income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period; and
 -  retained earnings are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the group’s foreign 
currency translation reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position and are recognised as other 
comprehensive income.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The directors evaluate estimates and judgments incorporated into the financial statements based on historical 
knowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events 
and are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the group.
The resulting accounting estimates may not equal the related actual results. The estimates, assumptions and 
judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment
The directors assess impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the entity that may 
lead to impairment of assets including exploration and evaluation expenditure. Where an impairment trigger 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. Any excess of asset's carrying value over recoverable 
amount is expensed and included in profit and loss.

NOTE 27 - STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Share based payments
Fair value of each share option granted in the Short Term Incentive Plan and Long Term Incentive plan was  
calculated by applying the Black Scholes model. The model requires inputs where estimation is required for 
expected volatility in line with the company’s share trading history. Refer to note 13 for key assumptions.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The application of entity's policy for exploration and evaluation discussed in Note 27(f) requires management to 
make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances. Any such estimates and 
assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalised exploration and 
evaluation expenditure, a judgement is made that the capitalised expenditure is unlikely to be recovered, the 
relevant capitalised amount will be impaired through the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income.
Restoration provision
The consolidated entity assesses its future liabilities in relation to the restoration costs which include the removal 
of facilities, abandonment of wells and restoration of affected areas. The estimate of future restoration costs is 
done at the time of installation of the assets. In most instances, removal of assets occurs many years into the 
future. Therefore, management is required to make judgments regarding the removal date, future environmental 
legislation, the extent of restoraion activities and future removal technologies. Refer to note 11 for key 
assumptions.
Useful life of property, plant and equipment
In preparation of the financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by the management 
regarding the estimated useful lives of property, plant and eequipment.The management estimates that the useful 
life of these assets, being the period of time during which the assets can be utilised without any significant 
modifications, repairs or replacements, is noted in 27(e). However, the actual useful life may be shorter or longer.
Share buy-back
The buy-back provides Icon with an opportunity to strengthen the Company’s capital position at a cyclical low 
point in the resources market and also demonstrates the Board’s strong belief in the underlying value of the 
Company’s assets. From March 2015, on-market share buy-back will be undertaken from market over the 12 
months of up to 10% of  Icon ordinary shares on issue. 
In accordance with ASX listing rules, the price paid for shares purchased under the buy-back is no more than 5% 
above the volume weighted average share price of Icon shares over the 5 days of trading before the share 
purchase is made.
The timing and actual number of shares purchased under the buy-back will depend on the prevailing share price, 
market conditions and other considerations. The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate the buy-
back at any time and to buy-back less than 10% shares. All shares purchased are cancelled.
There are two conditions set by Icon Board: 
1. Our cash position is sufficient to meet our near term exploration and administrative commitments and we retain 
the ability to pursue valuable growth opportunities that may arise in the near future.”
2. The fund for Share buy-back should come from our income such as interest.
Share based payments
Share based payment benefits are provided to employees through the Icon's Employee Performance Rights Plan. 
Information relating to this scheme is set out in Note 13. The fair value of performance rights granted under the 
Icon's Employee Performance Rights Plan is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the rights 
granted, which includes any market performance conditions and the impact of any non-vesting conditions but 
excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to vest. 
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting 
conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of rights 
that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to 
original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
