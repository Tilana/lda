Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.<footnote name="1">90. At the same meeting, the representative of Germany (on behalf of the European Union)

the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) and the United Nations General Assembly 
resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 that established the Human Rights Council all affirm that all 
human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and 
must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council, of the Commission on 
Human Rights and of the Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, and in particular Human Rights 
Council resolution 1/3 of 29 June 2006 on the Open-ended Working Group on an optional 
protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> ongoing efforts, including by this Council, towards the realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights and encouraging additional efforts to ensure the realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights and the removal of obstacles thereto at all levels, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Affirms</i>: 
 (<i>a</i>) That, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ideal of

created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as 
his or her civil and political rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) That all persons in all countries are entitled to the realization of their economic, 
social and cultural rights, which are indispensable to their dignity and the free development of 
their personality;

<p> (<i>c</i>) The universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms and the obligation of all States to ensure the full promotion, 
protection and realization of all human rights; </p>

  page 7 
 
</p>

obligation to protect and promote all human rights, including economic, social and cultural 
rights, while emphasizing that the primary responsibility for promoting and protecting human 
rights lies with States; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The inextricable link between full respect for the rights contained in the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the process of development, the central 
purpose of which is the realization of the potentialities of the human person with the effective 
participation of all members of society in relevant decision-making processes as agents and 
beneficiaries of development, as well as with a fair distribution of its benefits; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> all States: 
</p>

</p>

instruments related to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To guarantee that economic, social and cultural rights shall be exercised without 
discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To secure progressively, through national development policies and with 
international assistance and cooperation, full realization of economic, social and cultural rights, 
giving particular attention to the individuals and communities living in extreme poverty and 
therefore most vulnerable and disadvantaged; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To promote the effective and wide participation of representatives of civil society in 
decision-making processes related to the promotion and protection of economic, social and 
cultural rights, including through efforts to identify and strengthen good governance practices; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the six recent ratifications of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and calls upon the States parties to the Covenant: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To withdraw reservations incompatible with the object and purpose of the Covenant 
and to consider reviewing other reservations with a view to withdrawing them; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To submit their reports to the Committee in a regular and timely manner; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To promote a concerted national effort to ensure the participation of representatives 
of all sectors of civil society in the process of preparation of their periodic reports to the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the implementation of the 
recommendations of the Committee; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To ensure that the Covenant is taken into account in all of their relevant national and 
international policy-making processes; </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/123 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recalls</i> that international cooperation in solving international problems of an 
economic, social and cultural character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human 
rights and fundamental freedoms for all is one of the purposes of the United Nations, and affirms 
that wider international cooperation would contribute to lasting progress in implementing 
economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Notes with interest </i>the work carried out by the Committee on Economic, Social and

development and adoption of general comments, in order to assist in clarifying the content and 
scope of the articles of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and,

</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> the Committee to continue its efforts towards the promotion, protection 
and full realization of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, at the national and international levels, including by drafting further general 
comments to assist and promote the further implementation by States parties of the Covenant, by 
making the experience gained through the examination of States parties&#8217; reports available for the

its concluding observations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its appreciation for and encourages</i> the continuation of the work related to

manner that respects their distinctive mandates and promotes their policies, programmes and 
projects;

</b></p>
<p><b>4/2. Human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory: 
follow-up to Human Rights Council resolutions S-1/1 and S-3/1 
</b></p>
<p>1. Under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 4/2, the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) <i>Called for</i> the implementation of its resolutions S-1/1 and S-3/1, including the 
dispatching of the urgent fact-finding missions; 
</p>
<p> (b) <i>Requested</i> the President of the Human Rights Council and the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council at its fifth session on their efforts 
for the implementation of Council resolutions S-1/1 and S-3/1 and on the compliance of Israel, 
the occupying Power, with these two resolutions; 
</p>
<p>2. It may be recalled that at the first special session of the Human Rights Council, an oral 
statement of programme budget implications was presented to it on its resolution S-1/1, which 
informed the Council that while no provisions had been made in the 2006-2007 programme 
budget to dispatch an urgent fact-finding mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the 
related travel costs, estimated at $27,300, for the mission, would be absorbed within overall 
resources included in the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, under section 23, 
Human Rights (A/61/530). With regard to the Human Rights Council resolution S-3/1, although 
owing to time constraints, an estimate of the programme budget implications of the resolution 
was not presented to it, the Council was informed at the time it adopted the resolution that to the 
extent possible resources required to implement the decision to dispatch a high-level fact-finding 
mission to Beit Hanoun and to provide all administrative, technical and logistical assistance to 
the mission would be met from resources approved for the programme budget for the 
biennium 2006-2007, under section 23, Human Rights. Subsequent to the third special session of 
the Human Rights Council, it was estimated that $130,500 would be required to implement the 
Human Rights Council, resolution S-3/1. The Secretary-General in his reports A/61/530 and 
Add.1 on the revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human 
Rights Council at its first session, second and third sessions and its first through third special 
sessions, in 2006 informed the General Assembly at the main part of its sixty-first session of the 
aforementioned budgetary requirements.

<p><b>4/8. Follow-up to decision S-4/101 of 13 December 2006 adopted by  
the Human Rights Council at its fourth special session entitled 
&#8220;Situation of human rights in Darfur&#8221;</b><footnote name="*">* Alternate. </footnote><b> 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 of resolution 4/8, the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Decided to convene a Group to be presided over by the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Sudan, composed of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on children in armed conflict, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Requested that group to work with the Government of the Sudan and appropriate 
human rights mechanisms of the African Union and to consult closely with the chairman of the 
Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation to ensure the effective follow-up and to foster the 
implementation of resolutions and recommendations on Darfur adopted by the Human Rights 
Council, the Commission on Human Rights and other United Nations human rights institutions, 
as well as to promote the implementation of relevant recommendations of other United Nations 
human rights mechanisms, taking into account the needs of the Sudan in this regard, to safeguard 
the consistency of those recommendations and to contribute to monitoring the human rights 
situation on the ground; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Requested the Group to report to the Council at its fifth session. 
</p>
<p>2. The adoption of resolution 4/8 by the Human Rights Council and the expected adoption 
by the General Assembly give rise to costs for (a) travel of the members of the Group (the 
composition of which is set out in paragraph 1 (a) above) for two meetings in Geneva of 
three working days each, (b) travel for three days of consultations in Banjul with the mechanisms 
of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights by a representative of the Group and 
two OHCHR staff, (c) travel to Geneva for a representative of the Group to present its report to 
the Council at its fifth session, (d) staff costs for a coordinator at the P-4/5 level, an executive 
assistant at the P-3/2 level and a General Service (Other level) administrative assistant for 
three months and (e) for conference services to be provided to the group, estimated in the 
amount $366,300 for the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007 as follows: 
</p>
<p> United States dollars

</p>
<p>*  See paragraph 176 above. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/123 
  page 63 
 
</p>
<p>3. Provisions have not been made under sections 2, 23 and 28E of the programme budget for 
the biennium 2006-2007 for the activities envisaged under operative paragraphs 6, 7 and 9. 
Should the relevant draft resolution be adopted, additional resources of $366,300 would be 
required as reflected in paragraph 2 above. 
</p>
<p>4. The Secretariat has sought to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to 
meet the requirements arising from resolution 4/8. It is anticipated that the additional 
requirements can be accommodated to the extent possible within the resources already 
appropriated under the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007. However, any additional 
expenditures that should arise in the implementation of the resolution would be reported in the 
context of the second performance report on the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007. 
</p>
<p><b>4/4.  The right to development 
</b></p>
<p>1. Under the terms of paragraph 2 (e), (f) and (g) of resolution 4/4, the Human Rights Council 
decided: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To renew the mandate of the Working Group on the Right to Development for a 
period of two years, and that the Working Group shall convene annual sessions of five working 
days and present its reports to the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To renew also the mandate of the high level task force on the implementation of the 
right to development established within the framework of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development, for a period of two years, and that the task force would convene annual sessions 
of seven working days and present its reports to the Working Group on the Right to 
Development; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To request the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to 
take all necessary measures and allocate necessary resources for the effective implementation of 
the present resolution. 
</p>
<p>2. The adoption of the resolution by the Human Rights Council and the expected adoption by 
the General Assembly give rise to additional requirements because of the two additional working 
days of the sessions of the high-level task force each year. The additional costs would relate to 
(a) daily subsistence allowance for the members and (b) conference services to be provided to 
the high-level task force. The amount for the activity is estimated at $74,300 for the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, as follows: 
</p>
<p> United States dollars
