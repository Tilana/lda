<p><b>Human Rights Council</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/35.   Assistance to Somalia in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the relevant 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> all the previous resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the last of which was resolution 2005/83 of 21 April 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the commitment and efforts undertaken by the African Union to 
</p>
<p>support Somali-led efforts towards reconciliation and stability and the efforts made by 
</p>
<p>international and regional stakeholders to help Somalia re-establish stability, peace 
</p>
<p>and security in its national territory, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming also</i> the Declaration on the situation in Somalia, adopted by the 
</p>
<p>Heads of State and Government of the African Union during the tenth ordinary 
</p>
<p>session of the Assembly of the African Union, held in Addis Ababa from 31 January 
</p>
<p>to 2 February 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that the above-mentioned declaration, adopted by the Assembly 
</p>
<p>of the African Union, stressed the need for the deployment of a United Nations 
</p>
<p>peacekeeping operation in Somalia that would take over from the African Union 
</p>
<p>Mission to Somalia and support the long-term stabilization and post-conflict 
</p>
<p>reconstruction of the country, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i> that humanitarian, human rights and development assistance is of 
</p>
<p>paramount importance to alleviate poverty and to promote a more peaceful, equitable 
</p>
<p>and democratic society in Somalia, </p>

<p><i> Welcoming</i> the steps taken within Somalia, including the convening of the 
</p>
<p>National Reconciliation Congress, in July and August 2007, the recent appointment of 
</p>
<p>a new Prime Minister, Nur Hassan Hussein, and the subsequent formation of a new 
</p>
<p>Government, as well as the efforts made by the African Union, notably through the 
</p>
<p>deployment of the African Union Mission in Somalia, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i> that, despite the daunting challenges confronting the peace and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation process, the opportunity that arose in December 2006, when the 
</p>
<p>Transitional Federal Government regained control of Mogadishu and other parts of 
</p>
<p>the country in order to find a lasting solution to the crisis in Somalia, still exists,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the need for both the Somali stakeholders and the international 
</p>
<p>community as a whole to seize this opportunity to address decisively the conflict in 
</p>
<p>Somalia and to take all steps required to this end, 
</p>
<p><i> Seriously concerned</i> about the human rights and humanitarian situation in 
</p>
<p>Somalia, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with concern</i> that the security situation remains fragile throughout the 
</p>
<p>country, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that efforts to combat terrorism in Somalia must respect 
</p>
<p>international law, including human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are 
</p>
<p>inseparable from the establishment of peace in Somalia, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 
</p>
<p>March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and 5/2 on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures 
</p>
<p>Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the 
</p>
<p>mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in accordance with those resolutions and 
</p>
<p>the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses its serious concern</i> at the human rights and humanitarian 
</p>
<p>situation in Somalia, and calls for an immediate end to all ongoing violations; </p>

<p> 2. <i>Demands</i> that all parties in Somalia reject and stop all acts of violence, 
</p>
<p>abstain from engaging in hostilities, prevent any act likely to increase tension and 
</p>
<p>security and fully respect their obligations under international human rights law and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> all parties in Somalia to uphold the principles and spirit 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the Transitional Federal Charter and to work towards genuine national 
</p>
<p>reconciliation within that framework, including by holding fair, national multiparty 
</p>
<p>elections in 2009, as envisaged by the Charter; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to stand by the legitimate 
</p>
<p>Somali institutions and to provide adequate and concrete support in order to enhance 
</p>
<p>their capacity, including that of the Transitional Federal Government, as part of an 
</p>
<p>integrated approach that encompasses political, security and programmatic 
</p>
<p>dimensions; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Appeals</i> to the partners of the African Union to provide increased 
</p>
<p>logistical and financial support for the African Union Mission in Somalia, especially 
</p>
<p>in view of the fact that the African Union, in deploying an operation in Somalia, is 
</p>
<p>also acting on behalf of the international community at large; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> the international community to provide, as a matter of urgency, 
</p>
<p>development assistance to Somalia, so as to effectively contribute to the 
</p>
<p>reconstruction of Somalia, the rebuilding of its institutions and technical assistance in 
</p>
<p>the field of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also urges</i> the international community to provide humanitarian 
</p>
<p>assistance to the needy population and to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to 
</p>
<p>create conditions conducive to the provision of humanitarian assistance, including 
</p>
<p>unhindered access to the needy population and security for humanitarian workers and 
</p>
<p>organizations; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Acknowledges</i> the work undertaken by the independent expert on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights in Somalia, including his report to the current session 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/7/26); </p>

<p> 9. <i>Decides</i> to renew the mandate of the independent expert for a period of 
</p>
<p>one year, with a view to maximizing the provision and the flow of technical assistance 
</p>
<p>to Somalia in the field of human rights, and requests him/her to submit a report to the 
</p>
<p>Council at its sessions in September 2008 and March 2009; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with 
</p>
<p>all necessary human, technical and financial assistance in carrying out his/her 
</p>
<p>mandate; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights to strengthen its presence in Somalia with a view to providing 
</p>
<p>technical assistance and advisory services to the relevant Somali institutions; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Invites</i> relevant United Nations bodies and agencies to provide support 
</p>
<p>and technical assistance to Somalia in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p><i>42nd meeting 
28 March 2008</i> 
</p>
<p> Adopted without a vote.
