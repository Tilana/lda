2.           OPERATIONS
a)    Organization
Delta Oil & Gas, Inc.
(A Development Stage Company)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2009
(Stated in U.S. Dollars)
1.           BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2009 included herein have been prepared without audit pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  have  been  condensed  or
omitted  pursuant  to  such  rules  and  regulations.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  all  adjustments  (consisting  of  normal  recurring
accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements
be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2008 audited financial statements and notes thereto.  The results of the operations for the
three months ended March 31, 2009 are not indicative of the results that may be expected for the year.
Delta Oil & Gas, Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated as a Colorado corporation on January 9, 2001.
The  Company  is  a  development  stage,  independent  natural  gas  and  oil  company  engaged  in  the  exploration,  development  and
acquisition  of  natural  gas  and  oil  properties  in  the  United  States  and  Canada.  The  Company’s  entry  into  the  natural  gas  and  oil 
business began on February 8, 2001.
The Company is subject to several categories of risk associated with its development stage activities.  Natural gas and oil exploration
and  production  is  a  speculative  business,  and  involves  a  high  degree  of  risk.  Among  the  factors  that  have  a  direct  bearing  on  the
Company’s prospects are uncertainties inherent estimating  natural gas and oil reserves, future hydrocarbon production, and cash flows, 
particularly with respect to wells that have not been fully tested and with wells having limited production histories; access to additional
capital; changes in the price of natural gas and oil; availability and cost of services and equipment; and the presence of competitors
with greater financial resources and capacity.
The oil and gas industry is subject, by its nature, to environmental hazards and clean-up costs.  At this time, management knows of no 
substantial costs from environmental accidents or events for which the Company may be currently liable.  In addition, the Company’s 
oil and gas business makes it vulnerable to changes in prices of crude oil and natural gas.  Such prices have been volatile in the past
and can be expected to be volatile in the future.  By definition, proved reserves are based on current oil and gas prices and estimated
reserves.  Price declines reduce the estimated quantity of proved reserves and increase annual depletion expense (which is based on
proved reserves).
b)    Business acquisition
On March 26, 2009, the Company acquired 80.31% of The Stallion Group (“Stallion”), a Nevada corporation, whose principal business 
is  in  the  identification,  acquisition  and  exploration  of  oil  and  gas  properties.  To  fund  the  acquisition  of  the  Common  Stock,  the
Company issued 19,545,026 shares of common stock and paid $46,908 in cash to the holders of the Stallion’s common stock that was 
tendered for a value of $0.04.  Each common share of Stallion was exchangeable for 0.333333 of the Company’s common shares and 
$0.0008 in cash.  As of March 26, 2009, the Company owned 58,635,139 shares of Common Stock, which represents approximately
80.31% of the shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding.  Following is a summary of purchase price allocation:

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.
As  shown  in  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  has  incurred  a  net  loss  of  $3,789,099  since
inception.  To achieve profitable operations, the Company requires additional capital for obtaining producing oil and gas properties
through either the purchase of producing wells or successful exploration activity.  Management believes that sufficient funding will be
available  to  meet  its  business  objectives  including  anticipated  cash  needs  for  working  capital  and  is  currently  evaluating  several
financing  options.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Company  will  be  able  to  obtain  sufficient  funds  to  continue  the
development of its properties and, if successful, to commence the sale of its projects under

a)     Basis of Consolidation
development.  As a result of the foregoing, there exists substantial doubt the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  These 
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Delta Oil & Gas (Canada) Inc. and 80.31% of 
The Stallion Group.  All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
b)     Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the
estimate of proved natural gas and oil reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows there from.
c)     Natural Gas and Oil Properties
The Company accounts for its oil and gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting as prescribed by the United
States  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (“SEC”).  Accordingly,  all  costs  associated  with  the  acquisition  of  properties  and 
exploration with the intent of finding proved oil and gas reserves contribute to the discovery of proved reserves, including the costs of
abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs, and annual lease rentals are capitalized.  All general corporate costs are expensed
as incurred.  In general, sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with
no gain or loss recorded.  Amortization of evaluated oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on all
proved  reserves  on  a  country-by-country  basis.  The  net  capitalized  costs  of  evaluated  oil  and  gas  properties  (full  cost  ceiling
limitation) are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at 10%, and the lower of cost
or  estimated  fair  value  of  unproved  properties,  net  of  tax  considerations.  These  properties  are  included  in  the  amortization  pool
immediately upon the determination that the well is dry.
Unproved properties consist of lease acquisition costs and costs on wells currently being drilled on the properties.  The recorded costs
of the investment in unproved properties are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until
they  are  impaired.  Unevaluated  oil  and  gas  properties  are  assessed  at  least  annually  for  impairment  either  individually  or  on  an
aggregate basis.
d)    Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (“SFAS 143”), “Accounting for Asset Retirement 
Obligations”, which requires that asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset, 
including natural gas and oil properties, be recognized as liabilities in the period in which it is incurred and becomes determinable, with
an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated assets. The cost of tangible long-lived assets, including the initially
recognized ARO, is depleted, such that the cost of the ARO is recognized over the useful life of the assets. The ARO is recorded at fair
value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted cash flows are accreted to the expected settlement value. The
fair value of the ARO is measured using expected future cash flow, discounted at the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.

3.              SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
e)     Joint Ventures
MARCH 31, 2009
(Stated in U.S. Dollars)
All exploration and production activities are conducted jointly with others and, accordingly, the accounts reflect only the Company’s 
proportionate interest in such activities.
f)     Revenue Recognition
Revenue from sales of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products are recorded when deliveries have occurred and legal
ownership of the commodity transfers to the customers.  Title transfers for crude oil, natural gas and bulk refined products generally
occur at pipeline custody points or when a tanker lifting has occurred.  Revenues from the production of oil and natural gas properties
in  which  the  Company  shares  an  undivided  interest  with  other  producers  are  recognized  based  on  the  actual  volumes  sold  by  the
Company during the period.  Gas imbalances occur when the Company’s actual sales differ from its entitlement under existing working 
interests.  The Company records a liability for gas imbalances when it has sold more than its working interest of gas production and the
estimated remaining reserves make it doubtful that the partners can recoup their share of production from the field. At March 31, 2009
and 2008, the Company had no overproduced imbalances.
g)    Cash and Cash Equivalent
Cash consists of cash on deposit with high quality major financial institutions, and to date has not experienced losses on any of its
balances.  The carrying amounts approximated fair market value due to the liquidity of these deposits.  For purposes of the balance
sheet and statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the
time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
h)    Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and
accounts receivable.  The  Company  maintains  cash  at  one  financial  institution.  The  Company  periodically  evaluates  the  credit
worthiness of financial institutions, and maintains cash accounts only in large high quality financial institutions, thereby minimizing
exposure  for  deposits  in  excess  of  federally  insured  amounts.  The  Company  believes  credit  risk  associated  with  cash  and  cash
equivalents to be minimal.  Deposits are insured up to $79,283, the amount that may be subject to credit risk for the three months ended
March 31, 2009 is $627,064.
The  Company  has  recorded  trade  accounts  receivable  from  the  business  operations.  Management  periodically  evaluates  the
collectability  of  the  trade  receivables  and  believes  that  the  Company’s  receivables  are  fully  collectable  and  that  the  risk  of loss  is 
minimal.
i)      Environmental Protection and Reclamation Costs
The operations of the Company have been, and may be in the future be affected from time to time in varying degrees by changes in
environmental regulations, including those for future removal and site restorations costs.  Both the likelihood of new regulations and
their overall effect upon the Company may vary from region to region and are not predictable.

3.             SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
j)  Environmental Protection and Reclamation Costs (Continued)
The Company’s policy is to meet or, if possible, surpass standards set by relevant legislation, by application of technically proven and
economically feasible measures.  Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing environmental and reclamation programs will be
charged against statements of operations as incurred or capitalized and amortized depending upon their future economic benefits.  The
Company  does  not  currently  anticipate  any  material  capital  expenditures  for  environmental  control  facilities  because  all  property
holdings  are  at  early  stages  of  exploration.  Therefore,  estimated  future  removal  and  site  restoration  costs  are  presently  considered
minimal.
k)  Foreign Currency Translation
United States funds are considered the Company’s functional currency.  Transaction amounts denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into their United States dollar equivalents at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date.  Monetary assets and liabilities
are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect exchange rates prevailing at that date, and non-monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated  at  the  historical  rate  of  exchange.  Gains  and  losses  arising  from  restatement  of  foreign  currency  monetary  assets  and
liabilities at each year-end are included in other comprehensive income.
l)  Other Equipment
Computer equipment is stated at cost.  Provision for depreciation on computer equipment is calculated using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful life of three years.
m)  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the costs of long-lived assets, other than oil and gas properties, may be impaired, 
and  evaluation  of  recoverability  would  be  performed.  If  an  evaluation  is  required,  the  estimated  future  undiscounted  cash  flows
associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value or discounted 
cash flow value is required.  Impairment of oil and gas properties is evaluated subject to the full cost ceiling as described under Natural
Oil and Gas Properties.
n)  Loss Per Share
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, 
“Earnings Per Share” (“SFAS 128”).  Under SFAS 128, basic and diluted earnings per share are to be presented.  Basic earnings per
share  is  computed  by  dividing  income  available  to  common  shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares
outstanding  in  the  period.  Diluted  earnings  per  share  takes  into  consideration  common  shares  outstanding  (computed  under  basic
earnings per share) and potentially dilutive common shares.
o)  Income Taxes
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences of (i) temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and their reported amounts
in the financial statements, and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, based upon management’s estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized in a future period.

p)  Financial Instruments
The  Company’s  financial  instruments  consist  of  cash  and  cash  equivalent,  GIC  receivable,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable,
accrued liabilities and amounts due to related parties.
It  is  management’s  opinion  that  the  Company  is  not  exposed  to  significant  interest  or  credit  risks  arising  from  these  financial
instruments.  The fair value of these financial instruments is approximated to their carrying values.
q)      Comprehensive Loss
SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its 
components  in the  financial statements. The Company  is  disclosing this information on  its Consolidated Statements  of Changes  in
Stockholders’ Equity and Consolidated Statement of Operations.
r)      Stock-Based Compensation
The  Company  records  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  SFAS  123(R),  “Share-Based  Payments,”  which  requires  the 
measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share-based awards made to employees 
and directors, including stock options. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB 107 relating to SFAS 123
(R). The Company applied the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123(R). 
  
SFAS 123(R) requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. 
The  Company uses  the Black-Scholes option-pricing  model  as its  method  of  determining fair value.  This model is  affected  by  the
Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are 
not limited to the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock 
option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the
statement of operations over the requisite service period. 
  
All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for
based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  or  the  fair  value  of  the  equity  instrument  issued,  whichever  is  more  reliably
measurable.

5.             NATURAL GAS AND OIL EXPLORATION RISK
a)     Exploration Risk
The  Company’s  future  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  will  depend  upon  prices  received  for  its  natural  gas  and  oil 
production  and  the  cost  of  finding,  acquiring,  developing  and  producing  reserves.  Substantially  all  of  its  production  is  sold  under
various terms and arrangements at prevailing market prices.  Prices for natural gas and oil are subject to fluctuations in response to
changes in supply, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors beyond its control.  Other factors that have a direct bearing on the
Company’s prospects are uncertainties inherent in estimating natural gas and oil reserves and future hydrocarbon production and cash 
flows, particularly with respect to wells that have not been fully tested and with wells having limited production histories; access to
additional capital; changes in the price of natural gas and oil; availability and cost of services and equipment; and the presence of
competitors with greater financial resources and capacity.

5.             NATURAL GAS AND OIL EXPLORATION RISK (Continued)
b)    Distribution Risk
Page 22 of 43
The Company is dependent on the operator to market any oil production from its wells and any subsequent production which may be
received from other wells which may be successfully drilled on the Prospect.  It relies on the operator’s ability and expertise in the 
industry to successfully market the same.  Prices at which the operator sells gas/oil both in intrastate and interstate commerce; will be
subject to the availability of pipe lines, demand and other factors beyond the control of the operator.  The Company and the operator
believe any oil produced can be readily sold to a number of buyers.
c)    Credit Risk
A substantial portion of the Corporation’s accounts receivable is with joint venture partners in the oil and gas industry and is subject to 
normal industry credit risks.
d)   Foreign Operations Risk
The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, political risks, price controls and varying forms of fiscal regimes or changes
thereto which may impair its ability to conduct profitable operations as it operates internationally and holds foreign denominated cash
and other assets.
6.             ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The  Company  follows  SFAS  143  “Accounting  for  asset  retirement  obligations”.  SFAS  143  addresses  financial  accounting  and 
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.  SFAS 
143 requires recognition of the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in 
which it is incurred.  As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we recognized the future cost to plug and abandon the gas
wells  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  wells  in  accordance  with  SFAS  No.  143.  The  liability  for  the  fair  value  of  an  asset
retirement obligation with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the related long-lived asset is recorded at the time a well is 
completed and ready for production.  The Company amortizes the amount added to the oil and gas properties and recognizes accretion
expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the respective well.  The estimated liability is based on
historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells, estimated useful lives based on engineering studies, external estimates as to
the cost to plug and abandon wells in the future and federal and state regulatory requirements.  The liability is a discounted liability
using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate of 12%.
Revisions  to  the  liability  could  occur  due  to  changes  in  plugging  and  abandonment  costs,  well  useful  lives  or  if  federal  or  state
regulators enact new guidance on the plugging and abandonment of wells.
The  Company  amortizes  the  amount  added  to  oil  and  gas  properties  and  recognizes  accretion  expense  in  connection  with  the
discounted liability over the remaining useful lives of the respective wells.
The information below reflects the change in the asset retirement obligations during the three months period ended March 31, 2009 and

Business of Delta Oil 
  
We are an exploration company focused on developing North American oil and natural gas reserves. Our current focus is on the exploration of
our  land  portfolio  comprised  of  working  interests  in  acreage  in  Palmetto  Point,  Mississippi;  Southern  Saskatchewan,  Canada;  the  Southern
Alberta Foothills area in Canada; and South Central, Oklahoma.  As a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in The Stallion Group, a
Nevada  corporation,  which  is  discussed  below,  we  expanded  our  property  interests  to  include  acreage  in  the  North  Sacramento  Valley,
California. 
 
Acquisition of Controlling Interest in The Stallion Group 
  
On  October  7,  2008,  we  announced  the  commencement  of  our  offer  to  purchase  (the  “Offer”)  all  of  the  outstanding  common  shares  (the 
“Shares”) of The Stallion Group (“Stallion”), a Nevada corporation (“Stallion”), in exchange for 0.333333 shares of our common stock and 
$0.0008 cash per share of Stallion, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the prospectus accompanying the Offer. 
 
The Offer expired on March 26, 2009 and thereafter we notified the depository to take and pay for all of the common shares of Stallion that
were validly tendered in connection with our previously-announced tender offer. The depository advised us that, as of the expiration of the
Offer,  58,635,139 shares  of  Stallion  common  stock  had  been  validly  tendered,  representing  80.31%  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  common
shares of Stallion. 
 
All validly tendered common shares of Stallion were accepted for payment in accordance with the terms of the Offer, pursuant to which each
validly tendered common share of Stallion was exchanged for 0.333333 of a share of our common stock and $0.0008 in cash pursuant to the
Offer. 
 
Based  on  the  number  of  common  shares  validly  tendered  in  the  Offer  and  the  exchange  ratio  set  forth  above,  we  issued  approximately
19,545,026 shares of our common stock and paid approximately $46,908 in cash pursuant to the Offer. 
  
Hillspring Prospect 
  
On November 26, 2004, through our wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Delta Oil & Gas (Canada), Inc., we entered into an agreement (the
"Agreement") with Win Energy Corporation, ("Win Energy"), an Alberta based oil & gas exploration company, in order to acquire an interest in
leases owned by Win Energy. On or about January 25, 2005, we paid Win Energy $414,766 in exchange for a 10% working interest in one
section  of  land  (640  acres)  in  Hillspring  located  approximately  90  miles  south  of  Calgary,  Alberta  in  the  Southern  Alberta  Foothills
belt.  During the three months ended March 31, 2009, management reassessed its participation in this project and determined to abandon this
project due to concerns regarding its profitability.  We did not incur and cost in connection with our abandonment of this project and do not
anticipate incurring any future costs.

Strachan Prospect 
  
On September 23, 2005, we entered into the Farmout Agreement with Odin Capital Inc. (“Odin Capital”), a Calgary, Alberta corporation. A 
former member of our board of directors, Mr. Philipchuk, maintains a 50% ownership interest in Odin Capital. Odin Capital had the right to
acquire  an  oil  and  gas  leasehold  interests  in  certain  lands  located  in  Section  9,  Township  38,  Range  9,  West  of  the  5th  Meridian,  Alberta,
Canada (“Section 9”) upon incurring expenditures for drilling and testing on the property. In exchange for us paying 4.0% of all costs associated
with drilling, testing, and completing the test well on the property which we refer to as the Leduc formation test well, we will have earned:
(b)    a 4.0% interest in the natural gas in the Leduc formation before payout, subject to payment of the Overriding Royalty which is
(a)    a 2.0% interest in the petroleum and natural gas below the base of the Mannville, excluding natural gas in the Leduc formation; and
1.  in the Spacing Unit for the Earning Well:
convertible upon payout at royalty owners option to 50% of our Interest;
2.  a 1.6% interest in the rights below the base of the Shunda formation in Section 10, Township 38, Range 9W5M; and
 3.  a 1.289% interest in the rights below the base of the Shunda formation in Section 15 and 16, Township 38, Range 9W5M, down to the
base of the deepest formation penetrated.
On October 6, 2005, drilling commenced on the Leduc formation test well. Under the terms of the Farmout Agreement, we advanced 110% of
the anticipated costs prior to drilling. The total costs advanced by us prior to drilling were $347,431. The well was drilled to the targeted depth
of 13,650 feet.  During the three month period ended September 30, 2007, we paid additional drilling costs of $41,231 and have since incurred
no additional drilling costs. 
  
Based on results indicating the presence of a potential gas well, the operator inserted casing into the total depth of the well in July 2006 and we
have  committed  to  perform  a  full  testing  program.  During  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2008,  testing  showed  that  no  economic
hydrocarbons were present, the well was abandoned and  the costs of $388,662 was transferred to the proven cost pool for depletion. 
  
Palmetto Point Prospect - 12 Wells Phase - I 
  
On February 21, 2006, we entered into an agreement with 0743608 B.C. Ltd., (“Assignor”), a British Columbia based oil and gas exploration 
company,  in  order  to  accept  an  assignment  of  the  Assignor’s  10%  gross  working  and  revenue  interest  in  a  ten-well  drilling  program  (the 
“Drilling  Program”)  to  be  undertaken  by  Griffin  &  Griffin  Exploration  L.L.C.  (“Griffin  Exploration”),  a  Mississippi  based  exploration 
company.  Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  we  paid  the  Assignor  $425,000  as  payment  for  the  assignment  of  the  Assignor’s  10%  gross 
working and revenue interest in the Drilling Program. We also entered into a Joint Operating Agreement directly with Griffin Exploration on
February 24, 2006.

The initial Drilling Program on ten wells on the acquired property interest was completed by Griffin Exploration. On August 4, 2006, we paid
$70,000  to  Griffin  Exploration  in  exchange  for  our  participation  in  an  additional  two  well  program,  which  has  also  been  completed.  The
prospect area owned or controlled by Griffin Exploration on which the wells were drilled is comprised of approximately 1,273 acres in Palmetto
Point, Mississippi. All twelve wells have been drilled and currently seven wells are producing, we anticipate that three wells will be producing
and are currently waiting to be tied into the pipeline, and two wells were not commercially viable and were plugged and abandoned. We refer to
this  drilling  program  as  Palmetto  Point  Phase  I.  Total  revenue  received  from  these  wells  for  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2009  was
$1,948, compared with $13,573 in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  The decrease in revenue was attributable by a halt in
production in wells that had higher than expected water content and a decline in the price of natural gas in the three months ended March 31,
2009 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2008. 
 
In October 2007, as part of Palmetto Point Phase I, we drilled a well (the "PP F-12") on the prospect.  Subsequent testing revealed that the PP F-
12  well  contained  oil  reserves  suitable  for  commercial  production.  The  PP  F-12  well  began  producing  on  October  2,  2007.   This  well  is 
situated in what is known as the Belmont Lake Oil Field.  Based on the positive results from the PP F-12 well, the operator suggested drilling an 
additional two development wells in the immediate vicinity in which we would participate.  In November 2007, we participated in the drilling of
a  step-out  well  from  the  PP  F-12  (the  “PP  F-12  #2”).  This  well  was  drilled  to  total  depth,  logged,  tested  and  cased.   The  PP  F-12  #2 
encountered approximately three feet of hydrocarbon showings and as such the operator recommended re-entering the well and directionally 
drilling  on  an  angle  toward  the  PP  F-12.  Upon  completion  and  testing  of  this  re-entry  (the  “PP  F-12  #2-3”),  the  operator  encountered 
approximately  32  feet  of  hydrocarbon  pay  and  the  well  was  connected  to  a  nearby  pipeline  and  is  currently  producing  oil.  Total  revenue
received from these two oil wells was $4,503 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 compared to $35,524 for the three months ended
March  31,  2008.  The  decrease  in  revenue  was  attributable  to  a  decline  in  the  price  of  oil  in  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2009,  as
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2008, and our disposition of these working interests which was given effect on February 1,
2009. 
 
Subsequent  to  the  reporting  period,  we  disposed  of  our  interests  in  the  Palmetto  Point  Prospect  -  12  Wells  Phase  -  I  project  described 
above.  Although our disposition of these interests occurred subsequent to the reporting period, it was determined by the parties to be effective
as of February 1, 2009. 
 
Palmetto Point Prospect - 50 wells – Phase II 
  
During  the  fiscal quarter ended  September  30, 2006, we  entered  into a  joint venture  agreement  to acquire an  interest  in a drilling program
comprised of up to fifty natural gas and/or oil wells. The area in which the wells are being drilled is approximately 300,000 gross acres located 
between  Southwest  Mississippi  and  Northeastern  Louisiana.  Drilling  commenced  in  September  2006.  The  site  of  the  first  twenty  wells  is
located within range to tie into existing pipeline infrastructure should

the wells be suitable for commercial production. The drilling program was conducted by Griffin Exploration in its capacity as operator. We
agreed  to  pay  10%  of  all  prospect  fees,  mineral  leases,  surface  leases,  and  drilling  and  completion  costs  to  earn  a  net  8.0%  share  of  all
production zones to the base of a geological formation referred to as the Frio formation and 7.5% of all production to the base of a geological
formation referred to as the Wilcox formation. The cost during the quarter ending September 30, 2006 amounted to $100,000. During the fourth
quarter  of  fiscal  2006,  we  made  additional  payments  of  $300,000  that  was  employed  in  the  further  development  of  prospects  on  lands  in
Mississippi and Louisiana in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement. 
  
We acquired through our acquisition of a controlling interest of The Stallion Group an additional interest in this same drilling 
program.  Pursuant to the agreement entered into by Stallion on August 2, 2006, Stallion agreed to pay 30% of all prospect fees, mineral leases, 
surface leases, and drilling and completion costs to earn a net 19.2% share of all production zones to the base of a geological formation referred 
to as the Frio formation and 17.25% of all production to the base of a geological formation referred to as the Wilcox formation.  Stallion’s cost 
during the quarter ending September 30, 2006 amounted to $300,000. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Stallion made additional 
payments of $600,000 that was employed in the further development of prospects on lands in Mississippi and Louisiana in accordance with the 
terms of the operating agreement.  As a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest of Stallion, we are now obligated to pay 40% of all 
prospect fees, mineral leases, surface leases, and drilling and completion costs to earn a net 27.2% share of all production zones to the base of a 
geological formation referred to as the Frio formation and 24.75% of all production to the base of a geological formation referred to as the 
Wilcox formation 
  
Neither we nor Stallion incurred any additional payments other than drilling costs for these prospects in 2008 or 2007.  We do not anticipate that 
we will incur any additional payments other than drilling costs for these prospects going forward. 
  
To date, seven wells have been drilled, of which two have been abandoned (the Dixon #1 and the Randall #1).  Our costs attributable to these
two abandoned wells was $67,523 in the aggregate. Of the successful four wells, the Redbug #1, Redbug #2 and the Buffalo River #1 began
producing  in  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2007  and  the  Faust  #1,  is  awaiting  connection  to  the  nearby  pipeline  for  production.  The
revenue received from these wells for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $0 as compared to $69,423 for the three months ended
March 31, 2008.  During the three months ended March 31, 2008, $25,018 of the revenue received from these wells was attributable to our
working interest in the drilling program and $44,405 was attributable to the working interest held by Stallion.  The decrease in revenue was
attributable to a decline in commodity prices in the three months ended March 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2008
and the suspension of production on wells due to a high water content. 
  
Subsequent to the reporting period on April 3, 2009, we disposed of our entire interests in the Palmetto Point Prospect 12 Wells Phase - I and 50 
wells – Phase II projects in exchange for $200,367.  Although our disposition of these interests occurred subsequent to the reporting period, it
was determined by the parties to be effective as of February 1, 2009.

Wordsworth Prospect 
  
On April 10, 2006, we entered into a farmout, option and participation letter agreement (“FOP Agreement”) where we acquired a 15% working 
interest in certain leasehold interests located in southeast Saskatchewan, Canada referred to as the Wordsworth area for the purchase price of
$152,724. We are responsible for our proportionate share of the costs associated with drilling, testing, and completing the first test well on the
property. In exchange for us paying our proportionate share of the costs associated with drilling, testing, and completing the first test well on the
property, we earned a 15% working interest before payout and a 7.5% working interest after payout on the Wordsworth prospect. Payout refers
to the return of our initial investment in the property. In addition, we also acquired an option to participate and acquire a working interest in a
vertical test well drilled to 1200 meters to test the Mississippian (Alida) formation in LSD 13 of section 24, township 7, range 3 W2.  Our total
costs as at December 31, 2007 was $222,649. 
 
During June 2006, the first well was drilled to a horizontal depth of 2033 meters in the Wordsworth prospect. The initial drilling of this well and
subsequent  testing  revealed  that  this  well  contained  oil  reserves  suitable  for  commercial  production.  In  June  2006,  this  initial  well  began
producing as an oil well.  In December 2008, a second well was drilled and completed which started production in January 2009.  The revenue
received from these wells for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $39,815, as compared to $29,430 for the three months ended March
31, 2008.  The increase in revenue was attributable the production of a second well on this prospect, but we generated less revenue than we
anticipated as a result of a decline in oil prices during the three months ended March 31, 2009. 
  
The second horizontal well was drilled in May 2007 at a cost of $198,152. Initial logs indicated hydrocarbon showings in an oil-bearing zone 
estimated to be approximately 770 feet in the horizontal section. However, due to the high water content in fluid removed from this well, the
operator determined that it was not commercially productive and it was plugged and abandoned. 
  
In April 2008, the operator recommended re-entering the second horizontal well with a view to drilling horizontally in a different direction 
starting at the base of the vertical portion of that well. We elected to participate in this re-entry on the same terms and conditions as the previous 
wells.  This well was drilled at a cost of $33,812. No economic hydrocarbons were found and this well was plugged and abandoned. 
  
Owl Creek Prospect 
  
On June 1, 2006, we entered into an Assignment Agreement with Brinx Resources, Ltd., (“Brinx Resources”), a Nevada oil & gas exploration 
company,  in  order  to  acquire  a  working  interest  in  lands  and  leases  owned  by  Brinx  Resources.  The  purchase  price  of  $300,000  for  the
assignment and options to acquire future interests has been paid in full. We paid a further $68,987 for our proportion of costs associated with the
completion of the first well. The lands are located in Garvin and McClain counties in Oklahoma and we refer to the lands as the “Owl Creek 
Prospect.”

Pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we acquired a 20% working interest in an oil well drilled at the Owl Creek Prospect (the 
“Powell #2”).  The Powell #2 was drilled to total depth of 5,617 feet on May 18, 2006 and underwent testing. Based upon the positive result of 
the testing of the Powell #2, this well was completed and commercial production commenced in August 2006.  Under the terms of the 
Assignment Agreement, we are responsible for our proportionate share of the costs of completion and tie-in for production of the Powell #2 
which was $68,987.  Initially, the Powell #2 began flowing oil and natural gas under its own pressure without the assistance of a 
pump.  Revenue generated from the Powell #2 for the three months ended March 31, 2008 was $76,569.  In July 2008, the Company disposed 
of its holdings in Powell #2 and the surrounding area for aggregate consideration of $760,438. 
  
As part of the Assignment Agreement, we were granted an option to earn a 20% working interest in any future wells drilled on the 1,120 acres
of land, which make up the Owl Creek Prospect. Lastly, we received an option to earn a 20% working interest in any future wells to be drilled
on any land of mutual interest acquired by the Owl Creek participants in and around the same area. The working interest in future wells is
earned  by  paying  20%  of  the  costs  of  drilling  and  completing  each  additional  well.  Prior  to  drilling,  we  are  provided  an  invoice  for  the
anticipated costs of each proposed well and given the option to participate. 
  
Based upon the positive results of the Powell #2, an additional well (the “Isbill #1-36”) was drilled and reached targeted depth in September 
2006. However, test results showed that the well was not commercially viable and it was plugged and abandoned in September 2006.  Costs of
$80,738 were transferred to proved reserves and subsequently depleted in accordance with our accounting policy. 
  
In January 2007, we commenced drilling of another well (the “Isbill #2-36”). Our 20% working interest in the Isbill #2-36 cost $157,437 for 
both drilling and completion. The Isbill #2-36 was drilled to approximately 5,900 feet and encountered two potential pay zones and is a direct
offset well to the Powell #2 which is currently producing.  The revenue received from the Isbill #2-36 for the three months ended March 31, 
2008 was $55,085.  In July 2008, the Company disposed of its holdings in Isbill #2-36 and the surrounding area for aggregate consideration of 
$549,388. 
 
In  July,  2008,  we  sold  both  the  Powell  #2  and  Isbill  #2-36  wells  and  all  interest  in  the  Owl  Creek  Prospect  for  gross  proceeds  of 
$1,309,826.  We realized a gain on sale of the property of $1,067,447.  We decided to dispose of the property based on the declining rates of
production experienced by the operator and the reasonable offer for both wells and the surrounding lands of 1,120 acres. 
  
2006-3 Drilling Program 
  
On April 17, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Ranken Energy Corporation (“Ranken Energy”) to participate in a five well drilling
program in Garvin and Murray counties in Oklahoma (the “2006-3 drilling Program”).  The leases secured and/or lands to be pooled for this 
drilling program total approximately 820 net acres. We agreed to take a 10% working interest in this program. To date, we have paid Ranken
Energy the sum of $514,619.

Three wells drilled (the "Wolf #1-7", the "Loretta #1-22" and the “Ruggles #1-15") were deemed by the operator to not be commercially viable 
and as such, were plugged and abandoned.  The proportionate costs associated with these abandoned wells amounted to $244,989, which were
moved to the proved properties cost pool for depletion. 
  
Three other wells drilled (the “Elizabeth #1-25”, the “Plaster #1-1” and the “Dale #1 re-entry”) were deemed by the operator to be commercially 
viable and production casing was set in each.    The Elizabeth #1-25 located in the Meridian Prospect cost $99,129, the Plaster #1-1 located in 
the Plaster Prospect cost $116,581, and re-entry into the Dale #1 located in the Dale Prospect cost $18,150.  Subsequent to the completion of 
these wells, two remain economically viable at this time.  The Plaster #1 encountered hydrocarbon showings and is producing natural gas with
amounts  of associated  oil  as  of  January, 2008. The  Dale  #1  re-entry  has been  producing  in the  range  of  2  to 3  barrels  of  oil per day.  The
Elizabeth #1-25 has been plugged and abandoned.  Total revenue received from these wells for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was
$801, as compared to $4,075 for the three months ended March 31, 2008.   The reduction in revenue was caused by a suspension of production
in the Dale #1 and a decline in oil prices in the three months ended March 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2008. 
 
The operator, Ranken Energy, is reviewing the productivity levels from these wells and may propose the drilling of additional wells in the Dale
Prospect and the Crazy Horse Prospect.  We anticipate that we would participate in these wells to the same extent as in the original drilling
program, which is a 10% working interest. 
  
2007-1 Drilling Program - 3 Wells 
  
On September 10, 2007, we entered into an agreement with Ranken Energy to participate in a three well drilling program in Garvin County,
Oklahoma (the “2007-1 Drilling Program”).  We purchased a 20% working interest in the 2007-1 Drilling Program for $77,100. Drilling of the 
first and second wells (the “Pollock #1-35” and the “Hulsey #1”) has been completed in the N.E. Anitoch Prospect and the Washington Creek 
Prospect respectively.  The Pollock #1-35 did not prove to be commercially viable but the Hulsey #1 has been producing in the range of 50 to
60 barrels of oil per day with approximately 50 Mcf of natural gas per day.  Drilling of the third well in this drilling program (the “River #1”) 
was completed during the three months ended September 30, 2008.  River #1 commenced production and the total revenue received from the
River #1 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $12,408.  Hulsey #1-8 started producing during the first quarter of 2008 and the total 
revenue received from the Hulsey #1-8 for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $5,374, as compared to $5,601 for the three months
ended  March  31,  2008.  Hulsey  #2-8  commenced  production  during  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2009  and  produced  $3,323  in  oil 
revenues. 
 
Willows Gas Field 
 
On  February  15,  2008,  Stallion  entered  into  a  Farm  Out  Agreement  with  Production  Specialties  Company  (“Production  Specialties”)  for 
participation in a natural gas prospect area located in the North Sacramento Valley, California.  Stallion has participated in the drilling of the
first  well  on  the  prospect  area  and  encountered  a  number  of  prospective  pay  zones.   Testing  has  been  completed  and  stabilized  flow  rates
exceeded a combined 1.5 million cubic feet per day of sweet high quality gas, the well has been connected to a nearby pipeline and has begun
producing natural gas.

Stallion drilled its first prospect well paying  12.5% of the costs of the first well to earn a 6.5% Working Interest. Thereafter, Stallion will pay
6.5% of the costs of future wells to earn 6.5% Working Interest.  Total costs for this prospect for the end of the quarter ended November 30,
2008 is $255,887.  Revenue received from the initial discovery well was $319 for the three months ended March 31, 2009.  The lower than
expected performance from this well was caused by a reduction in natural gas prices.  We will review the ongoing economic viability of this
well taking into account the current commodity price outlook. 
 
For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 
  
Revenues 
  
We generated total revenue of $68,051 for the three months ended March 31, 2009, an decrease of approximately 79% from revenues of 
$321,695 for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  Our revenue generated during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 was 
entirely attributable to natural gas and oil sales.  The decrease in total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2009, when compared to 
the three months ended March 31, 2008, was primarily attributable to the disposal of our interests in the Owl Creek Prospect and Palmetto Point 
Prospect 12 Wells Phase - I and 50 wells – Phase II projects coupled with a decline in natural gas and oil prices in the three months ended 
March 31, 2009 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2008. 
 
Costs and Expenses 
  
We incurred costs and expenses in the amount of $ 281,288 for the three months ended March 31, 2009, a 74% decrease from costs and 
expenses of $1,074,461 for three months ended March 31, 2008. 
  
The decrease in costs and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009, when compared the three months ended March 31, 2008, is 
primarily attributable to the following factors: 
  
General and administrative costs for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased to $92,325 from $245,780 for the three months ended 
March 31, 2008, a decrease of 62%.  The decrease in general and administrative costs was caused by a reduction in stock based compensation 
expense attributable to the issuances of stock options and shares of common stock.  Stock based compensation expense for the three months 
ended March 31, 2009 was $0 as compared to $103,024 for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  Further reductions in administrative costs 
was due to foreign exchange gains increasing to $35,326, from $659 for the three months ended March 31, 2008, as the Canadian dollar 
weakened against the U.S. dollar. 
  
Natural gas and oil operating costs for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased to $36,773 from $72,277 for the three months ended 
March 31, 2008, an decrease of 49%. The decrease in natural gas and oil operating costs is attributable to disposal of our interests in the Owl 
Creek Prospect and Palmetto Point Prospect 12 Wells Phase - I and 50 wells – Phase II projects for the three months ended March 31, 2009, as 
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2008.

Depreciation and depletion expense for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased to $20,763 from $159,145 for the three months ended 
March 31, 2008, a decrease of 87%. The decrease in depreciation and depletion expense is attributable to the disposal of our interests in the Owl 
Creek Prospect and Palmetto Point Prospect 12 Wells Phase - I and 50 wells – Phase II projects, which was partially offset by additional 
uneconomic wells that were moved to the proved property pool for depletion; and 
  
Impairment of natural gas and oil properties expense for the three months ended March 31, 2009 decreased to $130,692 from $593,905 for the 
three months ended March 31, 2008, an decrease of 78%.  The substantial decrease in impairment of natural gas and oil properties expense for 
the three months ended March 31, 2009, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2008, is attributable to a decline in natural gas and 
oil prices in the three months ended March 31, 2009, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2008, which adversely impacts the third 
party valuation of our properties resulting in a reduction in carrying value of reserves. 
 
Net Operating Loss 
  
The net operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $213,237, compared to a net operating loss of $752,766 for the three 
months ended March 31, 2008 due to the factors described above. 
 
Other Income and Expense 
  
We reported other net income of $2,959 for the three months ended March 31, 2009, as compared to other income of $252 in the three months 
ended March 31, 2008. Other income was attributable to interest received on bank deposits. 
 
Net Loss 
  
Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $215,337, compared to a net loss of $669,475 for the three months ended March 31, 
2008. The reduction in loss for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was attributable to a reduction in operating expenses. 
  
There are material events and uncertainties which could cause our reported financial information to not to be indicative of future operating 
results or financial condition.  Our inability to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect 
our results of operations.  The success of any acquisition depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the ability to estimate 
accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from the reserves and to assess 
possible environmental liabilities.  Drilling for oil and natural gas may also involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from 
wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs. In addition, wells 
that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return.  Our ability to achieve our target results are also dependent upon the current and 
future market prices for crude oil and natural gas, costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an 
acceptable

cost.  We do not operate the properties in which we have an interest and we have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these
properties or their associated costs.  Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability
to influence operations and associated costs could materially adversely affect the realization of our returns on capital in drilling or acquisition
activities and our targeted production growth rate. As a result, our historical results should not be indicative of future operations. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  
As of March 31, 2009, we had total current assets of $865,566 and total current liabilities in the amount of $165,756.  As a result, we had 
working capital of $699,810 as of March 31, 2009. 
  
The revenue we currently generate from natural gas and oil sales does not exceed our operating expenses.  As such, we anticipate that we will 
require additional financing activities including issuance of our equity or debt securities to fund our operations and proposed drilling activities 
beyond the year ended December 31, 2009.  During the three months March 31, 2009, we received $0 from financing activities involving loan 
issuance.   We received $0 from financing activities involving share issuances for the three months March 31, 2009, compared to $90,000 for 
the three months March 31, 2008. 
  
We will require additional funds to expand our acquisition, exploration and production of natural oil and gas properties.  Our management also 
anticipates that the current cash on hand may not be sufficient to fund our continued operations at the current level for the next twelve 
months.  Additional capital will be required to effectively expand our operations through the acquisition and drilling of new prospects and to 
implement our overall business strategy.  It is uncertain whether we will be able to obtain financing when sought or obtain it on terms 
acceptable to us.  If we are unable to obtain additional financing, the full implementation of our ability to expand our operations will be 
impaired.  Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing shareholders. 
 
Cash Used in Operating Activities 
  
Operating activities used $68,701 in cash for the three months March 31, 2009, compared to $201,745 in cash generated from operating 
activities for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  Our negative cash flow for the three months March 31, 2009 was caused by a decline in 
revenues. 
 
Cash Used in Investing Activities 
  
Cash flows used by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $58,445, compared to $333,480 cash used in investing 
activities for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  All cash used in investment activities during the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 
2008 related to investments in natural gas and oil working interests.

Cash from Financing Activities 
  
Cash flows used by financing activities for the three months March 31, 2009  primarily consisted of $47,075 related to the cost of registration of 
shares under the Form S-4 in relation to the Offer to acquire shares of Stallion, compared to $90,000 in cash provided from financing activities 
for the three months ended March 31, 2008. 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  
We do not have any off-balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations) or
other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions,
changes in the financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenue
or expenses. 
 
Going Concern 
  
As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we have incurred a net loss of $3,789,099 since inception.  To achieve profitable 
operations, we require additional capital for obtaining producing oil and gas properties through either the purchase of producing wells or 
successful exploration activity.  We believe that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to meet our business objectives, including 
anticipated cash needs for working capital and are currently evaluating several financing options.  However, there can be no assurances offered 
in this regard.  As a result of the foregoing, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
Critical Accounting Policies 
  
In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management Discussion and 
Analysis.  The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company’s financial 
condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make 
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition. 
 
Oil and Gas Joint Ventures 
  
All exploration and production activities are conducted jointly with others and, accordingly, the accounts reflect only our proportionate interest 
in such activities. 
 
Natural Gas and Oil Properties 
  
We account for our oil and gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting as prescribed by the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  Accordingly, all costs associated with the acquisition of properties and exploration with the intent of finding 
proved oil and gas reserves contribute to the discovery of proved reserves, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical 
costs, and annual lease rentals are capitalized.  All general

corporate costs are expensed as incurred. In general, sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to
capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded.  Amortization of evaluated oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method
based on all proved reserves on a country-by-country basis.  Unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed at least annually for impairment 
either individually or on an aggregate basis.  The net capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties (full cost ceiling limitation) are not to
exceed their related estimated future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at 10%, and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of
unproved properties, net of tax considerations.  These properties are included in the amortization pool immediately upon the determination that
the well is dry. 
  
Unproved properties consist of lease acquisition costs and costs on well currently being drilled on the properties.  The recorded costs of the 
investment in unproved properties are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until they are 
impaired. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed at least annually for impairment either individually or on an aggregate basis. 
 
Revenue Recognition 
  
Revenue from sales of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products are recorded when deliveries have occurred and legal ownership of 
the commodity transfers to the customers. Title transfers for crude oil, natural gas and bulk refined products generally occur at pipeline custody 
points or when a tanker lifting has occurred.  Revenues from the production of oil and natural gas properties in which we share an undivided 
interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes sold by us during the period.  Gas imbalances occur when our actual 
sales differ from its entitlement under existing working interests.  We record a liability for gas imbalances when we have sold more than our 
working interest of gas production and the estimated remaining reserves make it doubtful that the partners can recoup their share of production 
from the field.  At March 31, 2009 and 2008, we had no overproduced imbalances.

Item 4T.       Controls and Procedures 
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of March 31, 2009.  This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of
our former Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Douglas Bolen, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Kulwant Sandher.  Based upon that evaluation,
our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2009, our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective. 
 
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC's  rules  and  forms.  Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  include,  without  limitation,  controls  and  procedures  designed  to  ensure  that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls 
 
Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily
prevent  all fraud  and  material error.  Our disclosure  controls and procedures  are designed to  provide reasonable  assurance  of achieving our
objectives and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at
that reasonable assurance level.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide  absolute  assurance  that  all  control  issues  and  instances  of  fraud,  if  any,  within  our  company  have  been  detected.  These  inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or
mistake.  Additionally,  controls  can  be  circumvented  by  the  individual  acts  of  some  persons,  by  collusion  of  two  or  more  people,  or  by
management override of the internal control.  The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions.  Over  time,  control  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or
procedures may deteriorate. 
 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 that have materially 
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect such controls.
