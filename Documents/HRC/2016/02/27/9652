<p><b>A</b> 
</p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming </i>the responsibility of the international community to promote human rights and 
ensure respect for international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the particularity of The Occupied East Jerusalem in its rich religious and 
cultural heritage, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> all relevant United Nations resolutions including Security Council resolutions on 
Occupied East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned at </i>the actions by Israel undermining the sanctity and inviolability of 
religious sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned also</i> at the policy of closure and severe restrictions of Israel, including 
the permit regime, which continue to be imposed on the movement of Palestinians hindering 
their free access to their Christian and Muslim holy sites, including Al- Aqsa Mosque, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all policies and measures taken by Israel, the occupying Power, 
including those limiting access of Palestinians to their properties and holy sites particularly in 
Occupied East Jerusalem, on the basis of national origin, religion, sex, age or any other 
discriminatory ground, which are in grave violation of the Palestinian People's civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Condemns further </i>the recent violations of human rights by Israel in Occupied East 
Jerusalem, particularly the confiscation of lands and properties, the demolishing of houses and 
private properties, the construction and expansion of settlements, the continuous construction of </p>

the separation Wall, changing the demographic and geographic character of East Jerusalem, the 
restrictions on the freedom of movement of the Palestinian citizens of East Jerusalem, as well as 
the continuous digging and excavation works in and around Al-Aqsa mosque and its vicinity; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Demands </i>Israel, the occupying Power, to respect the religious and cultural rights in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory as provided for  in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the core international human rights instruments, the Hague Conventions, and the Geneva

properties and religious sites therein; </p>
<p>4. <i>Also demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately cease all digging and 
excavation works and activities beneath and around Al-Aqsa Mosque and its vicinity, and refrain 
from any acts or operations that may endanger the structure or foundations or change the nature 
of holy sites both Christian and Islamic in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem; </p>
<p>5. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, pursuant to 
resolution S-9/1 of 12 January 2009 and in the context of her periodic reports, to monitor, 
document and report on the state of implementation by Israel, the occupying Power, of its human 
rights obligations in and around East Jerusalem;  </p>
<p><b>B 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that the promotion of respect for the obligations arising from the Charter and 
other instruments and rules of international law is among the basic purposes and principles of the

<p><i> Acknowledging </i>that peace, security, development and human rights are the pillars of the 
United Nations system,

humanitarian law, namely the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian

</p>
<p><i> Expressing serious</i> <i>concern</i> at the lack of implementation by the occupying Power, Israel, 
of previously adopted resolutions and recommendations of the Council relating to the human 
rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>its resolution S-9/1 of 12 January 2009, in which the Council decided to dispatch 
an urgent, independent international fact-finding mission, and its call upon the occupying Power, 
Israel, not to obstruct the process of investigation and to fully cooperate with the mission,   </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-12/1 
page 5 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Condemning</i> all targeting of civilians and stressing the urgent need to ensure 
accountability for all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian

Convention, and <i>reaffirming</i> that each High Contracting Party to the Fourth Geneva Convention 
relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is under the obligation to respect 
and ensure the respect for the obligations arising from that Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that the right to life constitutes the most fundamental of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the siege by Israel imposed on the occupied Gaza Strip, including its 
closure of border crossings and the cutting of the supply of fuel, food and medicine, constitutes 
collective punishment of Palestinian civilians and leads to disastrous humanitarian and 
environmental consequences,
