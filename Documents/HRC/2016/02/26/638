<p>in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, and bearing in mind the 
</p>
<p>importance of the Optional Protocols to the Convention, and calling for their universal 
</p>
<p>ratification and effective implementation, as well as that of other relevant human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions on the rights of the child of the Commission on

<p>including non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, survival and development, and 
</p>
<p>participation, provide the framework for all actions concerning children, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and of other

<p><i>Affirming</i> that investing in children is critical to achieving inclusive, equitable and 
</p>
<p>sustainable human development for present and future generations, and delivers benefits to 
</p>
<p>society and the economy at large, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that investing in quality education and health services tailored for 
</p>
<p>children is a critical component of fulfilling the State&#8217;s duties and responsibilities to 
</p>
<p>respect, promote and protect the rights of the child, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that children constitute more than 30 per cent of the world 
</p>
<p>population and even more than 50 per ent of the population in some countries, and 
</p>
<p>expressing deep concern that, while States have developed and improved legal frameworks 
</p>
<p>for children, the lack of sufficient, efficient, inclusive and equitable public investment in 
</p>
<p>children remains one of the main barriers to realizing the rights of the child, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that one billion children are deprived of one of more essential 
</p>
<p>services for their survival and development, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that economic policies are not neutral in their effect on children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that comprehensive investment in the rights of the child is broader than 
</p>
<p>the mobilization, budgeting and spending of public resources, 
</p>
<p><i>Conscious</i> that the realization of the rights of the child may be affected by a range of 
</p>
<p>factors, such as financial or economic crisis, illicit financial flows, emergencies, terrorism, 
</p>
<p>armed conflict, inadequate legal protection, the adverse impact of climate change, natural 
</p>
<p>disasters, food and water insecurity, poverty, or global inequalities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that long-term debt may have an impact on States&#8217; ability to mobilize 
</p>
<p>resources for the protection and realization of the rights of the child, and stressing in this 
</p>
<p>regard the importance of effective debt management as an element in ensuring long-term 
</p>
<p>debt sustainability, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that extreme poverty and social exclusion persist in all countries 
</p>
<p>of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, that their extent and 
</p>
<p>manifestations are particularly severe in developing countries, and that children are among 
</p>
<p>those in the most vulnerable situations, and noting that the girl child experiences particular 
</p>
<p>vulnerabilities as a consequence of multiple forms of discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that transparent, inclusive, participatory and accountable governance 
</p>
<p>and fiscal processes play a critical role in combating corruption and ensuring efficient 
</p>
<p>resource mobilization, allocation and spending for the protection and realization of 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that equitable, sustained and broad-based investment in children for the 
</p>
<p>protection and realization of their rights lays the foundation for a just society, a strong 
</p>
<p>economy and a world free of poverty, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the enhancement of international cooperation to support national 
</p>
<p>efforts in the field of human rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, including the effective promotion and protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>including the rights of the child, </p>


<p>1. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights entitled &#8220;Towards better investment in the rights of the 
</p>
<p>child&#8221;;<footnote name="8">A/HRC/28/33. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to ensure the enjoyment by children of all their human 
</p>
<p>rights, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, without 
</p>
<p>discrimination of any kind, and emphasizes in this regard the fundamental link between 
</p>
<p>laws, policies and budgets and the responsibility of States to ensure that relevant national 
</p>
<p>laws and policies are translated into transparent, participatory and accountable budgets and 
</p>
<p>spending for the promotion, protection and realization of the rights of the child; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative, 
</p>
<p>judicial and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognized in the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child and, with regard to economic, social, and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights, to take such measures to the maximum extent of their available resources and, where 
</p>
<p>needed, within the framework of international cooperation; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Affirms</i> that investment in children has high economic and social returns, and 
</p>
<p>that all related efforts to ensure resources allocated and spent for children should serve as 
</p>
<p>an instrument for the fulfilment of children&#8217;s rights; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Stresses</i> that the primary responsibility for the creation and maintenance of an 
</p>
<p>enabling environment for securing the well-being of children, in which the rights of each 
</p>
<p>and every child are promoted, protected, respected and fulfilled, rests within each State, and 
</p>
<p>that effective and equitable investment is required for this purpose, recognizing that 
</p>
<p>additional resources, both national and international, are required for this purpose; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Reaffirms</i> the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents, legal guardians or 
</p>
<p>other persons legally responsible for the child to provide, in a manner consistent with the 
</p>
<p>evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the 
</p>
<p>child of his or her rights; 
</p>
<p><b> I. National policies and the rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>7. <i>Recalls</i> that State action aimed at the promotion, protection and full 
</p>
<p>realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including the rights of the 
</p>
<p>child, at the national level is most effective when fully integrated into national laws and 
</p>
<p>policies based on a human rights perspective and in a manner consistent with States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights law; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Reaffirms</i> that States have the right to choose the framework that is best 
</p>
<p>suited to their particular needs and circumstances at the national level, and emphasizes that 
</p>
<p>national policies, including budgetary and fiscal policies, are to be implemented in a 
</p>
<p>manner that respects, protects and fulfils human rights and that inclusive and sustainable 
</p>
<p>economic growth and stability should be regarded as a means towards human development; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Emphasizes</i> the importance for the protection and realization of all human 
</p>
<p>rights, including the rights of the child, of participatory and transparent approaches when 
</p>
<p>planning, formulating and assessing relevant public policies, and recognizes the important 
</p>
<p>and constructive role that parliaments, national human rights institutions, the judiciary and 
</p>
<p>civil society can play with regard to the realization of the rights of the child; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>10. <i>Encourages</i> States to develop and strengthen the collection, analysis and 
</p>
<p>dissemination of data for national statistics and, as far as possible, to use data disaggregated 
</p>
<p>by, inter alia, age, sex, ethnicity, location, language, family income, disability and other 
</p>
<p>relevant factors that may lead to disparities, and other statistical indicators collected at the 
</p>
<p>subnational, national, subregional, regional and international levels, to develop and assess 
</p>
<p>social policies and programmes so that available economic and social resources are used 
</p>
<p>efficiently and effectively for the full realization of the rights of the child, including girls 
</p>
<p>and marginalized and disadvantaged groups of children; 
</p>
<p><b> II. Resource mobilization for the promotion, protection and realization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>11. <i>Requests</i> all States to take all possible measures towards the promotion, 
</p>
<p>protection and realization of the rights of the child without discrimination of any kind, 
</p>
<p>paying special attention to children in vulnerable situations; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Encourages</i> States to pursue, among others, the following actions for 
</p>
<p>mobilizing resources to realize children&#8217;s rights: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To take concrete measures to mobilize domestic and, where necessary, 
</p>
<p>international resources, such as collecting taxes and other revenues, implementing 
</p>
<p>transparent and efficient administrative procedures, promoting sustainable and inclusive 
</p>
<p>growth and productivity and, when appropriate, inviting private sector involvement in a 
</p>
<p>way that promotes the realization of the rights of the child; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To ensure the effective and efficient use of resources and, to the greatest 
</p>
<p>possible extent, that social expenditures that benefit children are prioritized, including 
</p>
<p>during short-term and long-term economic and financial crises; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To make continuous efforts to sustain investment in children, at both the 
</p>
<p>national and subnational levels, over the medium to long term as a way of creating a long-
</p>
<p>lasting impact on future growth, sustainable development and social cohesion while 
</p>
<p>safeguarding the rights of the child; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To take measures for responsible, sustainable lending and borrowing and 
</p>
<p>effective debt management in order to contribute to ensuring long-term debt sustainability; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To combat corrupt or illicit practices at all levels, including tax evasion and 
</p>
<p>illicit financial flows, that directly affect the resources available for the realization of 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights, and in this regard to consider, as appropriate, developing global 
</p>
<p>partnerships to that end; 
</p>
<p><b> III. Transparency in the allocation and use of resources 
</b></p>
<p>13. <i>Calls upon</i> States to make budgeting processes open, transparent, accessible 
</p>
<p>and participatory; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Encourages</i> States to take steps towards: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Making child-related fiscal and budget information publicly available, 
</p>
<p>comprehensive and timely, including the priorities guiding the relevant allocation of 
</p>
<p>resources, to encourage accountability and public scrutiny with children, through child-
</p>
<p>friendly information, and with other stakeholders; </p>


<p>(<i>b</i>) Allowing for the identification of budget line items that have a direct or 
</p>
<p>indirect impact on children, and systematizing relevant data and indicators, including child-
</p>
<p>focused indicators and child rights impact tracking mechanisms; 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>15. <i>Calls upon</i> States, in the context of their national policies relating to the 
</p>
<p>protection, promotion and realization of the rights of the child, to strengthen public 
</p>
<p>financial management systems, to ensure accountability for public resources, and to put in 
</p>
<p>place effective remedies to prevent and address the mismanagement of public funds and 
</p>
<p>other resources and the negative impact of investment decisions and practices that deprive 
</p>
<p>children of their access to services essential for the realization of their rights; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Encourages</i> States to take steps towards: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Ensuring financial internal oversight, such as internal audits, as well as 
</p>
<p>external oversight by the parliament and independent supreme audit institutions, and 
</p>
<p>recognizing the role that independent human rights institutions have established in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Paris Principles, children&#8217;s ombudspersons, and the wider public, 
</p>
<p>including children, can play to hold the Government accountable for its investment in 
</p>
<p>children; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Conducting assessments of the impact of fiscal policies, as well as budget 
</p>
<p>allocation and spending, on the realization of the rights of child, including the most 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged and marginalized, and of how investments in any sector can serve the best 
</p>
<p>interests of the child; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Calls upon</i> States to encourage the private sector to play a more active, 
</p>
<p>effective and responsible role in the fight against poverty and the protection and realization 
</p>
<p>of the rights of the child in all areas where it is involved and as economic agent and service 
</p>
<p>provider, to encourage corporate social responsibility, bearing in mind that corporations 
</p>
<p>must abide by national legislation, and to promote increased corporate awareness of the 
</p>
<p>interrelationship between social development and economic growth for the realization of 
</p>
<p>human rights, including those of children; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Encourages</i> States to collect statistical data and pertinent and accurate 
</p>
<p>information relating to investment in children, including, when possible, on progress made 
</p>
<p>and the challenges encountered, and to consider including statistics and comparable data in 
</p>
<p>their periodic reports to the relevant United Nations mechanisms in accordance with their 
</p>
<p>mandates, including information provided to the Human Rights Council in the context of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Emphasizes</i> the important role of civil society in promoting accountability in 
</p>
<p>investment in the realization of children&#8217;s rights at all levels, including through child-
</p>
<p>sensitive community engagement mechanisms; 
</p>
<p><b> V. Participation of children in budgetary and fiscal processes 
</b></p>
<p>20. <i>Recognizes</i> that the child who is capable of forming his or her own views 
</p>
<p>should be assured the right to express those views freely, without discrimination on any 
</p>
<p>ground, in all matters affecting him or her, the views of the child being given due weight in 
</p>
<p>accordance with his or her age and maturity; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Calls upon</i> States to consider, as appropriate, promoting, facilitating and 
</p>
<p>funding the meaningful participation and active consultation of children in all the issues </p>


<p>affecting them, including in the formulation and implementation of public policies and 
</p>
<p>delivery of services, in particular those designed to meet national goals and targets for 
</p>
<p>children and adolescents, and recognizes the important role played by independent 
</p>
<p>ombudspersons for children, educational institutions, the media, community-based 
</p>
<p>organizations, such as children&#8217;s organizations, and parliaments in assuring the meaningful 
</p>
<p>participation of children in these public processes, taking into account the best interests of 
</p>
<p>the child; 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Resource allocation and spending for the promotion, protection and

<p><b>realization of the rights of the child 
</b></p>
<p>22. <i>Emphasizes</i> the duty of all States to allocate and spend sufficient and 
</p>
<p>equitable public resources for the promotion, protection and realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p>and stresses that government budgets and spending are prerequisites for the provision of 
</p>
<p>appropriate services mechanisms and infrastructure that serve to fulfil children&#8217;s rights at 
</p>
<p>all times, including to prevent and respond to emergencies and other humanitarian 
</p>
<p>situations, and encourages States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To ensure that the national budget is conceived as an instrument to guarantee 
</p>
<p>social and economic objectives and the protection and realization of children&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p>guided by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the principles of non-
</p>
<p>discrimination, the best interests of the child, survival and development, and participation, 
</p>
<p>universality, transparency and accountability in all governmental actions and processes 
</p>
<p>related to it;

<p>(<i>b</i>) To make children a priority in budgetary allocations and spending as a means 
</p>
<p>to ensure the highest return on the limited resources available;

<p>effectively discharge their assigned responsibilities, and to implement safeguards to ensure 
</p>
<p>that decentralization or devolution does not lead to discrimination in the enjoyment of

<p>rights by children in different regions; 
</p>

</p>
<p>constraints, to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, the minimum essential levels of 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights by making every effort to use the 
</p>
<p>resources that are at their disposal to satisfy as a matter of priority these minimum levels; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>Emphasizes</i> that where the available resources are demonstrably inadequate,

</p>
<p>framework of international cooperation; 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Holistic child protection systems

<p>to ensure free birth registration, including free or low-fee late birth registration limited to 
</p>
<p>cases that would otherwise result in a lack of registration, by means of universal, accessible, 
</p>
<p>simple, expeditious and effective registration procedures, without discrimination of any 
</p>
<p>kind, as a means for providing an official record of the existence of a person and the

</p>
<p>quality education and to promote learning opportunities for all children, and urges States to 
</p>
<p>pay special attention in that regard to children with disabilities and children in vulnerable 
</p>

</p>
<p>comprehensive evidence-based education on human sexuality in a manner consistent with 
</p>
<p>their evolving capacities; 
</p>
<p>31. <i>Also</i> <i>calls upon</i> States to recognize for every child the right to benefit from 
</p>
<p>social security, including social insurance, and to take the necessary measures to achieve 
</p>
<p>the full realization of this right in accordance with their national laws, including by taking 
</p>
<p>into account the resources and circumstances of the child and persons having responsibility 
</p>
<p>for his or her maintenance, as well as any other consideration relevant to an application for 
</p>
<p>benefits made by or on behalf of the child; and encourages States to, as part of their social 
</p>
<p>protection systems, establish or maintain and implement social protection floors, which 
</p>
<p>comprise basic social security guarantees as nationally defined and contribute to ensuring 
</p>
<p>minimum essential level of protection, to  the realization of the economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights of children, and to preventing or alleviating poverty, vulnerability an social 
</p>
<p>exclusion;

<p>33. <i>Requests</i> all States to promote innovative programmes that provide incentives 
</p>
<p>to low-income families with school-age children in order to increase the enrolment and 
</p>
<p>attendance of girls and boys, and to ensure that children are not obliged to work in a way 
</p>

</p>
<p>they are not taken into care because of poverty; 
</p>

<p>situations, and those living in extreme poverty or caring for children with disabilities; 
</p>
<p>35. <i>Also encourages</i> States to take into account the Guidelines for the Alternative 
</p>
<p>Care of Children, and to adopt and enforce laws and to improve the implementation of 
</p>
<p>policies and programmes, budget allocation and human resources to support children, 
</p>
<p>particularly children living in disadvantaged and marginalized families, to ensure that they 
</p>
<p>are cared for effectively by their own families and communities, and to protect children 
</p>
<p>growing up without parents or caregivers; where alternative care is necessary, decision-

<p>that is likely to be hazardous, interfere with the child&#8217;s education or be harmful to the 
</p>
<p>child&#8217;s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, to eliminate 
</p>
<p>immediately the worst forms of child labour, to promote education as a key strategy in this 
</p>
<p>regard, and to examine and devise economic policies, where necessary in cooperation with 
</p>
<p>the international community, that address factors contributing to these forms of child 
</p>
<p>labour, such as poverty and social exclusion, labour mobility, discrimination and lack of 
</p>
<p>adequate social protection and educational opportunities; 
</p>
<p>37. <i>Urges</i> all States that have not yet ratified the Conventions of the International 
</p>
<p>Labour Organization concerning the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment (No.

</p>
<p>discrimination of any kind, from, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
</p>
<p>or punishment, and to abolish harmful practices that compromise the dignity and integrity 
</p>

</p>
<p>appropriate, alternatives to prison and alternative mechanisms for solving disputes and 
</p>
<p>seeking redress, available to children and their representatives; and also calls upon States to
