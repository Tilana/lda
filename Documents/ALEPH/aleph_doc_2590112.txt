Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements contained in this report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe
harbors created thereby. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are forward-
looking statements. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “plan,”
“should,” “intend,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “potential” and similar expressions identify forward-
looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of doing so. Forward-looking statements
include statements about matters such as: future prices and sales of, and demand for, our
products; future industry and market conditions; future changes in our exploration activities,
production capacity and operations; future delays or disruptions in construction or production;
future exploration, production, operating and overhead costs; future employment and
contributions of personnel; and management; tax and interest rates; capital expenditures; nature
and timing of restructuring charges and the impact thereof; productivity, business processes,
rationalization and other, operational initiatives; investments, acquisition, consulting, operational,
tax, financial and capital projects and initiatives; contingencies; environmental compliance and
changes in the regulatory environment; and future working capital, costs, revenues, business
opportunities, debt levels, cash flows, margins, earnings and growth.
These statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by our management in
light of their experience and their perception of historical and current trends, current conditions,
possible future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees, representations or warranties and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results, developments and business decisions to differ
materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Some of those risks and
uncertainties include the risk factors set forth in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and the following: current global economic and
capital market uncertainties; the speculative nature of gold or mineral exploration, including risks
of diminishing quantities or grades of qualified resources and reserves; operational or technical
difficulties in connection with exploration or mining activities; contests over our title to properties;
potential dilution to our stockholders from the conversion of securities that are convertible into or
exercisable for shares of our common stock; potential inability to continue to comply with
government regulations; adoption of or changes in legislation or regulations adversely affecting
our businesses; permitting rejections, constraints or delays; business opportunities that may be
presented to, or pursued by, us; changes in the United States or other monetary or fiscal policies
or regulations; interruptions in our production capabilities; unexpected equipment failures;
fluctuation of prices for gold or certain other commodities (such as silver, zinc, cyanide, water,
diesel fuel and electricity); changes in generally accepted accounting principles; geopolitical
events; potential inability to implement our business strategies; potential inability to grow
revenues organically; potential inability to attract and retain key personnel; interruptions in
delivery of critical supplies, equipment and raw materials; assertion of claims, lawsuits and
proceedings against us; potential inability to maintain an effective system of internal controls over
financial reporting; potential inability or failure to timely file periodic reports with the SEC;
potential inability to maintain the listing of our securities on any securities exchange or market;
and work stoppages or other labor difficulties. Occurrence of such events or circumstances could
have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or
the market price of our securities. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements by
or attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
these factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statement.

COMSTOCK MINING INC.
 
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)
1. Interim Financial Statements
 
Basis of Presentation
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Comstock Mining Inc. ("Comstock",
the "Company", "we", "our" or "us") have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In our
opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a
fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three and six month period ended
June 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the financial statements and
footnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company shipped 1,255 and 2,957
ounces of gold, respectively, resulting in recognized revenue of approximately $1.5 million and
$3.4 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company
shipped 22,131 and 51,569 ounces of silver, respectively, for approximately $0.4 million and $0.7
million, respectively. Silver is accounted for as a by-product credit in costs applicable to mining
revenue for financial reporting purposes.
 
Liquidity and Management Plans
 
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which considers the realization of
assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of uncertainties noted below.
The Company has recurring net losses from operations and an accumulated deficit of $206.0
million at June 30, 2016. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2016, the Company
recognized a net loss of $6.9 million and used cash in operations of $3.2 million. As of June 30,
2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 million, current assets of $10.3
million and current liabilities of $8.7 million, resulting in current assets in excess of current
liabilities of approximately $1.6 million. On March 31, 2016, the Company completed an
underwritten public offering of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock. Gross proceeds to the
Company from this offering were approximately $3.5 million before deducting underwriting
commissions and other offering expenses paid by the Company. On April 13, 2016, the Company
also completed the sale of an additional 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock for
additional gross proceeds of approximately $525,000.
The Company’s current capital resources include cash and cash equivalents and other working
capital resources, cash generated through operations, assets held for sale and existing financing
arrangements including a lease financing agreement and the previously drawn revolving credit
facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Auramet International, LLC (“Auramet”). The
Revolving Credit Facility was fully paid on April 1, 2016, from part of the proceeds from the sale
of the Company’s common stock on March 31, 2016. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Company may have borrowings of up to $10 million outstanding at any given time, subject to
satisfying certain conditions and obtaining certain consents. The Revolving Credit Facility has a
maturity of April 28, 2018, and allows for re-advances on the facility up to the $10 million
availability. The Company has financed its exploration, development and start up activities
principally from the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, debt financing. While the
Company has been successful in the past in obtaining the necessary capital to support its
operations, including registered equity financings from its existing shelf registration, borrowings
or other means, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional equity
capital or other financing, if needed.
Effective June 28, 2016, the Company entered into a sales agreement with respect to an at-the-
market offering program ("ATM Agreement") pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell,
from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering
price of up to $5.0 million. The Company pays the sales agent a commission of 2.5% of the gross
proceeds from the sale of such shares. The Company is not obligated to make any sales of
shares under the ATM Agreement, and if it elects to make any sales, the Company can set a
minimum sales price for the shares. As of June 30, 2016, no shares had been sold pursuant to
the ATM Agreement.
8
The Company believes that it will have sufficient funds to sustain its operations during the next
12 months as a result of the sources of funding described above.
Future production rates and gold prices below management’s expectations would adversely
affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If the Company
was unable to obtain any necessary additional funds, this could have an immediate material
effect on liquidity and could raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern. In such case, the Company could be required to limit or discontinue certain
business plans, activities or operations, reduce or delay certain capital expenditures or sell
certain assets or businesses. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to
take any of such actions on favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all.
Use of Estimates
 
In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we
are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and revenues and expenditures during the reported periods. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. Estimates may include those pertaining to valuation of
inventories, stockpiles and mineralized material on leach pads, the estimated useful lives and
valuation of plant and equipment, mineral rights, deferred tax assets, derivative assets and
liabilities, reclamation liabilities, stock-based compensation and payments, and contingent
liabilities.
Comprehensive Income
 
The only component of comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, was net loss.
Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the consolidated
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of certain recorded assets and liabilities and
for tax loss carryforwards. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to
generate sufficient future taxable earnings. Where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
asset will not be realized, we have provided a full valuation allowance. The Company has
provided a full valuation allowance at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, for its net deferred
tax assets as it cannot conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
     
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update (ASU) 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This standard is
intended to simplify the accounting for several aspects of the accounting for equity-based
compensation, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting
guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency
and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the
balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any
entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exceptions. For public business entities,
the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early
application is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements, which will require right of use
assets and lease liabilities be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for operating leases.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which introduces a new five-step revenue
recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires
disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of
revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and
quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in
judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard was
originally effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB
issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which defers the effective date of
ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is
permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim reporting periods within that reporting period. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-
10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing, which is an amendment that clarifies the following two aspects of the new five-step
revenue recognition model: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation
guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are
the same as ASU 2015-014. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to
determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period consolidated financial statements to
conform to the current period presentation. The Company reclassified its asset retirement
obligation expenses from Mining Claims Cost to Environmental and Reclamation line item in the
consolidated statements of operations. As a result of this change, Mining Claims Cost line item
was reduced by $364,092 and $707,134 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015,
respectively, and Environmental and Reclamation increased by such amounts.

4. Properties, Plant and Equipment
The Company sold land and equipment with a book value of approximately $2.4 million during
the six months ended June 30, 2016, and recorded a gain on the sale of that land and equipment
totaling $0.6 million. As of June 30, 2016, $0.7 million of the proceeds associated with sale had
not yet been collected and is recognized as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the
balance sheet.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized depreciation
expense of $1.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Depreciation expense for the three and
six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, was $1.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively.
Assets Held For Sale
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company committed to a plan to sell certain mining
equipment and land and buildings. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had assets with a net
book value of $4.3 million that met the criteria to be held for sale. Those criteria specify that the
asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition (subject only to terms that are
usual and customary for sales of such assets) and the sale of the asset must be probable, and its
transfer expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale, within one year, with certain
exceptions.

1) Caterpillar Equipment Note and Caterpillar Equipment Capital Lease balances on December
31, 2015 were consolidated into Caterpillar Equipment Consolidated Note on June 27, 2016. For
details see discussion below.
Long-Term Debt Obligations
 
Caterpillar Equipment Facility and Capital Lease
On June 27, 2016, the Company completed an agreement with Caterpillar Financial Services
Corporation relating to certain finance and lease agreements (the "CAT Agreement"). The
Company entered into the CAT Agreement which required the Company to complete the sale of
certain financed and leased equipment and modified the payment schedule under the related
finance and lease arrangements. Under the terms of the CAT Agreement, the Company will pay
down its obligations with the net proceeds from the financed and leased equipment required to
be sold during the second half of 2016, with any remaining balance to be paid off primarily from a
monthly payment schedule of $25,000 per month until the amounts have been paid in full. The
net book value of equipment required to be sold under the amended agreement is $1.8 million at
June 30, 2016 and is included in assets held for sale, net in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheets. The note bears an interest rate of 5.7%. The outstanding
obligations in the agreement are approximately $3.67 million. During June 2016, the Company
sold equipment for net proceeds of approximately $0.7 million.
12
Auramet Facility
On March 6, 2015, the Company entered into an amended and restated $5 million revolving
credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Auramet, pursuant to which the Company may
borrow up to $5 million, subject to satisfying certain conditions and obtaining certain consents.
On March 6, 2015, the Company drew $5 million (the “Note”), representing cash proceeds of
approximately $4.4 million, net of prepaid interest and fees of approximately $0.6 million. On
December 28, 2015, the Company and Auramet agreed to increase the facility up to $10 million
and extended the facility from the current maturity of February 6, 2017 to April 28, 2018. The
indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a security interest in certain real
estate owned by the Company within the Company’s starter mine and a first priority security
interest in all personal property of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Comstock
Mining, LLC, subject to any existing or future Permitted Liens (as defined under the Revolving
Credit Facility). The proceeds from the Note were primarily used for an accelerated construction
schedule for rerouting State Route 342, located in the Company’s Lucerne Resource Area, the
first phase of which was completed in early June 2015, and the second phase was completed in
November 2015. The Note contains a covenant that requires the Company to maintain a
minimum liquidity balance of $1 million (including cash and cash equivalents, plus 90% of the
value of any doré that has been picked up by a secured carrier but not yet paid for, as of any date
of determination). The Note additionally contains customary representations, warranties,
affirmative covenants, negative covenants, and events of default, as well as conditions to
borrowings.
The note was fully repaid on April 1, 2016, from proceeds from the sale of the Company’s
common stock on March 31, 2016.
Daney Ranch Property
On August 31, 2015, the Company entered into a note in the amount of $1.8 million for the
purchase of land and buildings. The note does not bear interest. Upon entering into the note, the
Company issued 1,538,462 shares of common stock to the noteholder as partial payment on the
note. In January 2016, the note maturity date was extended for nine months to November 2016
and an additional 3,000,000 shares of common stock was issued to the noteholder in satisfaction
of the outstanding principal balance. To the extent proceeds received by the noteholder from the
sale of the shares received are less than the outstanding principal balance, the Company would
make a final payment for the difference.
Dayton Property "Golden Goose"
During 2016, the Company amended the Golden Goose note, extended the maturity to January
2017, and issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock in partial satisfaction of the outstanding
principal balance. To the extent proceeds received by the noteholder from the sale of the shares
received are less than the outstanding principal balance, the Company would make a final
payment for the difference.
Lease Obligations
Varilease Finance Inc.
On May 12, 2015, the Company entered into a master lease agreement with Varilease Finance
Inc. ("Varilease") in which the Company obtained capital financing under a sale-leaseback
transaction in the amount of $5 million. Due to certain types of continuing involvement, the
Company was precluded from applying sale-leaseback accounting and has accounted for the
transaction under the financing method. The Company's obligations under the Varilease
agreement are secured by an interest in the Company's processing equipment in exchange for
24 monthly payments of $247,830 totaling the cash proceeds of $5 million and applicable
interest. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 6,617,896 shares of
common stock in partial satisfaction of lease payment obligations through the remainder of 2016.
To the extent proceeds received by Varilease from the sale of the shares received are less than
the lease payments required to be made, the Company would make a final cash payment for the
difference. The fair value of the shares which have been issued to Varilease but remain unsold
as of June 30, 2016 is $1.5 million which is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current
assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
8. Stockholders’ Equity
In March 2016, the Company raised $3.5 million in gross proceeds (approximately $3.0 million
net of issuance cost) through an underwritten public offering of 10 million shares of common
stock at a price per share of $0.35 under the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-3.
13
In April 2016, the Company raised an additional $525,000 in gross proceeds through the sale of
an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $0.35 to the underwriter
of the Company’s public offering of common stock closed in March 2016. The sale was
completed pursuant to the underwriter's exercise of the over-allotment option granted in
connection with the public offering.
At-the-Market Offering Program
Effective June 28, 2016, the Company entered into a sales agreement with respect to an at-the-
market offering program ("ATM Agreement") pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell,
from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering
price of up to $5.0 million. The Company pays the sales agent a commission of 2.5% of the gross
proceeds from the sale of such shares. The Company is not obligated to make any sales of
shares under the ATM Agreement, and if it elects to make any sales, the Company can set a
minimum sales price for the shares. As of June 30, 2016, no shares had been sold pursuant to
the ATM Agreement.
9. Fair Value Measurements
 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value
hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair
values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is defined into the following
three categories:
 
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs corroborated by market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
The following tables presents our liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

We had no assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and twelve months ended
December 31, 2015, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1, Level 2 or
Level 3.
14
Note payable (Daney Ranch Property) - The note payable is valued as the difference between
the $1.8 million face amount, reduced by the proceeds to be received by the noteholder from the
sale of the 4,538,462 shares of common stock to be sold through October 2016 by the
noteholder. The Company has estimated the proceeds to be received upon the sale of the
common stock by the noteholder using the Black-Scholes model with various observable inputs.
These inputs include contractual terms, stock price, volatility, dividend yield, and risk free interest
rates. Because the inputs are all observable market-based inputs, this instrument is classified
within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Note payable (Dayton Property "Golden Goose") - The note payable is valued as the difference
between the $0.5 million face amount, reduced by the proceeds to be received by the noteholder
from the sale of the 1,000,000 shares of common stock to be sold through December 2016 by the
noteholder. The Company has estimated the proceeds to be received upon the sale of the
common stock by the noteholder using the Black-Scholes model with various observable inputs.
These inputs include contractual terms, stock price, volatility, dividend yield, and risk free interest
rates. Because the inputs are all observable market-based inputs, this instrument is classified
within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
10. Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share
 
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, warrants and
convertible securities were exercised or converted into common stock.
 
The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the basic and diluted
computation of net loss per share:

11. Commitments and Contingencies
 
The Company has minimum royalty obligations with certain of its mineral properties and leases.
For most of the mineral properties and leases, the Company is subject to a range of royalty
obligations once production commences. These royalties range from 0.5% to 5% of net smelter
revenues (NSR) from minerals produced on the properties, with the majority being under 3%.
Some of the factors that will influence the amount of the royalties include ounces extracted and
the price of gold.
On March 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Drilling and Development Services for Common
Stock Investment Agreement (the "Stock Investment Agreement") between the Company and
American Mining & Tunneling, LLC and American Drilling Corp, LLC (collectively "AMT"),
pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue up to 9,000,000 shares of the Company's
common stock to AMT, in exchange for $5,000,000 in future underground mine development,
drilling and mining services. When the AMT Shares are issued, they will be restricted shares
subject to a six-month holding period by AMT, during which time the issued AMT Shares may not
be sold. AMT has also agreed not to sell the shares at a per share price of less than $0.56. The
Stock Investment Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements in
connection with the issuance of the AMT Shares, and conditions to closing include the
Company's obligation to file with NYSE MKT LLC a supplemental listing application relating to
the AMT Shares that has been approved by NYSE MKT LLC. As of June 30, 2016, no shares
had been issued.
The Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations
governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually
changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company believes its operations are
in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has
made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations,
but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise
in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that we expect to have a
material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 
12. Segment Reporting
 
Our management organizes the Company into two operating segments: mining and real estate.
Our mining segment consists of all activities and expenditures associated with mining. Our real
estate segment consists of land, real estate rental properties and the Gold Hill Hotel. We
evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on operating income (loss). All
intercompany transactions have been eliminated, and intersegment revenues are not
significant. Financial information relating to our reportable operating segments and reconciliation
to the consolidated totals is as follows:

13. Subsequent Events
On July 25, 2016, the Company purchased 98 acres of land and 257 acre-feet of senior priority
water rights in Silver Springs, Nevada for $3.2 million and entered into a Loan Agreement (the
“Loan Agreement”) of $3.25 million for the purpose of purchasing the real property and water
rights. The indebtedness under the Loan Agreement is secured by a deed of trust on the property
purchased.
17
The Loan Agreement has a term of two years. The indebtedness under the Loan Agreement
accrues interest at a rate of 9% per annum for the first year post-closing, 12.5% per annum for the
six months that follow the first anniversary of the Loan Agreement and 14% per annum thereafter
until such indebtedness is paid in full. Proceeds from the sale of the property securing the loan
must be used to repay the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement. In addition to customary
remedies for secured indebtedness on real property, the Loan Agreement allows the lender
thereunder to convert the principal amount of the indebtedness into common stock of the
Company upon a default.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
 
The following discussion provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and
understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company
as of and for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, as well as our future results.
It should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes also included in this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of,
and for the fiscal year ended, December 31, 2015.
  
Overview
 
Comstock Mining Inc. is a Nevada-based, gold and silver mining company with extensive,
contiguous property in the historic Comstock and Silver City mining districts (collectively, the
“Comstock District”). The Comstock District is located within the western portion of the Basin and
Range Province of Nevada, between Reno and Carson City. We began acquiring properties and
developing projects in the Comstock District in 2003. Since then, we have consolidated a
substantial portion of the historic Comstock District, secured permits, built an infrastructure and
brought exploration projects into production. We also received the 2015 Nevada Excellence in
Mine Reclamation award, voted on unanimously by five participating Federal and State of
Nevada agencies.
Because of the Comstock District’s historical significance, the geology is well known and has
been extensively studied by us, our advisors and many independent researchers. We have
expanded our understanding of the geology of the project area through vigorous surface mapping
and drill hole logging. The volume of geologic data is immense, and thus far the reliability has
been excellent, particularly in the various Lucerne Mine areas. We have amassed a large library
of historic data and detailed surface mapping of Comstock District properties and continue to
obtain historic information from private and public sources. We use such data in conjunction with
information obtained from our current operations, to target geological prospective exploration
areas and plan exploratory drilling programs, including expanded surface and underground
drilling.
The Company continues evaluating and acquiring properties inside and outside the district
expanding its footprint and exploring all of our existing and prospective opportunities for further
exploration, development and mining. The near-term goal of our business plan is to maximize
intrinsic stockholder value realized, per share, by continuing to acquire mineralized and
potentially mineralized properties, exploring, developing and validating qualified resources and
reserves (proven and probable) that enable the commercial development of our operations
through extended, long-lived mine plans that are economically feasible and socially responsible,
including both the Lucerne and Dayton Mine plans, with both surface and underground
development opportunities. We also plan to develop longer-term exploration plans for the
remaining areas, which include the Spring Valley, Occidental, Northern Extension and Northern
Targets areas, subsequent to and in some cases concurrent with the exploration and
development of Lucerne and Dayton. Our plans also include the identification, assessment and
acquisition of similarly situated gold and silver mining assets.
We achieved initial production and held our first pour of gold and silver on September 29, 2012.
We produced approximately 22,925 gold equivalent ounces in 2014 and 18,455 gold equivalent
ounces in 2015. That is, we produced 19,601 ounces of gold and 222,416 ounces of silver in
2014 and 15,451 ounces of gold and 221,723 ounces of silver in 2015. During the first six months
ended June 30, 2016, the Company produced 2,957 ounces of gold and 51,569 ounces of silver,
that is, approximately 3,621 gold equivalent ounces. The expected recovery rate for gold
increased from an estimated 85% to an estimated 87.5% in the first quarter of 2016 and remained
at this rate during the second quarter of 2016.
The Company’s headquarters, technical resources, mine operations and heap leach processing
facility are located in Storey County, Nevada, at 1200 American Flat Road, approximately three
miles south of Virginia City, Nevada and 30 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada. The Company
now owns or controls approximately 8,542 acres of mining claims and parcels in the Comstock
and Silver City Districts. The acreage is comprised of approximately 2,242 acres of patented
claims (private lands) and surface parcels (private lands) and approximately 6,301 acres of
unpatented mining claims, which the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) administers.
Our real estate segment owns significant non-mining properties, including the Gold Hill Hotel, the
Daney Ranch and other lands, homes and cottages. The Gold Hill Hotel consists of an operating
hotel, restaurant and a bar. In 2015, we entered into an agreement to lease the Gold Hill Hotel to
independent operators while retaining ownership. The initial term of the lease agreement was
effective on April 1, 2015, and ends in March 2020. The tenant may renew the lease for two
extended terms of five years each. Lease payments are due in monthly installments.

Current Exploration Projects
 
District-wide
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company expanded its exploration planning to include
longer-term exploration targets across the broader Comstock District where multiple miles of
additional mineralized strike zones have been identified and added to the Company’s
exploration planning activities. This includes the Company's northeastern properties within the
Occidental Group, the Northern properties referred to as the Gold Hill Group and the southern
portion of the Dayton Resource Area, extending further south into the Spring Valley Group (refer
to Figure 1).
During the first half of 2016, the Company focused on exploration and development in the
Lucerne Resource area, primarily in the Quartz Porphyry (PQ) and Succor geological target
areas, and to a lesser extent the Dayton Resource Area. Lucerne activity included underground
core drilling, underground drift (tunnel) development, and underground sampling. Dayton activity
included surface and underground sampling. The Company has also developed specific plans
for additional infill, development and exploration in the Dayton Resource area and further
exploration activities to define the extent of known mineralization in the Succor, Woodville and
Chute target areas within the Lucerne Resource Area.
20
Figure 1 - General overview of priority surface and underground targets.
21
Lucerne Exploration Targets
The Company has designed additional exploration drilling programs within the Lucerne Group.
This includes the Succor vein target, the Woodville area and the northern development of the PQ
underground. During the first quarter, about 12,380 feet of HQ-3 and NQ core drilling was
completed and samples produced from the Harris Drift. The drilling configuration is in the form of
‘fans’ that comprise a group of holes, with each drill bay having two or three fans of drill holes
extending into the primary target. The core locations and orientations were specifically designed
to infill and expand the areas of known, high-grade mineralization identified from previous
surface drilling programs. (Figure 2)
Figure 2 - 3D representation of the Harris Drift showing drill bays, drill fans, and the Succor
crosscut.
The Company encountered longer mineralized intercepts (10 to 40 feet thick) from bays 3
through 6 as it moved north of the Silver City/Succor structural intersection and within and
bordering the PQ mass. The configuration of the longer and higher grade intercepts occur along
the hanging wall contact of the PQ intrusive mass within both the Alta Andesite and PQ host
rocks. The intervals show continuity laterally and vertically along the structural contact.
Throughout the PQ drill program, geologic cross sections oriented along the drill fans and level
plans on 20 foot spacing were fashioned for the target area. With completion of drilling, core
logging and assaying through Drill Bay 6, cross sections and level plans were prepared,
reviewed, updated and digitized. The model was further refined as these sections were tied
together to form a three-dimensional triangulation using Maptek Vulcan software.
Using the geologic model and assay data as a base, multiple grade shells were produced in the
same manner. Starting with cross sections and level plans, the shells were digitized and then
refined as they were tied together to form three-dimensional triangulations. These shells form the
base of the block model used for internal planning and resource development. (Figure 3)
22
Figure 3 - Current grade shells: colored red for 0.12 opt Au cutoff (averaging 0.31 opt Au) and
magenta 0.25 opt Au cutoff (averaging 0.61 opt Au), with PQ, Succor, and Woodville proposed
drill programs.
Although the grade intercepts were promising, they did not yet yield sufficient continuity for
mining. The Company considers the initial 800 feet of advance within the Harris Drift as a first
phase of development toward a longer-term exploration and development objective targeting a
three-quarter-mile long mineralized corridor that includes the Lucerne (including the PQ target),
Succor, Woodville, and Chute zone systems. (Figure 4) Most of these systems remain open to
the north and east and particularly at depth. A second phase of development was completed by
advancing a crosscut out of Drill Bay 2 to a total length of 450 feet toward the structural
intersection of the Silver City fault zone and Succor vein zone. The design of the crosscut is
geared toward favorable underground drilling position. The Succor represents an important target
in conjunction with the PQ zone based on its location (perpendicular and adjacent to the PQ),
past production history and the results from the Company’s 2011 and 2012 reverse circulation
drill programs.
23
Figure 4 - Underground target areas highlighting the exploration drift and drill bays.
The Succor Vein Target has a strike length of greater than 1000 feet, an average true width of 15
feet and an average dip of 55 degrees. The structure has reported historic mining grades of
approximately 0.620 ounces per ton of recovered gold equivalent grade and is open to the east
and at depth, along the entire structure. The proposed drill holes shown in Figure 5 are designed
to extend the depth of known mineralization identified by surface drilling.
24
Figure 5 - Woodville, PQ, and Succor target areas with proposed Succor target drilling.
Future drill programs are being developed with a phased approach to extend the PQ
mineralization and scope the Succor and Woodville targets.
The remaining phases of the road realignment, estimated at approximately $65,000, and Lucerne
reclamation activities, including the final waste dump removal, grading and drainage
reestablishment are scheduled for completion in the third quarter of 2016.
Dayton Resource Area
The Company plans to conduct definition drilling and geotechnical core programs within the
Dayton Resource area. The Dayton southern expansion program includes exploration and
definition drilling of targets identified by the conventional percussion drill program, magnetic, IP
and resistivity geophysical surveys (Figure 6).
25
Figure 6 - Dayton and Spring Valley Area
26
The geologic and engineering staff also completed underground mapping, sampling, and
surveying in a number of historic mine tunnels on and near the Dayton Resource area. Several
historic mines operated in the Dayton area, leaving access to multiple structures from
underground. Some adits have remained open or have been uncovered by the Company. Where
accessible, the workings were and are being inspected and mineralized material sampled.
Geologic mapping is also done at this time. Once sampling is completed, the workings are
surveyed to model the size and location of the openings as well as locate the samples. The
samples are then assayed at the Company’s own metallurgical laboratory for gold and silver.
This underground sampling program has not only provided a wealth of assay information but it
has also provided critical information for furthering the geologic understanding of the Dayton. In
some cases structures identified on the surface can be traced underground and in other cases
structures that do not have obvious surface expression are identified.
Spring Valley
Spring Valley is located south of State Route 341. Limited drilling has identified favorable
mineralized zones (see Figure 4 below). The exploration of Spring Valley will include phased
drilling programs that will continue southerly from SR341 to the historic Daney mine site (Figure
1), with a total a strike length of approximately 8,000 feet.
Occidental Group
The Occidental vein (a sub parallel vein system to the Comstock) is considered by the Company
to be underexplored and is considered a significant exploration target, with historic, high grade
production mined near surface in localized pods. The Occidental vein system has a significant
strike length of over 7,600 feet on land controlled by the Company. Detailed geologic
assessment and mapping is ongoing to best define future drilling and development of this
exploration target.
Gold Hill Group
The northern Comstock underground targets of the Gold Hill Group will be prioritized and
exploration proposals will follow. Several locations in the Gold Hill Group have been selected to
receive additional evaluation.
    
Production
 
The Company operates a heap leach based, gold and silver production system, including a zinc-
precipitate based Merrill-Crowe processing plant. The Company, under the existing water
pollution control permit with the State of Nevada, has the crushing and processing capacity to
operate at a rate of up to 4.0 million tons of material crushed and stacked, per annum. The Merrill-
Crowe system facilitates that capacity with an operating fluid processing rate of over 1,000
gallons per minute.
During 2014, the Company completed the transition from the Billie the Kid and Hartford patented
claims in the Lucerne West-side Mine to the higher-grade Justice and Lucerne patents, also in
the Lucerne West-side Mine. During the first and second quarters of 2015, the Company, in
preparation for underground development, substantially completed mining of those Lucerne
West-side surface patents. Substantially all of the operations for the second half of 2015 were
focused on the extraction of the mineralized material contained in historic mine dumps while also
completing the realignment of SR-342, establishing a drift into the higher-grade PQ and
Woodville targets, and developing those targets towards the establishment of reserves for
potential future mining.
The Company substantially completed the extraction and remediation of the historic dump
materials during the third quarter of 2015, and stacked the material on the leach pads where the
mineralized material continues under solution until the target gold and silver recovery rates have
been achieved. The Company stacked over 13,000 tons of mineralized material during May
2016. This additional material, when combined with recent metallurgical yield estimates of
approximately 87.5%, increases our estimated recoverable gold ounces remaining on the pad.
The Company now expects that the leaching process and resulting gold and silver pours will
continue into the third quarter of 2016.

During the second quarter of 2016, the Company poured 1,255 ounces of gold and 22,131
ounces of silver. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company poured 2,957 ounces
of gold and 51,569 ounces of silver.
    
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized a $1,204.08 average price per
ounce of gold and a $15.21 average sales price per ounce of silver. In comparison, commodity
market prices in the first three months of 2016 averaged $1,259.35 per ounce of gold and $16.78
per ounce of silver.
    
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized a $1,193.04 average price per
ounce of gold and a $14.58 average sales price per ounce of silver. In comparison, commodity
market prices in the first six months of 2016 averaged $1,220.28 per ounce of gold and $15.80
per ounce of silver.
28
Our Comstock exploration activities include open pit gold and silver test mining. As defined by
the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Industry Guide 7, we have not yet established any
proven or probable reserves at our Comstock Lode Project.
 
Operating Costs
 
During the first six months of 2016, actual costs applicable to mining revenue were approximately
$3.4 million, $2.7 million net of silver credits, as compared to $8.9 million, $6.9 million net of
silver credits, during the first six months of 2015. This 61% reduction of net costs applicable to
mining revenue is primarily a result of significantly lower labor and processing costs due to the
Company’s transition from surface mining to underground exploration and development and
higher experienced metallurgical yields. Costs applicable to mining revenue include processing
labor, processing maintenance, processing reagents and assaying costs, among others. Costs
applicable to mining revenue for the first six months of 2016 and 2015 also included depreciation
of $1.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively.
 
During the first six months of 2016, the Company focused on reducing non-mining costs, most
recently increasing targeted savings in this area from $5.5 million in 2016, as compared to over
$8 million in 2015. The Company has aggressively implemented organizational changes
consistent with our transition from mining the Lucerne surface mine to growing our resource
portfolio and related exploration and development activities toward production-ready mining
projects. Accordingly, general and administrative costs and other non-mining costs, including
mine claims and land costs, other real estate operating costs and environmental costs have
already declined significantly to an annualized rate of over $8 million. The Company incurred
approximately $0.3 million in severance costs during the first six months of 2016, in mining and
general and administrative expenses, associated with organizational cost reductions.
Outlook
Production during 2016 is currently limited to processing of existing leach pad materials.
Considering the improved estimates of gold and silver recoveries, that is, 87.5% for gold and
59.5% for silver, the current leach cycle will continue well into the third quarter, likely through
September 2016 or later. All operating costs associated with hauling, crushing and other
ancillary activities have been reduced or eliminated as we transition the full organizational focus
toward the discovery, development and establishment of reserves from Lucerne and Dayton, for
future mining, and the identification, assessment and acquisition of similarly situated gold and
silver mining assets. During our exploration and development activities in 2016, we expect to
operate with less than 15 employees. General and administrative costs are also expected to
continue to decline significantly, resulting in savings in all non-mining costs of over $8 million
during 2016, as compared to 2015, an increase of 80% over the originally disclosed target of $3
million.
The Company plans to sell non-mining related lands, buildings and water rights, valued at over
$10 million, over the next twelve months and resulting in net profit of over $5 million and net cash
proceeds of over $7 million. These proceeds will eliminate current debt obligations and
strengthen the financial position of the Company. The Company also plans to sell surface mining
equipment, no longer required in our mine plans, valued at up to $2 million and significantly
reduce the financing obligations associated with Caterpillar Finance. These combined actions
should eliminate substantially all of the Company’s debt obligations in the next twelve months.
During the second half of 2016, the Company also plans limited core drilling in Dayton, sufficient
to finalize the parameters of a mine plan and commence the permitting for the Dayton Mine. The
Company has developed grade shells with higher average grades and believes the Dayton to
have economically feasible potential and plans on developing those mine plans in the latter half
of 2016. Infill drilling is expected to expand the reserve potential for the Dayton mine plans.
The Company commenced the underground drift tunnel and drilling, associated with the first
underground exploration phase of a PQ geological target, in September 2015, and completed
drift-sampling, drilling and metallurgical test work of the PQ target during the first quarter. The
Succor vein system is being considered as an easterly extension of the first phase of
development beyond the high-grade PQ target. This will positively expand the scope of Phase 1
through the second half of 2016. The drift tunnels are designed to conduct an underground
exploration program directed at a series of geological targets in the Silver City Branch of the
Comstock Lode, including the PQ target, the Succor vein systems and the historic Woodville
Bonanza system. These initial targets represent the core of a broader geological
corridor. Previous surface drilling in the area, including the Succor-Holman drilling from 2015 had
suggested that a greater than 1,000 feet of mineralized strike in the Succor zone, lying generally
adjacent to and below the Lucerne Cut, has the potential to yield high-grade gold and silver. The
current program has been geared toward defining that potential.
29
Drill results from the PQ drilling continued yielding wider and longer high-grade intercepts. These
results were published by press releases issued throughout the first quarter of 2016. The
Company also completed a crosscut tunnel, drifting to the Succor vein system. This drift positions
the Company for efficient scope drilling from an underground platform that compliments
additional scope drilling from the surface, ultimately to confirm the extent of the length and depth
of the Succor target. Ultimately, these efforts are designed to develop mine plans of sufficient
grade and quantities for longer-lived production plans for the Lucerne mine.
The Company will report the results of the Lucerne and Dayton exploration and development
programs as they become available.
Recent Developments
The Company completed a positive restructuring of certain equipment obligations and
consummated a forbearance agreement on June 27, 2016 with Caterpillar Financial Services
Corporation relating to certain finance and lease agreements (the “Forbearance”). The Company
entered into the Forbearance to permit the Company to complete the sale of certain equipment
against a modified payment schedule under the related lease arrangements. Under the terms of
the Forbearance, the Company will pay down its obligations with the net proceeds from the
equipment sold during the second half of 2016, with any remaining balance to be paid off with
$25,000 monthly payments until the leases have been paid in full. The Company paid down
$738,000 during July 2016, resulting in the total outstanding obligations of approximately $2.9
million as of July 29, 2016.
On June 30, 2016, the Company also entered into an equity facility agreement with International
Asset Advisory, LLC, a long-established financing partner, to provide up to $5 million in equity
financing from time to time as needed on terms deemed favorable to the Company.  This facility
is intended solely to enable more efficient access to equity capital markets while we are finalizing
our positive debt reduction and asset sale activities.
On July 14, 2016 the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Sierra Front Field Office, conveyed
ownership of approximately 24 acres to Northern Comstock, LLC.  The parcel known locally as
“Lot 51” is located on the American Flat Road, in Storey County, Nevada. The parcel was
established as a lot and patented during the historic mining heyday of the Comstock District.  The
BLM’s action legally recognizes Lot 51 as private property.  This marks the successful
completion of a multi-year process to acquire this land from the BLM.  Lot No. 51 represents a
strategic parcel of land that enables an expanded and efficient haul route from the Lucerne mine. 
    
On July 25, 2016, the Company purchased 98 acres of land and 257 acre-feet of senior priority
water rights in Silver Springs, Nevada for $3.2 million and entered into a Loan Agreement (the
“Loan Agreement”) of $3.25 million for the purpose of purchasing the real property and water
rights. The indebtedness under the Loan Agreement is secured by a deed of trust on the property
purchased.
The Loan Agreement has a term of two years. The indebtedness under the Loan Agreement
accrues interest at a rate of 9% per annum for the first year post-closing, 12.5% per annum for the
six months that follow the first anniversary of the Loan Agreement and 14% per annum thereafter
until such indebtedness is paid in full. Proceeds from the sale of the property securing the loan
must be used to repay the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement. In addition to customary
remedies for secured indebtedness on real property, the Loan Agreement allows the lender
thereunder to convert the principal amount of the indebtedness into common stock of the
Company upon a default.
On August 1, 2016, the BLM approved a Right-of-Way Amendment for Comstock Mining, LLC. In
July 2012 Comstock Mining, LLC submitted an application to the BLM to amend its existing
Right-of-Way on the American Flat Road, located in Gold Hill, Storey County. Under the
approved Right-of-Way Amendment, Comstock Mining, LLC would be permitted to realign a
portion of the American Flat Road to segregate public traffic from haul traffic for public safety. The
Lucerne Haul Road, which Comstock Mining, LLC has used since August 2012, would be used
exclusively for haul purposes for public safety between the Lucerne Pit and American Flat where
a processing facility exists. In order to approve the Right-of-Way Amendment, the BLM first had to
complete compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act. This was done in February
2016 with the execution of a Memorandum of Agreement to resolve adverse effects to eight
historic properties present. The BLM has also completed compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act by approving an environmental assessment.
30
Equity Raises
In March and April 2016, the Company raised $4.0 million (approximately $3.5 million net of
issuance costs) through an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of common stock at
a price per share of $0.35.

Mining revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.5 million. The decrease of $4.0
million resulted from lower production and lower average price per ounce of gold realized of
$1,204.08 versus $1,262.91 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company produced 1,255 ounces of gold (and 22,131 ounces of silver), during the three-
month period ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 4,575 ounces of gold (and 60,112 ounces of
silver) in the three-month period of 2015.
 
Throughout the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized an average price of
$1,204.08 per ounce of gold and a $15.21 average sales price per ounce of silver. In comparison,
commodity market prices in the second quarter of 2016 averaged $1,259.35 per ounce of gold
and $16.78 per ounce of silver.
Costs applicable to mining revenue were $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
including $0.4 million of silver credits, as compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015, including $1.0 million of silver credits. The reduction of $2.0 million, of net costs
applicable to mining revenue resulted from shifting of the Company's focus from mining to
exploration resulting in lower mining and processing costs and the reduction of mining and
processing staff.
Exploration and mine development costs increased by approximately $0.3 million during the
three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015. The
increase is a result of $0.7 million classification of mining equipment depreciation expense to
development activities, offset by lower exploration and development labor costs of $0.2 million
and other negotiated reductions in development costs.
Land and road development costs were $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2015, due to the
road realignment project that was completed in 2015.
31
General and administrative costs decreased by $0.4 million second quarter of 2016, as
compared to second quarter of 2015. The decrease is primarily the result of lower payroll costs of
approximately $0.3 million, in line with targeted cost reduction efforts.
Net loss was $2.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to a net
income of $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The $1.3 million increase in net
loss primarily resulted from a $4.0 million decrease in revenue, net of a $2.0 million decrease in
mining and processing costs, $0.8 million reduction in Road and Land Development costs and
$0.3 million of lower general and administrative costs, offset by a $0.3 million increase in
development and exploration expenses.

NET INCOME (LOSS)
 
Mining revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $3.4 million. The decrease of $7.9
million resulted from lower production and lower average price per ounce of gold realized of
$$1,193.04 versus $1,262.91 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company produced 2,957 ounces of gold and 51,569 ounces of silver, during the six-month
period ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 4,575 ounces of gold and 60,112 ounces of silver in
the six-month period of 2015.
 
Throughout the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized an average price of
$1,193.04 per ounce of gold and a $14.58 average sales price per ounce of silver. In comparison,
commodity market prices in the first half of 2016 averaged $1,220.28 per ounce of gold and
$15.80 per ounce of silver.
Costs applicable to mining revenue were $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
including $0.7 million of silver credits, as compared to $6.9 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015, including $1.9 million of silver credits. The reduction of $4.3 million of net costs
applicable to mining revenue resulted from shifting of the Company's focus from mining to
exploration resulting in lower mining and processing costs and the reduction of mining and
processing staff.
Exploration and mine development costs increased by approximately $2.3 million during the six
months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015. The
increase is a result of costs related to underground exploration activities and the completion of
the drift to the Succor vein system in early February 2016 and a $1.4 million classification of
mining equipment depreciation expense that was used in development.
Land and road development costs were $0.9 million in 2015 due to the road realignment project
that was undertaken and successfully completed in 2015.
32
General and administrative costs decreased by $1.4 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016, as compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease is a result of lower payroll costs of
approximately $0.6 million, a reduction of net proceeds tax liabilities of approximately $0.2
million and lower legal and consulting fees of approximately $0.1 million, , among other
reductions, all in line with the cost reduction programs.
Other income decreased approximately $3.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease primarily resulted from a reduction in a loss
contingency of approximately $3.2 million that was included in other income in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations in 2015, and did not recur in 2016.
Net loss was $6.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to a net loss of
$0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The $6.7 million increase in net loss
primarily resulted from a $7.9 million decrease in revenue, a $3.1 million decrease in other
income, net of $4.3 million lower mining and processing costs and $1.4 million of lower general
and administrative costs, offset by a $2.3 million increase in costs resulting from underground
and surface exploration and development costs and approximately $0.5 million in other costs
including environmental, mine claims and real estate costs.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Total current assets were $10.3 million at June 30, 2016, including cash and cash equivalents of
$0.8 million. Inventories, stockpiles, and mineralized material on leach pad totaled $0.5 million.
    
The Company was an exploration and development company for most of its existence and
accordingly has a history of net operating losses. The Company had net losses from operations
since 2012, and an accumulated deficit of $206.0 million at June 30, 2016. For the three-month
period ended June 30, 2016 the Company realized net loss of $2.9 million and used $3.2 million
of cash in operating activities. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had current assets of $10.3
million (including cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 million) and current liabilities of $8.7 million.
The Company’s current capital resources include cash and cash equivalents and other working
capital resources, cash generated through operations, certain planned, non-mining asset sales
with expected net proceeds of over $7 million and existing financing arrangements, including an
equity agreement with International Assets Advisory LLC, as agent (“IAA”), whereby the
Company may offer and sell shares of the Company’s common stock of up to $5 million and a
revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Auramet International, LLC
(“Auramet”). While the Company has been successful in the past in obtaining the necessary
capital to support its operations, including registered equity financings from its existing shelf
registration, borrowings, or other means, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to
obtain additional equity or other financing, if needed. The Company believes it will have
sufficient funds to sustain operations during the next twelve months as a result of the sources of
funding described above.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company prioritized the continued reduction of
non-mining costs including general and administrative, targeting $8.0 million of savings from
reduced labor, legal, consulting and other general corporate expenditures, as compared to 2015.
The Company incurred approximately $0.3 million in severance costs during the six months
ended June 30, 2016, in mining and general and administrative expenses, associated with
organizational cost reductions.
The Company plans to sell non-mining related lands, buildings and water rights valued at over
$10 million over the next twelve months and with planned net proceeds of over $7 million. These
proceeds will eliminate current debt obligations and strengthen the financial position of the
Company. The Company also plans to sell surface mining equipment, no longer required in our
mine plans, valued at up to $2 million and significantly reducing the financing obligations
associated with Caterpillar Finance. These combined actions should eliminate all or
substantially all of the Company’s debt obligations in the next twelve months. There is no
assurance that the Company will be able to sell such assets on favorable terms, or at all.
33
On June 28, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with IAA, pursuant to which the
Company may offer and sell shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.000666 per
share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $5 million. Any shares offered and sold will be
issued pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (and the related
prospectus) declared effective by the SEC on February 5, 2016, with an expiration date of
February 5, 2019. Under the agreement, IAA may sell shares by any method permitted by law
and deemed to be an “at-the-market” offering as defined in Rule 415 promulgated under the
Securities Act, including sales made directly on the NYSE MKT or on any other existing trading
market for the common stock, sales to or through a market maker or sales in privately negotiated
transactions. The Company is not obligated to make any sales of shares under the agreement,
and if it elects to make any sales, the Company may set a minimum sales price for the shares.
The offering of shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the
Sales Agreement by IAA or the Company, as permitted therein. The Company will pay IAA a
commission rate of up to 2.5% of the gross sales price per share sold, subject to an agreed-upon
minimum per share commission, and has agreed to reimburse IAA for certain specified expenses
in connection with entering into the agreement. The Company also agreed to provide
indemnification and contribution to IAA with respect to certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act. As of June 30, 2016, no shares had been issued.
On March 31, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 10,000,000
shares of its common stock. Gross proceeds to the Company from this offering were
approximately $3.5 million before deducting underwriting commissions and other offering
expenses paid by the Company. On April 13, 2016, the Company also completed the sale of an
additional 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock for additional gross proceeds of
approximately $525,000.
On March 6, 2015, the Company reached an agreement to draw on a restated $5 million
revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Auramet, pursuant to which the
Company may borrow up to $5 million, subject to satisfying certain conditions and obtaining
certain consents. On March 6, 2015, the Company drew $5 million representing cash proceeds of
approximately $4.4 million, net of prepaid interest of approximately $0.4 million, and other fees of
approximately $0.2 million. The proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility were primarily used
for an accelerated construction schedule for rerouting State Route 342, located in the Company’s
Lucerne Resource Area, the first phase of which was completed in early June 2015, and the
second phase was completed in November 2015. On December 28, 2015, the Company and
Auramet agreed to increase the facility up to $10 million and extend the facility from the current
maturity of February 6, 2017 to April 28, 2018. On April 1, 2016, the Company fully repaid the
outstanding revolving credit facility with a payment of $1.2 million. As of June 30, 2016, there
were no outstanding amounts related to this facility. The Company is in compliance with all the
required covenants.
Net cash used in operating activities was $3.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as
compared to net cash generated by operating activities of $0.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The Company's use of cash in operating activities in the first six months of 2016,
was primarily driven by Company's expenditures related to underground exploration, including
the PQ and Succor targets and operating losses due to lower production. Our positive cash flow
from operating activities in the first six months of 2015, was primarily from operating income
associated with lower labor, blasting, fuel and equipment rental costs relative to production of
mineralized material.
 
Net cash provided by investing activities was $1.6 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016, primarily from equipment sales of approximately $1.8 million, offset by land and properties
deposits of approximately $0.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months
ended June 30, 2015, was $3.7 million, primarily relating to $1.8 million for strategic land
purchases and $1.9 million for the design and construction of the heap leach expansion and
related infrastructure.
 
Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016, was $0.7
million, comprised of proceeds of $3.5 million from the sale of securities, $0.6 million proceeds
from an amended agreement with Auramet International and $0.3 million from proceeds from a
short-term note, offset by the pay-down of long-term debt obligations of approximately $3.7
million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was
$4.8 million, comprised of proceeds of $4.4 million from the revolving credit facility and $5.0
million from the Varilease agreement, offset by the pay-down of other long-term debt obligations
of approximately $4.6 million.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which considers the realization of
assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of uncertainties noted below.
34
The Company's success depends on its ability to recover precious metals, process them and
successfully sell them for more than the cost of production. The Company has limited control over
its costs and has no ability to control the market prices. The costs of exploration and production
may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, such as the changing composition of ore grade or
mineralized material production, and metallurgy and exploration activities in response to the
physical shape and location of the ore body or deposit. In addition, costs are affected by the price
of commodities such as fuel and electricity. Such commodities are at times subject to volatile
price movements, including increases that could make production unprofitable. A material
increase in production costs or a decrease in the price of gold or other minerals could materially
affect the Company's ability to generate cash flow.
Mineral exploration, particularly for gold and other precious metals, is highly speculative in
nature, involves many risks and frequently is nonproductive. If gold mineralization is discovered,
it may take a number of years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible, if ever,
during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial expenditures
are required to establish ore reserves through drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical
processes to extract metal from the ore, and (in the case of new properties) to develop the
processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mineral exploration. There can be
no assurance that gold reserves or mineralized material that may be discovered or acquired in
the future, if any, will be in sufficient quantities or of adequate grade to justify commercial
operations or that the funds required for mineral production operation can be obtained on a timely
or reasonable basis, if at all. In addition, mineralized material or reserves that may be identified, if
any, will be depleted by production.
The capital expenditures and time required to develop and explore our properties are
considerable and changes in costs or construction schedules, delays in such construction or both
can adversely affect project economics and expected production and profitability.
    
On March 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Drilling and Development Services for Common
Stock Investment Agreement (the "Stock Investment Agreement") between the Company and
American Mining & Tunneling, LLC and American Drilling Corp, LLC (collectively "AMT"),
pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue up to 9,000,000 shares of the Company's
common stock to AMT in exchange for $5.0 million in exchange for future drilling, mine
development and underground mining services in connection with (but not limited to) the
Company’s construction of an underground exploration portal, mining infrastructure and
development of the Company’s Lucerne and Dayton Mine projects.
Future production rates and gold prices below management’s expectations would adversely
affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Future asset sales
could also take longer than expected. If the Company was unable to obtain any necessary
additional funds, this could have an immediate material effect on liquidity and could raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In such case, the
Company could be required to limit or discontinue certain business plans, activities or
operations, reduce or delay certain capital expenditures or sell certain assets or businesses.
There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to take any of such actions on
favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
There have not been any material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates
previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
35
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
Metal Price – Changes in the market price of gold may significantly affect our profitability and
cash flow. Gold prices fluctuate widely due to factors such as; demand, global mine production
levels, investor sentiment, central bank reserves, and the value of the U.S. dollar.
In the second quarter of 2016, Gold Bullion prices averaged approximately $1,259.35 per ounce,
up from a quarterly low close of $1,212.10 on May 31, 2016. Gold has fluctuated from that low to
a high of $1,366.25 during the quarter. Silver prices averaged $16.78 per ounce, also gaining
from a quarterly low of $14.96 on April 4, 2016 to a high of over $18.36 per ounce during the
second quarter. The outlook for these markets remains mixed, driven primarily by uncertainty
over U.S. fiscal and monetary policy.
 
With the exception of the above, there have been no material changes in the market risks
discussed in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
36
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
 
A.  Disclosure
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management
performed, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial
Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Exchange Act and the SEC’s
rules, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system
of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective
disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their
control objectives. Each of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Design and Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our management
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016. In
making this assessment, management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting described in the “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” (2013) set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the
assessment, management concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria.
 
B.  Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
No change in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13(a)-15, occurred during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, that materially
affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
37
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
 
On January 31, 2014, the Comstock Residents Association (the “CRA”) and two of its members
filed a civil action in the Third Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Lyon
County (the “District Court”) against the Lyon County Board of Commissioners (the
“Commissioners”) and the Company, asking the Court to reverse the Commissioners’ decision to
grant an application for master plan amendment and zone change submitted and approved by
the Commissioners on January 2, 2014 (the “Application”). Prior to the approval of the
Application, the master plan designation and zoning precluded mining on certain property of the
Company in the area of Silver City, Lyon County. Generally, the CRA argues, among other
things, that the Commissioners should not have approved the Application because the master
plan and zoning designations on that property had been in place for more than forty years. In
April 2015, the District Court ruled in favor the Company and the Commissioners. The written
Order Denying Petition for Judicial Review was filed and mailed to all parties on June 15, 2015.
On July 14, 2015, the CRA and one individual (together “Appellants”) filed a Notice of Appeal of
the Court Order, appealing the decision to the Nevada Supreme Court. On December 9, 2015,
Appellants filed their Opening Brief in the Nevada Supreme Court, generally repeating the
arguments that were made at the District Court. On January 15, 2016, the Company and the
Commissioners jointly filed an Answering Brief. Briefing in the Nevada Supreme Court was
completed with the Appellants’ filing of a Reply Brief on March 3, 2016. On June 7, 2016, the
Nevada Supreme Court entered an Order indicating that the matter would be scheduled for an
oral argument. As of this date, no oral argument has been scheduled. The Company believes
that the Commissioners properly exercised their statutory authority and the Company, in
cooperation with the Commissioners and the Lyon County District Attorney, will continue to
aggressively oppose the pending appeal.
From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise
in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending or threatened that we expect to
have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
There have not been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 3 million shares of common
stock in consideration of a transaction related to the purchase of land near its mining operations,
with a fair value of $1.3 million.
No underwriters were involved in the foregoing issuances of securities. The offers, sales and
issuances of the securities described above were deemed to be exempt from registration under
the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The issuance of stock was
a private placement of securities to accredited investors within the meaning of Rule 501 of
Regulation D of the Securities Act. Each of the recipients of securities in these transactions had
adequate access to information about us through directorships, business or other relationships
with the Company.
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
 
None.
38
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosure.
 
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 104 of
Regulation S-K, we are required to disclose items believed to be violations of the Federal Mine
Safety and Health Act of 1977, any health and safety standard, or any regulation, as administered
by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. The required information is included in
