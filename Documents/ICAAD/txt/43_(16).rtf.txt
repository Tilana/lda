My ruling on the matter is that all accused persons must remain here until the end of the Prosecution case. If any accused person wishes to be released thereafter until tomorrow morning they have leave to do so. Indeed, if any of the other accused persons also wished to be excused, its entirely up to them. They may also be excused until 9.30 tomorrow morning. I do ask all accused persons who have some input into funeral arrangements and reguregu to try and sought it out today and early tomorrow morning, so that we can continue tomorrow.
