<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Guatemala ended its armed confrontation when the Peace Accords were adopted in 1996.  
This was a major success, but Guatemala has failed to complete the transition to a society in 
which the right to life is secure. 
</p>
<p> Today, a number of violent phenomena afflict Guatemala, including social cleansing, the 
rapidly rising killing of women, lynching, the killing of persons for their sexual identity or 
orientation, the killing of human rights defenders, and prison violence.  In some cases, the State 
bears direct responsibility.  There is strong evidence that some acts of social cleansing - 
executions of gang members, criminal suspects, and other &#8220;undesirables&#8221; - are committed by 
police personnel.  Killings by prison inmates have been facilitated by guards.  In other cases, the 
State bears indirect responsibility.  With a criminal justice system unable to achieve more than a 
single-digit conviction rate for murder, the State bears responsibility under human rights law for 
the many who have been murdered by private individuals. 
</p>
<p> There are 5,000 or more killings per year, and the responsibility for this must rest with 
the State.  Guatemala is not a failed State and is not an especially poor State.  The reason that 
extrajudicial executions are widespread is a distinct lack of political will.  Important legislation is 
not enacted.  Necessary budget allocations are not made. 
</p>
<p> Guatemala faces a choice:  realize the vision of the Peace Accords or fall back on the 
brutal tactics of the past.  On the one hand, Guatemala can choose to implement a working 
system of criminal justice based on human rights.  On the other hand, Guatemala can resort to 
militarized justice, the execution of suspects by the police, and impunity for vigilante justice. 
 Guatemala is aware of its problems, understands the available solutions, and has 
committed to making them a reality in the past.  While this report includes a number of 
recommendations, the emphasis is not on the details but on the need for the Government and 
society of Guatemala to take control of its future. </p>

<p><b>I.  BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>1. I visited Guatemala in August 2006 and met with government officials and members of 
civil society.<b>1</b>  The problems and opportunities I saw are structured by two legacies.  On the one 
hand, much of the violence plaguing Guatemala is structured by practices developed during past 
counter-insurgency efforts.  On the other hand, the changes that are required are very much those 
committed to in the Peace Accords.  The past is, thus, very important, and while the history is 
complex, its outline may be briefly summarized. 
</p>
<p>2. From 1962 to 1996, the country experienced an armed confrontation.  During most of 
that period, the insurgents were weak and much of the Government&#8217;s counter-insurgency effort 
was designed less to diminish its strength than to inhibit recruitment and deter further uprisings.  
The Government undertook a scorched-earth campaign against the civilian population of a 
number of Mayan indigenous regions, culminating in multiple acts of genocide between 1981 
and 1983.<b>2</b>  It is estimated that 81 per cent of the violations committed during the armed conflict 
took place in these three years.<b>3</b>  By the mid-1980s the principal tactic of counter-insurgency had 
shifted to selective killing, in which individual civil society leaders were killed to impede social 
organization and deter political participation.  The total death toll from the armed confrontation 
is estimated to have been over 200,000, with over 90 per cent of the killings committed by the 
Government.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>3. Attempts to negotiate a peaceful outcome to the armed confrontation began with the 
efforts of the Contadora Group (Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama) in the early 1980s.<b>5</b>  
Subsequently, the Esquipulas II Accord was signed by Central American presidents in 1987, 
pursuant to which the Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Reconciliaci&#243;n (CNR) was established to engage in 
talks with the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG).  The CNR comprised 
both governmental and civil society representatives, and conducted several broad-based yet 
quasi-officials rounds of discussion with the URNG from 1988-1993.  The final, successful 
round of negotiations took place under United Nations-mediation directly between the 
Government and the URNG between 1994 and 1996, with the continuing involvement of civil 
society as well as Colombia, Mexico, Norway, Spain, the United States and Venezuela 
(Bolivarian Republic of).

guatemala/contents.php&gt;. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.2

</p>
<p>4. This United Nations-mediated process led to a series of agreements dealing with human 
rights, the establishment of a truth commission, the rights of indigenous peoples, the agrarian 
situation, the role of the armed forces, the terms of a ceasefire, the constitutional and electoral 
regime, the integration of URNG forces, and mechanisms for verifying compliance with the 
agreements.  The Peace Accords provided a comprehensive plan for transforming 
Guatemala from a country that relied on brutal counter-insurgency tactics to maintain order into 
a country that fully respected the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights of all of its 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>5. To assist Guatemala in realizing the potential of the Peace Accords, the United Nations 
Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) was established in 1997.  MINUGUA issued a 
series of reports based on thorough on-the-ground research that provided highly detailed 
information on compliance and made corresponding recommendations.  MINUGUA&#8217;s mandate 
expired in 2004.  United Nations involvement continued when the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights established an office in Guatemala in 2005 at the invitation of the Government.  
Today, OHCHR and others in the international community continue to provide support for 
Guatemala&#8217;s efforts to implement the Peace Accords and ensure respect for human rights.  
However, international involvement has decreased significantly since the Peace Accords were 
signed, and the possibilities for further progress rest squarely on the efforts of the Government 
and civil society of Guatemala.  Today, despite the determined efforts by some, there are 
diminished expectations among the population and mounting calls for <i>mano dura</i> methods to 
deal with crime and disorder. 
</p>
<p>6. While the Peace Accords are one of the legacies shaping Guatemalan society today, the 
armed confrontation has left its own legacy as well.  Some of the practices characterizing the 
later phases of the counter-insurgency have re-emerged as desperate and lawless methods for 
&#8220;fighting crime&#8221;.  The practice of &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;, for instance, reprises the practice of 
&#8220;selective killing&#8221;.  The partial character of the Peace Accords&#8217; implementation has also had 
second-order negative consequences.  For instance, while the State disbanded the PACs and 
withdrew the military from much of the countryside, it did little to establish institutions of 
civilian governance to take their place, leaving a power vacuum that has facilitated the 
development of &#8220;lynching&#8221; as a means of providing order. 
</p>
<p>7. There are now more killings per day than there were during the post-genocide of the 
armed confrontation.  The killing of women, the execution of selected individuals by elements 
within the police and military, gang and crime-related killings, social cleansing, and other acts of 
violence have created a widespread sense of insecurity among the population.  There are 5,000 or 
more killings per year, and the responsibility for this must rest with the State.  And the death toll 
is only the beginning of the cost, for a society that lives in fear of killing is unable to get on with 
its life and business in the ways that it wants.  The rich can protect themselves, up to a point, but 
the rest of the society lives with the fear that a random killing could affect them or their loved 
ones at any moment. 
</p>
<p>8. Guatemala faces a choice:  realize the vision of the Peace Accords or employ the brutal 
tactics of the past and never fully escape the armed confrontation of the past.  The alternatives of 
establishing a working system of criminal justice based on human rights or of falling back on the 
methods of counter-insurgency - and the worst tendencies of <i>mano dura</i> thinking - are both fully 
available to Guatemala, and whatever should happen over the next few years will not be the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>result of unbending fate or inflexible constraints but of the deliberate and consequential choices 
of government officials, politicians, civil society leaders, and regular people.  The policies being 
followed today reflect decisions that have been taken deliberately, however hastily.  Insofar as 
illegal tactics are employed by the State, it is with broad acceptance among the political and 
social elite as well as significant segments of the general population.  There no doubt are &#8220;rogue 
officers&#8221;, but they do not characterize the problem.  The options for the future are well 
understood.  The armed confrontation gave Guatemalans a long and painful education in the use 
of brutal and lawless tactics.  The provisions of the Peace Accords, the recommendations made 
by MINUGUA, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the Inter-American Commission 
of Human Rights, OHCHR and others have given Guatemalans a ready familiarity with what is 
needed to provide democratic policing.  When a country facing problems knows its options and 
has the resources to take its pick, it has no escape from the burden of deciding its future. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>9. In Guatemala, most murders remain mysteries:  The perpetrators are not identified, much 
less convicted (see chapter IV).  This introduces conceptual difficulties, but the legal 
implications are limited.  As a legal matter, the failure to establish individual responsibility under 
domestic criminal law does not absolve the State of responsibility under international human 
rights law.  Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the State 
has legal obligations to both &#8220;respect&#8221; and &#8220;ensure&#8221; the right to life.<b>6</b>  Thus, while there is no 
human rights violation without State involvement, this involvement may be by act or omission. 
</p>
<p>10. On the one hand, human rights law is violated when agents of the State - such as police 
officers or soldiers - arbitrarily deprive individuals of their lives (A/61/311, paras. 33-45).  In 
general, the State may kill only in the form of capital punishment pursuant to the final judgement 
of a court.  This requirement of due process is not a mere formality but, instead, a crucial 
safeguard on the use of violence by the State designed to avoid mistakes and abuses where life 
and liberty are at stake.  The only exceptions are narrowly drawn to permit, for example, police 
officers to shoot to kill when it is clear that an individual is about to kill someone (making lethal 
force proportionate) and there is no other available means of detaining him or her (making lethal 
force necessary).  To permit police officers, among other State agents, to disregard these 
safeguards and execute suspects is absolutely prohibited by human rights law and would be to 
place entirely too much faith in both the discernment and incorruptibility of individual police 
officers. 
</p>
<p>11. In contrast, ordinary murders by private persons will, in most situations, constitute simple 
crimes and not give rise to any State responsibility (E/CN.4/2005/7, paras. 65-76).  The State is 
obligated, however, to exercise due diligence in preventing such crimes.  Once a pattern becomes 
clear in which the response of the Government is clearly inadequate, its responsibility under 
international human rights law becomes applicable.  To meet its legal obligations, the State must 
effectively investigate, prosecute, and punish perpetrators.  When such efforts prove ineffective, 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, arts. 2 and 6.  Guatemala acceded to the 
</p>
<p>ICCPR on 5 May 1992 and had assumed similar obligations under the American Convention on 
Human Rights on 25 May 1978. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.2 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>the State must take whatever measures are necessary to make them effective, including new 
legislation, training programmes, equipment, or budget allocations.  The State incurs 
responsibility under international law insofar as any branch of Government - executive, 
legislative, or judicial - fails to honour the obligations that it has assumed under international 
law. 
</p>
<p>12. The scope of the State&#8217;s responsibility under international law is, thus, much broader than 
the scope of the criminal offence of &#8220;extrajudicial execution&#8221; under Guatemala&#8217;s criminal law.  
That criminal offence encompasses killings by agents of the State as well as killings by private 
persons with the authorization or acquiescence of agents of the State, but does not include 
murders for which impunity is conferred by Government inaction.<b>7</b>  The concept of 
&#8220;extrajudicial execution&#8221; under international law does include such murders accompanied by 
impunity and addresses the responsibility of the State rather than of individual perpetrators.  
Thus, regardless of the extent to which State agents may be involved, the evidence shows that 
the State has responsibility under international human rights law for the widespread killings of 
gang members; gay, lesbian, transgender, and transsexual persons; human rights defenders; 
women; and prison inmates (see chapter III). 
</p>
<p>13. However, while the question of whether particular killings were committed by State 
agents is not critical to determining the State&#8217;s responsibility under international law, it is key to 
determining the measures required for the State to prevent future such killings. 
</p>
<p><b>III. ANALYSIS OF THE KINDS OF EXTRAJUDICIAL, SUMMARY OR 
ARBITRARY EXECUTIONS OCCURRING IN GUATEMALA 
</b></p>
<p>14. In this chapter, I compile and assess the quantitative and qualitative data on the kinds of 
extrajudicial executions confronting Guatemala with which I was provided in discussions with 
government officials and members of civil society as well as in interviews of victims.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Social cleansing:  executions of gang members and other &#8220;social  
undesirables&#8221; by government officials and private citizens 
</b></p>
<p>15. Guatemala is experiencing a high and rising murder rate.  In 2001, there 
were 3,230 homicides; in 2002, 3,631; in 2003, 4,236; in 2004, 4,507; in 2005, 5,308; and by 
mid-August 2006, there had been 2,905.<b>8</b>  In other words, the homicide rate increased an

</p>
<p>alarming 64 per cent over five years.<b>9</b>  (By comparison, the population increased by 8 per cent.<b>10</b>)  
In this context, it is natural that few believe that the criminal justice system is functioning 
properly.  One response has been the emergence - or re-emergence - of social cleansing as a 
desperate and lawless means of confronting gang violence.  Today, a significant number of youth 
are summarily executed for their presumed participation in crime or membership in gangs. 
</p>
<p>16. The principal gangs active in Guatemala are Mara 18 and Mara Salvatrucha, which also 
operate in other Central American countries and parts of the United States.  Estimates as to the 
overall membership of youth gangs vary widely, from 165,000 to 200,000 according to the 
Ministry of Interior to no more than 35,000 according to the non-governmental Coordinadora 
Juventud por Guatemala.<b>11</b>  There are no reliable statistics on how many murders involve gang 
members as perpetrators or victims.  One report I received draws on data from the National Civil 
Police (Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil, PNC) and attributes 40 per cent of the violent deaths in 
Guatemala to &#8220;fights between gangs&#8221;.  Civil society organizations express strong doubts, 
however, with regard to the attribution by the authorities of the majority of the killings to &#8220;fights 
between gangs&#8221; as discounting the contributions of organized crime and of the security forces 
themselves.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>17. Incidents of social cleansing are not effectively investigated, so official data provide no 
insight into their prevalence.  However, a detailed study by the Procurad&#237;a de los Derechos 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  The homicide rate includes acts of social cleansing.  Based on the PDH&#8217;s count of likely social 
</p>
<p>cleansing victims over the years studied, roughly nine percentage points of this increase may be 
due to acts of social cleansing.

<p>  The relationships between the gangs, organized crime, and deviant elements of the security 
forces are widely commented upon but difficult to disentangle.  One interlocutor who had 
investigated this matter was of the opinion that there is some cooperation between the gangs and 
small-scale organized crime, with gang members being hired as informants, lookouts, or hit men.  
In contrast, he suggested, the large-scale organized crime of international drug traffickers 
cooperates closely with deviant elements in the police and military but views gangs as a nuisance 
or unwelcome competition. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>Humanos (PDH) provides a rough picture.<b>13</b>  The PDH systematically reviewed newspaper 
stories concerning violent deaths and tabulated the characteristics of each reported death.  It 
found that in 2005, 63 murder victims had been dispatched with a final kill shot (<i>tiro de gracia</i>) 
and that the corpses of 305 murder victims showed signs of torture.<b>14</b>  Between January 
and June 2006, the numbers were 151 (kill shots) and 435 (torture).  In 2005, the bodies of 
12 per cent of all murder victims - 648 of 5,338 - were found in a location other than where they 
died.  Information about the victims does not provide sure information about the perpetrators.  
However, as the PDH noted, gangs typically kill quickly and flee quickly to avoid being captured 
or killed, suggesting that other, less vulnerable groups engaged in execution for purposes of 
intimidation are responsible for these murders. 
</p>
<p>18. Many of my interlocutors suggested that most instances of social cleansing are carried 
out or at least initiated by private individuals.  A paradigmatic example often given is that of the 
shopkeeper being extorted by gang members and opting to contract with either private hit men or 
off-duty police officers to execute the gang members.  One particularly disturbing expression of 
the problem of social cleansing by private individuals is that there is a Guatemalan website that 
permits users to anonymously denounce individuals as gang members and makes publicly 
available their names and street addresses.<b>15</b>  Most such interlocutors also believed that police 
officers are involved in a more official capacity but tended to see this as a less common 
phenomenon.  The inquiries that I made were not such as to be able to gauge the relative 
frequency of official versus non-official social cleansing; however, those that I met who shared 
first-hand knowledge of social cleansing located the responsibility with the police, and it is this 
kind of social cleansing that I will discuss in greater depth here. 
</p>
<p>19. Based on my interviews with victims and others, I must conclude that allegations that 
personnel working for the Divisi&#243;n de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal (DINC) of the PNC are engaged in 
social cleansing are highly credible.  The pattern is that the police will recruit an informant by 
agreeing to overlook the informant&#8217;s past or present criminal activities in exchange for 
cooperation and will then demand information regarding the identities and locations of gang 
members, suspected criminals, and other targets.  Police will then drive to the location provided, 
typically without uniforms and in an unmarked vehicle, apprehend the person identified by the 
informant, and kill him or her at another location, sometimes following torture.<b>16</b>

cleansing in the site&#8217;s discussion forums illustrate the dangers inherent in this kind of 
anonymous, public denunciation.

the much larger number of complaints that it has received of forced disappearances and

</p>
<p>20. One person I spoke with was a man in his early twenties who reported that he had been 
retained as an informant by DINC.  As an informant, he was witness to a number of incidents of 
social cleansing.  In one incident, a suspected car thief was arrested at his home during the night, 
without an arrest warrant, and his dead body was subsequently found with signs of torture.  In 
other incidents, the people killed were said to be distributing marijuana.  In another incident, he 
took part in a burglary carried out by DINC policemen in which they kidnapped the residents of 
the apartment, who were not seen again.  When another informant told him that the police 
wished to harm him, he went into hiding; that informant was found dead with a bullet in his head 
after going to a meeting with those controlling him in DINC.  The detailed accounts of this 
interlocutor were buttressed by those of a number of other individuals with whom I spoke.  One 
individual had been tortured by the police for gang activity.  Another had been taken away by 
police officers in an unmarked vehicle and threatened with death.  Another well-connected 
individual confirmed the involvement of DINC in such activities. 
</p>
<p>21. The evidence shows that social cleansing is more than the actions of a few rogue officers.  
This does not mean that it has risen to the level of officially-sanctioned policy, but the frequency 
and regularity of social cleansing does indicate that it presents an issue of institutional 
responsibility.<b>17</b>  Neither can the well-documented involvement of the police in social cleansing 
prior to the Peace Accords be overlooked.  The practice of social cleansing today appears to 
represent the reintroduction of practices of selective killing and social cleansing that emerged in 
the later phases of the armed confrontation.<b>18</b>  During the armed confrontation, intelligence 
services of the police and military were often involved both in gathering information on possible 
threats to the State and in eliminating them - without recourse to any judicial process.  Today,

<p>extrajudicial executions by the PNC.  With respect to forced disappearances by the PNC, the 
PDH received 9 complaints in 2004 and 23 in the first half of 2005.  With respect to extrajudicial 
executions by the PNC, the PDH received 21 complaints in 2004 and 28 in the first half of 2005.  
PDH, <i>Las Caracter&#237;sticas de las Muertes Violentas en el Pa&#237;s</i> (Febrero 2006).  Based on these 
complaints, the PDH identified four elements characterizing the conduct of the PNC alleged by 
victims and their family members:  &#8220;1. Las v&#237;ctimas de desaparici&#243;n fueron detenidas de forma 
arbitraria, previamente.  2. La &#250;ltima vez que se les vio fue cuando agentes de la PNC les 
capturaban.  3. Utilizaci&#243;n de veh&#237;culos sin placas e incluso patrullas con la identificaci&#243;n de la 
dependencia policial a la que pertenecen.  4. Ausencia de resultados de las investigaciones que 
permitan identificar a los responsables de los hechos.&#8221;  PDH, <i>Las Caracter&#237;sticas de las Muertes 
Violentas en el Pa&#237;s</i> (Febrero 2006). 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  The study by the PDH shows a dramatic increase in murders that carry the indications of 
social cleansing in 2005 and 2006 as compared to 2004.  This too provides some evidence that 
the practice reflects a shift in institutional practice rather than the capricious brutality of 
individual officers.  However, the significant shift in the percentage of murders that went 
unreported in the press suggests the need for further research before drawing strong conclusions 
about trends.  In 2004, 33 per cent of murders recorded by the PNC were covered by the media; 
in 2005, 66 per cent of murders recorded by the PNC were covered by the media.  PDH, <i>Las

<p>not only is the modus operandi similar but some of the same intelligence institutions appear to be 
involved.  In particular, the Cuerpo de Detectives of the Polic&#237;a Nacional, a predecessor of the 
PNC&#8217;s DINC, was named by Project for the Recovery of Historical Memory (Recuperaci&#243;n de la 
Memoria Hist&#243;rica, REMHI) as having been involved in social cleansing operations during the 
armed confrontation.<b>19</b>  While efforts to clean up the PNC have been made, resulting in the 
expulsion of over 100 policemen in 2005 and an even higher number in the first eight months 
of 2006, groups engaged in social cleansing evidently continue to operate.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  &#8220;Femicide&#8221;:  the unexplained surge in murders of women 
</b></p>
<p>22. The recent upward trend in murders of women is an issue that has provoked outrage in 
Guatemalan society.  The number of women murdered has been increasing year by year, as has 
the proportion of murder victims who are women.  In 2001, there were 303 homicides of women; 
in 2002, 317; in 2003, 383; in 2004, 531; in 2005, 665; and by mid-August 2006, there had 
been 359.<b>21</b>  In other words, the female homicide rate increased by 117 per cent over five years.  
(By comparison, the female population increased by 8 per cent.<b>22</b>) 
</p>
<p>23. These murders of women are collectively referred to as &#8220;<i>femicidio</i>&#8221;, suggesting that they 
constitute a discrete phenomenon.  However, the causes of this upward trend remain poorly 
understood.  I asked numerous interlocutors what they understood the causes of this upsurge to 
be, and I received a very large number of hypotheses, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; As more women enter areas of life traditionally reserved for men, they are targeted to 
put them in their place; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; As more women enter areas of life traditionally reserved for men, they become more 
exposed to the kinds of murder men have traditionally suffered; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; In connection with organized crime, women are killed to put pressure on their 
husbands or boyfriends; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Men feel increasingly free to rape and murder women given the climate of impunity; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Police are increasingly engaged in the social cleansing of gang members and 
associates and, in doing so, do not grant women any special dispensation.

</p>
<p>24. It is likely that individual women have indeed been killed for each of these reasons.  
However, there is a risk that the term <i>femicidio</i> may obscure the diversity of crimes involved.  
This matters because, without an analysis that distinguishes between the various reasons that 
women are killed, it will be impossible to strategically confront the problem by reforming 
institutions or productively mobilizing outrage. 
</p>
<p>25. In Guatemala, the concept of <i>femicidio</i> is often explicated by comparison to the murders 
of women in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, Mexico.  When my predecessor, Asma Jahangir, visited Mexico 
in 1999, she concluded that, &#8220;The events in Ciudad Ju&#225;rez ... constitute[d] a typical case of 
gender-based crimes which thrive on impunity&#8221;, observing that it appeared that &#8220;many of the 
crimes were never investigated for the sole reason that the victims were &#8216;only&#8217; young girls 
with no particular social status and who therefore were regarded as expendable&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2000/3/Add.3, para. 89).  It remains unclear, however, whether the murders of 
women in Guatemala fit the same profile. 
</p>
<p>26. The hypothesis that the rising number of female murder victims is due to the increasing 
use of social cleansing would point in another direction.  The fact that a significant and rapidly 
growing number of female murder victims show signs of intimate violence is often cited as 
indicating that these are gender-based crimes.  However, when these murders are placed in the 
broader context of murders involving torture and other abuse, the data lead to more equivocal 
conclusions.  A PDH study based on media reports showed that, among those murder victims 
who experienced torture or abuse, the acts committed by the perpetrators were generally similar 
whether the victim was male or female.  Of those bodies showing signs of torture or abuse, 
roughly 40 per cent of both male and female corpses showed signs of strangulation, about 
15 per cent of female corpses were left naked and about 11 per cent of male corpses were.  The 
one notable distinction was that while 15 per cent of the female corpses showed signs of sexual 
abuse, none of the male corpses did.  The increase in female homicides involving abuse or 
torture shown in the PDH study would account for at least two fifths of the increase in total 
female homicides shown in police statistics.  Finally, the PDH study found that, in 2005, 
18 per cent of homicide victims whose bodies showed signs of torture or other physical abuse 
were women, while only 10 per cent of all homicide victims were women.  The most obvious 
explanation of these data is that while women have been relatively immune from some forms of 
social violence, both men and women are being targeted by social cleansing.  It is impossible to 
be sure of any explanation for this pattern of violence against women without effective 
investigations and prosecutions, but it appears likely that at least some of it is due to social 
cleansing rather than gender-specific reasons.  Further research is needed, and strategies must be 
adopted to confront the full range of threats to women&#8217;s lives. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Lynching:  private violence filling a power vacuum left by the State 
</b></p>
<p>27. The lynching of suspected criminals by private individuals has been a persistent problem 
since the end of the armed conflict and its one that further illuminates a failure to fully transition 
from the era of armed confrontation.  The most reliable data are those compiled by MINUGUA 
from 1996 to 2001.  During those years, the annual number of lynchings ranged from 35 to 105, 
the number resulting in death ranged from 13 to 29, and the number of persons killed ranged </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.2 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>from 23 to 54.<b>23</b>  I have not found reliable statistics for 2002 to 2005, but, at the time of the visit, 
there had been 13 deaths from lynching in 2006.  MINUGUA conducted an exceptionally 
thorough and well-reasoned study of lynching, and this continues to structure nearly all serious 
discussion of the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>28. MINUGUA&#8217;s study began with a general observation that the areas in which lynching is 
most widespread are areas that suffer disproportionate poverty, are predominantly indigenous, 
have a weak State presence, and experienced the most human rights violations during the armed 
confrontation.  In seeking to explain this pattern, the study began by disproving several 
superficially plausible hypotheses.  First, lynching is not the result of indigenous cultural 
traditions.  Indeed, it found that lynching is a relatively recent phenomenon neither required nor 
permitted by the indigenous systems of justice.  Second, lynching is not a simple continuation of 
the armed confrontation at a lower intensity.  It found that lynchings are typically motivated 
neither by revenge for past violence nor by political or ideological agendas:  55 per cent are in 
response to crimes involving personal property.  Third, lynchings are not opportunistic attacks on 
the vulnerable facilitated by the absence of State institutions:  the vast majority of victims are 
men between the ages of 18 and 40. 
</p>
<p>29. The facts found by MINUGUA demonstrated that the pattern of lynching best supported 
an explanation grounded in Guatemala&#8217;s incomplete transition from the period of armed 
confrontation.  During the armed confrontation, the rural areas were heavily militarized, and 
roughly one million civilians were incorporated into <i>Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil </i>(PACs).  
The imposition of this counter-insurgency apparatus displaced indigenous systems of governance 
and justice, and its removal - without an adequate influx and integration of police, prosecutors, 
and courts - left a power vacuum.  Two facts found by MINUGUA strongly suggest that this 
power vacuum has been filled in part by the (demobilized) PACs and that lynching has been one 
result.  First, in many cases, the persons who instigate or perform lynchings are either former 
members of the PACs or former soldiers.  Second, the manner in which lynchings are carried out 
is similar, and in more than superficial aspects, to the manner in which the PACs conducted 
counter-insurgency operations during the armed confrontation. 
</p>
<p>30. This analysis led MINUGUA to very clear policy prescriptions that remain valid today.  
First, lynching can be combated by revitalizing indigenous systems of justice.  Second, lynching 
can be combated by extending the presence of State criminal justice institutions geographically 
and by better adapting their working methods to the needs of rural communities.  Both measures 
would respond to the power vacuum left by the incomplete transition from the armed 
confrontation. 
</p>
<p>31. This rigorous, solution-oriented analysis by MINUGUA also leads to some broader 
reflections.  First, the analyses of many of the phenomena of violence afflicting Guatemala 
appear disappointingly incomplete in comparison and, thus, far less capable of suggesting policy

</p>
<p>responses.  Second, despite the problem of lynching being well-understood and persuasive 
solutions having been precisely articulated in a well-documented report, the recommended 
reforms have not been adopted, and lynching remains a significant problem. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Impunity for attacks targeting people for being gay, 
lesbian, transgender, or transsexual 
</b></p>
<p>32. There has been impunity for murders motivated by hatred towards persons identifying as 
gay, lesbian, transgender, and transsexual.  Credible information suggests that there were at least 
35 such murders between 1996 and 2006.<b>24</b>  Given the lack of official statistics and the likely 
reticence if not ignorance of victims&#8217; family members, there is reason to believe that the actual 
numbers are significantly higher. 
</p>
<p>33. In most cases, there is no credible information regarding the identity of the murderer.  In 
the absence of effective investigations, it cannot be said with certainty that all of these killings 
have been motivated by the sexual identity of the victim, but the circumstances - e.g<i>.</i>, the killers 
firing from a car in an area of Guatemala city known to be frequented by transgender sex 
workers - often suggest this to be the case.  In those cases with witnesses, both government 
officials and private citizens have been implicated. 
</p>
<p>34. I spoke with one individual, Sulma, who was herself attacked and whose friend was 
killed.  On 16 December 2005, around 11.30 p.m., Paulina and Sulma - both transgender 
persons - were approached in a central area of the capital by four persons riding motorbikes and 
wearing police uniforms.  Without saying a word, the four persons opened fire on them.  Paulina 
died of her injuries in the hospital three hours later.  Sulma was severely injured but survived.  
She was granted police protection.  However, the policemen guarding her at the hospital 
repeatedly told her that she should stop making statements on the incident to investigators and 
others, as she was putting her life at risk by doing so.  Uncertain whether this was well meant 
advice or veiled death threats, she moved to a secret location.  At the same time, she successfully 
applied for interim measures of protection from the Inter-American Commission of Human 
Rights.  While there is a case file concerning the lethal attack on Paulina and Sulma opened at 
the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the proceedings had not made any progress at the time of my visit to 
Guatemala.  Even before my visit, on 10 February 2006, I had already sent a communication to 
the Government of Guatemala, seeking information on the investigations into this crime and the 
measures taken to protect Sulma.  To date, I have not received a reply. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Attacks on human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>35. The situation of human rights defenders in Guatemala is indicative of the broader human 
rights problems in the country.  Death threats, fears of imminent extrajudicial execution and 
assassinations of human rights defenders are alarmingly common.  From 2000 through

</p>
<p>mid-August 2006, at least 64 human rights defenders have been murdered.<b>25</b>  Those defenders 
most frequently assassinated, such as trade unionists, peasant workers (<i>campesinos</i>), indigenous 
leaders or environmental activists, have been upholding economic, social or cultural rights.  
Defenders seeking truth and justice for human rights violations committed during the internal 
armed conflict have also been particularly targeted. 
</p>
<p>36. Few attacks against human rights defenders are investigated and even fewer result in 
convictions, and the killing of human rights defenders has increased in large part due to the 
failure to investigate and punish those responsible.<b> </b> A large number of killings are preceded by 
death threats or acts of intimidation which are not investigated.  Effective investigation of these 
death threats could prevent a subsequent killing.  More broadly, if coupled with effective 
prosecution for assassinations, it could rupture the culture of impunity and deter future killings.  
The establishment of CICIG would be a positive step, but it is neither designed to be nor can be a 
substitute for effective prosecutions by the Ministerio P&#250;blico (see chapter IV). 
</p>
<p><b>F.  The State&#8217;s responsibility for prison violence 
</b></p>
<p>37. According to information provided by the Direcci&#243;n General del Sistema Penitenciario 
(DGSP), there were 3 violent deaths of persons in its custody in 2001, 18 in 2002, 9 in 2003, 4 in 
2004, 42 in 2005, and there had been 18 in 2006 as of July.  The unusually high figure for 2005 
is related to the riots that occurred at multiple prisons on 15 August 2005, in which 25 inmates 
were killed.  Statistics were not provided on the identities of the perpetrators or on whether they 
were inmates or guards.  There were also a number of killings in juvenile detention centres, 
which are subject to the Secretar&#237;a de Bienestar Social rather than the DGSP. 
</p><p>38. Many of the violent deaths in custody indicate either actions or omissions that could 
reasonably be expected to result in death.  One such incident occurred shortly before my visit, 
and I discussed it with both government officials and members of civil society.  The killings at 
the Etapa II juvenile detention centre on 22 June 2006 appear to have been part of a cycle of 
retaliation.  On 6 September 2005, a hand grenade and several firearm shots were fired in the 
Etapa II youth detention centre in San Jos&#233; Pinula, resulting in the death of 1 detainee and 
injuries to 13 others.  Reports indicate that the perpetrators were members of Mara 18 and 
attack was directed against members of Mara Salvatrucha.  On 19 September 2006, men 
believed to be associated with Mara Salvatrucha and carrying firearms entered the Etapa II 
centre and killed 12 detained members of the Mara 18. 
</p>
<p>39. On 22 June 2006, it was again the turn of the Mara 18 detainees to kill detainees of the 
rival gang held at Etapa II.  This time the attack was particularly brutal, involving not only the 
use of firearms but also stoning and severing of limbs.  It resulted in three dead and six wounded.  
The attack and its preparation were partially recorded on the closed circuit cameras of the 
detention centre.  The recording has been seized by the PDH, which has shown it at a press 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>conference and published a report on the incident.  The report found that some wardens 
contributed to arming the killers and enabling them to enter the cells of the victims, while the 
prison authorities and the police failed to intervene to stop the killing.  At 5.53 p.m. wardens 
hung blankets in front of the entry of the section where members of the Mara 18 are detained, 
obstructing the view for both the closed circuit cameras and the guard on the turret overlooking 
the wing.  During the following 40 minutes until the violence started, nothing was done to 
remove them.  During those 40 minutes, wardens brought several unidentifiable objects into the 
section holding members of the Mara 18.  Ten minutes before the violence started, the guard on 
the turret had left for his dinner.  No colleague replaced him.  At 6.36 p.m. three members of the 
Mara 18 emerged from behind the blankets and entered the area of the Mara Salvatrucha.  The 
report notes that it appears from the video that a warden had unlocked the doors to the Mara 
Salvatrucha section<i>.</i>  During the following 40 minutes the gang members shot and attacked their 
victims with stones, severing limbs and crushing skulls.  Forces of the PNC entered the detention 
facility when the violence started, but inexplicably withdrew after 2 minutes and returned only 
41 minutes later.  When investigators of the Ministerio P&#250;blico recorded the crime scene, they 
did not inspect the dormitories in which the attack had obviously been prepared.  They also left 
behind skull fragments, stones used as weapons and ammunition shells. 
</p>
<p>40. The motives of the guards who facilitated the killings are unclear.  However, in the days 
before the incident, members of the Mara 18 detained at Etapa II spoke about a &#8220;party&#8221; (<i>fiesta</i>) 
they were soon going to have and threatened a warden who was refusing to do them a favour that 
he might be victimized at their &#8220;party&#8221;.  The problem, however, goes beyond the corruption or 
intimidation of a few guards.  Too much power has been ceded to the gangs in the detention 
system, and in some instances this appears to have amounted to an unlawful but de facto 
delegation of authority from government officials to gang leaders. 
</p>
<p>41. The human rights law on deaths in custody involves the situation-specific application of 
the due diligence standard.  Many inmates who suffer violent deaths in custody do so at the 
hands of other inmates.  This does not, however, absolve the State of legal responsibility under 
international law.  As discussed above, the State&#8217;s obligation to respect and ensure the right to 
life requires exercising due diligence by taking measures to prevent murders.  In most contexts, 
exercising due diligence primarily entails the investigation, prosecution, and punishment of 
murderers so as to deter future crimes.  However, in the custodial context, this obligation has 
more far-reaching implications.  The controlled character of the custodial environment permits 
the State to exercise unusually comprehensive control over the conduct of government 
officials - police officers, prison guards, soldiers, etc. - in order to prevent them from committing 
violations.  The controlled character of the custodial environment also permits the State to take 
unusually effective and comprehensive measures to prevent abuses by private persons.  
Moreover, by severely limiting inmates&#8217; freedom of movement and capacity for self-defence, the 
State assumes a heightened duty of protection.  While the same basic standard applies in 
custodial and non-custodial settings - the State must exercise &#8220;due diligence&#8221; in preventing 
abuse - the level of diligence that is due is considerably higher in the custodial context 
(A/61/311, para. 51).  This obligation to exercise due diligence is breached both when prison 
officials permit inherently dangerous situations to develop and when they tacitly delegate their 
powers and responsibilities to gangs or individual inmates. </p>

</p>
<p><b>IV.  HOW THE STATE HAS FOSTERED IMPUNITY FOR MURDER 
</b></p>
<p>42. Guatemala has a single-digit conviction rate for murder.<b>26</b>  The implication is obvious 
and disturbing:  Guatemala is a good place to commit a murder, because you will almost 
certainly get away with it. 
</p>
<p>43. To understand the causes of this low conviction rate, I spoke with officials of the 
principal organs of Guatemala&#8217;s criminal justice system, including the Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil 
(PNC), the Ministerio de Gobernaci&#243;n (which oversees the PNC), the Ministerio P&#250;blico 
(which prosecutes criminal cases), and the Supreme Court of Justice.  These institutions are 
responsible for the various phases of the criminal justice process, from crime detection and 
prevention, to investigation and prosecution, to the adjudication of individual criminal 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>44. The PNC is responsible for crime detection and prevention, but with rising crime rates 
the public has little confidence in its efforts.<b>27</b>  In our discussion, the Ministro de Gobernaci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>26
</b>  Dividing the number of crimes recorded by the number of convictions achieved in a particular 
</p>
<p>year does not provide an accurate calculation of the conviction rate, inasmuch as some 
convictions will be for earlier years, and some unresolved cases will result in convictions in later 
years.  To accurately calculate the (current) conviction rate for a given year requires dividing the 
number of crimes recorded in that year by the number of convictions that have been achieved <i>for 
those crimes</i> today.  This calculation cannot be performed in Guatemala, because the databases 
of the various institutions of justice are not integrated, making it impossible to trace individual 
cases as they move from a complaint to a final disposition.  While this should be remedied, in the 
meantime a study tracing a random sample of murders through the system would be invaluable 
in clarifying both the extent of impunity and in more precisely identifying the bottlenecks in the 
system. 
</p>
<p> Some general insight may, nevertheless, be gleaned from the data that the 
Ministerio P&#250;blico was able to provide.  The Ministerio P&#250;blico recorded 8,003 crimes against 
life (<i>delitos contra la vida</i>) in 2005.  In that year, the Ministerio P&#250;blico filed charges in 480 
cases of crimes against life.  In 97 cases involving 111 victims, the defendant was found guilty 
(<i>sentencia condenatoria</i>), and in 34 cases involving 34 victims the defendant was found not 
guilty (<i>sentencia absolutoria</i>).  In an additional 55 cases involving 90 victims, a judgement was 
pending (<i>pendiente de dictarse sentencia</i>), and in 294 cases involving 349 victims, the charges 
remained in process (<i>acusaciones en tr&#225;mite</i>). 
</p>
<p> Thus, convictions were reached for 1.4 per cent of the victims of crimes against life.  If 
all pending judgements and outstanding charges should result in convictions, the conviction rate 
would still rise to only 6.9 per cent.  It would seem quite unlikely that any reasonable measure of 
the conviction rate for crimes against life - or for that subset constituting homicides - would 
exceed a single digit. 
<b>27
</b></p>
<p>  In a survey conducted in the municipality of Antigua in August 2006 of a representative 
sample of 410 residents, only 10 per cent believed the actions of the PNC against crime to be 
&#8220;adecuada&#8221; or &#8220;muy adecuada&#8221;.  <i>Informe de un Estudio Cuantitativo de Victimizaci&#243;n 
</i> </p>

</p>
<p>argued that the principal failings of the PNC were due to a lack of resources.  Guatemala has 
19,000 police officers, 5,000 of which participate in specialized units - largely devoted to 
protecting government buildings, foreign embassies, and individuals - rather than in general 
crime prevention.  Of the remaining 14,000, approximately 7,000 are serving each day, and 
3,500 during a given shift.  A number of my interlocutors suggested that, for Guatemala to be in 
line with the policing levels achieved in El Salvador, it would require between 35,000 and 
38,000 police - a doubling of the force.  The Government has supplemented the number of police 
by instituting joint patrols between the PNC and the military.  Several thousand soldiers are 
participating in these joint patrols, and a typical patrol will consist of 10 soldiers and 2 police 
officers.  Notwithstanding the need to end the use of social cleansing by elements with the 
police, as discussed in chapter III (A), there is no question but that Guatemala needs a far larger 
police force, but enlargement would need to be accompanied by thoroughgoing reform of 
existing arrangements.  It is, however, far from clear that the use of large patrols comprising 
primarily persons untrained in policing techniques is beneficial even as a short-term measure; 
moreover, this remilitarization of policing marks a significant step back from the aspirations 
expressed in the Peace Accords. 
</p>
<p>45. The challenges of investigation and prosecution confront three key obstacles:  a 
problematic division of responsibility, severely limited resources, and endemic corruption. 
</p>
<p>46. Responsibility for investigating crimes is shared by the PNC and the Ministerio P&#250;blico, 
and the latter then prosecutes suspected perpetrators.  The majority of investigative personnel are 
employed by the PNC.  However, by law the PNC investigators must comply with the direction 
of those from the Ministerio P&#250;blico in investigating crime scenes.  This arrangement requires 
close cooperation between the investigators of the PNC and of the Ministerio P&#250;blico.  Despite 
an inter-institutional accord on improving criminal investigations reached by the two bodies in 
2004, by all accounts the level of coordination and cooperation is often unsatisfactory, making 
many investigations inefficient and often unproductive in terms of successfully pursuing 
prosecution.  While disappointing, the failure of a system in which a single function is divided 
between institutions with inevitably competing interests is unsurprising and deeper reforms 
should be considered.  One possible model, from which much might be learned, is the approach 
taken by Chile in establishing a system of investigative prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>47. Limited resources are another cause of inefficient investigations that often produce 
insufficient evidence for effective prosecution.  I was informed that there are roughly 
350 investigators working for the PNC and roughly 100 working for the Ministerio P&#250;blico.  
The latter receives 250,000 complaints each year, and while not all require the attention of an 
investigator, the gap between resources and requirements is enormous.  It is understandable that 
government officials believe that at least 700 additional investigators are needed. 
</p>
<p>48. Another problem caused by a lack of resources, along with inadequate training, is that 
investigations rely overwhelmingly on testimonial rather than physical evidence.  The provision 
of better forensic resources is vital, because, not only is testimonial evidence generally of less

</p>
<p>probative value than physical evidence, but reliance on the former produces the expected 
incentives for the police to coerce confessions and for criminals to intimidate witnesses.  
Congress has passed a bill to establish a National Forensics Institute, there is no guarantee that 
that institute will have adequate resources to make a difference.  As one government official 
noted, Guatemala needs more laboratories, not more legislation. 
</p>
<p>49. That many investigations and prosecutions have been impeded by officials corrupted 
either by intimidation or financial inducement is widely acknowledged in and out of 
Government.  In Guatemala, as in many countries, there are networks of personal connections, 
trust, and loyalty that lead government officials to do favours for their friends and associates in 
private life.  There have also been indications, however, that some corruption is less personal and 
more organized, with &#8220;illegal groups&#8221; and &#8220;clandestine apparatuses&#8221; associated with organized 
crime and elements of the military infiltrating criminal justice institutions to ensure impunity for 
their actions, including murders of rivals as well as of those who seek to expose their crimes.  In 
my discussions with the Minister of Defence, I was disturbed by the apparent evasion of 
responsibility for ensuring that military personnel were not involved in organized crime.  I was 
informed first that the Ministerio P&#250;blico could not take action without a referral from the 
Department of Military Justice, then that the Department of Military Justice took no proactive 
steps to identify criminal activity but would only initiate investigations upon receiving a 
complaint, and finally that the problem could not be too bad because the Ministerio P&#250;blico was 
not investigating any cases against drug traffickers in the military.  This circular reasoning does 
little to dispel the widespread belief that military personnel are involved with drug traffickers, 
organized crime, and clandestine groups.  Whatever the precise contours of the problem, the fact 
of corruption is undisputed and must be addressed.  It is both a cause and a consequence of 
impunity. 
</p>
<p>50. In December 2006, the Government reached an agreement with the United Nations to 
establish the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (Comisi&#243;n Internacional 
Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala, CICIG).  A similar agreement had been reached in 2004 
whereby a similar body would act as an independent prosecutor for cases involving human rights 
violations, organized crime, drug trafficking, and corruption, but this agreement was rejected by 
the Congress and the Corte Constitucional as an affront to Guatemala&#8217;s sovereignty.  CICIG is to 
have a less expansive mandate, acting not as an independent prosecutor but as a <i>querellante 
adhesivo</i> or, that is, as a &#8220;third-party prosecutor&#8221; intervening in a prosecution on behalf of the 
victim.  Traditionally, such third-party prosecutors have played a key role in pushing cases 
through the system, and this arrangement has the potential to make a difference.  The 
establishment of CICIG, while important, is not a panacea.  To end widespread impunity will 
continue to require major reforms to the PNC and the Ministerio P&#250;blico. 
51. Another reform that must be introduced to overcome impunity in cases involving 
powerful perpetrators is the introduction of an effective witness protection programme for these 
kinds of cases.  It is difficult for the PNC to gather evidence or for the Ministerio P&#250;blico to 
sustain prosecutions when witnesses may be intimidated from providing testimony.  There are 
currently multiple systems of witness protection in Guatemala.  One is administered by the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>Ministerio P&#250;blico.  While this system should be preserved and strengthened, its association with 
a body widely believed to be corrupted by clandestine groups makes it inherently unsuitable for 
protecting witnesses involved in some cases.  Another system provides witness protection when 
orders for precautionary measures are received from the Inter-American Commission for 
Human Rights.  These are received and processed by the presidential human rights body the 
Comisi&#243;n Presidencial Coordinadora de la Politica del Ejecutivo en Materia de Derechos 
Humanos (COPREDEH), which in turn arranges for officers from the PNC to watch over the 
witness.  This system is also highly problematic when witnesses are involved in cases concerning 
clandestine groups or the police.  One possibility for reform would be to establish a witness 
protection programme under the PDH.  At a minimum, the current requirement that the PDH 
pass on complaints to the implicated Government agencies must be changed to avoid 
endangering complainants. 
</p>
<p>52. If Guatemala is to stop being a good place to commit murder, its criminal justice system 
institutions must be reformed so that more crimes are effectively investigated, more suspects are 
successfully apprehended, and more cases effectively prosecuted.  This will require major budget 
increases, the implementation of long overdue reforms, a relentless campaign against corruption, 
and serious inter-institutional cooperation.  More simply, it will require a society-wide focus on 
the bottom line:  The State must meet its obligation to apprehend and convict criminals. 
</p>
<p><b>V. THE OPTIONS FOR MAINTAINING ORDER AND  
CONTROLLING CRIME 
</b></p>
<p>53. As I noted at the beginning of this report, Guatemala faces a choice:  Realize the vision 
of the Peace Accords or employ the brutal tactics of the <i>mano dura</i> and never fully escape the 
armed confrontation of the past.  This chapter briefly outlines the character and implications of 
those options and seeks to clarify that the only obstacle to completing the transition from the 
brutality of an earlier era to a criminal justice system based on the rule of law is the distinct lack 
of political will. 
</p>
<p>54. One approach to crime control that meets considerable support is that of the <i>mano dura</i>, 
cracking down on undesirable elements with an iron fist.  In its more respectable forms, 
<i>mano dura</i> policy prioritizes harsh punishment and heavily-militarized sweeps over prevention, 
prosecution, and rehabilitation.  In its more extreme forms - what one interlocutor termed 
&#8220;<i>super mano dura</i>&#8221; - it prioritizes force over legal process.  There is a sense that a swift and 
brutal response to crime is more likely to be effective than the inherently more lengthy process 
of investigation, arrest, prosecution, trial, and punishment.  Indeed, given the failings of the 
criminal justice system, turning to on-the-spot executions of suspected criminals appears to some 
as the only available option. 
</p>
<p>55. However, not only does the summary execution of criminal suspects and other 
&#8220;undesirables&#8221; violate international law, but Guatemala&#8217;s own recent history demonstrates the 
concrete danger of this approach to crime control.  To the outside observer, the rhetoric of 
<i>mano dura</i> bears an uncanny resemblance to that of the &#8220;national security&#8221; doctrine that was 
implemented in many Latin American States in the 1970s and early 1980s and brought </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.2 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p>unqualified disaster.  In concrete terms, moreover, the methods are difficult to distinguish from 
the tactics of counter-insurgency.  The &#8220;selective killing&#8221; that swept Guatemala throughout the 
1980s and early 1990s is notably similar to the &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; plaguing Guatemala today.  
Similarly, the lynchings taking place throughout the country today are strongly reminiscent of 
the counter-insurgency practices of the PACs during the armed confrontation.  To the outside 
observer, it is difficult to understand why the continuing use of these practices is not a matter of 
universal concern.  Unfortunately, however, it appears that even for many who suffered greatly 
during the armed confrontation, the methods of counter-insurgency remain the most obvious 
means of maintaining &#8220;order&#8221;.  It would be prudent for all Guatemalans to carefully consider 
whether they want Guatemala to move fully beyond its legacy of armed confrontation or for it to, 
instead, remain in a permanent state of low-intensity lawless violence. 
</p>
<p>56. The other approach to crime control that Guatemala might choose is that pursued by 
other countries in the region to good effect and reflected in the Peace Accords and international 
human rights law:  Guatemala can develop a working criminal justice system aimed at ensuring 
the rule of law.  Almost all of the formal rhetoric of the political parties endorses this approach.  
The tragic reality, however, is that almost every component of the current system is radically 
under-funded, dysfunctional, or both.  Congress bears an enormous responsibility for this state of 
affairs, but those in Government, civil society, and the private sector could also do far more. 
</p>
<p>57. Many in Government are genuinely committed to a system of criminal justice based on 
prevention, prosecution, and rehabilitation.  Partly due to Congress&#8217;s failure to provide adequate 
resources and to enact necessary legislation, this commitment does not always bear fruit.  In the 
domain in which government officials would appear to have the most potential to create change - 
the reform of institutional structures, policies, and working methods - their efforts often appear 
tangential to the root problems.  There are many institutions, round tables, and commissions 
developing plans, policies, studies, and frameworks, but too often these remain just words.  
Many of the concrete steps taken, such as establishing specialized units to deal with particular 
high-profile problems, are too often small projects that do more to assuage criticism than create 
results.  In Government and in civil society there is a worrying tendency to avoid confronting 
vested interests that would impede the reform of existing institutions by conjuring up new 
institutions that are not (yet) occupied by vested interests.  Those who reject the 
counterproductive brutality of the <i>mano dura</i> and believe in the rule of law must think more 
strategically and build the coalitions necessary to make that vision a reality. 
</p>
<p>58. There is, however, little political will to end impunity and implement a working justice 
system capable of ensuring the rule of law.  There is diffidence among the elite and in Congress 
regarding the commitments made in the Peace Accords related to security and the criminal 
justice system.  For the wealthy, effective policing and criminal justice is a low priority in part 
due to their reliance on private security guards.  (There are roughly 100,000 private security 
guards in Guatemala, more than five times the number of police.)  The lack of political will to 
establish a functioning criminal justice system in part reflects a sense that the State has very 
limited responsibilities to society, and that it is wholly appropriate for even security and justice </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/20/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>to be private rather than public goods.  There is a sense that the State has fulfilled its 
responsibilities so long as it protects the borders and refrains from killing innocent people.  
This understanding of State responsibility is incompatible with the content of that concept 
under international law (see chapter II). 
</p>
<p>59. The Congress has demonstrated little political will to establish a functioning criminal 
justice system, often allowing key legislation to linger for years.  In addition, the inadequacy of 
the resources allocated to the institutions constituting the criminal justice is a justified complaint 
of nearly every interlocutor in and out of Government.  This complaint is widely articulated by 
comparing the resources available in Guatemala to those available in other countries, especially 
El Salvador, a neighbouring country that also emerged from a devastating civil war in the recent 
past.  As discussed above, Guatemala has, even after accounting for the difference in population, 
far fewer police officers, criminal investigators, prosecutors and judges than El Salvador.  When 
government officials complain about a lack of resources, it serves in part as a convenient excuse:  
Yes, people get away with murder, but you cannot expect more when I have so few employees, 
such poor equipment, etc.  As an excuse, it is indeed somewhat self-serving:  one would imagine 
that Guatemala could do better than a single-digit conviction rate for murder without spending an 
additional dollar.  Nevertheless, the resources provided to the PNC, the Ministerio P&#250;blico, and 
the courts are woefully inadequate and place a harsh upper limit on how effective the criminal 
justice system will be. 
60. It is important to emphasize that, while limited resources may provide some excuse for 
particular Government agencies, it provides no excuse at all for the State as a whole.  Guatemala 
is not an exceptionally poor country, and it could readily afford a criminal justice system on par 
with that provided in other Central American countries.  While Guatemala&#8217;s per capita gross 
domestic product is significantly less than those of Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama, it is roughly 
equal to that of El Salvador, twice that of Honduras, and nearly three times that of Nicaragua.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>61. The reason the executive branch of the Guatemalan State has so little money to spend on 
the criminal justice system is that the legislative branch, the Congress, imposes exceptionally 
low taxes.  Again, to put this in perspective, as a percentage of GDP, Guatemala&#8217;s total tax 
revenue has hovered on the high side of 10 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP),<b>29</b> and 
according to the latest estimates, tax revenue amounted to 9.6 per cent of GDP in 2005.<b>30</b>  In

<p>regional comparison, its tax revenue is a lower percentage of GDP than that of Belize, 
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, or Nicaragua, and radically lower than that of the countries 
of South America.<b>31</b>  Neither would higher taxation need to impose any greater burden on the 
poorer segments of the population given that Guatemala has higher income inequality than every 
other country in the region, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and 
Panama.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>62. It is precisely because Guatemala could so readily afford a far better criminal justice 
system that it is impossible to fully distinguish the issue of resources from the issue of political 
will.  The lack of resources is due to a lack of political will:  rather than funding a high-quality 
criminal justice system, Congress has decided to impose very low levels of taxation and, thus, to 
starve the criminal justice system and other parts of Government.  Insofar as impunity is due to a 
lack of resources, it is also due to a lack of political will. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Guatemalans are not ignorant of the problems confronting their country and are 
aware of the policies that could be pursued to ameliorate those problems.  First, Guatemala 
has the detailed plan for social transformation provided in the Peace Accords.  Moreover, 
Guatemala has received copious recommendations from the international community on 
how to realize the commitment made in the Peace Accords and its obligations under 
international human rights law.  In addition to the many reports by government 
commissions and national and international non-governmental organizations, there have 
been a multitude of reports from MINUGUA, OHCHR, the United Nations Human Rights, 
Committee, and the special procedures of the former Commission on Human Rights, now 
the Human Rights Council. The question today is less what should be done than whether 
Guatemala has the will to do so.  Thus, with the understanding that other reports have 
already provided sound and widely-understood recommendations regarding nearly every 
facet of the problem of extrajudicial executions facing Guatemala today, I will be sparing 
in my recommendations and succinct in my conclusions: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Many kinds of violence afflicting Guatemala are poorly understood, impeding 
efforts to craft solutions and mobilize coalitions for change;

<p>&#8722; <b>Continuities between current violations and those from the period of armed 
confrontation are surprisingly widespread and should be the cause of great 
concern among both the national and international community; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The resort to executions of suspects and other persons considered socially 
undesirable as a strategy for ensuring order and reducing crime should be 
absolutely and categorically rejected at every level of Government; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>While there is insufficient information to reliably determine how many killings 
are committed by State agents versus private individuals, both appear to be 
widespread.  Any strategy to confront these killings must have two prongs: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Relentlessly root out the practice of social cleansing by government bodies; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Reform and expand the criminal justice system - especially the PNC and the 
Ministerio P&#250;blico - to effectively investigate and prosecute murders; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>A lack of political will and of resources allocated to criminal justice has made 
effective crime control impossible.  Guatemala must fully accept the scope of 
State responsibility under international law and take the necessary 
measures - including costly measures - to bring crime under control in a 
manner that is effective and just; 
</b>&#8722; <b>Congress should enact the legislation required to implement CICIG and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>package of security-related legislation needed to realize the Peace Accords; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Congress should greatly increase the funds allocated to the institutions of the 
criminal justice system; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>A witness-protection programme adequate to address the needs and fears of 
witnesses, including victims, to human rights violations in which the State or 
other powerful actors are implicated.  This might be established under the 
supervision of the PDH; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>The counterproductive division of responsibility for conducting investigations 
between the Ministerio P&#250;blico and the PNC must be ended.  Establishing a 
system of investigative prosecutors is one possibility that should be considered; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8722; <b>Foreign donors are playing a complex, and in some ways problematic, role: 
rather than funding projects that the State cannot afford, they are funding 
projects that the State has simply opted not to be able to afford.  Insofar as these 
projects benefit those with the least power over the legislative agenda, such 
foreign assistance is commendable.  Moreover, foreign assistance makes up a 
relatively small proportion of the Government&#8217;s budget, and its withdrawal </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/20/Add.2 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>would not necessarily stimulate more responsible fiscal policies.  Nevertheless, 
the donor community should carefully consider whether its assistance is doing as 
much as possible to push the State to assume its own responsibilities. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>At the end of the day, even the crisis in relation to extrajudicial executions can be 
attributed in good part to the Government&#8217;s failure to behave in a fiscally responsible 
manner.  The refusal of the elites to raise the overall level of income derived from taxation 
to a level at which an honest and effective police force and system of justice can be 
afforded, along with a system which respects core economic, social and cultural rights, has 
produced predictable and sometimes disastrous results.  After all, even Governments get 
what they pay for.</b> </p>
