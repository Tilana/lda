<p>1. In its resolution 18/10, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee to prepare a study on the issue of hostage-taking by terrorist groups and its 
</p>
<p>adverse impact on the protection of the human rights of hostages and on the protection and 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of these rights by those living in local communities in the countries of the 
</p>
<p>regions affected. It requested the Committee to submit the study to the Council at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-third session and to present an interim report thereon at its twenty-first session.

</p>
<p>Chinedu Okafor, Shigeki Sakamoto, Ahmer Bilal Soofi and Jean Ziegler. The Committee 
</p>
<p>also recommended that the Council consider a decision whereby it takes note of the 
</p>
<p>recommendation of the Committee and requests it to submit an interim report to the 
</p>
<p>Council at its twenty-second session, and a final report at its twenty-fourth session.1 
</p>

</p>
<p>Committee, joined the drafting group. The Committee recalled the recommendation made 
</p>
<p>at its eighth session,  took note of the progress report (A/HRC/AC/9/CRP.1) and agreed to 
</p>
<p>invite all interested stakeholders, including Member States, international organizations, 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to contribute to the 
</p>
<p>study, and requested the drafting group to finalize its work on the study in the light of the 
</p>
<p>discussions held by the Committee at the ninth session, and to submit the draft final report 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission.

</p>
