1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. 
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a corporate 
governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a statement is located. The 
corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate 
Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate 
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not 
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period. 
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must 
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. The corporate governance 
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3. 
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 which discloses the 
extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during a particular reporting period. 
3 Mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web page, where the entity’s 
corporate governance statement can be found. You can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable. 
Throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not applicable and just 
retain the option that is applicable. If you select an option that includes “OR” at the end of the selection and you delete the other options, you can

form  manner,  which  appropriately  reflects  the  changing  circumstances  of  the  Company  as  it  grows  and 
evolves.  Accordingly,  the  Board  has  established  a  number  of  practices  and  policies  to  ensure  that  these 
intentions are met and that all shareholders are fully informed about the affairs of the Company. 
 
The  Australian  Securities  Exchange  (ASX)  Corporate  Governance  Council  sets  out  best  practice 
recommendations including corporate governance practices and suggested disclosures. ASX Listing Rule 
4.10.3  requires  companies  to  disclose  the  extent  to  which  they  have  complied  with  the  ASX 
recommendations and to give reasons where they have not been followed. 
 
Unless otherwise indicated, the best practice recommendations of the ASX Corporate Governance Council 
(CGC),  including  corporate  governance  practices  and  suggested  disclosures,  have  been  adopted  by  the 
Company for the year ended 30 June 2016 as relevant to the size and complexity of the Company and its 
operations.  Where  the  Company  has  not  followed  a  recommendation,  reasons  for  non-compliance  have 
been identified.  
 
The  Board  currently  consists  of  four  Directors,  one  of  whom  is  the  Executive  Chairman  and  only  one 
Director  is  independent.  Consequently,  it  is  presently  not  possible  to  comply  with  the  following  CGC 
recommendations: 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 4.1 and 8.1. The number of Directors increased from three to four during 
the  year.  On  31  December  2015  the  Company  successfully  completed  a  debt  restructure  with  Standard 
Chartered  Bank  (SCB)  and  Special  Portfolio  V  Limited  (PAG  SPV).  Under  the  terms  of  the  restructuring 
deed Aeris entered into with SCB and PAG SPV, SCB and PAG SPV each have a separate entitlement to 
appoint  one  director  to  the  Aeris  Board.  SCB  elected  to  take  up  this  right  and  nominated  Mr  Marcus 
Derwin,  who was  appointed  to  the  Aeris  Board  on  18  April  2016.  Mr  Derwin  does  not  fall  within  the  ASX 
definition of “independent” by virtue of his association with SCB, which has a material business relationship 
with the Company. The Board considers that all Directors bring significant expertise to the Company and 
that the current structure is appropriate for the Company at this time. The debt restructure was a significant 
step towards stabilising the Company’s financial position. A stable financial position will assist the Board in 
recruiting  suitably  qualified  and  experienced 
future.  The  other 
recommendations that are not fully complied with are: 1.5 and 2.2, and the reasons for non-compliance are 
set out in the respective recommendations.

Recommendation 1.1: A company should disclose:
 

the respective roles and responsibilities of the board and management; and  
those matters expressly reserved to the board and those delegated to management.
The  Board  is  responsible  to  the  shareholders  for  the  performance  of  the  Company  in  both  the  short  and 
long term. Their focus is to enhance the interest of shareholders, taking into account the interests of other 
stakeholders and to ensure the Company is properly managed.
Broadly, the key responsibilities of the Board are:
  Setting  the  strategic  direction  of  the  Company  with  management,  and  monitoring  management’s
implementation of that strategy;
  Evaluating, approving and monitoring major capital expenditure, capital management and all major
corporate transactions;
  Approving  the  annual  operating  budget,  annual  shareholders’  report  and  annual  financial
statements;
  Appointing,  monitoring,  managing  the  performance  of,  and  if  necessary  terminating,  the
employment of the Chief Executive Officer;
2
Aeris Resources Limited 
Corporate Governance Statement 2016
  Approving and monitoring the Company’s Risk Management Policy and Guidelines; and 
  Ensuring  compliance  with  the  Corporations  Act  2001,  ASX  listing  rules  and  other  relevant
regulations.
The Board Charter sets out the Board’s delegation of responsibility to allow the Chief Executive Officer and 
the executive management team to carry on the day-to-day operations and administration of the Company. 
The  Board  Charter  supports  all  delegations  of  responsibility  by  formally  defining  the  specific  functions 
reserved for the Board and its Committees and those matters delegated to management.  
 
Recommendation 1.2: A company should:
  undertake  appropriate  checks  before  appointing  a  person,  or  putting  forward  to
shareholders a candidate for election, as a director; and
  provide  shareholders with  all  material  information  in  its  possession  relevant  to  a  decision
on whether or not to elect or re-elect a director.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for:
  Reviewing  and  recommending  to  the  Board  the  size  and  composition  of  the  Board  and  potential
director appointments;
  Making recommendations for the re-election of Directors; 
  Assisting the Board as required to identify individuals who are qualified to become Board members;
and
  Undertaking appropriate checks before appointing a  Director or putting forward to shareholders a 
candidate  for  election  as  a  Director,  including  checks  as  to  the  person’s  character,  experience, 
education, criminal record and bankruptcy history.
Recommendation  1.3:  A  company  should  have  a  written  agreement with  each  director  and  senior 
executive setting out the terms of their appointment. 
 
All Directors and senior executives reporting to the Executive Chairman of the Company have been given 
formal  letters  of  appointment  outlining  key  terms  and  conditions  of  their  appointment.  A  summary  of  the 
contract details of the Directors and senior executives who are Key Management Persons is set out in the 
Directors’ Report section of the 2016 Annual Report. 
 
Recommendation 1.4: The Company Secretary should be accountable directly to the board, through 
the chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the board 
 
The  Company  Secretary  is  accountable  to  the  Board  through  the  Chairman  on  all  matters  to  do  with  the 
proper  functioning  of  the  Board.  The  Board  Charter  confirms  that  all  Directors  have  direct  access  to  the 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is responsible for:
  Advising the Board on corporate governance matters; 
  Managing the company secretarial function; 
  Attending and taking minutes at all Board and Committee meetings; and 
  Communicating with the ASX.
The decision to appoint or remove the Company Secretary is made or approved by the Board. 
 
Recommendation 1.5: A company should:
  have a Diversity Policy which sets measurable objectives for achieving gender diversity;  
  disclose the Diversity Policy or a summary of it; and  
  disclose  as  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period  the  measurable  objectives  for  achieving 
gender diversity set by the  board in accordance with the  Diversity  Policy and its  progress 
towards achieving them, and the respective proportions of men and women on the board, in 
senior executive positions and across the whole organisation.
The Board has adopted a formal Diversity Policy that is available in the Corporate Governance section of 
the Company’s website. The Board values diversity and recognises the potential benefits it can bring to the 
Company’s ability to achieve its goals. The Diversity Policy provides for establishing measurable objectives 
for  achieving  gender  diversity  and  on  an  annual  basis  the  Company  reports  on  these  outcomes.  The 
Company’s  Diversity  Policy  is  to  provide  opportunities  for  women  wherever  possible  through  internal 
promotion and external recruitment across all levels.
3
Aeris Resources Limited 
Corporate Governance Statement 2016
The  Board  has  not  yet  formulated  measurable  objectives  regarding  gender  diversity;  however,  the  Board 
has endeavoured to maintain existing participation levels within the Company for female employees. Once 
the  Board  has  completed  the  repositioning  of  the  Company’s  business,  it  will  consider  the  measurable 
objectives for gender diversity. 
 
At  30  June  2016,  female  employees  represented  approximately  11.8%  (2015:  14.5%)  of  the  total 
workforce. There are currently no female senior executives or Directors on the Board of Aeris.  
 
Recommendation 1.6: A company should:
  have and disclose the process for evaluating the performance of the board, its committees
and individual directors; and
  disclose,  in  relation  to  each  reporting  period,  whether  a  performance  evaluation  was
undertaken in the reporting period in accordance with that process.
The  Company  currently  has  an  informal  process  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  Board  by  the 
Nominations Committee on an ad hoc basis. 
 
During  the  financial  year ended  30  June  2016  the  Board  was  focussed  on  finalising  the  Company’s  debt 
restructure  and  optimising  its  Tritton  operations  and  has  therefore  not  undertaken  a  formal  process  for 
evaluating the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors during the year ended 30 
June 2016. 
 
Recommendation 1.7: A company should:
  have  and  disclose  a  process  for  periodically  evaluating  the  performance  of  its  senior
executives; and
  disclose,  in  relation  to  each  reporting  period,  whether  a  performance  evaluation  was
undertaken in the reporting period in accordance with that process.
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the financial year ended 30 June 2016 were: Michele 
Muscillo  (Chairman)  and  Alastair  Morrison.  The  Committee  operates  pursuant  to  a  Remuneration 
Committee  Charter.  The  Remuneration  Committee  is  responsible  for  various  aspects  of  remuneration, 
including the review of the remuneration of senior executives and Board members at least annually. 
 
The  Remuneration  Committee  did  not  meet  during  the  year  ended  30  June  2016.  As  the  Board  is 
comprised of only four Directors, the Board considered it more effective to set aside time at Board meetings 
to  specifically  address  the  matters  that  would  have  been  ordinarily  attended  to  by  the  Remuneration 
Committee. 
 
The Board sets a range of goals and specific, measurable targets at the start of the performance year for 
each senior executive including the Executive Chairman. The Board undertook a performance evaluation of 
each senior executive during the 2016 financial year and performance was assessed against the goals and 
targets that were set at the start of the performance year.  
 
PRINCIPLE 2 – STRUCTURE THE BOARD TO ADD VALUE
Recommendation 2.1: The Board should establish a nomination committee which:
  has at least three members; 
  consists of a majority of independent directors; and  

is chaired by an independent director.
and disclose:
the charter of the committee; 
the members of the committee; and
 
 
  as at the end of each reporting period, the number of times the committee met throughout
the period and the individual attendances of the members at those meetings.
The members of the Nomination Committee during the  financial year ended 30 June 2016  were: Michele 
Muscillo (Chairman) and Andre Labuschagne. The Committee does not comply with Recommendation 2.1 
as it only has two members and not three, and it does not consist of a majority of independent directors. As 
there are currently only four Directors, one of whom is the Executive Chairman and only one is considered 
independent, it is presently not possible to achieve compliance with this recommendation.
4
Aeris Resources Limited 
Corporate Governance Statement 2016
The  Board  has  adopted  a  formal  Nomination  Committee  Charter  which  is  available  from  the  Corporate 
Governance section of the Company’s website. 
 
The Nomination Committee did not meet during the year ended 30 June 2016. As the Board is comprised 
of  only  four  Directors,  the  Board  considered  it  more  effective  to  set  aside  time  at  Board  meetings  to 
specifically address the matters that would have been ordinarily attended to by the Nomination Committee. 
   
Recommendation  2.2:  A  company  should  have  and  disclose  a  board  skills  matrix  setting  out  the 
skills and diversity that the board has or is currently looking to achieve in its membership. 
 
The  Board  has  not  yet  established  a  formal  board  skills  matrix  as  the  Board  has  been  focussed  on 
stabilising the Company’s financial position and optimising its Tritton operations.  
 
The  current  Board  members  represent  individuals  who  have  extensive  industry  experience  as  well  as 
professionals who bring to the Board their specific skills in order for the Company to achieve its strategic, 
operational and compliance objectives. Their suitability as Directors has been determined primarily on the 
basis of their ability to deliver outcomes in accordance with the Company’s short to medium term objectives 
and  therefore  deliver  value  to  shareholders.  A  formal  skills  matrix  will  be  prepared,  when  the  Company 
appoints additional suitably qualified and experienced independent directors.  
 
Details  of  Board  members,  their  experience,  expertise,  qualifications,  term  in  office  and  independence 
status are set out at the commencement of the Directors’ Report section of the 2016 Annual Report. 
 
Recommendation 2.3: A company should disclose:
 


the names of the directors considered by the board to be independent directors;  
if a director has an interest, position, association or relationship described and the board is 
of the opinion that it does not compromise the independence of the director, an explanation 
of why the board is of that opinion; and  
the length of service of each director.
In determining the independence of Directors, the Board has regard to the independence criteria as set out 
in  the  ASX  Principles.  Currently,  the  Board  consists  of  four  Directors  of  which  only  Michele  Muscillo  is 
considered independent.  
 
Alastair Morrison is a Non-executive Director but does not fall within the ASX definition of “independent” as 
he  was  previously  appointed  by  Standard  Chartered  Private  Equity  (SCB  PE),  the  Company’s  largest 
shareholder and only ceased employment with SCB PE on 31 March 2014.  
 
Marcus Derwin is a Non-executive Director but does not fall within the ASX definition of “independent” as 
he is a nominee Director of Standard Charted Bank, which has a material business relationship with Aeris. 
In  terms  of  the  restructuring  deed  Aeris  entered  into  with  SCB  and  PAG  SPV,  SCB  and  PAG  SPV  each 
have  a separate  entitlement  to  appoint  one  director  to  the  Aeris  Board.  SCB  elected  to  take  up  this right 
and nominated Mr Marcus Derwin who was appointed to the Aeris Board on 18 April 2016. 
 
In  respect  to  Mr  Muscillo,  a  partner  with  HopgoodGanim  Lawyers  (HG)  who  act  as  lawyers  for  the 
Company, the Board considers that despite the business relationship between Aeris and HG, Mr Muscillo is 
independent  as  Mr  Muscillo’s  annual  billings  to  the  Company  do  not  represent  more  than  1%  of  the 
Company’s annual revenue or more than 5% of HG’s total annual billings. 
 
The term in office of each Board member is set-out at the commencement of the Directors’ Report section 
of the 2016 Annual Report. 
 
Recommendation 2.4: A majority of the Board should be independent directors. 
 
The current structure of the Board does not comply with ASX Recommendation 2.4 as the majority of the 
Directors  are  not  independent.  The  Board  is  currently  comprised  of  four  Directors,  only  one  of  whom  is 
determined  by  the  Board  to  be  independent.  The  Board  includes  one  executive  Director,  Mr  Andre 
Labuschagne, who is also the Chairman.  
 
The Board is of the view that the Board’s current composition serves the interests of shareholders for the 
following reasons:
  The Board has a majority of non-executive directors;
5
Aeris Resources Limited 
Corporate Governance Statement 2016
  All Board Committees are chaired by the independent Director; 
  The  independent  Director  fulfils  the  role  of  the  ‘senior  independent  director’  whenever  the 
Chairman  is  conflicted  (refer  to  Recommendation  2.5  for  the  role  of  the  ‘senior  independent 
director’);
  Under the Company’s directors code of conduct policy, all Directors have agreed not to participate
in any decision in which they are conflicted; and
  After considering the needs of the Company at this time and the Board policies which have been 
put  in  place,  it  is  the  view  of  the  Board  that  it  is  not  in  the  interests  of  shareholders  to  incur  the 
expense of additional directors at this time.
Recommendation 2.5: The chair should be an independent director and in particular should not be 
the same person as the CEO of the company. 
 
Andre  Labuschagne  was  appointed  to  the  role  of  Managing  Director  on  20  December  2012  and 
subsequently  as  Executive  Chairman  on  19  April  2013.  The  Nomination  Committee  and  the  Board 
considered  that  the  combined  role  is  in  the  interests  of  shareholders  in  order  to  utilise  the  proven 
leadership  qualities  and  significant  experience  of  Mr  Labuschagne  through  a  challenging  period  for  the 
Company and to ensure the on-going commercial success of the Company. Furthermore, Mr Labuschagne 
has  been  with  the  Company  since  2012  and  has  therefore  provided  stability  and  continuity  through  his 
detailed understanding of the Company’s operations and the markets in which it operates.  
 
Recognising,  however,  that  an  Executive  Chairman  is  not  able  to  provide  independent  review  of  the 
performance  of  management,  Michele  Muscillo,  an  independent  Director,  fulfils  the  role  of  the  ‘senior 
independent Director’ whenever the Chairman is conflicted. In the role of ‘senior independent Director’ Mr 
Muscillo:
  Works closely with the Executive Chairman, acting as a sounding board and providing support;  
  Being  available  to  shareholders  to  address  any  concerns  or  issues  they  feel  have  not  been
adequately dealt with through the usual channels of communication;
  Meeting  with  the  other  non-executive  Directors  to  review  the  Executive  Chairman’s  performance
and carrying out succession planning for the Chairman’s role; and
  Attending sufficient meetings with major shareholders to obtain a balanced understanding of their
issues and concerns.
Recommendation 2.6: A company should have a program for inducting new directors and provide 
appropriate professional development opportunities for directors to develop and maintain the skills 
and knowledge needed to perform their role as directors effectively. 
 
The  Nomination  Committee  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  new  Directors  are  provided  with  a 
comprehensive induction programme that includes business briefings by management and site visits. 
 
The Board encourages  Directors to continue their education and maintain the skills required to discharge 
their duties by providing professional development opportunities. The Company meets all reasonable costs 
of continuing Director education. 
 
A Director of the Company is entitled to seek independent professional advice (including, but not limited to, 
legal,  accounting  and  financial  advice)  at  the  Company’s  expense  on  any  matter  connected  with  the 
discharge of his or her responsibilities, in accordance with the procedures, and subject to the conditions set 
out in the Company’s Board Charter.
PRINCIPLE 3 – ACT ETHICALLY AND RESPONSIBLY
Recommendation 3.1: A company should:
  establish a code of conduct for its directors, senior executives and employees; and  
  disclose the code or a summary of the code.
The Board has adopted a formal Corporate Code of Conduct. A copy of the Code is made available to all 
employees of the Company and is also available from the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s 
website.
This Code expresses certain basic principles that the Company, Directors and employees should follow in 
all dealings related to the Company.  They should show the highest business integrity in their dealings with
6
Aeris Resources Limited 
Corporate Governance Statement 2016
others,  including  preserving  the  confidentiality  of  other  peoples’  information,  and  should  conduct  the 
Company’s business in accordance with relevant legislation and principles of good business practice.
The Company encourages the reporting of unlawful and unethical behaviour, and protects those who report 
breaches in good faith.  The Corporate Code of Conduct provides protection to whistle-blowers, as required 
by the Corporations Act 2001. 
 
PRINCIPLE 4 – SAFEGUARD INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE REPORTING
Recommendation 4.1: The board should establish an audit committee which: 
  has at least three members, all of whom are non-executive directors; 
  consists of a majority of independent directors; and  

is chaired by an independent director, who is not chair of the board.
and disclose:
 
 

the charter of the committee;  
the relevant qualifications and experience of the members of the committee; and 
in relation to each reporting period, the number of times the committee met throughout the 
period and the individual attendances of the members at those meetings.
The  Audit  Committee  members  are:  Michele  Muscillo  (Chairman)  and  Alastair  Morrison.  The  Committee 
does  not  comply  with  Recommendation  4.1  as  it  only  has  two  members  and  not  three,  and  it  does  not 
consist of a majority of independent directors. As there are currently only four Directors, one of whom is the 
Executive  Chairman  and  only  one  is  considered  independent,  it  is  presently  not  possible  to  achieve 
compliance with this recommendation.  
 
Both members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and have an appropriate understanding of the 
mining industry. All other details of the members’ qualifications and number of meetings held and attended 
can be found in the Directors’ Report section of the 2016 Annual Report.
The  Board  has  adopted  a  formal  Audit  Committee  Charter.  The  Charter  sets  out  the  roles  and 
responsibilities  of  the  Audit  Committee  and  contains  information  on  the  procedures  for  the  selection, 
appointment  and  rotation  of  the  external  and  internal  auditors.  The  Audit  Committee  Charter  is  available 
from the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website.  
 
Recommendation 4.2: The board should, before it approves the company’s financial statements for 
a  financial  period,  receive  from  the  chief  executive  officer  and  the  chief  financial  officer  a 
declaration  that,  in  their  opinion,  the  financial  records  of  the  company  have  been  properly 
maintained and that the financial statements comply with the appropriate accounting standards and 
give a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the company and the opinion 
is founded on a sound system of risk management and internal control that is operating effectively 
 
In accordance with section 295A of the Corporations Act, the Chief Executive Officer (who is the Executive 
Chairman)  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  have  provided  a written  statement  to the  Board  in respect  of  each 
half and full year financial period that:
  The Company’s financial records have been properly maintained; 
  The financial statements comply with the appropriate accounting standards and give a true and fair
view of the financial position and performance of the Company;
  Their  view  provided  on  the  Company’s  financial  report  is  founded  on  a  sound  system  of  risk 
management and internal compliance and control which implements the financial policies adopted 
by the Board; and
  The  Company’s  risk  management  and  internal  compliance  and  control  system  is  operating
effectively in all material respects.
The  Board  acknowledges  that  the  internal  control  assurances  from  the  Chief  Executive  Officer and  Chief 
Financial Officer are not absolute and can only be provided on a reasonable basis after having made due 
enquiries. This is due to such factors as the need for judgment, the use of testing on a sample basis, the 
inherent limitations in internal control and because much of the evidence available is persuasive rather than 
conclusive and therefore is not, and cannot be, designed to detect all weaknesses in control procedures. 
 
Recommendation 4.3: A company should ensure that its external auditor attends its Annual General 
Meeting and is available to answer questions from shareholders relevant to the audit.
7
Aeris Resources Limited 
Corporate Governance Statement 2016
PricewaterhouseCoopers,  the  Company’s  external  auditor,  attends  each  Annual  General  Meeting  and  is 
available  to  respond  to  shareholder  questions  about  the  conduct  of  the  audit  and  the  preparation  and 
content of the audit report. 
 
PRINCIPLE 5 – MAKE TIMELY AND BALANCED DISCLOSURE
Recommendation 5.1: A company should establish a written policy to ensure compliance with ASX 
Listing Rules continuous disclosure requirements and disclose that policy or summary of it. 
 
The  Board  has  adopted  a  formal  Disclosure  Policy  outlining  procedures  for  compliance  with  ASX 
continuous  disclosure  requirements.  The  Disclosure  Policy  is  available  from  the  Corporate  Governance 
section of the Company’s website. 
 
The Policy is based upon the Company’s desire to promote fair markets, honest management and full and 
fair disclosure. The disclosure requirements must be complied with in accordance with their spirit, intention 
and purpose.   
 
The purpose of the Policy is to:
  Summarise the Company’s disclosure obligations; 
  Explain what type of information needs to be disclosed; 
 
  Explain how individuals at the Company can contribute.
Identify who is responsible for disclosure; and
The Company Secretary has been nominated as the person responsible for communications with the ASX. 
This role includes responsibility for ensuring compliance with the continuous disclosure requirements in the 
ASX Listing Rules and overseeing and co-ordinating information disclosure to the ASX, analysts, brokers, 
shareholders, the media and the public.
PRINCIPLE 6 – RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS
Recommendation  6.1:  A  company  should  provide  information  about  itself  and  its  governance  to 
investors via its website. 
 
The Company keeps investors informed of its corporate governance, financial performance and prospects 
via its website. Investors can access copies of all announcements to the ASX, notices of meetings, annual 
reports  and  financial  statements,  investor  presentations  and/or  transcripts  of  those  presentations  via  the 
‘Investor  Centre’  tab  and  can  access  general  information  regarding  the  Company  and  the  structure  of  its 
business under the ‘About Aeris’, and ‘Our Business’ tabs. 
 
Recommendation  6.2:  A  company  should  design  and  implement  an  investor  relations  program  to 
facilitate effective two-way communication with investors. 
 
The Board has adopted a formal Shareholder Communication Guidelines and Policy.
All information disclosed to the ASX is posted on the Company’s website as soon as it is disclosed to the 
ASX. When there are briefings to general groups, analysts or investors on the aspects of the Company’s 
operations,  the  material  used  in  the  presentation  is  released  to  the  ASX  and  posted  on  the  Company’s 
website.  Procedures have also been established for reviewing whether any price sensitive information has 
been inadvertently disclosed, and if so, this information is released to the market.
In addition, the Company seeks to provide opportunities for shareholders to participate through electronic 
means.  Initiatives  to  facilitate  this  include  making  available  on  the  Company’s  website  all  Company 
announcements,  media  briefings,  details  of  Company  meetings  and  both  press  releases  and  financial 
reports.
The  Shareholder  Communication  Guidelines  and  Policy  is  available  from  the  Corporate  Governance 
section of the Company’s website.
8
Aeris Resources Limited 
Corporate Governance Statement 2016
Recommendation  6.3:  A  company  should  disclose  the  policies  and  processes  it  has  in  place  to 
facilitate and encourage participation at meetings of shareholders 
 
The  Company  communicates  with  shareholders  through  releases  to  the  ASX,  its  website,  information 
distributed directly to shareholders and the general meetings of shareholders. To ensure that shareholders 
have the opportunity to participate at meetings of members:
  At  the  Annual  General  Meeting,  shareholders  elect  the  Directors  and  have  the  opportunity  to 
express their views, ask questions about  the Company’s business and vote on items of business 
for resolution by shareholders; and
  The Company’s external auditor attends each Annual General Meeting and is available to answer 
shareholder questions about the conduct of the audit and the preparation and content of the audit 
report.
Recommendation 6.4: A company should give shareholders the option to receive communications 
from, and send communications to, the company and its share registry electronically. 
 
Shareholders  are  able  to  send  and  receive  communications  to  and  from  the  Company  electronically,  as 
provided for in the Shareholders Communication Guidelines and Policy. Transcripts of results presentations 
and  major business presentations are placed on the  Company’s website as soon as  practicable after the 
conclusion of such events. 
 
PRINCIPLE 7 – RECOGNISE AND MANAGE RISK
Recommendation 7.1: The board should establish a committee or committees to oversee risk, each 
of which:
  has at least three members; 
  consists of a majority of independent directors; and 

is chaired by an independent director.
and disclose:
the charter of the committee;  
the members of the committee; and
 
 
  as at the end of each reporting period, the number of times the committee met throughout
the period and the individual attendances at those meetings.
The Board has not formed a committee to oversee risk. The full Board consists of only four Directors and 
has  formed  the  view  that  it  is  more  efficient  for  the  Board  as  a  whole  to  deal  with  matters  that  would 
otherwise be dealt with by a Risk Committee.  
 
Recommendation  7.2:  The  board  or  a  committee  of  the  board  should  review  the  company’s  risk 
management  framework  at  least  annually  to  satisfy  itself  that  it  continues  to  be  sound;  and 
disclose, in relation to each reporting period, whether such a review has taken place. 
 
The  Board is responsible  for reviewing, ratifying  and monitoring systems  of risk management.  The  Board 
adopted  a  Risk  Management  Policy  and  Guidelines  and  this  policy  is  available  from  the  Corporate 
Governance section of the Company’s website.
Financial and operating risks are addressed through approved policies and procedures covering treasury, 
financial, contract management and health, safety and environmental activities of the Company.
In particular the Board monitors and assesses key financial risk areas which include that Aeris has:
  An effective financial risk management system in place;  
  An effective internal control system in place; and   
  A system in place for unusual and/or high risk transactions.
Key  controls  have  been  identified  for  each  business,  and  accounting  processes  with  an  internal  controls 
framework developed. 
 
In addition to external financial audits, all the Company’s operations are also subjected to annual external 
safety  and  environmental  audits  to  Australian  Standards.  The  Company  engages  an  insurance  brokering

firm and an independent insurance advisor as part of the Company’s annual assessment of the coverage 
for insured assets and risks.   
 
The  Company  intends  to  continue  to  work  on  improving  and  enhancing  its  risk  management  framework. 
The  results  of  all  the  various  audits  and  insurances  assessments  are  reported  to  the  Board  at  least 
annually. 
 
Recommendation 7.3: A company should disclose:


if it has an internal audit function, how the function is structured and what role it performs; 
or  
if  it  does  not  have  an  internal  audit  function,  that  fact  and  the  processes  it  employs  for 
evaluating and continually improving the effectiveness of its risk management and internal 
control processes.
The Company does not have an internal audit function. Given the Company’s current size and nature of its 
operations,  the  Board  considers  it  appropriate  to  engage  external  advisors  (independent  of  the  external 
auditor)  as  appropriate  from  time  to  time  to  undertake  various  tasks  that  an  internal  audit  function  would 
perform.  No  external  advisors  were  engaged  during  the  financial  year  ended  30  June  2016  to  undertake 
internal audit activities.  
 
The Executive Chairman and the Chief Financial Officer are primarily responsible for reporting to the Board 
on  a  regular  basis  in  relation  to  whether  the  Company’s  material  business  risks  are  being  managed 
effectively by way of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 
 
Recommendation  7.4:  A  company  should  disclose  whether  it  has  any  material  exposure  to 
economic, environmental and social sustainability risks and, if it does, how it manages or intends 
to manage those risks. 
 
The Board identifies and manages material exposures to economic, environmental and social sustainability 
risks in accordance with its Risk Management Policy and Guidelines. 
 
The Board has overall responsibility for Aeris’ internal control environment, and ensures that Aeris has an 
integrated  framework  of  control,  based  on  formal  procedures  and  appropriate  delegation  of  authority  and 
responsibility. There is a disciplined approach to identification and management of risk.  
 
The following categories of risks have been identified as being specific risks that have the potential to have 
an adverse impact on the Company's business:
  Operational;  
  Environmental; 
 
Insurance; 
  Litigation; 
  Financial; 
  Treasury and finance; and 
  Compliance.
For further discussion on some of the above risks please refer to the Review of Operations and Activities 
section of the 2016 Annual Report. 
 
The  Company  has  established  and  implemented  a  system  for  identifying,  assessing,  monitoring  and 
managing  material  risk  throughout  the  organisation.  This  system  includes  Aeris’  internal  compliance  and 
control systems, which include the following:
Insurance risk engineers’ operational risk reports;  
Insurance risk assessment reports;  
Insurance valuation of plant and equipment reports;
  Aeris’ Health, Safety and Environment Management System Framework;  
  Aeris’ Health, Safety and Environment Management Standards;  
 
 
 
  Aeris’ Group Treasury Policy and Procedure;  
  Risk Assessment Registers for all mine sites; and  
  Board approved policies which are available from the Corporate Governance section of Aeris’
website.

Corporate Governance Statement 2016
PRINCIPLE 8 – REMUNERATE FAIRLY AND RESPONSIBLY
Recommendation 8.1: The board should establish a remuneration committee which:
  has at least three members; 
  consists of a majority of independent directors; and 

is chaired by an independent director.
and disclose:
the charter of the committee; 
the members of the committee; and
 
 
  as at the end of each reporting period, the number of times the committee met throughout
the period and the individual attendances of the members at those meetings.
The  Remuneration  Committee  members  are:  Michele  Muscillo  (Chairman)  and  Alastair  Morrison.  The 
Committee  does not comply  with  Recommendation  8.1  as  it  only  has  two  members and  not  three,  and  it 
does not consist of a majority of independent  Directors. As there are currently only  four Directors, one of 
whom  is  the  Executive  Chairman  and  only  one  is  considered  independent,  it  is  presently  not  possible  to 
achieve compliance with this recommendation.  
 
The  Remuneration  Committee  did  not  meet  during  the  year  ended  30  June  2016.  As  the  Board  is 
comprised of only four Directors, the Board considered it more effective to set aside time at Board meetings 
to  specifically  address  the  matters  that  would  have  been  ordinarily  attended  to  by  the  Remuneration 
Committee.  
 
The  Board  operates  in  accordance  with  the  formal  Remuneration  Committee  Charter,  which  has  been 
adopted by the Board and is available from the Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website.  
 
Recommendation  8.2:  A  company  should  separately  disclose  its  policies  and  practices  regarding 
the remuneration of non-executive directors and the remuneration of executive directors and other 
senior executives. 
 
The Company determines the remuneration of its non-executive and executive Directors and other senior 
executives in accordance with its Remuneration Committee Charter, a copy of which is available from the 
Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website.  
 
Each  member  of  the  Senior  Executive  Team  signs  a  letter  of  appointment  covering  a  range  of  matters 
including  their  duties,  rights,  responsibilities,  fees,  any  entitlements  on  termination  and  job  description.  
Further  information  on  Directors’  and  executives’  remuneration,  including  principles  used  to  determine 
remuneration  is  set  out  in  the  Directors’  Report  section  of  the  2016  Annual  Report  under  the  heading 
'Remuneration Report'.   
 
Non-executive Directors are appointed by letter and remunerated by way of an annual Director’s fee and a 
superannuation  contribution  calculated  according  to  that  fee.  Non-executive  Directors  are  not  entitled  to 
any  further  remuneration  by  way  of  termination  payments  or  any  staff  benefits,  and  are  ineligible  to 
participate in any of the Company’s Incentive Plans. There is no scheme for retirement benefits, other than 
statutory  superannuation.  Executive  Directors  are  paid  a  salary  and  provided  with  shares  and/or  options 
(subject to shareholder approval) and bonuses as part of their remuneration and incentive package. They 
do not receive a separate payment for participation on Board committees. 
 
Further  details  regarding  the  remuneration  of  non-executive  and  executive  Directors  are  set  out  in  the 
Remuneration Report of the Directors’ Report section of the 2016 Annual Report. 
 
Recommendation 8.3: A company which has an equity-based remuneration scheme should have a 
policy on whether participants are permitted to enter into transactions (whether through the use of 
derivatives or otherwise) which limit the economic risk of participating in the scheme; and disclose 
that policy or a summary of it. 
 
Under the Company’s Security’s Trading Policy, participants in the Company’s equity-based remuneration 
plans (the Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the Employee Exempt Plan and Performance Right Plan) 
are not permitted to enter into any transactions that would limit the economic risk of unvested entitlements.
