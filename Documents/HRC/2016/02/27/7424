<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In his report to the General Assembly (A/69/273), the Independent Expert on the 
</p>
<p>effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the 
</p>
<p>full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>identified the question of lending to States that are responsible for gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations as one of his six thematic priorities. The holders of the mandate have repeatedly 
</p>
<p>advocated that lending by international financial institutions, private actors and States 
</p>
<p>should respect international human rights standards, in particular in the context of 
</p>
<p>development cooperation and export credit insurance (see A/66/271 and A/68/542) calling 
</p>
<p>for human rights safeguards in project financing or promoting a human rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach to development cooperation (see A/HRC/25/50/Add.2 and A/HRC/17/37/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>The main focus of the mandate has been to study the human rights impacts of foreign debt, 
</p>
<p>debt relief, structural adjustment policies and austerity measures adopted in response to the 
</p>
<p>debt crisis (see A/HRC/23/37 and Add. 1, A/HRC/25/50/Add.1 and Add. 3 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/20/23/Add.1 and Add.2).  
</p>
<p>2. Previous mandate holders have not, however, addressed in detail the issue of what 
</p>
<p>States, international financial institutions and private financial actors should do when they 
</p>
<p>are confronted with the question of whether they should provide financial support to 
</p>
<p>Governments or State institutions that are allegedly responsible for gross violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights. In cases where States or other actors provide financial support in such 
</p>
<p>contexts, how should they ensure that such support does not facilitate the commission of 
</p>
<p>further gross human rights violations? The Human Rights Council has explicitly requested 
</p>
<p>the Independent Expert to consider the effects of foreign debt and related financial 
</p>
<p>obligations on the enjoyment of &#8220;all human rights&#8221;, it is therefore more than appropriate to 
</p>
<p>fill that gap, considering that the issue of financial complicity has, apart from some 
</p>
<p>exceptions (see, for example, E/CN.4/Sub.2/412, Vols. I-IV and Corr. 1),1 not been studied 
</p>
<p>in a systematic manner by independent experts appointed by the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>3. The focus of the present report is on authoritarian regimes involved in gross human 
</p>
<p>rights violations, but the Independent Expert also argues that there is a link to the protection 
</p>
<p>of economic, social and cultural rights. Withdrawing financial support to States may 
</p>
<p>negatively impact the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights for the affected 
</p>
<p>populations, a problem that has been recognized, for example, in the context of 
</p>
<p>comprehensive economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council. In addition, autocratic 
</p>
<p>regimes have frequently perpetrated gross violations of human rights to suppress public 
</p>
<p>dissent, violating core social, economic and cultural rights. Human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>working on social rights, trade union representatives and land rights defenders are often the 
</p>
<p>first to be targeted. 
</p>
<p>4. There have been difficulties in understanding the causal link between sovereign 
</p>
<p>financing and gross human rights violations by States. However, there is a rational 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See also the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>and Protection of Minorities, <i>Assistance to Racist Regimes in Southern Africa. Impact on the 
</i></p>
<p><i>Enjoyment of Human Rights</i> (United Nations publication, sales No. E.79.XIV.3). From 1981 to 1992, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur continued to submit regular reports to the Commission on Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly under the title &#8220;Adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights of 
political, military, economic and other forms of assistance given to the racist and colonialist regime of 
</p>
<p>South Africa&#8221;, which also covered the issue of lending by States and commercial banks to the 
apartheid regime in South Africa.  </p>


<p>explanation for why human rights violations committed by officials of authoritarian 
</p>
<p>regimes may be influenced by the external financial support they receive. 
</p>
<p>5. Suitable legal and policy concepts are critical to recognizing better the connection 
</p>
<p>between finance and gross human rights violations, taking into consideration the fungibility 
</p>
<p>of the money and the complexity of the administrative and economic structures and the 
</p>
<p>dynamics of authoritarian regimes. The purpose of the present report is to contribute to a 
</p>
<p>better understanding of those links and provide a framework for a future report that will 
</p>
<p>address some legal considerations pertinent to preventing financial complicity and holding 
</p>
<p>lenders accountable for assisting in the empowerment of abusive regimes. 
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert follows the definition of complicity provided by the 
</p>
<p>International Commission of Jurists: &#8220;enabling,&#8221; &#8220;facilitating,&#8221; or &#8220;exacerbating&#8221; human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses through financing.2 In order to address the notion of complicity and to grasp 
</p>
<p>its implications in the financial field, the Independent Expert proposes a macro and holistic 
</p>
<p>approach, interpreting the various connections to sovereign financing. In the present report, 
</p>
<p>sovereign financing refers to every financial loan or provision of assistance to States which 
</p>
<p>includes financing by private, bilateral or multilateral lenders, based on commercial, 
</p>
<p>development or concessional objectives.   
</p>
<p>7. For the purpose of the present report, the Independent Expert understands &#8220;gross 
</p>
<p>human rights violations&#8221; to mean severe and systematic violations of international human 
</p>
<p>rights, which may amount to an international crime, as codified by the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, or any other systematic, widespread and severe violation of 
</p>
<p>internationally recognized physical integrity rights, such as torture, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances, extralegal, arbitrary or summary executions, or arbitrary detention.3  
</p>
<p><b> II. Why does financial complicity matter and what has the 
United Nations done in that field? 
</b></p>
<p>8. Political institutions influence sovereign borrowing, but lending to States also 
</p>
<p>shapes the political institutions of the recipient, including those which are used to perpetrate 
</p>
<p>crimes. That is the fundamental reason why it is important to reflect, from a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective, whether and under what conditions States engaging in gross human rights 
</p>
<p>violations should receive financial assistance.  
</p>
<p>9. During the founding years of the United Nations, the issue of financial complicity 
</p>
<p>came up during the 12 subsequent war crimes trials held by the United States of America in 
</p>
<p>Nuremberg after the Second World War. The Military Tribunal of Nuremberg, when 
</p>
<p>judging whether certain German industrialists who had donated money to the Schutzstaffel 
</p>
<p>(SS) were responsible for criminal acts, reasoned that &#8220;it remains clear from the evidence 
</p>
<p>that each of them gave to Himmler, the Reich Leader SS, a blank check. His criminal 
</p>
<p>organization was maintained and we have no doubt that some of this money went to its 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See International Commission of Jurists, <i>Corporate Complicity and Legal Accountability</i> (Geneva, 
</p>
<p>International Commission of Jurists, 2008), vol. 1. 
</p>
<p> 3 This definition is set out only to clarify the meaning of gross violations of human rights for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of the present report, in order to emphasize that the Independent Expert has in mind multiple 
</p>
<p>and large-scale violations of such rights. That should not be interpreted as an attempt to come up with 
</p>
<p>an official definition of the term for the United Nations, or limit the scope of application of the term 
</p>
<p>to civil integrity rights only. </p>


<p>maintenance. It seems to be immaterial whether it was spent on salaries or for lethal gas.&#8221;4 </p>
<p>To hold them criminally liable, the Military Tribunal found it sufficient to prove that two of 
</p>
<p>the defendants, Flick and Steinbrinck, regularly provided substantial funds to a State 
</p>
<p>organization responsible for the mass extermination of Jews, brutalities and killings in 
</p>
<p>concentration camps, and other crimes under international law. The Nuremberg Trials were 
</p>
<p>not held under the auspices of the United Nations and the crimes against humanity 
</p>
<p>adjudicated in Nuremberg were of an unprecedented nature, but the ruling was nevertheless 
</p>
<p>a landmark judgement, emphasizing that individuals may incur liability under international 
</p>
<p>criminal law for financially contributing to a State organization responsible for mass 
</p>
<p>extermination, war crimes and other gross violations of human rights. 
</p>
<p>10. At the United Nations, the question of whether States, international financial 
</p>
<p>institutions or private finance should refrain from lending to States involved in gross human 
</p>
<p>rights violations has mainly been discussed in the context of sanctions. Several sets of 
</p>
<p>economic sanctions, or lending bans, have been called for by the General Assembly or 
</p>
<p>imposed by the Security Council, with the aim of curtailing or minimizing gross human 
</p>
<p>rights violations. In the 1960s, the General Assembly requested the World Bank and other 
</p>
<p>international institutions to refrain from lending to South Africa and Portugal because of 
</p>
<p>their poor human rights records. While the request was initially fruitless, the World Bank 
</p>
<p>did stop approving further loans to the apartheid regime after 1966;5 the International 
</p>
<p>Monetary Fund (IMF), however, continued lending to South Africa until 1983. Human 
</p>
<p>rights concerns were at the core of the first comprehensive sanctions regime of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, imposed on the white minority regime in Southern Rhodesia by the Security 
</p>
<p>Council in resolution 253 (1968), which included a prohibition on making investment funds 
</p>
<p>or any other financial or economic resources available to the illegal regime.  
</p>
<p>11. In 1977, Antonio Cassese was appointed as Special Rapporteur by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities 
</p>
<p>with the specific mandate of assessing the link between the financial aid then being 
</p>
<p>allocated to the Pinochet military regime and the human rights violations suffered by the 
</p>
<p>Chilean population. His report analysed the political, institutional, economic, budgetary, 
</p>
<p>fiscal and financial conditions then prevailing in Chile and considered how financial aid 
</p>
<p>contributed in this context to the commission of the crimes of the regime, and several 
</p>
<p>countries decided to not lend to the Pinochet regime because of its human rights record (see 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/Sub.2/412, vols. I&#8211;IV). 
</p>
<p>12. The pros and cons of more comprehensive economic sanctions against the apartheid 
</p>
<p>regime in South Africa were feverishly debated for more than two decades. While 
</p>
<p>mandatory sanctions imposed on the regime by the Security Council in resolutions 181 
</p>
<p>(1963) and 418 (1977) were limited to an arms embargo and to a prohibition of military and 
</p>
<p>nuclear cooperation, the General Assembly repeatedly urged the Security Council to 
</p>
<p>consider comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist regime in South Africa, 
</p>
<p>condemned transnational corporations and financial institutions that continued to 
</p>
<p>collaborate with South Africa and repeatedly called upon the IMF &#8220;to terminate credit and 
</p>
<p>other assistance to the racist regime of South Africa&#8221;.6 In 1987, in resolution 42/23B, the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly urged all States to induce transnational corporations, banks and financial 
</p>

<p>institutions to withdraw effectively from South Africa and prevent them from investing in 
</p>
<p>the country and granting loans and credits to South Africa, and to hold them accountable 
</p>
<p>for any transgressions.7  
</p>
<p>13. After the end of the cold war, the Security Council applied comprehensive sanctions, 
</p>
<p>including financial sanctions, to Iraq (1990&#8211;2003), Libya, the former Yugoslavia (during 
</p>
<p>the 1991&#8211;96 break-up) and Haiti (1993&#8211;94).8 In the case of Yugoslavia, the Security 
</p>
<p>Council decided in resolution 757 (1992) that no State should make any funds available to 
</p>
<p>the authorities or any commercial, industrial or public utility in the Federal Republic of 
</p>
<p>Yugoslavia and should prevent any person within their own territories from making those 
</p>
<p>funds available (except payments exclusively for medical or humanitarian purposes and 
</p>
<p>foodstuffs). The sanctions were justified by ceasefire violations, forcible expulsions and 
</p>
<p>attempts to change the ethnic composition of the populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</p>
<p>and Croatia.  
</p>
<p>14. The sanctions regime imposed on Iraq and Haiti raised serious concerns about their 
</p>
<p>adverse impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by the affected 
</p>
<p>population,9 prompting the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to adopt its 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 8 (1997) on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect 
</p>
<p>for economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>15. To avoid such negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights, Security Council 
</p>
<p>sanctions have become more targeted and have included arms embargoes, travel bans, 
</p>
<p>financial sanctions and comprehensive asset freezes on specified individuals and entities. 
</p>
<p>The majority of current sanctions regimes of the United Nations include, as part of their 
</p>
<p>justification, violations of international human rights or humanitarian law, or make explicit 
</p>
<p>reference to particular violations, such as recruiting child soldiers, committing rape and 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence, targeting civilians and other similar offences.10 Sanctions have been 
</p>
<p>imposed on individuals in decision-making positions and on non-State actors, such as rebel 
</p>
<p>and terrorist groups, and private sector actors. As of November 2013, there were 
</p>
<p>575 individuals and 414 entities designated for asset freezes by the Security Council.11 
</p>
<p>While targeted sanctions avoid a number of negative human rights impacts associated with 
</p>
<p>comprehensive economic or financial sanctions, they have raised concerns about due 
</p>
<p>process and unintended negative impacts on economic, social and cultural rights, such as 
</p>
<p>blocking legitimate humanitarian work or preventing the transmission of remittances to 
</p>
<p>family members abroad (see, for example, A/HRC/16/50, paras. 1&#8211;27, A/65/258 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/6/17 paras. 42&#8211;50).  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 The General Assembly had earlier requested all States, pending Security Council action, to adopt 
</p>
<p>legislative and/or other measures to ensure, inter alia, the prohibition of financial loans and 
</p>
<p>investments and the withdrawal of investments from South Africa. See, for example, resolution 40/64.

<p>16. In the case of terrorism, money received by a suspect terrorist group may not have 
</p>
<p>been used to actually commit an act of terrorism.12 However, that does not mean that the 
</p>
<p>funding did not sustain a terror group and its terrorist acts. The issue may be more complex 
</p>
<p>in relation to funding provided to States perpetrating gross violations of human rights, but 
</p>
<p>the same argument can be made.   
</p>
<p>17. One would of course have to differentiate between whether funding provided to 
</p>
<p>States directly finances the commission of gross violations of human rights, or maintains 
</p>
<p>the general functioning and sustainability of a regime that violates human rights, and to 
</p>
<p>what extent funds provided to such regimes might still be used for the realization of human 
</p>
<p>rights, including social and economic rights.13 Sometimes funds facilitate the commission 
</p>
<p>of gross human rights violations in a more direct way, for example when they are used to 
</p>
<p>equip intelligence services, police or other security forces with tools or weapons of 
</p>
<p>repression. In many cases, financial support may rather have an indirect effect through 
</p>
<p>enabling a regime that violates human rights to last longer by, for example, allowing it to 
</p>
<p>fund patronage. We need to better understand when, whether and how official and private 
</p>
<p>lending may contribute to gross human rights violations, in order to design and implement 
</p>
<p>effective laws and policies at the national and international level aimed at minimizing the 
</p>
<p>risk that financial support enables Governments or non-State actors to commit such 
</p>
<p>violations.  
</p>
<p>18. With the present report, the Independent Expert intends to contribute to a better 
</p>
<p>understanding of when financial support may contribute to or sustain the commission of 
</p>
<p>large-scale gross human rights violations by sketching a rational choice framework 
</p>
<p>premised on the incentives of authoritarian Governments and private and official lenders. 
</p>
<p>As developed further below, authoritarian regimes make rational policy choices when they 
</p>
<p>try to stay in power, using available funds to foster loyalty or repress opponents. Lenders 
</p>
<p>also make rational calculations when deciding on loans, for which the likelihood that they 
</p>
<p>will be paid back is key. Complementing the qualitative explanation, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert will discuss the existing empirical evidence of the relationship that exists between 
</p>
<p>sovereign financing, human rights practices and the consolidation of non-democratic 
</p>
<p>Governments engaged in gross violations of human rights. Finally, the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>will present some interim conclusions and invite stakeholders to discuss them. The legal 
</p>
<p>and policy implications of financial complicity will be discussed in a future study.  
</p>
<p><b> III. How additional funds consolidate authoritarian regimes 
in most situations 
</b></p>
<p>19. Authoritarian regimes committing gross human rights violations are politically 
</p>
<p>vulnerable because of their problems of legitimation. Such regimes endeavour to retain 
</p>
<p>power and do so by securing privileges for part of the population, the elites, the military or 
</p>
<p>the security apparatus, by allocating economic benefits and/or political concessions in 
</p>
<p>exchange for support. To remain in power, a regime must address economic constraints in 
</p>
<p>ways that secure a minimum of political support, or enable the bureaucratic or repressive 
</p>
<p>machinery to function efficiently, control society or repress the population. There is a 
</p>

link in transitional justice&#8221;, <i>International Human Rights Law Review</i>, vol. 1, No. 1 (2012).  </p>


<p>mutually sustaining interaction between loyalty and repression, but there are also trade-offs, 
</p>
<p>depending on the target of the strategies.14 Both tactics require that Governments possess 
</p>
<p>sufficient economic resources. The national economy, and more specifically the State 
</p>
<p>budget, must support an effective system to buy loyalty or ensure repression.  
</p>
<p>20. Loyalties can be acquired through (targeted) economic benefits that can consist of 
</p>
<p>resource transfers, subsidies, tariff protections and regulations that guarantee profits, 
</p>
<p>employment and consumption. At the same time, public finance and repressive 
</p>
<p>expenditures should be considered: the budget allocation and bureaucratic apparatus will 
</p>
<p>reflect, to some extent, the repressive capacity and policy of the regime. The loyalty of the 
</p>
<p>military, police or secret services in controlling or repressing opponents are imperative 
</p>
<p>priorities for autocratic regimes that rule mainly through violence. Consequently, global 
</p>
<p>data confirm that autocratic regimes frequently increase military budgets and often 
</p>
<p>overcompensate the military police and other officials who control instruments of violence 
</p>
<p>and coercion.15 Indeed, military expenditures used to strengthen the coercive capacity of the 
</p>
<p>regime and its stability,16 have been found to contribute strongly to a country&#8217;s external 
</p>
<p>debt burden.17 
</p>
<p>21. It is true that Governments can frequently sustain themselves by taxes, income 
</p>
<p>generated by investments, trade in commodities and other internal revenue, allowing them 
</p>
<p>to buy key loyalties and fund agencies of repression, but sovereign financing may 
</p>
<p>frequently be crucial for maintaining autocratic rule and overcoming critical periods of 
</p>
<p>dissent or economic downturns. With a longer time horizon in mind, it is reasonable to 
</p>
<p>expect that external actors who contribute financially to the regular functioning of a regime 
</p>
<p>that violates human rights are helping to consolidate it. Sovereign financing may assist it in 
</p>
<p>attaining its principal feature: retaining power, either through the acquisition and 
</p>
<p>maintenance of key loyalties, or the use of coercion to minimize and marginalize dissident 
</p>
<p>voices. In many authoritarian regimes, the majority of the population remain in a situation 
</p>
<p>of exclusion or dependency, unable to improve their condition or the way they are ruled, 
</p>
<p>fearful that dissent may result in discrimination, torture or death. Freedom of association 
</p>
<p>and assembly are limited, so that dissident voices cannot organize collectively or call for 
</p>
<p>changes. Sovereign financing may serve to further uphold that status quo.  
</p>
<p>22. As money is fungible, funds lent or granted to a regime committing gross human 
</p>
<p>rights violations might of course also be spent in a beneficial way. However, there are 
</p>
<p>several reasons why such economic support may not be in the long-term interest of the 
</p>
<p>population.

<p>23. Firstly, even if it is proven that loans are employed for a beneficial use, such 
</p>
<p>spending could also release other funds that can then be spent for harmful purposes. If 
</p>
<p>lending is used to build roads, construct homes or other public infrastructure, there is little 
</p>
<p>doubt that external financing was not directly allocated for repressive use. However, such 
</p>
<p>projects may also be critical to quelling discontent or buying loyalty. Even funds allocated 
</p>
<p>directly to social programmes or projects aimed at realizing economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights can reduce social and political protest and resistance, thus prolonging the survival of 
</p>
<p>the regime. Furthermore, government revenue that would otherwise have been spent on 
</p>
<p>social or economic development can be distributed to strengthen clientelistic relations and 
</p>
<p>fortify the national security system. 
</p>
<p>24. External funds may temporarily provide more fiscal space for regimes so that they 
</p>
<p>can rely more on buying loyalties and depend less on repression. In fact, when 
</p>
<p>Governments take into consideration the preferences of outside (non-supportive) groups 
</p>
<p>that have their own financial and budgetary priorities, they will probably garner some social 
</p>
<p>and political support, while at the same time contributing to their primary goal which, in the 
</p>
<p>case of authoritarian regimes, may imply surviving in power and carrying out their political 
</p>
<p>and economic plans.18  
</p>
<p>25. Secondly, while the domestic population may perceive that there has been a short-
</p>
<p>term improvement in well-being, as a result of additional public spending, that is directly at 
</p>
<p>odds with the positive conditions that normally surround the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>Multilateral loans might not really benefit the enjoyment of human, social and economic 
</p>
<p>rights, but may have a propagandistic purpose in making a regime look more benign 
</p>
<p>externally than it actually is. The docile nature of the population can potentially be 
</p>
<p>misinterpreted as acceptance of, or support for, a regime, confusing public compliance with 
</p>
<p>expediency. In his report of 1977, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Sub-
</p>
<p>Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities demonstrated 
</p>
<p>that sentiment in the case of the Pinochet regime. Authoritarian regimes have sometimes 
</p>
<p>been able to withstand international pressure from other countries, or the United Nations, to 
</p>
<p>improve their human rights record, because multilateral banks not only provide direct 
</p>
<p>financial assistance to repressive Governments but also facilitate access to more sizeable 
</p>
<p>amounts of private capital. 
</p>
<p>26. Finally, Governments with access to foreign income usually rely much less on the 
</p>
<p>taxes levied from their citizens to obtain revenues.19 That gives political elites little or no 
</p>
<p>incentive to grant democratic representation, or the right to effective political participation, 
</p>
<p>to citizens in exchange for their economic compliance as taxpayers. Economic elites and 
</p>
<p>other relevant groups may be rewarded without the need for political bargaining, voter 
</p>
<p>control or democratic decision-making on the use of funds. As has been explained, &#8220;in 
</p>
<p>developing countries, tax bases are typically narrow and the state&#8217;s ability to extract taxes is 
</p>
<p>notoriously limited. Therefore, governments utilize their ability to sell loans internationally 
</p>
<p>to generate revenue needed to fund domestic spending projects.&#8221;20 However, under 
</p>
<p>authoritarian Governments, those public spending projects have clear and specific political

<p>objectives, including rewarding the loyalty of regime insiders, self-enrichment and 
</p>
<p>financing the coercive apparatus.21  
</p>
<p>27. Increases and decreases in external financing can impact human rights in various 
</p>
<p>ways. There are obviously cases in which foreign (including financial) investments can 
</p>
<p>actually benefit the enjoyment of social and economic rights or promote the virtuous circle </p>
<p>of growth and democratization, fostering greater respect for civil and political rights, but 
</p>
<p>additional financing can also have the reverse effect. Debates on the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>international sanctions reflect the existing uncertainty as to whether reduced lending or 
</p>
<p>economic support will lead to the desired policy outcomes, including better respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights.22 There are several examples in which sanctions limiting foreign investments 
</p>
<p>contributed to a reduction in repression, but sanctions have also sometimes pushed regimes 
</p>
<p>into intensified repression. The matrix below provides a framework highlighting the 
</p>
<p>potential effects loans provided to an authoritarian regime may have on human rights. 
</p>
<p>Frequently those effects will be mixed.  
</p>
<p><b>   
</b></p>
<p><b>Interlinks between finance and human rights, possible scenarios 
</b></p>
<p><i> More human rights violations  Fewer human rights violations  
</i></p>
<p>More funds  Strengthen the regime, free up 
funds for criminal purposes  
</p>
<p>Promote the circle of growth 
and democratization or directly 
benefit the people 
</p>
<p>Fewer funds Provoke instability and 
subsequently more repression  
</p>
<p>Weaken the regime and open up 
a democratic transition 
</p>
<p>28. Cutting off loans can destabilize authoritarian regimes, but whether increased 
</p>
<p>repression will ensue is a more complex question. Two different outcomes are possible: 
</p>
<p>when a regime faces financial constraints and cuts the resources for its population, dissent 
</p>
<p>may occur and the regime may retaliate with elevated repression in the short term. Social 
</p>
<p>and economic instability can beget escalation effects, radicalization of opposition groups 
</p>
<p>and even defections from the security forces. The alternative scenario is that financial 
</p>
<p>difficulties actually reduce repression, because the State has less financial capacity to 
</p>
<p>operate its repressive apparatus, thus reducing the medium- and long-term sustainability of 
</p>
<p>the regime, and ultimately shortening its political life. In sum, refraining from lending to a 
</p>
<p>regime may have negative or positive outcomes depending on those different chains of 
</p>
<p>causality. There are trade-offs between buying loyalty and repression and the regime may 
</p>
<p>be unable to find a sustainable equilibrium between those two options. 
</p>
<p>29. It should be noted that gross human rights violations are increasingly committed in 
</p>
<p>failed States or in the context of weak government structures. A further withdrawal of 
</p>
<p>lending to weak or failing States could therefore cause further harm, as in such contexts the 
</p>
<p>loss of administrative capacity and the lack of effectiveness of law enforcement by the State 
</p>
<p>is a fertile ground for human rights abuses by private individuals or rogue agents of the

<p>State.23 Weakening a State and its law enforcement institutions may sometimes increase the 
</p>
<p>probability of gross human rights violations by further decreasing State capacity. However, 
</p>
<p>just providing funding to a weak or failed State, or its law enforcement authorities, is 
</p>
<p>unlikely to ensure the building-up of State institutions based on the rule of law and respect 
</p>
<p>for human rights. The risk is that resources will rather be invested in repressive, State 
</p>
<p>structures that disrespect human rights, or allocated to sustaining patronage networks. 
</p>
<p>30. As every situation needs to be separately assessed, lenders should respect 
</p>
<p>fundamental due diligence standards, in order to understand the likely consequences of their 
</p>
<p>own behaviour. Risk analysis should not only be focused on the likelihood of whether the 
</p>
<p>loan will be serviced in the future, but needs to assess the impact lending will have on the 
</p>
<p>population and their enjoyment of human rights. That includes not only considering 
</p>
<p>whether the funds will consolidate an authoritarian regime, but also whether the debt 
</p>
<p>obligations imposed on future generations of the country are just. To make informed 
</p>
<p>decisions about their lending, States, the international community, multinational financial 
</p>
<p>institutions and private lenders need to understand how the regime finances itself; to what 
</p>
<p>extent it is dependent on external financing; which State agencies or other actors are mainly 
</p>
<p>responsible for gross human rights violations; what the intentions of the regime are; and 
</p>
<p>whether there are opportunities for a transition to democracy. When financial assistance 
</p>
<p>would predictably contribute to strengthening a regime perpetrating gross human rights 
</p>
<p>abuses, lenders should refrain from allocating funding that will sustain it. Curbing lending 
</p>
<p>under that scenario would ceteris paribus presumably lead to lower levels of human rights 
</p>
<p>abuses in the country.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination and Protection of Minorities explained that point in his report on the 
</p>
<p>financial contributions received by the Pinochet regime: depending on the circumstances, 
</p>
<p>financial assistance can have a positive or negative impact on the human rights situation of 
</p>
<p>any given country. Loans with the precise objective of building houses for the poorest and 
</p>
<p>funds that are earmarked to alleviate suffering will be less likely to have a negative impact 
</p>
<p>than loans granted for general spending needs.  
</p>
<p>32. To some extent, State behaviour has already become sensitive to such human rights 
</p>
<p>arguments. A recent study analysing how States responded to physical integrity violations 
</p>
<p>in developing countries in their bilateral development assistance between 1981 and 2004, 
</p>
<p>revealed that, overall, donor States reduced their infrastructure, general budget and 
</p>
<p>programme support for countries in which physical integrity violations had increased. On 
</p>
<p>average, however, in such countries they maintained their development spending for the 
</p>
<p>social sector, including health, education and water supply, or the promotion of human 
</p>
<p>rights and democratization.24 However, bilateral development financing is only a small part 
</p>
<p>of all financial support or lending and the Independent Expert is not aware of studies that 
</p>
<p>have analysed in a similar way non-concessional lending by States or private lenders. 
</p>
<p>33. Experience with past lending and recent developments should be analysed by 
</p>
<p>lenders to enable them to recognize changing trends. A due diligence analysis should take 
</p>
<p>into consideration at least the following information and factors: the amount, type, 
</p>
<p>objective and timing of the proposed loans; information from post-disbursement monitoring 
</p>
<p>of earlier loans; the growth of debt and the sustainability of public funds to service further 
</p>
<p>debt; the type and character of gross human rights violations and potential changes in the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23 For an empirical study providing evidence for this trend, see, for example, Neil A. Englehart, &#8220;State 
capacity, State failure, and human rights&#8221;, <i>Journal of Peace Research</i>, vol. 46, No. 2 (March 2009). 
</p>

<i>International Studies Quarterly</i>, vol. 57, No. 4 (December 2013). </p>


<p>human rights record of the country in question; information from civil society; the nature of 
</p>
<p>the authoritarian regime; and the actions taken by international organizations and other 
</p>
<p>Governments. Hence, a due diligence analysis to assess the impact of loans or additional 
</p>
<p>loans on human rights should be viewed as a continuous process. 
</p>
<p>34. At the time lending decisions are made, a micro- and macroanalysis of the situation 
</p>
<p>of the borrowing country should include the following questions:  
</p>
<p>(a) Whether the money would directly serve, or be easily diverted, to finance 
</p>
<p>human rights violations (for example, funding for death squads, death camps, weapons or 
</p>
<p>other tools to repress or control the population); 
</p>
<p>(b) Whether financial resources provided to the Government would make the 
</p>
<p>regime politically stronger or extend its life; 
</p>
<p>(c) Whether the loan would improve the enjoyment of economic and social 
</p>
<p>rights of marginalized people, or would more likely be used to sustain clientelistic relations, 
</p>
<p>or whether funding spent in the social sector would rather free government funds for 
</p>
<p>repressive investments than improve the overall human rights situation.  
</p>
<p>35. Lenders should ask themselves those questions before granting any loan. Failing to 
</p>
<p>exercise due diligence may not only come with considerable reputational risk. As legal 
</p>
<p>standards and customs in the area of business and human rights are evolving, it cannot be 
</p>
<p>ruled out that courts may start reviewing such lending decisions, even if many years later.25  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Do funds consolidate regimes engaged in gross violations of 
human rights? 
</b></p>
<p>36. As explained in the previous section, in theory, net lending may have a profound 
</p>
<p>influence on regimes engaged in gross violations of human rights. Funds can influence 
</p>
<p>regime structure and stability, as well as the choices for survival and domination of the elite 
</p>
<p>of a country. However, to what extent is the theoretical, rational choice explanation of the 
</p>
<p>abusive behaviour of a regime confirmed by reality?  
</p>
<p>37. It should be noted that there has been some research analysing whether lending by 
</p>
<p>international financial institutions or structural adjustment programmes imposed by them 
</p>
<p>have had an impact on physical integrity rights. Those studies found that World Bank and 
</p>
<p>IMF adjustment programmes lowered the overall level of government respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights, including physical integrity rights.26 While some scholars have found that net World 
</p>
<p>Bank and IMF lending has improved respect for human rights, their data confirms that 
</p>
<p>physical integrity rights increase when payback of loans exceeds new loans, suggesting that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 In recent civil lawsuits in Argentina, based on responsibility for financing criminal regimes, victims 
</p>
<p>have sued the banks that financed the military junta between 1976 and 1983. Those cases include

<p>it is not the painful payment process which triggers such violations, but rather an indicator 
</p>
<p>of a domestic crisis fuelling repression.27  
</p>
<p>38. Other studies have assessed whether development assistance or conditionalities 
</p>
<p>attached to such lending have been able to reduce human rights violations, showing 
</p>
<p>disparate results.28 While some scholars find that European Union development assistance 
</p>
<p>has had overall a positive impact on certain human rights, such as the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement, freedom of religion and workers&#8217; rights, other experts have concluded that 
</p>
<p>United States foreign aid, despite human rights conditionalities, is associated with increased 
</p>
<p>physical integrity violations.29  
</p>
<p>39. Studies have also been carried out on the impact of economic sanctions on different 
</p>
<p>autocratic regimes and their human rights record, finding that the likelihood of repression 
</p>
<p>depends on the type of autocratic system.30 They have, however, not investigated the impact 
</p>
<p>of net lending on human rights. The Independent Expert is therefore not aware of any 
</p>
<p>empirical research tackling the specific question of the link between foreign debt and 
</p>
<p>regime survival in a systematic way. It is crucial to explore that issue, as the question he is 
</p>
<p>raising has obvious policy and legal implications. 
</p>
<p>40. In the following paragraphs, the Independent Expert will discuss some preliminary 
</p>
<p>evidence of the relationship between foreign financing and the likelihood that an 
</p>
<p>authoritarian regime transitions to democratic rule.31 He is using democratic governance as 
</p>
<p>a proxy indicator for a low likelihood that gross human rights violations are being 
</p>
<p>committed. Ideally, reliable data on gross human rights violations would need to be 
</p>
<p>compiled as well, to assess whether there is a direct correlation between lending and gross 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, but there are several methodological challenges. For example, 
</p>
<p>there is no data set available which tracks over a long period and a large number of 
</p>
<p>countries to what extent States have or have not been engaged in gross violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights. While several data sets exist, which measure on a country basis violations of 
</p>
<p>physical integrity, they usually fail to include in a systematic way information produced by 
</p>
<p>the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. The Independent Expert was therefore 
</p>
<p>hesitant about using them for this report.

<p> 31 This section is based on research undertaken by the Independent Expert, together with Abel Escrib&#224;-
</p>
<p>Folch. See Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky and Abel Escrib&#224;-Folch, &#8220;Rational choice and financial 
complicity with human rights abuses: policy and legal implications&#8221; in <i>Making Sovereign Financing

<p>41. Using democratic governance as a proxy indicator for a low likelihood of gross 
</p>
<p>human rights violations can nevertheless be justified. Empirical studies have found a close 
</p>
<p>and consistent correlation between democratic governance and respect for human rights, 
</p>
<p>including physical integrity rights, using different data sets.32 In other words, widespread 
</p>
<p>and systematic gross human rights violations are rather seldom found in countries that show 
</p>
<p>certain fundamental features of democratic governance. The close link between human 
</p>
<p>rights and democratic governance is not only well tested by empirical research, but has also 
</p>
<p>been stressed in resolutions of the General Assembly (55/96), the Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (2000/47 and 2002/46) and the Human Rights Council (19/36).  
</p>
<p>42. Of course there some caveats: authoritarian or non-democratic regimes are not 
</p>
<p>tantamount to systematic and gross violators of human rights. There is, however, robust 
</p>
<p>empirical evidence that such violations have been more prominently committed by 
</p>
<p>authoritarian regimes. Vice versa, gross violations of human rights may happen as well 
</p>
<p>under democratic governance. The empirical research has only established that democratic 
</p>
<p>regimes and their agents have a significantly lower predisposition to engage in gross 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights, in particular against people living within their own territory.  
</p>
<p>43. It should be acknowledged that distinctions between democratic and autocratic 
</p>
<p>regimes are not always very clear. Democratic governance can be organized in many 
</p>
<p>different ways and the diverse nature of democracies reflects the rich social and cultural 
</p>
<p>traditions of the world. The General Assembly has recognized that there is not one 
</p>
<p>universal model of democracy, but that all democracies share common features (see 
</p>
<p>resolution 55/96).  
</p>
<p>44. One such common feature is described in article 21, paragraph 3, of the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights, which states that &#8220;the will of the people shall be the basis of 
</p>
<p>the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections 
</p>
<p>which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by 
</p>
<p>equivalent free voting procedures.&#8221; Similar provisions are included in article 25 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. For his research, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert has relied on those human rights provisions to distinguish between autocratic and 
</p>
<p>democratic types of governance, reflecting also the current state of the art in political 
</p>
<p>science, which stresses the importance of periodic, free and competitive elections as a key 
</p>
<p>feature of democratic governance.33 
</p>
<p>45. The Independent Expert would also like to acknowledge that there may be a time lag 
</p>
<p>between the allocation of funding and its potential impact on gross violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights. According to the explanations provided in the previous section, a regime may either 
</p>
<p>invest funds to buy loyalty or strengthen the repressive apparatus. The life of the regime 
</p>
<p>may thus be prolonged without necessarily seeing an immediate human rights impact in the 
</p>
<p>form of more or less gross human rights violations. However, as long as an autocratic 
</p>

assessment&#8221;, <i>International Studies Quarterly</i>, vol. 48, No. 3 (September 2004); Christian Davenport 
and David A. Armstrong, &#8220;Democracy and the violation of human rights: a statistical analysis from 
1976 to 1996&#8221;, <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, vol. 48, No. 3 (July 2004); Steven C. Poe, and

</p>
<p> 33 For the data presented further below, the Independent Expert has relied on the classification made by 
</p>
<p>Barbara Geddes, Joseph Wright and Erica Frantz in &#8220;Autocratic breakdown and regimes transitions: a 
new data set&#8221;, <i>Perspectives on Politics</i>, vol. 12, No. 2 (June 2014).  </p>


<p>regime remains in power, there remains a greater risk that such a regime will engage in 
</p>
<p>systematic suppression.  
</p>
<p>46. Preliminary empirical evidence shows that foreign financial sources might have an 
</p>
<p>important impact on the durability of authoritarian regimes in power.34 The authors of the 
</p>
<p>study in question consider whether net transfers of public and publicly guaranteed external 
</p>
<p>debt have an impact on the likelihood that an authoritarian regime transitions to democracy 
</p>
<p>during the same year, using data covering the period 1970&#8211;2006.35 The analysis is based on 
</p>
<p>a data set capturing 158 different episodes of authoritarian rule in 91 countries.  
</p>
<p>47. The results show the negative impact over a period of 36 years that foreign debt has 
</p>
<p>had on the likelihood of a transition to democracy.36 While more research is needed and the 
</p>
<p>preliminary results should be interpreted with caution<i>, </i>the effects are statistically significant 
</p>
<p>at conventional levels. They suggest that foreign loans contribute to the perpetuation of 
</p>
<p>authoritarian regimes. While the gross probability of a transition to democracy (within one 
</p>
<p>year) in the sample is 2.2 per cent, moving from the minimum to the maximum value of the 
</p>
<p>debt variable brings about a 1.65 per cent (per year) decrease in the probability of 
</p>
<p>democratization (then reaching 0.3&#8211;0.4 per cent).37 Over a 10-year period, for example, the 
</p>
<p>effect would obviously be higher. The data set would predict that, on average, 22 per cent 
</p>
<p>of all authoritarian regimes not benefitting from public or private lending would transition 
</p>
<p>to democratic governance. However of those regimes regularly receiving net public or 
</p>
<p>private lending, only 3.35 per cent would become democratically ruled. Some additional 
</p>
<p>tests also reveal that foreign borrowing might be of special relevance in times of economic 
</p>
<p>downturn, which usually lead to severe shrinkages in State revenues.  
</p>
<p>48. Rerunning the regime survival model detailed above, but distinguishing between net 
</p>
<p>transfers on external debt (public and publicly guaranteed external debt) from official 
</p>
<p>creditors and those from private lenders, it is possible to observe the impact of foreign debt 
</p>
<p>provided by private and official creditors on the likelihood of democratization.38  
</p>
<p>49. The results suggest that, although both sources of funds have helped authoritarian 
</p>
<p>regimes endure,
 
loans from private creditors have actually been more likely to stabilize 
</p>
<p>authoritarian regimes than official lending and thus are probably also more harmful to 
</p>
<p>human rights.39 Additional research is needed to establish whether funds provided to 
</p>
<p>authoritarian regimes are used to buy loyalties through patronage (thus prolonging the life 
</p>
<p>of the regime), or are used to boost the repressive apparatus of the regime.  
</p>
<p>50. The different impact of official and private lending might partially be explained by 
</p>
<p>the fact that official creditors, in particular bilateral lenders, may be subject to some 
</p>
<p>(although frequently limited) political accountability. As most of the world&#8217;s large bilateral 
</p>
<p>lenders enjoy some form of democratic governance, voters and civil society might resent 
</p>
<p>their Governments using taxpayers&#8217; money to support States violating fundamental human 
</p>
<p>rights. Similarly, albeit frequently criticized for their lack of transparency and democratic 
</p>

<p>control, international financial institutions are subject to the scrutiny of public opinion, 
</p>
<p>transnational groups, civil society and member States.40  
</p>
<p>51. In contrast, while civil society is increasingly monitoring corporations, voters exert 
</p>
<p>less control over private lenders operating in international financial markets and States have 
</p>
<p>so far prohibited private lenders only in exceptional circumstances by legal regulation from 
</p>
<p>providing funds to States or State institutions with a bad human rights record.41 Market 
</p>
<p>discipline alone provides insufficient incentives for lending that is sensitive to human 
</p>
<p>rights. It looks mainly at debt sustainability and the likelihood that the loan will be repaid, 
</p>
<p>not at the democratic character of a regime, nor its predisposition for human rights abuse. 
</p>
<p>The market does not prevent loans to dictators. On the contrary, once loans are provided to 
</p>
<p>autocratic regimes, the market rather provides incentives to grant additional funds to such a 
</p>
<p>regime, in order to stabilize it and ensure its repayment capacity. Market logic thus 
</p>
<p>becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Next steps 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>Lending to regimes that commit gross human rights violations may contribute 
</b></p>
<p><b>to regime consolidation, prolong disrespect for human rights and increase the 
</b></p>
<p><b>likelihood of gross violations of human rights. Those conclusions can stand for both 
</b></p>
<p><b>official and private financial assistance to Governments. Nevertheless, private lending 
</b></p>
<p><b>seems to be more damaging, as it might enjoy lower public accountability compared to 
</b></p>
<p><b>lending between States and to loans allocated by international financial institutions.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The statistical analysis presented above, which is based on 158 different 
</b></p>
<p><b>episodes of authoritarian rule in 91 countries, suggests that net fund transfers may 
</b></p>
<p><b>prolong autocratic rule and thus increase the risk of gross violations of human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>However, each country situation must be assessed individually. The rational choice 
</b></p>
<p><b>model presented by the Independent Expert, suggesting the likely causalities and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>quantitative data presented, must be checked by case studies that serve to illustrate 
</b></p>
<p><b>the causal linkages between the financial aid received and gross violations of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights perpetrated by authoritarian regimes.  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>According to the argumentation developed in the previous sections, unless 
</b></p>
<p><b>lending decisions are subjected to human rights impact assessments, appropriately 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeted or mitigated by contractual measures, financial lending can have a persistent 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on authoritarian regimes, making it possible for them to consolidate autocratic 
</b></p>
<p><b>rule and perpetuate political exclusion and human rights violations, and reducing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>need for political concessions. However, it may sometimes be best not to lend on any 
</b></p>
<p><b>condition, as financial inflows could impair the human rights situation, either 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediately or over the longer term. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>States engaged in gross human rights violations not only torture and kill 
</b></p>
<p><b>people, but may also impose economic models that violate fundamental social, 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic and cultural rights. As Antonio Cassese explained in a paper he wrote in 
</b></p>

</p>
<p> 40 James H. Lebovic and Erik Voeten in &#8220;The costs of shame: international organizations and foreign aid

</p>
<p>found that multilateral development cooperation commitments showed greater sensitivity to criticism 
</p>
<p>of human rights records by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights compared to bilateral 
</p>
<p>commitments.

</p>

<p><b>1979, the ways in which different rights violations are interlinked is often part of the

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>form trade unions, or from countries with weak social, safety and health standards. If 
</b></p>
<p><b>foreign actors make decisions based on profitability, and profitability is more likely to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be higher when human rights are restrained, then economic assistance can contribute 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the perpetuation of human rights abuses and such abuses, in turn, might potentially 
</b></p>
<p><b>bring about the necessary conditions to attract and obtain additional economic

<p>56. <b>The present report has not dealt with the legal aspects of financial complicity in 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights, or international or national law. The purpose of the report is to 
</b></p>
<p><b>provoke discussion and to obtain feedback from stakeholders, to be able to assess the 
</b></p>
<p><b>robustness of the framework and data provided, stimulate further data collection and

<p><b>analysis of financial complicity and policy guidance as to how States and private

<p><b>financial actors should deal with the issue. He hopes that in a future report, he will

<p><b>States or State institutions with questionable human rights records, such guidance

<p><b>contribute to gross violations of human rights or international crimes. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Independent Expert also intends to discuss in a future report whether the 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of additional legal standards is required to address the issue. That
