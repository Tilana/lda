<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The open-ended intergovernmental working group on a draft United Nations 
</p>
<p>declaration on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas (hereinafter, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the working group&#8221;) was established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 21/19 
</p>
<p>and recalling Council resolutions 13/4, 16/27 and 19/7, with a mandate of negotiating, 
</p>
<p>finalizing and submitting to the Human Rights Council a draft United Nations declaration 
</p>
<p>on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas. Council resolution 26/26 
</p>
<p>of 23 June 2014 mandated the working group to hold its second session for five working 
</p>
<p>days before the twenty-ninth session of the Council; requested the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
</p>
<p>working group to conduct informal consultations with Governments, relevant special 
</p>
<p>procedures of the Human Rights Council, regional groups, intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, United Nations mechanisms, civil society and representatives of peasants 
</p>
<p>and other people working in rural areas; requested the Chair-Rapporteur of the working 
</p>
<p>group to prepare a new text on the basis of the discussions held during the first session of 
</p>
<p>the working group, the draft declaration presented by the Advisory Committee, and the 
</p>
<p>informal consultations to be held, and present it to the working group at its second session 
</p>
<p>for consideration and further discussion. The resolution also requested the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide the working group with 
</p>
<p>the human, technical and financial assistance necessary for it to fulfil its mandate; and 
</p>
<p>requested the working group to submit to the Council for consideration at its thirtieth 
</p>
<p>session a report on progress made, which should be published as an official document in all 
</p>
<p>the official languages of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>2. Following the resolution, the working group held its second session from 2 to 
</p>
<p>6 February 2015. 
</p>
<p>3. The second session was opened by Craig Mokhiber, Chief, Development and 
</p>
<p>Economic and Social Issues Branch on behalf of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights on 2 February 2015. Mr. Mokhiber noted that people working in rural 
</p>
<p>areas were more vulnerable to emergencies, diseases and conflicts because of the multiple 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination they faced from long-term failures by States to protect, respect and 
</p>
<p>fulfil their rights. Mr. Mokhiber highlighted that people working in rural areas also faced 
</p>
<p>structural inequalities that often impacted upon small-scale farmers&#8217; abilities to protect 
</p>
<p>agricultural values, determine prices and access markets for agricultural production, as well 
</p>
<p>as to facilitate biological diversity. 
</p>
<p><b> II Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Election of the Chair-Rapporteur and the Vice-Chair 
</b></p>
<p>4. At its second session, on 2 February 2015, the working group re-elected Ms. 
</p>
<p>Navarro Llanos (Plurinational State of Bolivia) as its Chair-Rapporteur, by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>Guatemala, on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group, stated that it had 
</p>
<p>nominated Ms. Navarro Llanos based on the leading role of the Plurinational State of 
</p>
<p>Bolivia in moving the working group forward and her leadership in the first session of the 
</p>
<p>working group and intersessional informal consultations. Guatemala further underscored 
</p>
<p>that Ms. Navarro Llanos possessed all the necessary credentials to successfully carry out 
</p>
<p>and accomplish her mandate. 
</p>
<p>5. Owing to the ill health of Ms. Navarro Llanos, the 5th meeting of the session 
</p>
<p>(3 February 2015, morning) was suspended and the Chair-Rapporteur proposed electing a </p>


<p>Vice-Chair as a temporary measure to ensure continued smooth proceedings of the rest of 
</p>
<p>the second session of the working group. The 5th meeting of the session was resumed in the 
</p>
<p>afternoon. A representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR), on behalf of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, opened 
</p>
<p>the meeting and, hearing no objection on the Chair&#8217;s proposal, proceeded to the election of 
</p>
<p>a Vice-Chair. Guatemala nominated Luis Espinoza (Ecuador). With no other nominations, 
</p>
<p>Luis Espinoza was elected as Vice-Chair of the open-ended intergovernmental working 
</p>
<p>group on the draft United Nations declaration on the rights of peasants and other people 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas, and he assumed the responsibility for the rest of the second session 
</p>
<p>of the working group as a temporary measure. The Vice-Chair chaired the 5th, 6th and 7th 
</p>
<p>meetings.

</p>
<p>(d) Report of the Chair-Rapporteur on the first session of the open-ended 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group on a draft United Nations declaration on the rights of 
</p>
<p>peasants and other people working in rural areas (A/HRC/26/48). 
</p>
<p><b>  Adoption of the agenda and organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>11. In her opening statement, the Chair-Rapporteur thanked the delegation of Guatemala 
</p>
<p>and the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries for her nomination as Chair-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur and welcomed their encouraging remarks about the working group. The Chair-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur informed the participants that two informal consultations had been held on 12 
</p>
<p>November and 4 December 2014. She also noted that all relevant information regarding the 
</p>
<p>working group could be found on the OHCHR website. In referring to the draft declaration 
</p>
<p>before the working group, the Chair-Rapporteur informed the working group participants 
</p>
<p>that the programme of work would include two thematic panels, with eight panel 
</p>
<p>participants. She noted that one panel would discuss the civil, political, economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas and gaps and the 
</p>
<p>second panel would focus on rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas in 
</p>
<p>other international instruments and gaps. The Chair-Rapporteur noted that, after the panel 
</p>
<p>discussions, there would be an opportunity for general statements, followed by the first 
</p>
<p>reading of the new draft of the declaration on the rights of peasants and other people 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas. The Chair-Rapporteur highlighted that no list of speakers would be 
</p>
<p>provided during the general statements, as the session would be open to all participants 
</p>
<p>wishing to take the floor. She also highlighted that the reading of the draft declaration 
</p>
<p>would be done in five groups of articles: the first would include articles 1 to 6, the second, 
</p>
<p>articles 7 to 14, the third, articles 15 to 18, the fourth, articles 19 to 23, and the fifth, 
</p>
<p>articles 24 to 30 of the draft declaration. The reading would take place over three and a half 
</p>
<p>days and would be open to the floor. The Chair-Rapporteur also noted that there would be 
</p>
<p>no public consultation at the first meeting of the last day and informed the participants that 
</p>
<p>the final report would include: details of summaries of the debate, summaries of the panel 
</p>
<p>discussions and a summary by the Chair-Rapporteur. The Chair-Rapporteur noted that she 
</p>
<p>had conducted informal consultations with delegations and regional and political groups, 
</p>
<p>and that she looked forward to fruitful group work based on the various views of the 
</p>
<p>participants.  
</p>
<p>12. The Chair-Rapporteur noted the basic principles for conducting the session of the 
</p>
<p>working group, namely transparency, inclusiveness, accountability and objectivity.  
</p>
<p>13. The Chair-Rapporteur asked if there were any opposition to the programme of work 
</p>
<p>and, hearing no objections, declared the programme to be adopted.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Panel discussion 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Panel discussion I. Civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>of peasants and other people working in rural areas and gaps  
</b></p>
<p>14. One panellist noted that the great majority of the rights in the draft declaration were 
</p>
<p>not new rights, with many of them having been recognized in other international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments. The issue of small food producers was raised, as was the need for the 
</p>
<p>recognition of the part they played in feeding the planet. It was also argued that small food 
</p>
<p>producers needed to be informed about their rights and that the draft declaration, if it were </p>


<p>to be adopted, would help facilitate that transfer of knowledge. Some panellists argued that 
</p>
<p>the right to water should include the right to water for irrigation use and should not be 
</p>
<p>limited to water for sanitation or drinking purposes.  
</p>
<p>15. A number of panellists highlighted the need to protect peasants&#8217; civil and political 
</p>
<p>rights, noting that often peasants lacked access to justice and were not given the same 
</p>
<p>protection as to others. They were often persecuted, detained, arrested or subjected to 
</p>
<p>violence upon the expression of their right to freedom of association and to protest. One 
</p>
<p>panellist also noted that cattle breeders usually worked in different countries and therefore 
</p>
<p>crossed international borders, which often meant their freedom of movement needed to be 
</p>
<p>protected by all States concerned.  
</p>
<p>16. One panellist noted that indigenous peoples had historically been forgotten and that 
</p>
<p>more emphasis needed to be placed on the relationship between peasants and indigenous 
</p>
<p>people as they were often one and the same thing. They also noted that the vision of Mother 
</p>
<p>Earth of indigenous peoples should be part of the declaration. Another panellist noted that 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, including traditional forms of knowledge, had not been adequately protected 
</p>
<p>in international law. However, there was a growing body of international law, such as 
</p>
<p>article 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
</p>
<p>general comment  No. 21 (2009) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights on the rights of everyone to take part in cultural life on that article, the reports of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights and various 
</p>
<p>multilateral treaties on biodiversity, cultural heritage and intellectual property, that 
</p>
<p>recognized the right to cultural identity, including traditional forms of knowledge, and the 
</p>
<p>obligations of States to respect, protect and fulfil cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>17. Some panellists noted that it was essential to include the principles of gender 
</p>
<p>equality and non-discrimination in the draft declaration, as those were fundamental 
</p>
<p>principles of international human rights law. It was emphasized that peasants and other 
</p>
<p>people working in rural areas were frequently unable to enjoy human rights on an equal 
</p>
<p>basis. International human rights mechanisms had observed that gender-based 
</p>
<p>discrimination against rural women was widespread. It was also underlined that 
</p>
<p>intersectional and compound forms of discrimination must be identified and remedied. 
</p>
<p>Peasants and people working in rural areas were diverse and might be confronted with 
</p>
<p>discrimination on the basis of several different grounds: gender, age, ability, socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>status, ethnic origin, religion, etc. Intersectional forms of discrimination were quantitatively 
</p>
<p>and qualitatively different from discrimination on a single ground and could give rise to 
</p>
<p>mutually reinforcing violations of several different human rights. It was further noted that 
</p>
<p>international law requires that both formal (de jure) and substantive (de facto) equality be 
</p>
<p>guaranteed and that direct and indirect discrimination were effectively prevented and 
</p>
<p>remedied. That necessitated the adoption of positive measures &#8212; including, where 
</p>
<p>necessary, temporary special measures &#8212;to redress prior disadvantage and to ensure real 
</p>
<p>equality of opportunity. Two panellists argued that rural women faced specific 
</p>
<p>discriminatory barriers to equal access to productive land and resources, such as customary 
</p>
<p>systems of land titles which frequently denied women direct rights of ownership or 
</p>
<p>inheritance. They also noted that the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women was in the process of adopting a general recommendation on article 14 of 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women that 
</p>
<p>explicitly recognized rural women&#8217;s rights to equality with respect to reproductive rights 
</p>
<p>and health care, social security programmes, training and education, self-help groups, 
</p>
<p>community activities, credit, adequate living conditions, prevention of gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, succession rights, inheritance and land rights.  
</p>
<p>18. It was also noted that international obligations concerning the availability, 
</p>
<p>accessibility, adaptability and acceptability of education had not been adequately </p>


<p>implemented in rural areas. The international legal framework concerning the right to 
</p>
<p>education was well developed in international law; however, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other sources had noted that rural 
</p>
<p>areas often lagged behind other regions in terms of the availability and accessibility of 
</p>
<p>good-quality education. The right to education, as contained in article 26 of the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights, required States to ensure that formal and non-formal education 
</p>
<p>was available and accessible to all on the basis of equality. Measures must be taken to 
</p>
<p>ensure that every level of education from early childhood education to universal primary 
</p>
<p>education, secondary and vocational education, tertiary education, and continuing and non-
</p>
<p>formal education, such as literacy and livelihood programmes, were effectively available 
</p>
<p>and accessible without any discrimination. 
</p>
<p>19. It was emphasized that the right to education for peasants and people working in 
</p>
<p>rural areas must be respected, protected and fulfilled and that the draft declaration should 
</p>
<p>more adequately reflect the general international legal framework in that respect, while also 
</p>
<p>highlighting the obligation (contained in draft article 28 of the declaration) of States to 
</p>
<p>adapt education to the specific needs of peasants and people living in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>20. Some panellists noted that peasants&#8217; rights to health and a clean environment were 
</p>
<p>often negatively affected by the use of chemicals. They noted that it was important that 
</p>
<p>peasants had the right to control the use of pesticides and chemical products. They further 
</p>
<p>noted that peasants should have the right to know what health problems could be caused by 
</p>
<p>use thereof, such as cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. One panellist highlighted the 
</p>
<p>need for peasants to have a right to keep their own seed and to be able to take decisions not 
</p>
<p>to use genetically modified organisms. Some panellists noted that peasants could not 
</p>
<p>control market prices alone, as prices were also determined by the level of demand, and that 
</p>
<p>their rights to a decent income and an adequate standard of living should be protected.  
</p>
<p>21. During the panel discussions, the Chair-Rapporteur informed the participants that, in 
</p>
<p>her view, new human rights were often created and rights had been adapted, that 
</p>
<p>intersectional discrimination against most vulnerable groups was common, and that a 
</p>
<p>positive connotation of the word &#8220;peasant&#8221; was being led from the grass roots, as well as in 
</p>
<p>the working group. The Chair-Rapporteur also noted that the incorporation of the concept 
</p>
<p>of &#8220;Mother Earth&#8221; in the declaration could be included on the basis of previously accepted 
</p>
<p>language.  
</p>
<p>22. In relation to a number of questions provided by the participants, panellists noted 
</p>
<p>that States had the obligation to not remove peasants from their lands and to help facilitate 
</p>
<p>food aid. They also had the obligation to protect them and to protect the prices of 
</p>
<p>agricultural products so that peasants could access households and food. They noted that 
</p>
<p>States must have the right to establish agricultural policies to further enable work with 
</p>
<p>sustainable methods and sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>23. One panellist noted that the United Nations system as far back as 1948 had already 
</p>
<p>declared the right to food and the right to an adequate standard of living for peasants and 
</p>
<p>other people working in rural areas and that those rights had also been enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as well as in FAO 
</p>
<p>instruments. Some panellists also highlighted the difference between individual and 
</p>
<p>collective rights and their view that the great majority of the rights proposed were 
</p>
<p>individual rights, which could only be meaningfully exercised collectively. One panellist 
</p>
<p>noted that there were already examples of discrimination faced by various groups, such as 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, persons from the Roma community and persons of African descent, 
</p>
<p>and this was an opportunity to expand on what was meant by equality and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination within the context of specific groups. Another highlighted that anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination and equality rights had both negative and positive action, and that there was </p>


<p>a level of interpretation where every right was seen as having both negative and positive 
</p>
<p>obligations attached to them. All the panellists argued that there was a need for a United 
</p>
<p>Nations declaration on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas and 
</p>
<p>urged that the text of the declaration be comprehensible and understandable in order for 
</p>
<p>peasants to enjoy their rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Panel discussion II. Rights of peasants and other people working in 
</b></p>
<p><b>rural areas in other international instruments and gaps 
</b></p>
<p>24. Two of the panellists highlighted the various applicable provisions of international 
</p>
<p>law and the United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the special procedures, 
</p>
<p>and FAO guidance on the promotion of the right to food. They also noted that the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its general comment No. 12 (1999) 
</p>
<p>on the right to adequate food, explained that the right to food included access to adequate 
</p>
<p>food or means to obtain it; the availability of safe and nutritious food could be obtained 
</p>
<p>through cultivation of land and therefore access to natural resources was fundamental 
</p>
<p>dimension of the right to adequate food.  
</p>
<p>25. One expert noted that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Peoples and the FAO Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of 
</p>
<p>Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security re-emphasized human 
</p>
<p>rights principles such as human dignity, gender equality, participation, transparency, 
</p>
<p>accountability and rule of law, and that the FAO guidelines furthermore included in its 
</p>
<p>general principles the duty of States to respect, safeguard and promote legitimate tenure 
</p>
<p>rights. The guidelines also addressed, inter alia, restitution and redistribution of land, 
</p>
<p>fisheries and forests, including the possibility to introduce limits on land property. It was 
</p>
<p>clear that the intention of States when adopting those guidelines was not to create new 
</p>
<p>rights but to give practical guidance in terms of policies and measures regarding the 
</p>
<p>compliance of States with their obligations on the right to food. At the same time, it was 
</p>
<p>clear that those guidelines represented an unprecedented international consensus about what 
</p>
<p>States should do with respect to responsible governance of tenure. It was argued that this 
</p>
<p>had contributed enormously to developing international law and what still needed to be 
</p>
<p>clarified were the entitlements of the rights holders, such as the landless, peasants, artisanal 
</p>
<p>fishers and nomadic pastoralists, with respect to land and natural resources, so that there 
</p>
<p>was finally legal certainty about their rights to land and natural resources that could be 
</p>
<p>claimed, including through the courts. 
</p>
<p>26. One expert discussed extensively the various International Labour Organization 
</p>
<p>(ILO) conventions that supported the call for a declaration on peasants and other people 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas. These included ILO Right of Association (Agriculture) Convention, 
</p>
<p>1921 (No. 11), Plantations Convention, 1958 (No. 110), Rural Workers&#8217; Organisations 
</p>
<p>Convention, 1975 (No. 141), Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169), 
</p>
<p>Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001 (No. 184) and those related to workers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>rights. The panellist highlighted the various workers&#8217; rights in those conventions, such as 
</p>
<p>freedom of association, the elimination of all forced or compulsory labour or child labour, 
</p>
<p>the right to organize for agricultural workers, the obligation of States to actively encourage 
</p>
<p>agricultural unions and ensure that national laws did not inhibit the work of those 
</p>
<p>organizations, and detailed guidance on minimal wages, maternity protection, labour 
</p>
<p>inspection, housing and medical care. She also argued that protection gaps remained, 
</p>
<p>particularly in relation to migrant workers and rural women who were often subjected to 
</p>
<p>sexual harassment in the workplace.  
</p>
<p>27. One expert explained that most of the rights introduced by the draft declaration and 
</p>
<p>referred to as &#8220;new rights&#8221; were not completely &#8220;new&#8221; in international law, for they </p>


<p>reflected obligations that States had already undertaken in a number of international 
</p>
<p>instruments. She noted that instruments for the protection of the environment and cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage imposed on States the obligation to respect and protect traditional cultural practices 
</p>
<p>of peasants and other people working in rural areas and to adopt measures to safeguard their 
</p>
<p>access to natural resources, including lands and seed. She also noted that the right to 
</p>
<p>participation and the principle of free, prior and informed consent were entrenched in a 
</p>
<p>number of international instruments, some of them widely ratified, such as the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious 
</p>
<p>Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, the International Treaty on Plant 
</p>
<p>Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic 
</p>
<p>Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from Their Utilization to 
</p>
<p>the Convention on Biological Diversity. The panellist also explained that international 
</p>
<p>courts had increasingly recognized those rights and a number of States had already 
</p>
<p>incorporated them into their national legal systems. She expressed her opinion that it was 
</p>
<p>fundamental that the Human Rights Council compiled the existing legal guidance into one 
</p>
<p>single instrument so as to secure the realization of the rights of peasants and other people 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas all over the globe. 
</p>
<p>28. A number of participants asked the panellists to elaborate on the right to land and its 
</p>
<p>consequences for States obligations. One panellist noted that normative gaps remained in 
</p>
<p>relation to the right to land and that land should be recognized among the fundamental 
</p>
<p>rights, as it was vital to rural communities&#8217; existence. She also noted that land was often 
</p>
<p>privatized, sold and marketed without due attention to the fact that all human beings need 
</p>
<p>land to live.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. General statements 
</b></p>
<p>29. Many delegations noted that they would not be able to provide comments on the 
</p>
<p>draft declaration owing to the tight time frame since receiving the text, and therefore their 
</p>
<p>comments and positions would be preliminary. For the same reason, many States who 
</p>
<p>attempted to engage noted that they had to reserve their positions on the draft. A number of 
</p>
<p>States highlighted their concerns regarding rights that were not already established as 
</p>
<p>international human rights. They also raised concerns regarding the elaboration of existing 
</p>
<p>human rights in the new draft declaration, and their reach beyond the agreed language. A 
</p>
<p>number of delegations expressed concerns about the procedural process regarding the first 
</p>
<p>draft declaration circulated by the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee. They 
</p>
<p>argued that the Council had not mandated the drafting of the declaration and voiced 
</p>
<p>concern regarding the scope and length of the latest version of the draft declaration. A 
</p>
<p>number of States argued that the draft declaration focused too much on the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peasants and that, by singling out that group, others could be discriminated 
</p>
<p>against. One State noted that the free, prior and informed consent principles were not 
</p>
<p>appropriate in the draft declaration. Another delegation stated that the Human Right 
</p>
<p>Council was not the right forum for a declaration on peasants and other people working in 
</p>
<p>rural areas. All delegations stated their willingness to participate in the working group in a 
</p>
<p>constructive manner in order to find common ground and discuss appropriate ways forward.  
</p>
<p>30. A number of States highlighted their support for a United Nations declaration that 
</p>
<p>specifically focused on the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas, as a 
</p>
<p>new human rights instrument. They argued that was due to the vulnerability of peasants and 
</p>
<p>other people working in rural areas as a group and because they represented over a billion 
</p>
<p>persons. Those States highlighted the mandate given by the Human Rights Council to the 
</p>
<p>working group in resolutions 21/19 and 26/26 to negotiate, finalize and submit to the 
</p>
<p>Council a draft United Nations declaration on the rights of peasants and other people </p>


<p>working in rural areas. They also stressed that the draft declaration was provided through 
</p>
<p>informal consultations and collaboration through views from the first session of the 
</p>
<p>working group held by the Council. A number of States noted that there was a need for 
</p>
<p>delegations to come together to find a consensus on the text of the draft declaration and one 
</p>
<p>State argued that this should be based on the principle of international solidarity. Many 
</p>
<p>States congratulated the Chair-Rapporteur on her re-election and thanked her for her 
</p>
<p>ongoing work on the draft declaration.  
</p>
<p>31. A number of NGOs highlighted their support for the new text of the draft 
</p>
<p>declaration, noting they were satisfied with the new length and scope of the draft text. They 
</p>
<p>welcomed the inclusion of civil and political rights and their application to the specific 
</p>
<p>needs and realities of peasants. They welcomed the recognition of important rights, such as 
</p>
<p>the right to land, the right to seed or the right to biological diversity, and noted that those 
</p>
<p>so-called &#8220;new&#8221; rights were already agreed upon in other international instruments and that 
</p>
<p>at one point all rights had been considered new. They also welcomed the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>specific State obligations for each article and a general reference to extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>obligations and non-State actors. Several NGOs noted that an effort had been made to use, 
</p>
<p>as much as possible, agreed language and hoped that this would provide a more suitable 
</p>
<p>basis for the negotiations and help all States to engage constructively. Furthermore, they 
</p>
<p>recalled the importance of the declaration to better protect the rights and improve the 
</p>
<p>livelihoods of millions of peasants, fisherfolk, pastoralists, nomads and others peoples 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas who were victims of multiple forms of discrimination and human 
</p>
<p>rights violations. They also emphasized that the adoption of the declaration would 
</p>
<p>ultimately reinforce food security and food sovereignty at the global level, and thus benefit 
</p>
<p>all humanity. 
</p>
<p>32. The participants agreed that there was a need to improve the situation of peasants 
</p>
<p>and other people working in rural areas. In particular, some participants noted that extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty, hunger and malnutrition were concentrated in rural areas, despite peasants&#8217; 
</p>
<p>substantial contribution to food security and food sovereignty. A number of participants 
</p>
<p>also highlighted that 75&#8211;80 per cent of people affected by hunger and malnutrition were 
</p>
<p>people working in rural areas and that peasants experienced discrimination in many forms. 
</p>
<p>Participants also argued that women were especially vulnerable due to factors such as age, 
</p>
<p>gender, marital status, indigenous and peasant identity. It was further noted that other 
</p>
<p>challenges facing peasants included the denial of their means of livelihood, and their ability 
</p>
<p>to control their own means of production and to set market prices for their products. The 
</p>
<p>participants argued that those issues were detrimental to the livelihoods of peasants and 
</p>
<p>other people working in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>33. A number of delegations and participants noted that the rights under discussion 
</p>
<p>already existed as civil, political, economic, social and cultural human rights. They noted 
</p>
<p>that economic, social and cultural rights such as the right to food, health, water, and 
</p>
<p>education were regularly denied because States had often underinvested in facilities for 
</p>
<p>peasant communities. They also noted that civil and political rights were denied because 
</p>
<p>peasants who organized protests were often subjected to imprisonment, detention, laws and 
</p>
<p>government policies that were used to limit their freedom of expression and association.  
</p>
<p>34. Some participants noted their support for the right to water and the need to widen the 
</p>
<p>scope to include water used in agricultural production. They argued that, in developed 
</p>
<p>countries, that right was already available, but it was being denied to small-scale famers 
</p>
<p>operating in developing countries. Other States argued that further analysis was needed of 
</p>
<p>the elaboration of already agreed international language in relation to the right to water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation.  
</p>
<p>35. A number of participants highlighted the various forms of discrimination faced by 
</p>
<p>peasant women, owing to the lack of education available to women working in rural areas. </p>


<p>It was also argued that, if women were to be able to gain access to education, they would be 
</p>
<p>able to fully participate and better fulfil their human rights. One participant also noted that 
</p>
<p>some of the work that peasant women undertook was often invisible and limiting their 
</p>
<p>access to education. They furthermore argued that States must address structural problems 
</p>
<p>through targeted policies if they were to improve access to education. Another participant 
</p>
<p>noted that women faced discrimination based on land policies and cultural practices, as they 
</p>
<p>were often landless or culturally excluded, as land titles were often registered to the men in 
</p>
<p>the family. The increasing price of land was also highlighted by one participant, who noted 
</p>
<p>that it was for that reason that many in developed countries could not become small-scale 
</p>
<p>farmers and that government policies were hindering their ability to work in rural areas. A 
</p>
<p>number of NGOs noted that women should be specially recognized throughout the 
</p>
<p>declaration because they are the poorest among the food-insecure peasants, and 
</p>
<p>disenfranchised in entitlement to land and other rights. One NGO highlighted the need for 
</p>
<p>the draft declaration to include miners and communities living in mining areas, and to take 
</p>
<p>into account States and non-State actors&#8217; responsibilities and obligations towards them. 
</p>
<p>Another NGO called for the declaration to include specific State obligations to respect, 
</p>
<p>protect and fulfil the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas, the State 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial obligations with regard to those rights, the distinction between progressive 
</p>
<p>and immediate realization of certain of those rights, and ways to ensure accountability.  
</p>
<p>36. Some participants also raised concerns over not including migrants under the 
</p>
<p>definition of &#8220;peasant&#8221;. They highlighted the need for special protection measures, 
</p>
<p>especially in relation to migrant women, as they faced discrimination and limited access to 
</p>
<p>land and other resources. They highlighted that there was often a lack of protection for 
</p>
<p>migrants, including no access to health services, water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> V. First reading of the draft United Nations declaration on the 
rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas  
</b></p>
<p>37. The Chair-Rapporteur noted that there were over 50 international conventions, 
</p>
<p>covenants and instruments that had been used as the basis for the new draft declaration. 
</p>
<p>including international human rights treaties and standards developed by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms; regional human rights treaties; General Assembly and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolutions; instruments adopted by FAO and ILO; and a number of other 
</p>
<p>international treaties, outcome documents of international conferences, reports of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, as well as instruments developed by civil society, social movements, 
</p>
<p>academics and experts.  
</p>
<p>38. The Chair-Rapporteur introduced articles 1-6, indicating the background of each 
</p>
<p>article, and opened the floor for comments from representatives of States and civil society 
</p>
<p>and other participants.  
</p>
<p>39. Many States reserved their position because of the late distribution of the draft 
</p>
<p>declaration. Some stated that it was premature to present a draft at this session. Some 
</p>
<p>participants raised concerns over the implementation of the declaration, highlighting that 
</p>
<p>various human rights international declarations lacked implementation even after signing 
</p>
<p>and ratification by the Member States. A number of participants also raised objections over 
</p>
<p>the use of the term &#8220;peasants&#8221;. They noted that the term was derogatory and disrespectful 
</p>
<p>and asked for more discussion over it. Some participants argued that the definition under 
</p>
<p>article 1 was narrow and proposed that it to be broader, while others said it was right to 
</p>
<p>define &#8220;peasants&#8221; in article 1 of the declaration, but that the proposed definition was too 
</p>
<p>broad. One State indicated that it would be difficult to comment on the text as it was only 
</p>
<p>provided in English. That delegation noted that there was no concept of &#8220;peasants&#8221; in his </p>


<p>country and that the United Nations translation of &#8220;peasant&#8221; into Arabic was &#8220;farmer&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>which could include large-scale farmers.  
</p>
<p>40. An NGO raised its concern that Dalits, tenants and sharecroppers were not included 
</p>
<p>in the definition of &#8220;peasant&#8221;. It proposed that those groups be included in the definition of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;peasants&#8221; within the framework of declaration.  
</p>
<p>41. Several delegates sought clarification of the phrase &#8220;access to natural resources&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>its meaning and scope under the draft declaration. One delegation also raised concerns over 
</p>
<p>the definition of natural resources and community right over them. Delegates also 
</p>
<p>highlighted that, under article 2 of the declaration, extraterritorial obligations of States were 
</p>
<p>noted, but said that more clarification was needed on the responsibilities of States and non-
</p>
<p>State actors. It was also argued that this term had been elaborated on, but specific 
</p>
<p>responsibilities of international enterprises needed to be defined.  
</p>
<p>42. A number of States asked for further clarification of article 5 of the draft declaration 
</p>
<p>and the concept of sovereignty. They argued that food sovereignty was a concept under 
</p>
<p>discussion in international forums and not fully defined. Some NGOs also stated that food 
</p>
<p>security and food sovereignty were two different concepts and should not be used 
</p>
<p>interchangeably. They also argued that both terms should be defined clearly and developed 
</p>
<p>sufficiently. One NGO noted that article 5 could be divided into two separate 
</p>
<p>articles dealing with food security and food sovereignty independently. Another NGO 
</p>
<p>noted that food sovereignty was, in its view, directly related to the right to self-
</p>
<p>determination and therefore should be central in the first articles of the draft declaration. A 
</p>
<p>number of delegations noted that the language of article 5 should be grounded in human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>43. One delegation argued that there was a need to use language relating to gender 
</p>
<p>discrimination rather than gender identity because it was more universally accepted. 
</p>
<p>Another delegation also sought clarification and elaboration of the terms &#8220;subsistence&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;small farm holders&#8221; and proposed the recognition of the term &#8220;justiciability&#8221; and the use 
</p>
<p>of human rights principles such as discrimination, as well as the right to development, in 
</p>
<p>the declaration.  
</p>
<p>44. Several NGOs, including representatives of peasants and other peoples working in 
</p>
<p>rural areas, expressed their general support for articles 1-6. They welcomed the inclusive 
</p>
<p>character of the definition of &#8220;peasant&#8221; and the recognition of the peasant identity. They 
</p>
<p>proposed to include in the definition the specific relation of peasants with the land, the fact 
</p>
<p>that peasants did not seek primarily profit and accumulation but rather their subsistence and 
</p>
<p>the reproduction of their families. They insisted that they would prefer to see the notion of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;peasant agriculture&#8221; used rather than &#8220;small-scale agriculture&#8221;. They welcomed the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of the right to food sovereignty and suggested it could be separated from the right 
</p>
<p>to sovereignty over natural resources, as those were two distinct issues. They also strongly 
</p>
<p>supported the inclusion of article 6 on the right of rural women, as women were the most 
</p>
<p>discriminated against in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>45. The Chair-Rapporteur introduced articles 7-14, indicating the background of each 
</p>
<p>article and opened the floor for comments from States, civil society and all participants.  
</p>
<p>46. An NGO asked why the word &#8220;liberty&#8221; had been used instead of &#8220;freedom&#8221;, while 
</p>
<p>another NGO noted that States must have effective mechanisms for the prevention of 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to life. Another delegation noted that article 7 should be seen in the 
</p>
<p>light of territorial unity and that the use of local customs must not be used as a justification 
</p>
<p>to violate national and international law.  
</p>
<p>47. Participants highlighted that under article 9 of the draft declaration, freedom of 
</p>
<p>movement of mobile peasants was not expressly defined. Some participants argued that </p>


<p>States should do more to promote cross-border mobility and facilitate free movement of 
</p>
<p>herds, with proper safeguards. One participant proposed including collective remedy 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in the declaration. Participants also highlighted the need for access to justice 
</p>
<p>and justice mechanisms for women in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>48. Several NGOs, including representatives of peasants and other peoples working in 
</p>
<p>rural areas, welcomed the inclusion in the new draft of those articles on civil and political 
</p>
<p>rights. Those were already recognized as human rights, but they argued there was a need to 
</p>
<p>include them in the declaration to give them more visibility and adapt them to the specific 
</p>
<p>needs and realities of peasants. They noted that peasants and other peoples working in rural 
</p>
<p>areas continued to suffer multiple violations of their civil and political rights, in particular 
</p>
<p>their rights to freedom of association, freedom of thought, opinion and expression, and that 
</p>
<p>they were often denied access to justice. They insisted that there were continual human 
</p>
<p>rights violations against peasant leaders and that the right to life was being violated.  
</p>
<p>49. Some participants highlighted that under article 12 of the draft declaration, peasants 
</p>
<p>should be given the right to participate in the formulation of government policy and 
</p>
<p>programmes that affected peasants and other people working in rural areas. They argued 
</p>
<p>that would enable peasants and other people working in rural areas to access information 
</p>
<p>and markets easily. One participant highlighted the lack of participation in politics by 
</p>
<p>peasants and other people working in rural areas and proposed that States ensure that there 
</p>
<p>be at least 50 per cent participation rate for peasants in the decision-making process.  
</p>
<p>50. One participant noted that article 13 was too detailed and unrealistic and asked for 
</p>
<p>detailed information in a timely fashion on the ways in which a purchaser intended to 
</p>
<p>market produce purchased.  
</p>
<p>51. A number of participants raised concerns regarding article 14 and noted that the 
</p>
<p>language should be more closely associated with agreed international human rights 
</p>
<p>language. Some participants also noted that there was a need to introduce government 
</p>
<p>policies for compensation for peasants and other people in rural areas facing human rights 
</p>
<p>violations.  
</p>
<p>52. The Vice-Chair introduced articles 15-18, indicating the background of each article 
</p>
<p>and opened the floor for comments from States, civil society and all participants.  
</p>
<p>53. A number of delegations raised concerns over the Chair-Rapporteur&#8217;s description of 
</p>
<p>the working group as holding a &#8220;favourable view&#8221; of the draft declaration, which was seen 
</p>
<p>from their perspective as an inaccurate characterization of discussions. They also raised 
</p>
<p>questions of the legal basis of new rights mentioned in the draft. They sought clarification 
</p>
<p>regarding the procedure of work of the second session and asked the Vice-Chair to 
</p>
<p>elaborate on what the outcome of the session would be. The Vice-Chair responded to those 
</p>
<p>concerns by noting that the objective of the second session was to share views and 
</p>
<p>information, and that there would not be a line-by-line examination of the draft text during 
</p>
<p>the session. Some participants stated that they saw the current process as a first reading of 
</p>
<p>the draft declaration. One delegation noted that it would like further information regarding 
</p>
<p>the term &#8220;create an enabling environment&#8221; and associated State obligations in article 15. 
</p>
<p>One delegation raised the point that it would need to consult labour experts on articles 15, 
</p>
<p>16 and 18 and asked if the Human Rights Council was the most appropriate forum for that 
</p>
<p>discussion, rather than the International Labour Organization. One NGO noted that it 
</p>
<p>supported article 15 of the declaration and recommended that migrant workers who worked 
</p>
<p>in the agricultural sector be specifically highlighted, as they were often subjected to 
</p>
<p>trafficking and exploitation. Another delegation noted that it was important to add 
</p>
<p>references to forced and bonded labour in order to help fight against exploitation.  
</p>
<p>54. One delegation stated that a clear definition of peasants was needed so that 
</p>
<p>government policies could focus on framing and implementing article 16. One delegate </p>


<p>argued that article 16 could be linked with other articles that refer to the right to health and 
</p>
<p>inquired whether there was a need for separate articles. An NGO responded to that query by 
</p>
<p>highlighting that it was appropriate to have an article on the right to safety and health at 
</p>
<p>work, because peasants and other people working in rural areas worked in some of the most 
</p>
<p>hazardous and dangerous work environments.  
</p>
<p>55. One delegation noted that article 17 should have more focused gender-
</p>
<p>mainstreaming language. The delegate had concerns surrounding price-setting and its 
</p>
<p>impact on States&#8217; obligations. One NGO supported article 17, noting that the text should 
</p>
<p>include as much as possible about nutrition and the right to a healthy diet. A number of 
</p>
<p>participants asked for sources and clarification regarding the term &#8220;culturally acceptable 
</p>
<p>food&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>56. A number of States raised concerns regarding the language of article 18, noting that 
</p>
<p>the suggested text pertaining to markets could imply that the Human Rights Council was 
</p>
<p>going beyond its mandate. Another delegation also raised concerns regarding the term 
</p>
<p>&#8220;community-based commercialization system&#8221; and asked for more clarification regarding 
</p>
<p>the text. Two delegations highlighted their support for article 18 and noted that it was 
</p>
<p>important that the article stayed in the draft declaration because it was important for 
</p>
<p>peasants and other people working in rural areas to be able to sell their produce at prices 
</p>
<p>that allowed for an adequate standard of living.  
</p>
<p>57. Several NGOs, including representatives of peasants and other peoples working in 
</p>
<p>rural areas, stressed the importance of articles 15-18. They highlighted that those were 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights already recognized but that needed to be given more 
</p>
<p>visibility and applied to the specific needs and realities of peasants and other peoples 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas. A number of participants stressed the importance of the right to 
</p>
<p>food, as peasants and others peoples working in rural areas represented 80 per cent of those 
</p>
<p>in the world that are hungry. The point was made that the key element of a right to food for 
</p>
<p>peasants must be the right to produce food, and that aspect should be reinforced in the 
</p>
<p>drafting of the article. Several participants also welcomed the inclusion of the right to a 
</p>
<p>decent income in the declaration. They stressed that one major obstacle for peasants to have 
</p>
<p>a decent income was the fact that peasants were not able to sell their production at a fair 
</p>
<p>price. They proposed therefore the inclusion of some State obligations related to the need to 
</p>
<p>regulate food markets in order to ensure a fair price for peasant products and also abuse of 
</p>
<p>power by intermediaries, the dumping of agricultural products and the monopolies of 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations be prohibited. They also stressed the necessity of including 
</p>
<p>provisions on the need for States to support access to local markets for peasant production 
</p>
<p>and stop applying to peasant products the same standards and regulations that they applied 
</p>
<p>to industrial agricultural producers. Some participants also highlighted the issue of public 
</p>
<p>subsidies and aids and proposed including the obligation of States to give priority to 
</p>
<p>peasants for the attribution thereof. The problem of decent income for agricultural workers 
</p>
<p>and the lack of implementation of existing instruments, including ILO instruments, was 
</p>
<p>also highlighted by several participants and the point was made that the language of the 
</p>
<p>article should be strengthened in that regard. 
</p>
<p>58. The Vice-Chair introduced articles 19-23, indicating the background of each article 
</p>
<p>and opened the floor for comments from States, civil society and all participants.  
</p>
<p>59. A number of delegations noted that article 19 should be discussed in other United 
</p>
<p>Nations forums and that many points in that particular article needed clarification. One 
</p>
<p>delegation sought clarification on the sources for article 19. Other delegations noted that it 
</p>
<p>was important to recognize those rights, building upon already agreed international 
</p>
<p>standards, such as those existing on the responsible governance of land, fisheries and 
</p>
<p>forests. A number of NGOs argued that, although the right to land was considered a &#8220;new&#8221; 
</p>
<p>right, it was already established in other international instruments such as in the Declaration </p>


<p>on Social Progress and Development and that the right to land needed to be kept in the 
</p>
<p>declaration, because peasants and other people working in rural areas had a specific cultural 
</p>
<p>relationship with their land and territories. They also noted that business enterprises were 
</p>
<p>able to claim their rights to land and private property, which was denied to peasants and 
</p>
<p>other people working in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>60. One delegation raised concerns regarding article 20 and noted that they would like 
</p>
<p>further clarification regarding the term &#8220;transboundary environmental harm&#8221; and how that 
</p>
<p>impacted State obligations.  
</p>
<p>61. A number of delegations raised concerns regarding article 22 noting that it was a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;new&#8221; right, and that it should be dealt with in a different United Nations setting. They 
</p>
<p>noted that the proposed right was not in line with many national policies and trade 
</p>
<p>agreements. It was also recommended by some delegations that the issue of seed rights 
</p>
<p>should be taken up in the World Intellectual Property Organization rather than the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. Other delegations noted that it was important to include that right in the 
</p>
<p>declaration, even if the wording could be adapted to take other international instruments 
</p>
<p>into account. A number of NGOs argued that article 22 was key to the draft declaration 
</p>
<p>because peasants and other people working in rural areas were subjected to pressure from 
</p>
<p>business enterprises to use genetically modified seeds rather than seeds that they had 
</p>
<p>traditionally used. They also noted that patent laws were being used to compel peasants and 
</p>
<p>small-scale farmers to use seeds of specific companies.  
</p>
<p>62. A number of delegations noted that article 23 was considered to be a &#8220;new&#8221; right 
</p>
<p>and therefore they would need to consult with their Governments. It was also argued that 
</p>
<p>the right to biological diversity was not an issue for the Human Rights Council. Other 
</p>
<p>delegations noted that the right was important for peasants and other people working in 
</p>
<p>rural areas. 
</p>
<p>63. A number of NGOs, including representatives of peasants and other peoples 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas, welcomed the new draft of articles 19-23, and stressed that those 
</p>
<p>articles were probably the most important in the whole declaration. They highlighted in 
</p>
<p>particular the right to land and the right to seeds as crucial for peasants and other peoples 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas. They stressed that many elements in those articles were in fact not 
</p>
<p>new but taken from other existing international instruments. On the right to land, several of 
</p>
<p>those participants identified access to land and security of tenure as the key elements that 
</p>
<p>should be recognized. They welcomed the effort to use agreed language but highlighted 
</p>
<p>some important elements that had been lost in the process and that should be reintroduced, 
</p>
<p>emphasizing in particular the agrarian reform, which, they argued, was recognized to a 
</p>
<p>certain degree in a number of United Nations human rights conventions, but also the social 
</p>
<p>function of land, the prohibition of latifundia and the obligation of States to act against the 
</p>
<p>concentration of the ownership of land. One NGO suggested including specific 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial obligations, as well as the obligation to regulate non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>64. The Vice-Chair introduced articles 24-30, indicating the background of each article 
</p>
<p>and then opened the floor for comments from States, civil society and all participants.  
</p>
<p>65. A number of delegations noted their concerns regarding article 24 and asked for 
</p>
<p>more clarification with regards to the terms &#8220;customary water management system&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;cultural use of water&#8221; and &#8220;use of water not only for personal use&#8221;. One delegation noted 
</p>
<p>that the language used in article 24 could be considered discriminatory as it only referred to 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged groups. Further clarification was requested as to the term &#8220;water poisoning&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Other delegations noted that the inclusion of that right in the declaration was important. 
</p>
<p>One delegation also stated the view that, while it supported the right to water and sanitation, 
</p>
<p>it was important for the language used to match national legislation. A number of NGOs 
</p>
<p>noted that it was important to take into account the special need of peasants, including for </p>


<p>water for irrigation. They argued that the management of water should have local 
</p>
<p>leadership, as peasants and small stakeholders understood the effect of the misuse of water. 
</p>
<p>They also noted that peasants and other people working in rural areas wanted a fair and 
</p>
<p>sustainable solution, considering the old systems for distributing water to be unfair and 
</p>
<p>outdated.  
</p>
<p>66. Two NGOs noted that not only people who dwelt in urban areas had the right to 
</p>
<p>social security; specific measures should be put into place to ensure that women, older 
</p>
<p>persons and individuals affected by climate change were also protected. Some delegations 
</p>
<p>supported the inclusion of the right to social security as that right was essential for peasants 
</p>
<p>and other people working in rural areas. One delegation noted that different countries had 
</p>
<p>different domestic laws, and that there was no universally recognized system for social 
</p>
<p>security.  
</p>
<p>67. One delegation noted that the right to health was already recognized and that right, 
</p>
<p>along with others, in the declaration were already well defined. A number of NGOs 
</p>
<p>highlighted the need to include article 26 because of the need to keep references to the 
</p>
<p>harmful effects of chemicals and other pesticides. They furthermore highlighted the 
</p>
<p>negative effects of chemicals on peasants and other people working in rural areas, 
</p>
<p>particularly with regard to women&#8217;s reproductive rights.  
</p>
<p>68. A proposal was made to include the specific obligation of States to take measures to 
</p>
<p>limit the use of chemicals in agriculture. The importance of article 25 on social security was 
</p>
<p>also emphasized and its inclusion in the new draft was welcomed. Proposals were made to 
</p>
<p>include the obligation of States to implement insurance against environmental and climatic 
</p>
<p>events for peasants. 
</p>
<p>69. One delegation asked how article 30 of the draft declaration would be implemented.  
</p>
<p>70. At the end of the meeting, the Vice-Chair clarified the term &#8220;water poisoning&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>explaining it meant &#8220;slow poisoning&#8221; and provided the example of fish living in waters 
</p>
<p>polluted by mercury, who consumed the mercury and then transferred it to humans.  
</p>
<p>71. The Vice-Chair introduced the preamble, indicating its background and sources, 
</p>
<p>then opened the floor for comments from States, civil society and all participants.  
</p>
<p>72. A number of delegations noted that they felt the declaration gave special rights to 
</p>
<p>people in certain groups and that this might negatively affect other groups of people. They 
</p>
<p>also noted that they wanted to avoid ambiguities and said that more clarification was 
</p>
<p>needed regarding the term &#8220;harmonious practices with Mother Earth&#8221;. They also 
</p>
<p>highlighted that each country had its own practices, and that the term did not have the same 
</p>
<p>definition everywhere. They also noted that FAO, ILO and the World Intellectual Property 
</p>
<p>Organization should have been consulted in the drafting process and that they were the 
</p>
<p>adequate forums to discuss those topics, rather than the Human Rights Council. Another 
</p>
<p>delegation noted that it would be better to analyse the existing declarations and conventions 
</p>
<p>to address the various issues related to peasants and other people working in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>Some delegations discussed on the extraterritorial scope of the declaration, highlighting that 
</p>
<p>threats to peasants and other people working in rural areas often originated from outside the 
</p>
<p>national territory.  
</p>
<p>73. A number of delegations thanked the Chair-Rapporteur and the Vice-Chair for the 
</p>
<p>transparent way in which the working group had been conducted and noted that they were 
</p>
<p>particularly satisfied with the mainstreaming of a gender perspective. One delegation also 
</p>
<p>highlighted the need to focus more on children and people with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>74. One delegation noted they would prefer the term &#8220;food security&#8221; rather than &#8220;food 
</p>
<p>sovereignty&#8221; because it was more widely accepted, and that they would prefer wording that 
</p>
<p>was in line with language found in existing instruments of international human rights law.  </p>


<p>75. One delegation noted that the preamble highlighted a number of international human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties and instruments and that articles 22 (1) and 23 (1) should also be included in 
</p>
<p>the preamble, as they did not generate any specific obligations. It also recommended that a 
</p>
<p>reference be included to the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural 
</p>
<p>Development.  
</p>
<p>76. A number of States noted that, although they needed more time to further study and 
</p>
<p>analyse the declaration, they were convinced that it was highly necessary to guarantee the 
</p>
<p>rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas and to encourage the international 
</p>
<p>community to support the declaration. One delegation also noted that articles 24-30 were 
</p>
<p>essential to ensuring and protecting economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>77. Another delegation noted that promoting and defending peasants and other people 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas was essential and that the declaration would strengthen national and 
</p>
<p>international initiatives to combat hunger and food crises and support the preservation of 
</p>
<p>biodiversity. They also noted that clear instruments for economic and social inclusion of all 
</p>
<p>those living in rural areas and fishing communities were needed and that the aim of the 
</p>
<p>declaration was to ensure access to markets, credit and sophisticated irrigation mechanisms 
</p>
<p>in order to reduce poverty. They also noted that guaranteeing social security and protection 
</p>
<p>was still a major challenge, and that rural women had a key role to play.  
</p>
<p>78. One delegation argued that the declaration could contribute to improving the 
</p>
<p>potential growth of peasants and other people working in rural areas by improving their 
</p>
<p>welfare. It also noted that it supported the concept of food sovereignty, because it 
</p>
<p>emphasized the need for fair trade, particularly for small producers. It furthermore noted 
</p>
<p>that articles 5, 18 and 21-24 were key to the declaration because they guaranteed land, 
</p>
<p>seeds, cultural knowledge, agricultural loans, ecosystems for future generations, marketing 
</p>
<p>services, appropriate technologies, equal treatment in agrarian reform, and the quality of 
</p>
<p>life of peasants and other people working in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>79. One NGO noted that farmers specifically in South Asia usually only referred to men 
</p>
<p>and therefore requested that &#8220;peasant men and women&#8221; be added to the preamble.  
</p>
<p>80. One NGO noted that the concept of Mother Earth was not new within the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system and that it was a valuable concept for peasants and other people working in 
</p>
<p>rural areas, particularly in countries that recognized collective rights. They also noted that 
</p>
<p>the consideration by the Human Rights Council of those rights from a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective emphasized their importance and the obligations of States to comply therewith. 
</p>
<p>81. Some NGOs highlighted the need for the text to be easy to understand for peasants 
</p>
<p>and other people working in rural areas to read. They furthermore noted the need to 
</p>
<p>acknowledge that it was important to remember the importance of peasants&#8217; food 
</p>
<p>production and their collaboration in maintaining the environment in the context of climate 
</p>
<p>change. They also noted the importance of land, seeds and water as rights and highlighted 
</p>
<p>that peasants and other people working in rural areas had a special relationship with nature. 
</p>
<p>They argued that contributed to the preservation of biodiversity and that without food 
</p>
<p>sovereignty it was almost impossible to guarantee any other human right. Welcoming the 
</p>
<p>term &#8220;food sovereignty&#8221;, they noted that food security and food sovereignty were not the 
</p>
<p>same thing and could not be used interchangeably.  
</p>
<p>82. A number of NGOs noted the discrimination that peasants faced and emphasized 
</p>
<p>that they were the most vulnerable in accessing justice, particularly in the context of land 
</p>
<p>reform and land grabs.  
</p>
<p>83. A number of NGOs underscored the importance for peasants and other people 
</p>
<p>working in rural areas to have access to seeds and information especially on genetically 
</p>
<p>modified organisms. One NGO also noted that when addressing development it was </p>


<p>important to clarify the distinction between drug trafficking and illicit crops, as some 
</p>
<p>peasants had been arrested for drug trafficking for growing certain plants. 
</p>
<p>84. The Vice-Chair informed participants that they were able to submit comments in 
</p>
<p>written form and closed the meeting, as there were no further requests.  
</p>
<p>85. The Chair-Rapporteur opened the final meeting to States, civil society and all 
</p>
<p>participants of the working group for comments on the proposed language of the conclusion 
</p>
<p>and the recommendations.  
</p>
<p>86. One delegation suggested changing the word &#8220;negotiations&#8221; to &#8220;discussions&#8221; as, it 
</p>
<p>argued the word &#8220;negotiations&#8221; suggested that a formal dialogue had taken place during the 
</p>
<p>second session of the working group. That position was supported by a number of 
</p>
<p>delegations, who highlighted that they were not entering into negotiations because they had 
</p>
<p>not been given a formal mandate by their Governments. They furthermore noted that the 
</p>
<p>text of the draft declaration had not been translated into all official United Nations 
</p>
<p>languages and had been distributed late. The delegations suggested including a change to 
</p>
<p>the text in paragraph 91 (a) to include the word &#8220;continue&#8221;. Those positions were also held 
</p>
<p>by other delegations.  
</p>
<p>87. A number of delegations noted that they disagreed with the other delegations and 
</p>
<p>that negotiations had indeed taken place throughout the week because the very nature of 
</p>
<p>holding a working group was to negotiate, and that the word &#8220;negotiation&#8221; was specifically 
</p>
<p>mentioned in the various resolutions that set out the mandate of the working group. One 
</p>
<p>delegation noted that, although the word &#8220;negotiation&#8221; was open to interpretation, they 
</p>
<p>understood that any informal consultation held in the United Nations was by default a type 
</p>
<p>of negotiation. One participant noted that they agreed that the word &#8220;negotiations&#8221; should 
</p>
<p>remain and that they supported the delegations&#8217; arguments.  
</p>
<p>88. The Chair-Rapporteur thanked all the participants and suggested taking out the word 
</p>
<p>&#8220;negotiation&#8221; from where it was first mentioned in section 91 (b)  but leaving the word in 
</p>
<p>paragraph 91 (a), and the remaining text, while including the suggested word &#8220;continue&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>89. Hearing no objections from the floor, the text was adopted and the Chair-Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>informed the participants that they could send any suggested changes to the secretariat by 
</p>
<p>20 February 2015. The Chair-Rapporteur also thanked the participants for their 
</p>
<p>participation in the working group and closed the session.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>90. At the final meeting of its second session, the open-ended intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>working group on a draft United Nations declaration on the rights of peasants and other 
</p>
<p>people working in rural areas welcomed the participation of the Chief of the Development 
</p>
<p>and Economic and Social Issues Branch from OHCHR, as well as a number of independent 
</p>
<p>experts who took part in the panel discussions, acknowledged the constructive dialogue that 
</p>
<p>took place between Governments, regional and political groups, civil society, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and all other relevant stakeholders and took note of the inputs 
</p>
<p>received from them.
