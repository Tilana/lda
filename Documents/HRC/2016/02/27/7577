<p>visit to Mozambique from 8 to 16 April 2013. In the present report, she outlines the 
challenges facing Mozambique in implementing measures to tackle poverty and ensuring 
the human rights of those living in poverty in the country. 
</p>
<p>While the economic growth prospects of the country are excellent, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that the benefits thus far have not been widely shared, with large 
sectors of the population continuing to live below the poverty line. The increasing income 
gap between the rich and the poor, the lack of implementation of legislation and poverty 
reduction policies and the lingering risk of corruption all pose potential threats to stability. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur provides recommendations to ensure that relevant policies 
and programmes are implemented to enable those living in extreme poverty to enjoy their 
human rights on an equal basis with the rest of the population.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
human rights visited Mozambique from 8 to 16 April 2013. During the visit she collected 
first-hand information on the situation of people living in extreme poverty as a means of 
conducting a human rights-based analysis of key public policies relating to poverty 
alleviation, development and social protection.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, 
the Minister for Education, the Minister for Justice, the Vice-Minister for Women and 
Social Action and the Vice-President of the Assembly of the Republic, along with the 
Parliamentary Committees for Constitutional Affairs, Rights, Freedoms and Guarantees and 
for Social Affairs. She also met with representatives from the Ministries of Health, of 
Labour and of Planning and Development, and the Governors and relevant local authorities 
of the Provinces of Gaza and Zambezia, including the Legal and Justice Councils. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also held meetings with the National Human Rights 
Commission of Mozambique along with representatives of international organizations, 
donor agencies, financial institutions and a range of civil society organizations, as well as 
academics. In addition, she visited communities living in poverty in the provinces of Gaza 
(the cities of Xai Xai and Chibuto), Maputo City (the neighbourhoods of Xipamanine and 
Chamanculo) and Zambeiza (the cities of Quelimane and Nicoadala).  
</p><p>4. The Special Rapporteur extends her appreciation to the United Nations country 
team, and in particular the Office of the Resident Coordinator, for its indispensable 
assistance before and during the visit. She is also grateful to the other interlocutors she met, 
including members of civil society, for their invaluable contributions to the mission. She is 
especially grateful to those who took the time to share their personal experiences of 
struggling with the plight of extreme poverty and social exclusion in Mozambique. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b>5. Following independence in 1975, Mozambique was faced with numerous, severe 
challenges hindering development, and a brutal civil war that ravaged the country for 
almost two decades. Mozambique overcame that difficult legacy to emerge as a politically 
stable democracy, with the Government embarking on a series of reforms that led to 
extraordinary progress and dramatic improvements in the economic growth rate of the 
country.  
</p>
<p>6. Mozambique has been ranked as one of the fastest growing economies in sub-
Saharan Africa over the past two decades.1 Recent economic growth has remained robust, 
despite severe flooding in early 2013.2 With an expanding gross domestic product spurred 
by the extractive industries, financial services, transport and communications, and 
government services, the country&#8217;s economy holds great promise and the Government of 
Mozambique has a unique opportunity to provide a better future for all Mozambicans.

</p>
<p>7. Despite strong economic performance and two decades of peace and political 
stability, prosperity has not been inclusive. Economic growth has failed to reach the most 
disadvantaged in society and has not been leveraged into a significant reduction in poverty. 
Available data show that poverty reduction stagnated between 2002/03 and 2008/09.3 In 
2009, 54.7 per cent of the population lived below the national poverty line,4 and 
Mozambique ranks 185th out of 187 countries according to the 2013 Human Development 
Index of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).5 On the Multidimensional 
Poverty Index, Mozambique is ranked third for the highest headcount percentages of people 
in poverty (79 per cent) and is tied for the highest intensity of poverty, with about 65 per 
cent of the population facing deprivations in at least 33 per cent of weighted indicators in 
the period 2007&#8211;2011.6  
</p>
<p>8. During her visit the Special Rapporteur observed that as the income gap widens 
poverty is becoming entrenched, not only in rural areas where the majority of the 
population lives but also in urban centres.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the significant challenges facing Mozambique in 
its endeavours to eradicate poverty, including the legacy of its colonial past and the war, 
along with current threats from natural disasters and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. She 
commends the important progress made in bringing the country to a new era of 
independence and stability, and the resulting economic growth. However, she urges the 
State to ensure that the political will and desire for a better future for Mozambique are 
reinvigorated with renewed purpose. Mozambique has enormous potential for growth and 
everyone in society, including those living in extreme poverty, must be allowed the 
opportunity to reap the benefits of prosperity.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. In 1990, Mozambique adopted a new Constitution that for the first time introduced a 
multiparty political system, explicit guarantees of human rights protection, and the doctrine 
of the separation of powers. The Constitution was revised in 2004 and includes among its 
fundamental objectives: the building of a society of social justice and the achievement of 
material and spiritual well-being and quality of life for its citizens; the promotion of 
balanced economic, social and regional development in the country; and the defence and 
promotion of human rights and of the equality of citizens before the law.7 International 
human rights obligations are also recognized as having the same force in the Mozambican 
legal order as legislative acts.8 
</p>
<p>11. Mozambique has demonstrated its commitment to the promotion and protection of 
human rights by ratifying important international human rights conventions, improving 
their implementation at the domestic level and engaging with various United Nations 
human rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review process in 2011. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that Mozambique has not yet ratified the International 
Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and its Optional Protocol. That 
represents a major gap in the human rights commitment of Mozambique.

</b></p>
<p>12. The Constitution encompasses the right to equality and states that no discrimination 
shall be permitted on legislative, political, economic or social grounds.9 Explicit protection 
is provided on the basis of colour, race, sex, ethnic origin, place of birth, religion, level of 
education, social position, the marital status of one&#8217;s parents, profession or political 
preference. However, sexual orientation is not addressed as a prohibited ground for 
discrimination. The Special Rapporteur noted the call of the newly established National 
Human Rights Commission to incorporate into the Constitution a prohibition of 
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.10  
</p>
<p>13. Mozambique has introduced policies and strategies aimed at achieving inclusive 
economic growth and poverty reduction, such as the Action Plan for the Reduction of 
Absolute Poverty (PARPA II) 2006&#8211;2009, and the Poverty Reduction Action Plan (PARP) 
2011&#8211;2014. The Special Rapporteur is disappointed, however, by the findings of 
independent evaluations carried out in 2009 after PARPA II had been in operation for three 
years, indicating that less than 50 per cent of the objectives had been reached.11 <b> 
</b>14. The Special Rapporteur commends the establishment of the National Human Rights 
Commission and believes it will play an essential role in fortifying the commitment of 
Mozambique to guaranteeing respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. She 
hopes that the Commission ensures that economic, social and cultural rights are included in 
its institutional mandate.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. General challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Corruption 
</b></p>
<p>15. Mozambique has introduced important reforms in recent years as a means of 
tackling corruption, including the ratification of the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption in 2008, the adoption of an anti-corruption package in November 2011 and the 
establishment of an ethics commission in January 2013. Good governance and the fight 
against corruption are also highlighted in PARPA II as key pillars in reducing poverty. 
Despite those commendable efforts, corruption is perceived to be rampant in Mozambique, 
as reflected in its ranking on the 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency 
International: 123rd out of 182 countries.12 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur was disappointed to learn that, despite donor pressure to 
enhance transparency and accountability, corruption continues to blight the country&#8217;s 
administration, aided by gaps in the current legal framework.  
</p>
<p>17. While recognizing the steps taken by Mozambique to tackle corruption, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that corruption seriously undermines the State&#8217;s capacity 
to fulfil human rights obligations, with a disproportionate impact on those living in poverty. 
The Special Rapporteur notes the effectiveness of zero-tolerance policies in ensuring 
transparency and accountability at all levels. Given the large investment projects in the

<p>country, particularly in the extractive industries and mining sector, such steps may be 
necessary to ensure that the benefits of development are not diverted through illegal means. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Environmental issues  
</b></p>
<p>18. In the past 35 years, Mozambique has experienced more than 35 extreme weather 
and flooding events. Those events have had significant impacts on the population, 
exacerbated by widespread deep poverty and a lack of resilience.13 Floods and cyclones 
have caused damage to infrastructure,14 homes, and public buildings accommodating 
essential services.  
</p>
<p>19. The cumulative effects of recurrent extreme weather events and the associated costs 
of recovery measures have the potential to increase poverty, particularly in rural areas 
where the great majority of those living in poverty reside and where dependence on 
subsistence agriculture increases vulnerability to food insecurity. Droughts also have a 
disproportionate impact on residents of rural areas, forcing people to walk long distances in 
search of water for drinking and domestic purposes and increasing the number of children, 
in particular girls, who drop out of school to help support family livelihood activities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Land rights, resettlement and displacement 
</b></p>
<p>20. Mozambique has also witnessed a dramatic change in its environmental landscape 
over recent years due to the increasing number of mining projects. The government mining 
registry, published in October 2012, indicates that at least 245 mining concessions and 
exploration licences were approved in Tete Province alone.15 The Special Rapporteur 
received information about the negative impact that some of those projects have had on 
communities living in the surrounding areas, including restrictions on access to land and 
natural resources.  
</p>
<p>21. The displacement of communities in order to make way for infrastructure or 
development projects potentially violates several human rights. A regulation to govern the 
process of resettlement resulting from economic activities was approved through Decree 
31/2012 (appended to the Law on Territorial Planning of 2007). Despite those efforts to 
protect the rights of the displaced, reports suggest that the provision of poor quality 
agricultural land and inconsistent access to water have compromised the rights to food, 
water and work in many communities.16 In addition, many agricultural families historically 
relying on farm plots for survival are confronted with new costs in paying for food, and 
additional unexpected expenses, such as paying for piped water.17  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about reports that some 
megaprojects have led to so-called land grabbing, whereby large areas of land are bought 
up from smallholder farmers by mining companies, allegedly with the approval of the State, 
leading to forced displacement and destroyed livelihoods.18

</b></p>
<p><b> V. Situation of groups particularly vulnerable to poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Women 
</b></p>
<p>23. As a party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and its Optional Protocol, Mozambique has committed itself to promoting 
women&#8217;s rights. Since independence there has been considerable progress in women&#8217;s 
participation in decision-making at the national level, with women constituting 39 per cent 
of Parliament.19 Progress has also been made at the executive and legislative levels, with 
Mozambique ranking second among African countries on the Global Gender Gap Index 
2012 in relation to the political empowerment of women.20 It should be noted that women 
remain underrepresented at the provincial and district levels. 
</p>
<p>24. Despite the gains made in political representation, social indicators demonstrate that 
women are lagging behind men in most social and economic measures. For example, 
Mozambique was ranked 125th in the UNDP Gender Inequality Index for 2013.21 A deeply 
embedded patriarchal sociocultural order, along with a lack of implementation of laws and 
policies at the institutional level, has hindered significant and measurable progress towards 
gender equality. The Special Rapporteur was struck by the testimonies of women, from all 
spectrums of society, about the endemic structural gender discrimination that they 
experience. 
</p>
<p>25. Women in rural communities are particularly disadvantaged. The female labour 
force is heavily concentrated in agriculture, with 94 per cent of economically active women 
working in the farming industry.22 Studies indicate that the number of female-headed 
households is increasing and that those households represent an increasing proportion of the 
poorest sections of the population. The feminization of poverty is in part due to the fact 
that, while more women are more involved in the agricultural sector than men, men are the 
principal owners of land. The Special Rapporteur observed that women in Mozambique 
have little control over or access to productive resources, and they are typically prevented 
from participating equally at the decision-making level, often being unaware of their legal 
rights, such as property and inheritance rights. Moreover, the bulk of unpaid care work, 
such as cooking, childcare and fetching water and fuel, is carried out by women and girls, 
with severe implications for their enjoyment of rights (see A/68/293).  
</p><p>26. Migration as a result of natural disasters has also had a differential impact on 
women, particularly those living in rural areas. Following the devastating floods of 2010, 
for example, many men were forced to migrate to either South Africa or larger cities in 
Mozambique in search of alternative employment, leaving women in charge of the 
household for long periods. Women in those situations not only have to deal with an 
increased workload, but also the social and emotional consequences that accompany post-
disaster situations, including the loss of loved ones, disease and scarcity of food and 
water.23  
</p>
<p>27. Limited access to basic social services, including health care and education, is a 
major obstacle to women&#8217;s enjoyment of rights. Despite significant progress, maternal

<p>mortality is high, particularly in rural areas where the great majority of women have no 
access to quality care or specialized health professionals (including maternal and infant 
health nurses).24  
</p><p>28. While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the State&#8217;s investment in girls&#8217; education, 
significant challenges remain.25 Sexual abuse from teachers and male students, along with 
an inadequate quality of instruction, lead to high failure and dropout rates, with only 
74.4 per cent of girls completing primary education.26 Owing to structural discrimination, 
only 47.2 per cent of women in Mozambique are literate (only 31.3 per cent in rural 
areas).27 As a result, they have fewer opportunities for formal or informal employment and 
are obstructed from overcoming poverty and improving their enjoyment of rights.  
29. The structural discrimination against women is also reflected in the higher 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS among women, who account for more than half the adult 
population living with the disease. Women are more vulnerable to infection because they 
often lack the power or status to choose their partners, or to insist on safe sex. Girls and 
young women are particularly vulnerable. As a result of stigma and discrimination, women 
with HIV/AIDS are often expelled from their homes by their husband or family, leaving 
them highly vulnerable to extreme poverty and destitution.28  
</p>
<p>30. Gender-based violence remains a serious problem in the country.29 Despite the 
establishment of a political and legal framework to address the issue, including a law 
against domestic violence (2009), as well as the establishment of specialized police services 
and a referral system offering assistance to victims, the Special Rapporteur is concerned 
about the lack of effective implementation. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Children 
</b></p>
<p>31. Children, who numbered 11.8 million according to the 2007 census, make up more 
than half of the Mozambican population. By ratifying the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child in 1994, Mozambique committed itself to guaranteeing their rights without 
discrimination of any kind. While important steps have been taken to adopt legislative and 
other measures to protect children, more must be done to ensure that the rights enshrined in 
existing legislation become reality. Poverty continues to affect millions of children in 
Mozambique, with almost half of children experiencing severe deprivation.30  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the improvements over recent years: fewer 
children die before reaching the age of 5 and more children are enrolled in school, have 
access to health services and are protected from abuse.31 However, she is concerned that 
striking disparities remain in the country, with children in rural areas and the central and

water and sanitation facilities and medical services, along with high levels of 
undernutrition, results in one of the highest rates of stunting in the world (44 per cent of 
children under 5 years of age).32 The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the 
Government&#8217;s current five-year plan, which includes an indicator on stunting and calls for 
the drafting of a multisectoral action plan to reduce chronic undernutrition.  
</p>
<p>33. The effect of HIV/AIDS on children is devastating, with an estimated 19,000 child 
deaths due to AIDS in 200833 and 180,000 children under 14 living with HIV.34 The number 
of orphans and vulnerable children in Mozambique whose situations are due to HIV/AIDS 
is estimated to be 740,000.35 Those children are vulnerable to abuse, neglect and 
exploitation and have limited prospects, given that they may have to stay at home to care 
for siblings, are less likely to enrol in school and may be more susceptible to early sexual 
activity, leaving them at an increased risk of being infected by HIV themselves. Children 
orphaned by HIV/AIDS, or who are living with sick or dying parents, often suffer 
discrimination at the societal and community levels, but also within their own extended 
families.36  
</p>
<p>34. Mozambique has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world, with 38 per 
cent of girls 15 to 19 years old being mothers or pregnant in 2011.37 Data from 2008 
demonstrates that 18 per cent of girls aged 20 to 24 were married by age 15, while 52 per 
cent of them were married before the age of 18.38 Those girls have little or no access to 
information on reproductive health, leaving them vulnerable to adolescent pregnancy and 
sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Child marriage and adolescent 
pregnancy also result in low secondary school enrolment and completion rates for girls.39  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur commends the progress made in guaranteeing the right of 
children to education, but significant deficiencies still exist, particularly in relation to 
secondary education. Reports indicate that only 20 per cent of children aged 13 to 17 attend 
secondary school.40 Girls are also more likely to experience educational deprivation than 
boys, due to various reasons, including child marriage, teenage pregnancy and sexual abuse 
within the school environment.41 Despite progress, the number of schools is still inadequate, 
and in several parts of the country infrastructure is still lacking. The low quality of 
education, particularly in rural provinces, is of particular concern and poor, rural children 
are less likely to complete primary education.42 
</p>
<p>36. The prevalence of violence, sexual abuse and harassment within the school 
environment has had a shattering effect on the lives of many children. Alarmingly, in one 
survey, 70 per cent of girl respondents reported that some teachers use sexual intercourse as

<p>a condition for promotion between grades, and 50 per cent stated that they faced sexual 
abuse from teachers or boys in their peer groups.43 Often those crimes go unpunished, as 
girls are unwilling to report abuse or are prevented from doing so by fear of retribution. In 
addition, the decision of parents to send their daughters to school is greatly influenced by 
this phenomenon, reducing the future prospects for girls. While the Special Rapporteur is 
encouraged by an increase in reporting and the Government&#8217;s zero tolerance policy, she is 
concerned at the apparently increasing prevalence of such abuse.44 More must be done to 
hold perpetrators accountable and ensure the right of girls to enjoy an education without 
violence, harassment or fear. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at reports that girls are often forced to move to 
night schools when they become pregnant,45 and at order (<i>despacho</i>) 39/GM/2003, issued in 
2003 by the Ministry of Education, which prohibits pregnant girls from attending day 
classes. Those measures aggravate the stigma they experience and have a detrimental 
impact on their ability to complete their education.46 
</p>
<p><b> C. Older persons 
</b></p>
<p>38. A total of 5 per cent of the Mozambican population is above the age of 60, giving it 
the third-largest older population in Southern Africa.47 The Special Rapporteur welcomes 
the recent Law on the Promotion and Protection of Older People&#8217;s Rights (2013) and 
encourages the State to take immediate steps to implement the measures set out in the 
legislation as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p>39. Immediate measures must be taken to support older persons caring for orphaned 
children. They often live in extremely precarious circumstances, dealing with their own 
health concerns (8.5 per cent of people between 50 and 65 years old in Mozambique are 
HIV-positive)48 but also having to provide and care for children. Older people, in particular 
women, lack sufficient income to support themselves and their dependents, and small 
measures can make a big difference to their quality of life. The provision of adequate 
nutrition or transportation costs to the nearest health centre, for example, would greatly 
improve their situation. Many older persons are illiterate and have limited alternative means 
of income. The Special Rapporteur encourages an expanded emphasis on integrating older 
persons into adult literacy programmes. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur was informed that older women are often left to survive in 
situations of poverty, isolated from the community and stigmatized as a result of cultural 
beliefs and accusations of witchcraft. Older women who have lost their husband tend to be 
excluded from the extended family and are considered a burden on the community.49

<p>Reports suggest that the practice by which the extended family expropriates household 
property from the widow continues to affect many women, who are forced to take a 
subordinate position within the family circle after losing their property.50 With 95 per cent 
illiteracy rates and a lack of education, financial capacity or legal empowerment, those 
women do not have the resources to defend their tenure.51  
</p>
<p>41. The right to health remains unrealized for many of the most marginalized older 
women and men. Older people in Mozambique are legally exempted from paying for 
medication at health centres. However, reports suggest that the exemption is often not 
honoured, with 86 per cent of older people in Gaza Province paying a consultation fee, and 
85 per cent paying for medication when visiting health centres.52 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the significant advances that have been made in 
establishing a social assistance programme to benefit older persons through the Programa 
de Subs&#237;dio Social B&#225;sico. She remains concerned that Mozambique does not have a social 
pension programme offering extensive coverage or a dignified standard of living to older 
persons. While the efforts of the Government to expand and improve the programme by 
establishing transparent and accountable systems are commendable, capacity must be 
strengthened to implement the programme and ensure that the benefits are at least sufficient 
to cover the basic needs of families receiving it. Mozambicans must not face old age 
without the guarantee of a minimum income, vulnerable to poverty and marginalization.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>43. Mozambique ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and 
its Optional Protocol in 2012, a move the Special Rapporteur applauds. It is estimated that 
persons with disabilities in Mozambique represent 9.9 per cent of the population.53 Efforts 
to improve living conditions for persons with disabilities include the National Plan of 
Action on Disability (2006&#8211;2010) and the Plan of Action for Orphaned and Vulnerable 
Children. 
</p>
<p>44. Despite those efforts, the Special Rapporteur notes that the living conditions of 
people with disabilities are generally much more precarious than those of the rest of the 
population. The 1997 Census found that 80 per cent of disabled people lived in rural areas, 
where their situation is compounded by a lack of physical and economic access to basic 
services, such as medical care and education,54 and long waiting periods for treatment.55 
Moreover, persons with disabilities suffer from considerable discrimination and 
stigmatization,56 often facing scorn and contempt from their fellow citizens.57

</p>
<p>45. Children with disabilities are of particular concern as societal attitudes, often based 
on traditional beliefs, result in the majority of them being kept hidden behind closed 
doors.58 A lack of teaching professionals for children with special needs, along with limited 
resources, prevents children with disabilities from accessing basic education and integrating 
into society.59 The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the lack of a robust effort by the 
Ministry of Women and Social Action to ensure that children with disabilities are integrated 
into preschool activities and that they are covered by social protection measures, to 
encourage their assimilation into society. 
</p>
<p>46. Heightened risk factors, combined with major problems in gaining access to 
prevention and screening services and an extremely low level of awareness, make persons 
with disabilities particularly vulnerable to contracting HIV/AIDS.60 One study found that 
57 per cent of disabled persons interviewed in Maputo and Sofala were at risk of 
contracting HIV/AIDS, while 84 per cent did not know what it was.61 Such is the 
discrimination faced by disabled people in Mozambique that many are reluctant to take 
HIV tests for fear that testing positive would expose them to a secondary stigma, thus 
creating additional barriers to their already limited access to essential services.62 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Challenges to the enjoyment of specific rights by those living 
in poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>47. Following the end of the war in 1992, Mozambique introduced the Health Sector 
Reform Programme, aimed at providing access to good quality health care for everyone, 
with strong investment from the State and external donors providing budgetary support.63 
The Special Rapporteur is concerned at reports suggesting that there was a decrease in the 
financial resources allocated to the health sector from 13.4 per cent in 2006 to 8.4 per cent 
in 2010.64 
</p>
<p>48. While there has been considerable progress in improving access to health services, 
Mozambique faces major public health challenges. The overall health status of the 
population remains lower on average than that of other countries in the region and 
significantly below international standards.65 High maternal and infant mortality rates, the 
prevalence of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS and malaria, and high levels of 
chronic malnutrition have resulted in an average life expectancy at birth of 53 years.66  
</p>
<p>49. Gender, socioeconomic status and geographic location all influence access to good 
quality health care, with poor households experiencing the most obstacles.67 In 2011,

<p>89.5 per cent of women in the upper wealth quintile gave birth in a health facility attended 
by skilled personnel, compared to 31.5 per cent of women in the lowest quintile.68 
Similarly, reports suggest that wealthier children are more likely to receive treatment for 
certain illnesses (such as acute respiratory infections) than those from rural areas, poor 
families or families in which mothers had no education.69  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the situation facing rural 
women as regards access to sexual and reproductive health care. High maternal mortality 
and morbidity is a product of structural discrimination against women and denial of their 
human rights, including sexual and reproductive health rights. During the visit, the Special 
Rapporteur witnessed the obstacles that women face in gaining access to adequate 
antenatal, delivery and postnatal care, as well as the inadequacies of some of the local 
health-care centres. During her interviews with women, lack of transportation and having to 
walk long distances to health centres, out-of pocket costs and perceived bad quality of care 
were highlighted as factors that discouraged them from accessing health-care facilities.  
</p>
<p>51. Such experiences are reflected in data which show that 43 per cent of maternal 
deaths occur during delivery or within 24 hours after delivery, while in the primary-level 
health units, death occurs with greater frequency in the first two hours after the woman&#8217;s 
admission, indicating bad conditions at the centres and the fact that many women arrive too 
late for early intervention.70 The lack of equitable distribution of health-care facilities, 
goods and services and their unavailability in rural and remote areas are a particular 
concern, in particular with respect to the lack of available and physically accessible 
emergency obstetric care for most women.  
</p>
<p>52. Despite the introduction of the Family Planning and Contraception Strategy in 2011, 
and a contraceptive prevalence rate (the percentage of women who are using, or whose 
partner is using, a contraceptive method) that has virtually tripled in the last 20 years,71 less 
than a fifth of the female population in Mozambique uses contraception.72 Women living in 
poverty have limited access to contraception and family planning.73 Just 5 per cent of 
women with no education use modern contraceptive methods, compared to 47 per cent of 
women with secondary education or higher. Only 7 per cent of women in rural areas use 
contraception.74 Despite those stark variations, efforts to bring reproductive health 
information and services to the rural population are few. Goods and services related to 
sexual and reproductive health continue to be viewed as commodities to be allocated by the 
market or as charity, rather than as fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>53. Cultural factors and taboos play a significant role in determining the relationship 
between sexual and reproductive health and human rights. For example, although the law 
provides for the freedom to receive health-care services from any source, in practice many 
women need permission from their husbands or another relative before seeking treatment.75 
The State has a role to play in bridging cultural and economic divides to provide 
comprehensive reproductive education, ensuring access to affordable and accessible 
contraception and eliminating gender norms that increase the likelihood of early pregnancy, 
sexual violence and transactional sex.

<p>54. The considerable knowledge-behaviour gap in terms of condom use for HIV 
prevention has undermined the fight against HIV/AIDS.76 While there has been progress 
since 2003, when only 53 per cent of women were aware of condom use as a method of 
HIV prevention, there was a significant reduction in the availability of condoms in the 
country between 2009 and 2011.77 Reports suggest that this is a result of reduced demand, 
weak distribution systems and a reduction in the availability of funds.78 Traditional and 
cultural norms perpetuate the non-use of condoms, as well as women&#8217;s lack of power to 
negotiate safe sex, transactional sex and intergenerational sex. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the availability of HIV tests, as well as 
the limited access to and coverage of antiretroviral treatment, particularly for children.79 
During the mission, the Special Rapporteur visited a rural health clinic and witnessed the 
limited equipment available for carrying out tests for HIV. She was also informed that 
many patients have to walk long distances in order to reach the clinic and receive treatment.  
</p>
<p>56. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with a group of young people who 
work on a voluntary basis to raise awareness of sexual and reproductive rights among their 
peers. She was extremely impressed by their dedication, but finds it unfortunate that the 
State has not done more to implement nationwide awareness-raising campaigns on sexual 
and reproductive health. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to access to justice 
</b>57. Access to justice is a fundamental right and essential for the protection and 
promotion of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights (see A/67/278). 
Mozambique has an obligation to ensure that conditions are in place for all persons to have 
access to justice, irrespective of their level of education, economic situation or social status. 
In recent years a number of initiatives have been taken by the State to improve access to 
justice, including the establishment of the Legal Aid Institute (IPAJ), which provides free 
legal assistance to economically disadvantaged citizens.80 The Ministry of Justice has also 
been promoting a policy to construct palaces of justice at the district level, which will house 
the offices of the District Prosecutor, the Criminal Police, the court and IPAJ under the 
same roof.  
</p>
<p>58. Despite those efforts, access to justice remains a significant problem, particularly for 
vulnerable groups.81 Those living in rural areas are especially disadvantaged, as judicial 
officials in those areas have limited resources and little or no means of community 
outreach, in part owing to bad infrastructure. Generally, formal procedures are lengthy and 
costly, and the judicial system is also reportedly beleaguered by corruption.82 As a result, 
many citizens continue to rely on alternative informal or traditional mechanisms of dispute 
resolution,83 which may not conform to human rights standards or constitutional principles. 
The Government recognizes that the justice system currently remains inaccessible to

<p>substantial parts of the population and has committed itself to strengthening the capacity 
and accessibility of the formal justice system. <b> 
</b>59. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the Juvenile Justice Law of 2009, 
which places the age of criminal responsibility at 16 years; however, it seems that much 
remains to be done to ensure the full compliance of the juvenile justice system with 
international human rights standards. Young detainees are regularly detained in adult 
prisons even though the law stipulates that they should be placed in separate detention 
facilities.84 Although juvenile criminal suspects may be legally detained for a maximum of 
30 days,85 the Special Rapporteur learned during her visit that they are often detained for 
much longer. Currently there are no functioning juvenile detention centres for children 
awaiting trial or otherwise in conflict with the law.86 Some progress has been made, 
however, through the introduction of a children&#8217;s section in courtrooms in three provinces 
in the country.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to adequate housing and access to land 
</b></p>
<p>60. The right to access to land is essential for reducing poverty in Mozambique, given 
that 61 per cent of the population live in rural areas and depend principally on subsistence 
farming for a living.87 The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts made by the State to 
introduce a legal framework governing land distribution. Indeed, the Land Law of 1997 
(Law 19/97) has been lauded as one of the most progressive and gender-sensitive in the 
region.88  
</p>
<p>61. While the intention of the Land Law should be commended, implementation has 
been slow and largely ineffective. A lack of capacity at the State level,89 a general lack of 
awareness of rights and participation at the community level and failure by local 
government and prospective land developers to recognize the extent of community land 
holdings have resulted in frequent land disputes or other tensions.90 Land disputes in rural 
areas are particularly common where traditional territory may be infringed upon as a result 
of concessions granted to developers.91 
</p>
<p>62. According to article 100 of the Constitution, the State owns all land in Mozambique. 
The Land Law recognizes the right to use land, known by the Portuguese acronym 
DUAT.92 Most rural land is held by communities, which have perpetual DUATs based on 
their traditional occupancy.  
</p>
<p>63. Land has not necessarily been distributed in compliance with human rights 
principles and decisions on land ownership often discriminate against disadvantaged

<p>groups.93 Women are particularly vulnerable, despite the provisions in the 1997 Land Law 
enshrining women&#8217;s right to participate in all land-related decisions and the right to register 
DUATs individually. Often unaware of their legal rights, women are constrained by 
customary norms that continue to limit their social and economic rights, including access to 
land and secure tenure.94 The chapter on succession in the Portuguese Civil Code of 1966 
continues to be applied in court cases, favouring the inheritance rights of men over 
women.95  
</p>
<p>64. In the majority of communities, men control land rights and women are only able to 
gain access to land through men, often via community-based committees. However, women 
often have limited access to the committees because they have no identity documents.96 
Many women feel powerless to oppose male relatives in such situations, given 
discriminatory sociocultural norms.97 The phenomenon is not limited to rural communities; 
studies show that women in urban areas suffer similar obstacles to and violations of their 
property rights.98  
</p>
<p>65. While the Constitution recognizes the right to housing, the issue of adequate quality 
and quantity of housing remains a concern (A/HRC/WG.6/10/MOZ/2, para. 67). The 
demand for housing in Mozambique is increasing, with migration to urban areas putting 
pressure on resources. Three quarters of urban dwellers are regarded as informal settlers,99 
and most do not know that they must register land transactions, a cumbersome and costly 
process.100 Formal access to land is out of reach for the majority, with the urban poor who 
inhabit the outskirts of the cities depending on subsistence agriculture or informal 
employment.101  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur met with families living in rural areas and in informal 
settlements in Maputo City and witnessed the extremely precarious situations in which they 
are forced to live. With insufficient access to electricity and water and almost no access to 
sanitation facilities, public transportation and other public services, those families risk 
being among the estimated 17,000 people who die annually in Mozambique as a result of a 
lack of basic essential services.102 This tragic reality highlights the need for the State to 
ensure adequate housing for all, which would encompass legal security of tenure, 
affordability, accessibility and availability of services, materials, facilities and 
infrastructure.103  
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to social security

<p>regulatory framework in 2009 and the adoption of the National Strategy for Basic Social 
Security (ENSSB) in 2010.105 Both were preceded by the Social Protection Law of 2007 
(Law 4/2007) and together provide a comprehensive legal framework for a system offering 
universal protection. The Strategic Operational Plan of 2011 implements the ENSSB 
through 2014, providing for a direct cash transfer programme, direct employment in public 
works programmes and short-term support for vulnerable households.106 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government&#8217;s commitment to improving 
social protection as a means of reducing poverty and welcomes the broad consultation and 
participation during the national policy dialogue on this issue.107 She notes however that in 
order to build on those achievements the reform process must give due consideration to 
implementation gaps within the current system that have prevented the poorest and most 
marginalized sectors of society from enjoying their right to social security.  
</p><p>69. One of the greatest challenges facing Mozambique is the small proportion of people 
covered by social protection policies.108 In 2010, Mozambique spent 3.7 per cent of its 
gross domestic product on social protection; overall social protection expenditure in 
Mozambique is lower than the average of other countries in the region.109 Social protection 
insurance is restricted to resident salaried workers, civil servants and military officials and 
their families. In 2011, only 4.3 per cent of the economically active population benefited 
from social protection, while only 12 per cent of those over 60 years old were covered by a 
pension.110 An overall lack of coordination and fragmentation of the social protection 
system, as well as gaps in legislation, have resulted in the majority of poor households, 
including families with children, youths and persons of working age, receiving little or no 
benefit from the system.111 
</p>
<p>70. Although the cash transfer programme (Programa de Subs&#237;dio Social B&#225;sico, PSSB) 
has been rapidly expanded to target extremely poor households in which no adult is able to 
work, such as those in which the adults are elderly or persons with disabilities, it does not 
cover all communities within each district or region.112 Conditions for social protection 
coverage are not uniform across districts and a determination of eligibility in one district 
may not be respected in another. Often there is little or no coordination between the 
National Institute for Social Action (INAS) and community-based organizations 
(<i>permanentes</i>) tasked with assisting in the identification of beneficiaries and informing 
them of payment dates.113 Indeed, due to logistical and budgetary constraints, beneficiaries 
are often informed of payment dates for monthly payments only a day or two in advance, 
limiting collection possibilities for many households.114 A general lack of awareness about 
the procedures and processes often prevents eligible beneficiaries from accessing payments.  
</p>
<p>71. Although the PSSB is essentially an unconditional cash transfer targeting poor 
households with no labour capacity, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that it currently 
provides little or no coverage for persons with disabilities. While 95 per cent of PSSB

<p>beneficiaries were destitute elderly persons,115 only 5 per cent of the beneficiary households 
reached by the system in 2012 included persons with disabilities.116 One of the reasons for 
this may be gaps in the referral system whereby health professionals who are responsible 
for certifying the clinical status of persons with disabilities do not communicate effectively 
with INAS.117 There is also insufficient inclusion of the chronically ill and vulnerable 
children in the system. The programme also reportedly only extends to a subsection of 
eligible households, while the value of the cash transfers have been eroded by inflation.118  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports of corruption within the system 
whereby those responsible for targeting (<i>permanentes</i> and INAS staff) are often subject to 
social and political pressure to allow non-eligible households to be admitted to the PSSB 
programme.119 A lack of transparency with regard to selection criteria has led to a general 
lack of understanding as to why some households living in poverty are able to register 
while others are not. In some cases eligible beneficiaries are reluctant to question 
irregularities regarding their rights to certain benefits owing to a fear of reprisals from their 
local community leaders or <i>permanentes.</i>120 Such a situation is unacceptable.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>73. Despite the economic growth in recent years, development partners and donors are 
still crucial to poverty reduction and equitable growth efforts in Mozambique. In 2012, 
foreign aid constituted almost 50 per cent of the State budget.121 While welcoming the 
substantial efforts of the international community to provide financial and technical 
assistance to Mozambique in line with their international human rights obligations, the 
Special Rapporteur calls on the international community to ensure consistency and to 
implement and guarantee a long-term strategy. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. When providing assistance for social protection schemes, donors must ensure that 
their initiatives are well-coordinated, foster more comprehensive coverage, reduce 
duplication and promote genuine dialogue with the beneficiaries. The Special Rapporteur 
also underscores that international aid must build political support and country ownership. 
As Mozambique enters a new era of economic growth, international cooperation will 
remain crucial, particularly in relation to the enhancement of social policies and further 
development of the legal and institutional framework for human rights in the country. The 
Special Rapporteur urges donors to continue to provide the necessary funds to assist with 
the development of a comprehensive poverty reduction programme. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>75. While the Special Rapporteur recognizes that Mozambique has generally enjoyed 
good relations with its partners and has made effective use of aid,122 she is concerned by 
reports that some donors have expressed reluctance to provide aid to the country in future 
owing to claims of misappropriation of funds and corruption. <b>

<p><b> VIII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>76. <b>While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the remarkable achievements made 
by Mozambique in the fight against poverty in the aftermath of colonial rule and a 
devastating civil war, considerable challenges remain. Much of the population 
continues to live in poverty, with a majority of the people struggling to survive in dire 
conditions. The increasing income gap between the rich and poor, a lack of 
implementation of legislation and poverty reduction policies and the lingering risk of 
corruption all pose potential threats to stability.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>As Mozambique enters a period of economic growth, there is a real and 
tangible opportunity to eradicate extreme poverty, with great potential for future 
shared prosperity for everyone. The effective implementation of poverty reduction 
strategies must be considered as a matter of priority.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>While the present report includes recommendations in each of its sections, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to especially urge the Government of Mozambique to 
take the steps listed below to improve the enjoyment of rights by the poorest sectors of 
society.  
</b></p>

<p><b>(a) Ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and its Optional Protocol without delay; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure the proper implementation of existing laws by strengthening 
monitoring and accountability mechanisms, and ensure that laws currently under 
revision are in line with international human rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that adequate resources are provided to implement the poverty 
reduction measures outlined in the Poverty Action Reduction Plan;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Revise the definition of discrimination in the Constitution and the Penal 
Code in line with international human rights instruments in order to prohibit all 
forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender 
identity, and develop effective mechanisms to provide access to justice and remedies in 
cases of violation of those rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Immediately approve the rules and procedures necessary to ensure that 
the National Human Rights Commission is a fully functioning and independent body 
in line with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles), with sufficient 
human and financial resources to carry out its work. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Corruption

</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Take all measures necessary to eliminate discrimination against women, 
including gender-based violence, prejudice and harmful traditional practices that 
undermine women&#8217;s enjoyment of rights, in line with the obligations assumed by

young women, and rural and poor populations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure that adequate training and sensitization is provided for law 
enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary in relation to gender-based 
violence; and implement measures to increase the prosecution rate of offenders; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Develop a public policy for the protection of victims of gender-based 
violence, including the provision of more shelters, training of medical staff and better
