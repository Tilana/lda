<body><p>GE.<footnote name="1">4. Arbitrary detention remains a serious problem. The Office continued to monitor 
unlawful and arbitrary detention of people removed from the streets of Phnom Penh in the 
context of Government efforts to deal with homelessness. Their arbitrary detention had 
given rise prior to 2008 to human rights abuses, such as inhuman conditions of detention, 
ill-treatment sometimes leading to death, and sexual violence. The Office has consistently 
advised the authorities that detention is an inappropriate response to social deprivation. It 
has regularly monitored the issue and worked with the Ministry of Social Affairs to inform 
it of these concerns and to encourage corrective measures. The Ministry instructed its staff 
to cease participation in police round-ups of poor people in the streets, re-established the 
principle of voluntariness for admission to its centres and improved its rehabilitation </footnote>0-16131

and civil cases from all 22 provincial and municipal courts. Thousands of appeals have 
been pending which, with the court&#8217;s current capacity, will take many years to clear. 
OHCHR has been encouraging donors to support the construction of extra office and 
courtroom space in order to increase its capacity to address this large backlog. This 
infrastructure intervention could have a significant and measurable impact on cases of 
human rights violations related to excessive detention pending appeal, the right to speedy 
judicial review and overcrowding in prisons. In March 2010, the Office supported a small 
donors&#8217; conference at which the Appeal Court President and the Prosecutor-General set out 
their plans to improve the functioning of the Court, which stands at the apex of the court 
structure. Two donors expressed interest in supporting the project.

OHCHR provided assistance and legal advice to provincial and local authorities, affected 
communities and NGOs supporting them, in order to protect communities&#8217; access to land 
and resources. Upon request, the Office also mediated or facilitated discussions or

ranged from installing rainwater harvesting systems, drilling additional wells or helping 
connect the prison to the mains water supply, to improving existing water connections or 
providing water filters to improve the quality of drinking water. The programme has also 
looked at wider issues of sanitation: latrine windows were modified in CC3 to improve 
light and ventilation; material was provided to several prisons for the construction of metal 
clothes dryers, so that prisoners can dry their uniforms outside; toiletries were provided to 
prisoners during monitoring visits; options are being explored regarding treatment of waste 
water and sewage or setting up of biogas units.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report was prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/25 of 2 
October 2009. It describes the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in Cambodia from June 2009 to June 2010.  
</p>
<p>2. During this period, the OHCHR programme of cooperation with the Government, 
civil society and the development community focused on the protection of rights related to 
land and housing, support for legal and judicial reform, correctional reform, and the 
protection of fundamental freedoms and development of civil society. It has continued to do 
so in a spirit of constructive dialogue which consists of discussing issues of concern 
directly with the relevant authorities, to draw their attention to applicable human rights 
standards, to explore possible solutions with them and to provide assistance to implement 
these. This approach builds on working relationships based on mutual confidence, and the 
search for durable solutions. In this spirit, OHCHR has been implementing its protection 
mandate within its technical cooperation programme. It has also drawn public attention to 
certain issues deemed critical, or when avenues for dialogue have been exhausted or proved 
ineffective. Human rights cooperation is complex and sensitive. It requires tact, dialogue, 
mutual understanding, the acknowledgement of issues and a willingness to address them.  
</p>
<p>3. The Office welcomed the exemplary cooperation of the Government with United 
Nations human rights mechanisms. In January 2010, it extended the OHCHR Memorandum 
of Understanding for another two years, thus acknowledging the value of the Office&#8217;s 
cooperation. It cooperated closely with the new Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Cambodia, who has visited the country three times since June 2009 and 
will be submitting his second report to the Human Rights Council in September 2010. The 
Government fully cooperated with the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture, which 
carried out its first mission in the country in December 2009. It presented its human rights 
record before the Universal Periodic Review (1 December 2009) of the Human Rights 
Council and accepted all the recommendations resulting from the process. Noteworthy also 
is the strengthened cooperation between OHCHR and the Cambodian Government&#8217;s 
Human Rights Committee (CHRC) on treaty reporting, which resulted in the Government&#8217;s 
clearing nearly all its pending reports to the United Nations Human Rights Treaty Bodies.  
</p>
<p>4. Since June 2009, important steps that will impact on human rights have been taken 
to strengthen the country&#8217;s legal and institutional framework: adoption of the Penal Code, 
the Law on Peaceful Demonstrations, the Law on Expropriation, the Anti-Corruption Law, 
a Housing Rights Policy and a circular to regulate evictions; drafting of a new correctional 
law and a law on a national human rights institution; and steps towards developing a 
national mechanism to prevent torture. The Office welcomed these initiatives, which, in the 
course of their development, it has actively sought to bring closer to human rights 
standards. It also welcomed the completion of the first trial in November 2009 by the 
Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC).  
</p>
<p>5. During the same period, however, many poor rural and urban communities, 
including minority peoples in north-eastern provinces, continued to be dispossessed of their 
lands with little or no remedy, the political space for critical debate was further eroded due 
to threats of, or the abusive use of, defamation, disinformation and incitement lawsuits, the 
reform of the correctional system faced enormous pressure, and the judiciary serious 
challenges to the effective delivery of justice. </p>


<p><b> II. Rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>6. Few people in Cambodia have access to justice for violations of their rights, because 
they are poor and disempowered and, too often, when they turn toward the courts, justice is 
rarely delivered. The Office&#8217;s rule of law programme aims to assist the Government in 
strengthening an institutional framework within which people can obtain an effective 
remedy, through the promotion of human rights standards, the strengthening of institutions 
responsible for protecting human rights, and their effective functioning. 
</p>
<p>7. The Office supported the Government&#8217;s commitment to the international human 
rights treaties, both through new ratifications and compliance with existing obligations. In 
August 2009, a law to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women was promulgated. OHCHR has been 
encouraging the Ministry of Social Affairs to consider ratification of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the light of the adoption of the Law on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities in 2009. A plan of action for implementation of the law is being 
drafted and it is hoped that ratification will be part of it.  
</p>
<p>8. The Office welcomed the adoption of the new Penal Code1, replacing the criminal 
provisions enacted by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in 
1992. The Code was drafted with significant support from the Government of France, and 
represents a considerable improvement in the legal framework for the administration of 
criminal justice. The Office analysed key provisions in order to contribute to an informed 
debate on the draft code as it passed through Parliament. The analysis focused on the extent 
to which the provisions conformed to international standards applicable in Cambodia with 
regard to sentencing, especially non-custodial alternatives, detention, torture and child 
exploitation, as well as their potential for restricting freedom of expression. Parliament 
missed an opportunity to improve the Code in order to strengthen Cambodia&#8217;s adherence to 
other international human rights treaty norms, for instance by including a definition of 
torture under the provision on torture in line with the 2003 recommendation of the 
Committee Against Torture2, or ensuring better protection of children against sexual 
exploitation in line with the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. OHCHR&#8217;s comments 
highlighting these concerns were shared with the Government and all parliamentarians but 
no amendments were made. 
</p>
<p>9. The tightly controlled adoption process by Parliament with no amendments accepted 
at any stage of the process highlighted that institution&#8217;s limited effectiveness in scrutinizing 
legislation prepared by the Executive. Whilst the National Assembly had begun to assert its 
independent role when it sent the draft Law on Peaceful Demonstrations back to the 
Council of Ministers in early 2008, important laws, such as the Penal Code, the anti-
corruption law, and the law on expropriation, were adopted with almost no debate, no 
amendments, and little or no consultation. The Government has responded that some 
Cambodian laws take many years to draft and are sent back and forth between executive 
and legislative bodies for modifications after being submitted to the legislative body. The 
Government is of the view that no law in Cambodia has been drafted or passed without 
debate either at drafting or passing level. 
</p>
<p>10. The process of establishing a national human rights institution (NHRI) has moved 
forward slowly since it started over a decade ago. The non-governmental organization 
(NGO) group delegated to draft the law and the CHRC are moving towards a consensus on 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Part of the Code came into force in December 2009; the balance entered into force in December 2010. 
 2 CAT/C/CR/30/2, para. 7. </p>


<p>a draft strengthening the basic requirement of the independence of the future institution. 
The process is ongoing. The difficulties in establishing effective independent bodies in 
Cambodia are illustrated by the Government&#8217;s timid efforts to establish an independent 
national preventive mechanism (NPM) as required under the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture (OPCAT) to which it is a party. In August 2009, a body was 
established by sub-decree which falls short of the basic OPCAT requirements. It is an inter-
ministerial committee consisting of senior officials, chaired by the Interior Minister. There 
are no independent members or participants from civil society. The Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture (SPT) confirmed the earlier advice of OHCHR that this body could 
not be regarded as a credible NPM. The Ministry of Interior has acknowledged this fact and 
signalled its intention to draft a law to formally establish an NPM with a supporting 
Secretariat. OHCHR has offered support, which the Ministry has accepted, to help draft the 
law, train the Secretariat and coordinate with other actors. 
</p>
<p>11. The Office provided support to the SPT during its mission to Cambodia in 
December 2009. OHCHR assisted the inter-ministerial committee to prepare the visit. The 
delegation spent ten days visiting prisons, police stations, drug and rehabilitation centres 
and meeting key Government officials. The Government granted the SPT unfettered access 
to detention facilities and demonstrated an exemplary openness to discussing its findings. 
OHCHR was invited to participate in the end-of-mission discussions with the Government. 
Wider lessons can be drawn from this visit in terms of the value of opening up government 
activities to scrutiny by independent professional bodies. The SPT methodology, which 
includes unfettered access to places of detention and detainees, together with confidential 
interviews and reporting, has been promoted by OHCHR through its prison programme in 
the past two years. These lessons may serve to inspire Cambodia&#8217;s reform of existing or 
proposed independent institutions, including the judiciary and the NPM. 
</p>
<p>12. Despite Cambodia&#8217;s renewed commitment to preventing torture, prosecutions for 
acts of torture remain the exception. OHCHR investigated allegations of torture and 
ill-treatment and raised them with the appropriate authorities but has yet to see any 
prosecution. The new Penal Code provides for more effective action against perpetrators. 
</p>

<p>services, but has not taken any serious steps to investigate and sanction the instances of 
serious abuse brought to its attention. In early 2010, the Office offered to the Ministry and 
the Phnom Penh Municipality to convene a meeting of Government and other stakeholders 
to look for long-term solutions, but received no response. 
</p>
<p>15. A notable exception in the widespread pattern of impunity has been the trial of Kang 
Guek Eav, alias &#8220;Duch&#8221;, before the ECCC. The Office has carefully followed the ECCC 
proceedings and is currently promoting a project aimed at encouraging the use of the good 
practices observed at the ECCC across the broader Cambodian court system (the ECCC is a 
Cambodian court, but one bound through international participation to implement 
international fair trial standards).  
</p>
<p>16. The ECCC proceedings are taking place in the context of a legal system which 
continues to face major challenges despite the comprehensive Legal and Judicial Reform 
Strategy. Impartial monitoring can play an important part in improving the quality of 
judicial services. The introduction of the new Penal Procedure Code in 2007 has provided 
an opportunity to raise standards within the court system as judges, lawyers and clerks 
familiarize themselves with the new Code. In 2009 the Office began to support a court 
monitoring project established by the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, a Cambodian 
NGO, in five courts. The aim is to collect basic data on the extent to which the courts 
comply with international trial standards and the provisions of the Penal Procedure Code, 
and to work constructively with court authorities and the Government to encourage good 
practice, identify problems and seek solutions. Constructive collaboration between the 
authorities and civil society monitors can contribute to improving compliance with 
international standards. Eventually the data from this monitoring effort could feed into a 
review of the implementation of the Penal Procedure Code by judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>17. In August 2009, the Office and the International Labour Organization (ILO) issued a 
joint press statement welcoming the Appeal Court&#8217;s decision to reinvestigate the murder of 
trade unionist Chea Vichea in 2004 following the Supreme Court ruling in December 2008. 
The statement recommended a transparent investigation to determine the identity of those 
responsible. The Office forwarded copies of the High Commissioner&#8217;s amicus curiae brief 
on the case, originally submitted to the Supreme Court in June 2008, to the Appeal Court 
prior to the hearing.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Fundamental freedoms and civil society 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Fundamental Freedoms and Civil Society programme aims to strengthen the 
capacity of individuals and civil society organizations to exercise their fundamental 
freedoms of expression, association and assembly. The programme works with the 
Government, civil society and development actors towards the development of legislation 
and policies - and in monitoring their implementation - that would enable groups and 
individuals to organize and participate peacefully in public affairs in a free and informed 
manner.  
</p>
<p>19. The Office continued to observe the narrowing of the space for the peaceful exercise 
of fundamental freedoms. Opposition parties, community activists and leaders, civil society 
organizations and the domestic media &#8211; but also United Nations agencies and donors &#8211; have 
faced growing pressure and threats following public expressions of concern about issues of 
public interest. A dozen defamation and disinformation lawsuits filed during the summer of 2009 against journalists and members of the opposition resulted in convictions with prison  </p>
<p>sentences for three people. This reflected a growing intolerance by the Government towards 
public criticism of its policies and practices, and public demands for transparency and 
accountability. Civil society actors, notably those involved in protecting the rights of poor </p>


<p>urban or rural communities dispossessed of their lands, have increasingly been accused of 
&#8220;inciting&#8221; people to violence or &#8220;opposing the authorities&#8221; or &#8220;acting as political parties&#8221;. 
Some of their members have been intimidated, threatened or prosecuted. Official rhetoric 
has continued to associate critical voices with the political opposition, and to imply that 
civil society groups are acting outside of their legitimate role, thus giving rise to a need for 
stricter regulation. In this context, the plan to adopt a law on NGOs and associations during 
this legislature has been widely received with concern, by civil society, the United Nations 
and donors.  
</p>
<p>20. OHCHR observed the exercise of the right to freedom of expression. It worked with 
journalists and journalists&#8217; associations, United Nations agencies, NGOs and donors to look 
for ways to improve the professional ethics of journalists and the protection of their 
profession. No one has been brought to justice for the murders of journalists since 1994. 
Similarly, the investigation into the latest killing &#8211; the murder of an opposition newspaper 
editor and his son on 11 July 2008 &#8211; has remained inconclusive. A number of persons 
affiliated with opposition parties or who simply criticized Government action were 
convicted either of defamation or disinformation. Examples of issues raised by these 
individuals included the possible adverse effects of a new lighting system on Angkor Wat 
(in the case of Moeun Sonn), allegations of corruption of senior officials (in the case of 
Hang Chakra) or the validity of diplomas distributed to army officers (in the case of Ho 
Vann). The Office monitored almost all high-profile defamation and disinformation trials, 
and provided interpretative and legal advice about relevant applicable international human 
rights standards to lawyers representing defendants, the defendants themselves, and the 
judges and prosecutors whose rulings were deemed incompatible with these standards.  
</p>
<p>21. The Office circulated a briefing note on freedom of expression, defamation and 
disinformation which sought to clarify the limits of the permissible restrictions on freedom 
of expression under international human rights law. The note cautioned that the use and 
abuse of defamation and disinformation lawsuits could dangerously undermine the 
constitutional freedoms of opinion and expression and the democratic development in the 
country. The note was submitted to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court in August 2009 
together with an offer to meet the judges and prosecutors to help clarify the issue, to no 
avail. 
</p>
<p>22. The Office supported the initiative of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media, 
to develop a Code of Ethics for journalists. It co-organized with UNESCO a conference to 
mark World Press Freedom Day on 4 May 2010, at which some 250 journalists 
participated, to discuss freedom of information and access to information. The journalists 
drafted a public statement calling for the adoption of an Access to Information Law, which 
was submitted to the Government. The Office encouraged the Government to adopt such a 
law, which with the Anti-Corruption Law could have a positive effect on press freedom. 
</p>
<p>23. The provisions of the new Penal Code relating to freedom of expression were 
examined by the Office in terms of their compliance with human rights standards. Legal 
comments were submitted to the Parliament prior to its discussion of the law, and the 
Office proposed briefings to present its analysis and encourage lawmakers to improve the 
draft. The National Assembly did not take up the offer, but the Senate did. The Office 
shared its analysis with civil society, the United Nations and donors, as well as interested 
individual members of Parliament, to inform and stimulate discussion. The Penal Code was 
adopted without amendment. Opposition parliamentarians&#8217; suggestions were rejected and 
the National Assembly refused proposals for consultation with civil society. 
</p>
<p>24. A positive provision of the Penal Code is the explicit reference to the media being 
subject to the Press Law, a combination of civil and criminal law, explicitly protecting 
opinions expressed by journalists. Once in force, the Penal Code may result in more </p>


<p>concerted efforts on the part of the judiciary to apply the Press Law to the media. Another 
positive aspect is that the crime of &#8220;disinformation&#8221; no longer seems to exist.  
</p>
<p>25. The new Penal Code has the potential to be more restrictive of freedom of 
expression than the UNTAC law, especially in a context where courts are vulnerable to 
pressure. Under the UNTAC law, freedom of expression was primarily regulated by the 
provisions governing defamation, disinformation and incitement. The new Code, however, 
includes additional crimes that could be used to curtail freedom of expression, such as 
&#8220;falsification of information&#8221;; &#8220;public insult&#8221;; &#8220;slanderous denunciation&#8221;; &#8220;insult and 
resistance to public officials&#8221;; &#8220;publication of any commentaries to put pressure on the 
judiciary&#8221; and &#8220;discrediting the court decision&#8221;. These provisions include fines of up to ten 
million riel and prison sentences of up to three years and could seriously curtail freedom of 
expression. Moreover, many provisions remain open to arbitrary interpretation. For 
instance, the Office recommended that the concepts of &#8220;bad faith&#8221; and &#8220;putting pressure on 
the court&#8221; be precisely defined. This would facilitate the task for the judges and clarify the 
meaning of the law. OHCHR is exploring ways in which it can contribute towards assisting 
the judiciary in interpreting the Penal Code in line with the international human rights 
standards obligations of Cambodia.      
</p>
<p>26. The Office cooperated with the Ministry of Interior and other actors to contribute to 
fostering an environment whereby citizens can assemble and peacefully discuss and express 
their views. In recent years, peaceful demonstrations had been prohibited or restricted to the 
extent that they had become rare. The observation of several demonstrations showed undue 
restrictions imposed by local authorities on civil society actors for obtaining permission to 
demonstrate. This was the case when the subject of the demonstration was considered 
sensitive, such as corruption or land conflicts. Restrictions were usually justified on 
unspecified security grounds. Demonstrations that were authorized, however, ran smoothly, 
with minimal or no interference from the authorities. Good examples of this were the 
Human Rights Day march and the Labour Day march, where the cooperation between 
municipal authorities, police and organizers was exemplary.  
</p>
<p>27. In December 2009, a new Peaceful Demonstrations Law was adopted. A key 
improvement is that the law establishes a regime of notification rather than authorization to 
hold demonstrations. The law also contains provisions open to interpretation that could 
unduly restrict people&#8217;s ability to peacefully demonstrate. The Office shared its legal 
analysis with the Ministry of Interior and the relevant committees of the National Assembly 
prior to adoption of the law as well as opposition parliamentarians. Particular concerns 
remain about the impact of the law on demonstrations that occur spontaneously, for which 
there is no provision in the law and which are happening more frequently. 
</p>
<p>28. The Office worked with the Ministry of Interior and the East West Management 
Institute (EWMI) to develop an Implementation Guide on the new law, in consultation with 
civil society representatives. The project was launched through a jointly organized National 
Workshop in March 2010, at which approximately 170 participants, including Government 
and civil society representatives and donors discussed the law and areas that required 
clarification. The purpose of the Guide is to provide practical guidance to the authorities, 
civil society members and end-users to implement the law in accordance with international 
human rights standards. Once the Guide is finalized, the Office and EWMI will support 
regional training workshops on the law and the Guide to facilitate its understanding, 
interpretation and implementation. 
</p>
<p>29. As part of its objective to foster better cooperation between Government and civil 
society, the Office has been actively promoting the participation of civil society actors in 
activities and forums involving Government institutions and development partners, so as to 
help build mutual understanding, working relationships and trust and defuse mutual 
suspicion and tensions.  </p>


<p>30. The Office brought to the attention of government authorities several instances 
where human rights defenders were being accused, investigated or charged with incitement 
and defamation. An emblematic case was that of Pen Bunna, the provincial coordinator of 
the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC) in Rattanakiri, and 
Radio Free Asia Reporter Ratha Visal, who are being investigated by the provincial court 
for &#8220;incitement&#8221; to unspecified criminal offences, incitement of villagers to violence and to 
illegal occupation of land. The Office sought to discuss the case with the provincial 
authorities and the court to explore possible solutions, to little avail. It issued a statement in 
September 2009, calling for an end to the intimidation and harassment of human rights 
defenders in Rattanakiri Province. The same month, the Office proposed to the CHRC that 
a joint visit to Rattanakiri be made to assess the situation of human rights defenders and to 
jointly look for possible solutions. The Office did not receive a reply. Mr. Bonna remains 
under investigation.  
</p>
<p>31. In late 2008, the Government announced its decision to adopt an NGO law. As part 
of its effort to support the development of civil society and to foster an environment of 
cooperation between it and the Government, the Office analyzed the legal environment and 
context of this initiative. While respecting the Government prerogative to decide its 
legislative agenda, the Office questioned whether the law was legally necessary, since 
existing and planned legislation, in combination with self-regulation, appear to be sufficient 
to regulate the status and activities of NGOs. It also cautioned that the initiative could be 
premature, given the uneasy relationship between NGOs and the Government. The 
Government has responded that it perceives that some organizations in Cambodia have 
been operating anarchically under the name of &#8220;civil society&#8221;. The Office offered to 
facilitate dialogue between the Government and civil society prior to the development of 
the law. By June 2010, the Ministry of Interior was finalizing a first draft, and considering 
the convening of a national consultation to seek input from stakeholders. The Office 
proposed that it review the draft, and the Ministry accepted.  
</p>
<p>32. In this context, in January 2010 the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Cambodia, Surya Subedi, proposed to the Prime Minister that they, together with 
NGOs, explore avenues to improve dialogue between Government and NGOs. The Prime 
Minister accepted, expressing the view that cooperation from development NGOs was 
welcome but that other NGOs, such as human rights advocacy groups, should remain in 
their roles and not act as political parties or proxies for them. The Office has been 
facilitating discussion amongst civil society groups to develop concrete proposals.  
</p>
<p>33. The Office commented on several deportation cases which had undermined the 
refugee protective framework gradually established in the past decade, after Cambodia&#8217;s 
accession to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. 
</p>
<p>34. In October 2009, with the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee (CHRAC), 
the Office organized a one-week training course for 35 human rights NGO staff on the 
methodology of the documentation of human rights violations and the use of the United 
Nations human rights mechanisms to help them engage better with these. A follow-up 
training course is being developed focusing on further human rights monitoring methods, 
an area participants identified as a priority.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Land and livelihood  
</b></p>
<p>35. The Land and Livelihood programme seeks to contribute to protecting the rights of 
the poorest urban and rural communities, which are being dispossessed of their land or 
housing in the context of land disputes, land grabbing by powerful individuals or groups, or </p>


<p>the attribution with little control of economic land concessions and rapid high-end urban 
development.  
</p>
<p>36. The Office has been working with affected communities, the Government, civil 
society organizations, United Nations agencies and multilateral and bilateral development 
actors, as well as private companies, to strengthen the legal framework protecting land 
ownership and housing rights, and improve its fair implementation. It recommended a 
moratorium on evictions until such a framework is in place. Evictions in rural and urban 
areas undermine the efforts by the Government to alleviate poverty, and to improve the rule 
of law and governance. If the Constitution, the land legislation and human rights standards 
were effectively implemented, many land conflicts or evictions would not take place, and 
others would be fairly resolved. 
</p>
<p>37. Although there are no reliable figures, land disputes and evictions affect large 
numbers of people. The urban poor, small-scale farmers and indigenous communities are 
the primary victims. Whilst the land management system has resulted so far in the granting 
of over a million land titles, mostly to small-scale farmers, it has not ensured adequate 
tenure security for others in dire need, notably poor urban and rural communities, including 
indigenous peoples. In the urban sector, OHCHR continued to promote a process whereby 
evictions and resettlement, if considered necessary in the public interest, are undertaken 
with respect for the rights of affected communities and procedural safeguards. In July 2009 
&#8220;Group 78&#8221; residents were evicted from their land in central Phnom Penh. Many had 
official documentation proving their right to land titles under the law. Their attempts to 
obtain titles remained unanswered, as did their efforts to obtain redress. The Office worked 
with the Municipality in the months prior to the eviction, including supporting peaceful 
negotiations with the families right up to the day of eviction, thereby avoiding violence. 
The residents were nevertheless forced to leave their houses, albeit with financial 
compensation, before their claims to land ownership were determined by the relevant 
authorities, in violation of the law and procedural safeguards. 
</p>
<p>38. Together with the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), notably UNAIDS, the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme, 
the World Food Programme, and with civil society and humanitarian organizations, the 
Office worked with the Phnom Penh Municipality and national authorities to promote better 
standards of resettlement for 42 families whose members were living with HIV, and who 
were evicted and relocated outside the capital in mid-2009. The case provoked a public 
outcry, questioning Cambodia&#8217;s treatment of persons living with HIV. The UNCT and civil 
society organizations entered into a cooperation agreement with the Municipality to share 
the costs of the resettlement, which resulted in major improvements in the living and 
housing conditions of the families.  
</p>
<p>39. In July 2009, on the eve of the Group 78 eviction, a joint public statement by major 
development partners (including the United Nations) recommended that the Government 
stop forced evictions until a fair and transparent mechanism for resolving land disputes and 
a comprehensive resettlement policy are developed. These recommendations echoed those 
previously made by civil society, development partners, OHCHR, and United Nations 
bodies (the Human Rights Council, the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights 
(CESCR), the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Cambodia, and the 
Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing). During the same month, the Government 
announced its plans to adopt a Circular to regulate illegal settlements, and to develop a law 
on expropriation and a housing policy. These initiatives were welcomed by the Office, 
which pursued its efforts to foster support to help bring them to fruition. The Government 
has drawn attention to these components of an emerging legal framework to regulate land 
issues, as well as the creation of mechanisms to resolve disputes linked to land (including 
the Inter-Ministerial Council for Land Policy, and the Cadastral Commissions).  </p>


<p>40. The Law on Expropriation was adopted in February 2010, without sufficient 
consultation. The law offers some important protection to owners and &#8220;possessors&#8221; under 
the Land Law by limiting expropriation for public infrastructure that meets the definition of 
public interest. The Senate invited the Office to brief it on the human rights implications of 
the draft law and best practices elsewhere. The briefing was appreciated but the law was not 
amended.  
</p>
<p>41. The Office, together with civil society, supported and actively contributed to the 
development of the national &#8220;Circular on Temporary Settlements&#8221;. It advised development 
partners involved in the land sector on the Circular and closely cooperated with them to 
submit joint comments. The Circular was adopted in May 2010. It offers some solutions to 
support illegal settlers and ensure minimum standards for relocation, but remains unclear as 
to how to determine the legality or illegality of urban settlements subject to the Circular. 
The draft Housing Policy was released in early 2010. The Office welcomed its vision that 
all citizens have a right to adequate housing and its recommendation of a temporary 
moratorium on eviction for dwellers in informal settlements &#8211; a recommendation made by 
the United Nations and other experts referred to above. The Office submitted legal 
comments to improve the policy.  
</p>
<p>42. In addition, the Office continued to advocate for the adoption of a policy on 
resettlement to improve current practices and provide comprehensive solutions. This 
recommendation is in part based on a field study conducted by the Office in the last six 
months to assess the human cost of evictions at selected resettlement sites. OHCHR 
observed that &#8211; with notable exceptions &#8211; resettled families&#8217; living conditions, especially 
regarding food security, housing, livelihoods, health and education were worse than prior to 
the eviction. The study will hopefully contribute to raising awareness and to policy 
discussions. 
</p>
<p>43. As part of its broader advocacy work to persuade the Government to integrate basic 
human rights standards into housing and resettlement policies and practices, the Office, 
together with NGOs, organized a public briefing by the former Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing about the United Nations Guidelines on development-based Evictions and 
Displacement and facilitated the presentation of these guidelines to representatives of the 
Ministries of Land Management and Interior.  
</p>
<p>44. In rural areas, OHCHR has continued to monitor the granting of economic land 
concessions (ELCs) and their impact on the rights of indigenous communities and small-
scale farmers. Generally the procedural safeguards prior to granting concessions are not 
adequately followed &#8211; most importantly, the requirements to consult with affected 
communities and conduct environment and social impact assessments. As of May 2009, 
according to the Ministry of Agriculture&#8217;s public information, ELCs had been granted to 85 
companies over a total land area of 956,690 ha.3 The Office&#8217;s own monitoring and NGOs&#8217; 
observations indicate that there might be up to 159 companies involved over a total area of 
1,300,000 ha. 
</p>

<p>46. In addition, the Office worked with selected companies to encourage them to apply 
human rights standards beyond merely obeying national law. For instance, it gave legal 
advice to a multinational rubber company. Prompted partly by this advice, the company 
conducted an extensive environmental and social impact assessment, including an analysis 
on how the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples applied to its 
rubber plantation. The Office contributed to this assessment. Since then the company has 
been taking measures to mitigate the impact of its plantation on people&#8217;s livelihood and 
land. Other companies have agreed to negotiate solutions with affected villagers, or to 
exclude the land used by villagers from their concessions. 
</p>
<p>47. At policy level, the Office continued to draw attention to the need to strengthen the 
protection of indigenous land. It participated in discussions on &#8220;joint monitoring indicators&#8221; 
between the Government and development partners in this regard. Since the adoption of the 
Sub-Decree on indigenous land registration in April 2009, the Government has taken 
important steps to legally register communities and facilitate the subsequent registration of 
their land. The pace of this land registration is however very slow. It is for this reason that 
the Office recommends that temporary measures be taken to protect those communities 
until they can effectively receive titles.  
</p>
<p>48. OHCHR also closely followed the work of NGOs and communities involved in land 
disputes and sought to defend their rights and seek remedies through cadastral 
administration and the courts. In most, if not all cases, these institutions failed to uphold 
their rights and deliver justice. Instead, criminal charges were brought against villagers and 
human rights defenders. For instance, in the 31 disputes mentioned above, 45 people were 
arrested and detained. The Office provided advice to the relevant authorities in several 
instances to ensure due process of law, which resulted in the release of several of the 
farmers. It supported the documentation of land disputes by communities themselves, 
which resulted in the submission of a third round of countrywide community complaints to 
national authorities in August 2009. These collective efforts in 2008 and 2009 have 
remained unanswered.  
</p>
<p>49. Together with the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) the Office initiated 
a project to raise awareness among business enterprises and NGOs of their corporate social 
and human rights responsibilities. In November 2009, it conducted a two-day training 
course for 30 NGO representatives on human rights and business. It has been supporting the 
CCHR in conducting workshops with private businesses to raise their awareness about the 
human rights implications of their activities. This is the first time that such issues have been 
discussed in Cambodia 
</p>
<p><b> V. Prison reform 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Office continued to implement its Prison Reform Support Programme (PRSP), a 
partnership with the Ministry of Interior aimed at supporting the transformation of prisons 
from a system of confinement to one of rehabilitation, complying with the international 
human rights norms. Support is provided in four areas: (a) legal reform, (b) training of 
prison personnel, (c) assessment of prison conditions and prisoners&#8217; treatment, and 
(d) water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>51. The programme looked at existing legislation. Prisons have been organized on the 
basis of a variety of secondary legislation, including a royal decree, governmental sub-
decrees, ministerial proclamations and circulars, but no law. To address this shortcoming, 
the Government decided to adopt a Law on Prisons. The Ministry of Interior initiated a 
draft, which was shared with the Office for legal analysis and comments, so as to build in 
protection safeguards. In consultation with relevant stakeholders including UNICEF and </p>


<p>ILO, OHCHR prepared comments based on the international standards regarding the rights 
of prisoners and good practices in prison management, which were submitted in June 2010. 
The Office also provided advice for the review of the Royal Decree on the Separate Status 
of Prison Staff, and recommendations for amendments to specific Prison Procedures, such 
as those pertaining to health and sanitation or labour in prison.  
</p>
<p>52. Wider criminal justice legislation also impacts on detention. The Office drew to the 
attention of the authorities provisions of the new Penal Code which are likely to increase 
the growth rate of the prison population. Over the past 15 years, the prison population has 
grown at an annual rate of 8 to 13 per cent. Prison overcrowding is one of the main 
challenges faced by the prison authorities in carrying out their mission, threatening to 
undermine reform progress, and by prisoners who live in congested cells, with often less 
than two square metres per person and too little time outside their cells.  
</p>
<p>53. Human resources determine any process of reform. While policies have been 
developed at a senior level, the General Department of Prisons (GDP) is faced with a gap at 
the operational level, where insufficiently trained or untrained personnel are required to 
translate these reforms into daily practice. In consultation with outside actors involved in 
the prison sector, in particular the Cambodia Criminal Justice Assistance Programme 
(CCJAP) of AusAID (the Australian Government&#8217;s overseas aid programme), OHCHR has 
been working with the Steering Committee on Prison Staff Training, set up by the Ministry 
in January 2010. The Office started developing a comprehensive training plan and 
curriculum for all categories of prison staff, both for new recruits and for existing staff 
promoted to new responsibilities, for implementation from 2011 onwards. In parallel, it has 
also sought to help address more immediate needs such as developing a pool of prison 
trainers, or designing a short training plan for around 650 prison guards who have not had 
any training since their recruitment up to three years ago.  
</p>
<p>54. The primary goal of the programme is to ensure that the human rights of prisoners 
are promoted and protected. Regular monitoring of prisons is an essential tool for achieving 
this goal. The programme seeks to critically assess conditions of detention and prisoners&#8217; 
treatment, identify good practices developed in some prisons in order to promote them in 
others, understand the reasons behind specific problems or patterns of abuse in order to 
address them systemically, and draw the attention of prison authorities to these issues. The 
Office continued to enjoy the full cooperation of the prison authorities in accessing the 
prisons and holding confidential interviews with prisoners and staff. Between June 2009 
and August 2010, it conducted five new assessment visits to provincial prisons in Prey 
Veng, Mondolkiri, and Kampong Speu, and to Correctional Centres No. 3 and 4, then 
accommodating a total of around 2,000 prisoners. During the same period, it also carried 
out over 35 follow-up visits to prisons in eight provinces and the four national Correctional 
Centres, accounting together for 70 per cent of the prison population. Prison authorities 
have welcomed OHCHR&#8217;s constructive approach. The quality of dialogue on difficult 
issues raised by the Office as part of its confidential reporting to the Government has been 
constant.  
</p>
<p>55. Solutions to several problems identified have progressed over the last year, thanks to 
the commitment of governmental and non-governmental actors involved in the sector. The 
revised sub-decree regulating prisoners&#8217; rations and cell equipment, which almost doubled 
the daily food allocation per detainee (from the equivalent of US$ 0.37 to US$ 0.70), was 
issued in June 2009, and funds were disbursed from September onwards. The Ministries of 
Interior and Health also agreed in early 2010 that healthcare in prison fell under the 
Ministry of Health: prison dispensaries were officially considered as &#8220;health posts&#8221;, to be 
supported by the relevant public health structures in terms of supply of medicine and 
medical training for prison health-care staff. While expected improvements at prison level 
have been slow, in part due to the limited resources of the public health system, this </p>


<p>development is nevertheless a step in the right direction. The draft Minimum Design 
Standards for Prison Construction, jointly developed by OHCHR, the International 
Committee of the Red Cross, CCJAP, and GDP were improved as a result of several 
discussions in the first half of 2010, and are to be adopted as an official document of the 
Ministry of Interior to guide its construction and renovation of prisons.  
</p>
<p>56. A number of initiatives were explored to address other recurrent concerns, such as 
excessive detention. During visits to Correctional Centre No. 3 in 2009, several hundred 
prisoners whose appeal was pending, in some cases for up to a decade, were identified. The 
Office has been discussing with GDP and the Court of Appeal ways to address the backlog 
of prisoners&#8217; cases. An estimated 1,000 prisoners have an appeal pending countrywide but 
the exact figure is not known. At the request of GDP, the Office drafted guidelines on how 
prisons could facilitate the processing of cases, through the production of a comprehensive 
list of prisoners awaiting appeal. This work has highlighted the need for improved 
communication and cooperation between the prisons and the courts in general. Documents 
which are essential for the effective implementation of pre-trial detention orders and prison 
sentences need to be properly requested, prepared, submitted and managed in a timely 
manner by the courts and the prison authorities. Only a coordinated strategy of all actors 
can help to reduce excessive detention. OHCHR has expressed its willingness to assist in 
the organization of a high-level meeting of all relevant stakeholders to table the issue and 
discuss collaborative solutions.  
</p>
<p>57. Dialogue has also continued with GDP on ways to prevent ill treatment in prison, be 
it in the form of physical abuse, lack of access to fresh air, or unlawful disciplinary actions. 
In 2010, initial changes were introduced by the authorities in the organization of the 
prisoners&#8217; committees, the bodies originally set up to assist the authorities in the 
management of prisons, but which have been implicated in the abuse and ill-treatment of 
prisoners. An internal inspection mechanism has been strengthened with assistance from 
CCJAP and has carried out a first series of visits. OHCHR has been exploring with GDP 
the need to clarify disciplinary rules and diversify the options available to the authorities. It 
hopes to facilitate a meeting of prison staff to map the recurrent disciplinary offences 
occurring in prisons and the sanctions currently applied by the authorities, in order to 
develop and agree on a scale of humane and lawful sanctions, proportionate to the offences, 
complying with Cambodia human rights obligations and reflecting the willingness of GDP 
to continue progressing towards dynamic security management for the secure operation of 
its prisons.  
</p>

<p><b> VI. Assistance on reporting under the treaty bodies and the 
Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Office continued its comprehensive support to the Government and civil society 
with reporting procedures under human rights treaties and the Universal Periodic Review of 
the Human Rights Council. As part of its follow-up to the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights (CESCR) Concluding Observations of May 2009, the Office organized 
a workshop in June, with the CHRC, representatives of relevant ministries, and a member 
of CESCR, to seek to establish a system of focal points in key ministries to assist the 
CHRC in compiling future reports and ensure effective follow-up to concluding 
observations. The workshop reviewed the CESCR recommendations and agreed a workplan 
for drafting a common core document and Cambodia&#8217;s next periodic report for the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). With a view to the 
preparation of these two documents, the Office initiated an in-depth training course on the 
ICCPR for CHRC staff and focal points from relevant Ministries. Seven one-day training 
sessions are being conducted, each on a group of articles, aimed at explaining the meaning 
of each article and how to report on them. This training supports the drafting by the CHRC 
of Cambodia&#8217;s report under the ICCPR, expected to be submitted in 2011. 
</p>
<p>61. In February 2010, Cambodia&#8217;s latest report was considered by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). The Office worked with the CHRC to 
prepare for the session and advised it on how to respond effectively to the Committee&#8217;s list 
of issues. The Government did not send an expert delegation to Geneva to engage directly 
with the Committee, thus depriving itself of the full benefits of the process. In contrast, 
NGOs and civil society organizations took advantage of the opportunities to highlight their 
concerns. The Office supported civil society engagement, including that of indigenous 
communities, with regard to the reports for both the CESCR and CERD.   
</p>
<p>62. Reports from Cambodia are due to be considered by the Committee against Torture 
in November 2010 and the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2011. While in 2008 
Cambodia had fifteen overdue reports for the treaty bodies and four others pending, by May 
2010, this backlog has been reduced to one &#8211; an impressive achievement to which OHCHR 
contributed. 
</p>
<p>63. In December 2009 Cambodia underwent the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). 
OHCHR assisted the CHRC with its preparations for this. The UPR resulted in 91 
recommendations, ranging from land issues to freedom of expression, health, and children&#8217;s 
and women&#8217;s rights. In March 2010, the Government announced its decision to accept all 
recommendations. Cambodia is one of very few Member States to have made this 
important commitment. Both the Office and the Special Rapporteur welcomed the decision 
and offered support to assist in its implementation. By June, discussions were under way 
between the Office, the CHRC, the British Embassy and the Swedish International 
Development Cooperation Agency to convene a workshop aimed at developing a national 
action plan for implementation of the recommendations and those of the recent treaty body 
reviews (CESCR and CERD).  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Education, training and public information 
</b></p>

<p>rights treaties are now available in bilingual booklets, and accessible, along with other 
materials, on the Office&#8217;s bilingual website - the only United Nations website in Khmer. 
The Office also developed bilingual public information materials on its work, including its 
annual report, a leaflet introducing the Office, and a newsletter to contribute to topical 
human rights debates.  
</p>
<p>65. In addition to training offered to partners in substantive areas of work, the Office 
embarked on a new human rights education project with the Ministry of Education, 
UNESCO and UNICEF to further integrate human rights education into school curricula at 
primary and secondary levels. The first step in this process is a pilot human rights drawing 
competition in two provinces for children in grades five and six that will involve the 
production of government-approved human rights materials for primary schools. Human 
rights education projects are also supported through the provision of grants for the 
production and airing on national television of two human rights public service 
announcements, the broadcasting of an interactive radio series on the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, and a campaign on the rights of persons with disabilities. The Office 
supported celebrations of Human Rights Day 2009 and produced bilingual public 
information materials on the global anti-discrimination theme.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Support to the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>66. The new Special Rapporteur, Mr. Subedi of Nepal, undertook three missions to 
Cambodia (June 2009, January and June 2010). As in the case of his predecessors, the 
Office helped organize and coordinate the visits of the Special Rapporteur and provided 
him with administrative and logistical support. The Special Rapporteur reports separately to 
the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Staffing and administration  
</b></p>
<p>67. OHCHR maintains a head office in Phnom Penh and a regional branch in 
Battambang. The Office has eight international staff positions, 24 national posts and one 
international United Nations Volunteer. Its management structure consists of a 
Representative, a Deputy Representative, four programme units, and an administrative unit.  
</p>
<p>68. The regular budget of the United Nations covers the Office&#8217;s operational expenses, 
including the salaries of 7 international and 20 national staff members. Voluntary  </p>
<p>contributions to the United Nations Trust Fund for a Human Rights Education Programme 
in Cambodia cover all other expenditures, including substantive programme activities and 
the salaries of the other staff members. The Trust Fund is administered by the United 
Nations Office at Geneva.  
</p>
