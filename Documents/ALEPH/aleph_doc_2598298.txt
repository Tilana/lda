identifying and developing economic reserves. 
 
Operating Result  
 
The net profit of the Consolidated Entity for the financial period was $2,332 (2015: loss $2,383,200). 
 
The profit for the financial period was derived after the write off of $55,990 (2015: $2,039,640) in carrying values of 
the Consolidated Entity’s exploration assets and funds received in respect to the Research and Development tax 
incentive claim of $352,877 (before costs) for the twelve months ended 30 June 2015 from the Australian Taxation 
Office.  Other impact was the fair value decrement in Renascor Resources Limited of $9,000 in shares which was 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.   
 
Dividends Paid or Recommended 
 
No amounts have been paid or declared as dividends during the course of the financial period just concluded. 
 
Review of Operations 
 
During  the  twelve  months  to  30  June  2016,  Stellar  Resources  Limited  continued  to  progress  its  100%  owned 
Heemskirk Tin Project located in northwest Tasmania.  The project ranks as one of the best placed undeveloped 
tin projects in the world because of its high grade (1.14% tin) and its excellent location.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Figure 1: Location of Heemskirk Tin Project relative to other mines, northwest Tasmania
Heemskirk lies within one of the most prolific mining districts in Australia.  As such, environmental precedents are 
well  established  and  do  not  present  a  significant  hurdle  for  the  project.    In  addition,  infrastructure  spending  at 
Heemskirk  is  low  compared  to  that  of  more  remote  tin  projects  due  to  the  close  proximity  of  all-weather  roads, 
water  supply,  electricity  and  housing.    The  Zeehan  community  is  very  supportive  and  keen  to  see  a  new  mine 
developed in the area. 
 
Strategy 
 
The strategy remains to take Heemskirk through to development and tin production in the most cost effective and 
timely manner available.  Over the last year, that has meant cost effective management of corporate costs, while 
at  the  same  time  looking  for  opportunities  to  optimise  the  project  and  lower  pre-production  capital  and 
development risk.  
 
Optimisation of metallurgy for the Severn deposit was completed in September 2015 and demonstrated potential 
for improvements in the processing circuit and tin recovery. 
 
In July 2016, a pathway to faster tin production at lower capital cost was investigated and showed potential for a 
lower risk development.  
 
Market Outlook 
 
The  outlook  for  tin  improved  in  the  second  half  of  the  year  following  announcements  of  tin  smelter  closures  in 
China  and  Indonesia.    The  International  Tin  Research  Institute  (ITRI)  expects  that  refined  tin  production  will  be 
down by 5% in 2016 compared with 2015.   
 
Tin concentrate production from Myanmar remained at record levels in the January to May 2016 period.  However, 
volumes declined significantly in June 2016.  Whether this is a seasonal effect or the beginning of a longer-term 
trend will not be known for another three months.  The later outcome would be positive for the tin price. 
 
The LME tin price is up by 38% from its mid-January 2016 low with the decline of tin stocks at all levels supporting 
continued price recovery.  In Australian dollar terms, the tin price is now back at early 2014 levels.

Finance 
 
As at the 30 June 2016, cash on hand was $1,577,410. 
 
Costs  were  reduced  throughout  the  year  in  accordance  with  the  board  approved  plan  to  preserve  existing  cash 
resources  to  finance  activity  well  into  the  next  financial  year.    Accordingly,  expenditure  in  2016  was  reduced  by 
67% to $639,721 compared with $1,962,725 in 2015. 
 
During the year, the project continued to attract interest from potential investors.  To date, no preferred model for 
financing has evolved. 
 
Operational Overview 
 
Optimisation  work  at  the  beginning  of  the  financial  year  focused  on  improving  metallurgical  recovery  of  tin, 
simplifying  the  process  circuit  and  identifying  opportunities  to  lower  mining  and  processing  costs.    The  results 
achieved were positive and demonstrated potential for an even greater improvement. 
 
Further improvement was realised later in the financial year under a Fast Start Study.  The aim of the study was to 
achieve accelerated access to ore at a significantly lower  pre-production capital requirement.   Faster ore access 
was  achieved  by  assuming  a  sequential  development  of  the  three  Heemskirk  tin  deposits,  rather  than  the 
simultaneous development plan used in the optimisation work. 
 
The Fast Start Study concentrated on the Lower Queen Hill (LQH) Indicated Mineral Resource as the first stage in 
the mining plan.  The location of LQH near the proposed mine portal means that ore access could be reduced from 
twelve months to six months with development of the other tin deposits deferred until later in the mining plan.  In 
addition,  the  Fast  Start  Study  provided  a  21%  increase  in  head  grade  to  1.22%  tin  and  an  8%  increase  in 
recovered grade from the outcomes achieved by the optimisation work.

The Fast Start Study timeline in Figure 3, provides an indication of the path from the commencement of drilling to 
upgrade the LQH mineral resource to first tin in concentrate production twenty-four months later.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Figure 3: Indicative Timeline for a Definitive Feasibility Study
As announced in July 2016, Stellar has applied to Mineral Resources Tasmania, to convert the Retention Licence 
that covers the Heemskirk tin deposits into a Mining Lease (ML).  The new title would provide exclusive rights to 
extract  economic  minerals  from  the  deposits  and  would  have  a  much  longer  duration  than  the  existing  title.  
Granting of an ML also represents an important milestone in advancing the project to development. 
 
Exploration Activity 
 
All tenements held by Stellar Resources subsidiaries were reviewed for lithium and cobalt exploration potential.  In 
all  cases,  historical  assays  and  a  review  of  previous  work  showed  limited  potential.    Tailings  from  test  work  at 
Heemskirk tin were also tested given the observation of lithium mineral lepidolite in drill core.  The results showed 
sub-economic lithium concentrations. 
 
Tin exploration tenements in Tasmania were reviewed in order to prioritise targets.  Ramsay (EL 1/2004) has a drill 
ready tin in soil geochemical target that will be tested once finance is available. 
 
Uranium exploration tenement in South Australia are maintained under a joint venture agreement with Samphire 
Uranium Limited. 
 
Iron ore exploration interests in the Tarcoola area of South Australia were divested during the year under the terms 
of an existing Exploration and Development Agreement with Tarcoola Gold Pty Ltd a subsidiary of WPG Limited. 
 
Risk Management 
 
Stellar maintains a risk registry and reviews key risks at every board meeting.  If there is a high level of site activity 
throughout the year, one board meeting and risk review is also conducted at site in Tasmania.  As there was low 
site activity during the financial year, no board meeting was held at site in Tasmania. 
 
Occupational health, safety and environment are discussed at every board meeting with any incidents or breaches 
of the regulations reported by the Managing Director.  There were no reported incidents or breaches of regulations 
during the financial year. 
 
Access to capital is the most significant risk faced by the Company and the  most comprehensively discussed at 
board meetings.  Cost control on expenditure, as discussed earlier, is the main approach to managing this risk.

Significant Changes in the State of Affairs  
 
There were no significant changes in the state of the affairs of the Consolidated Entity during the financial period. 
 
Subsequent Events 
 
On 21 July 2016, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Columbus Metals Limited has applied 
to  Mineral  Resources  Tasmania  for  a  Mining  Lease  over  its  Heemskirk  tin  deposits.    Conversion  of  current  title, 
RL5/1997, into a Mining Lease represents a key milestone in the project’s advancement towards development.  A 
Mining Lease grants exclusive rights to minerals and Columbus Metals Limited has applied for the longest duration 
available under the Mineral Resources Development Act 1995. 
 
On 11 August 2016, the Company announced an “Investor Presentation” regarding the Heemskirk Tin Project. 
 
On 17 August 2016, the Company announced a request for an immediate trading halt, pending the release of an 
announcement in relation to potential clarifications to the ASX release “Investor Presentation” made on 11 August 
2016. 
 
On 18 August 2016, the Company announced “Clarification and Replacement of Investor Presentation” regarding 
the  Heemskirk  Tin  Project  and  provided  a  replacement  “Investor  Presentation”  for  the  one  announced  on  11 
August 2016. 
 
Other than stated, there has not been any matter or circumstance occurring subsequent to the end of the financial 
year that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations of the Consolidated Entity, the results 
of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Consolidated Entity in future financial years. 
 
Business Strategies 
 
The Consolidated Entity is committed to the corporate objective of:
“Enhancing shareholder wealth through mineral discovery”.
It seeks to meet this objective by:
-
-
-
Utilising cutting edge exploration technology;
Focusing on projects located within geological terrains hosting world-class ore bodies; and
Utilising an experienced, focused and success driven management team.
Where joint ventures seem appropriate and beneficial to the risk/reward profile of Stellar Resources, the Board has 
chosen to enter such agreements.  Joint ventures provide financing whilst maintaining meaningful involvement and 
equity in the project. 
 
Stellar  Resources  Limited  is  also  prepared  to  sponsor  or  co-sponsor  new  IPO’s  –  including  those  where  the 
Consolidated  Entity’s  assets  may  be  included.    In  such  cases,  shareholders  may  also  be  eligible  and  entitled  to 
subscribe for shares in any new IPO.

Review of Operations (cont’d) 
 
The  Consolidated  Entity’s  prospects  for  future  years  depend  very  much  on  the  rate  of  mineral  discovery.    The 
Consolidated  Entity  is  an  active  minerals  explorer  and  a  good  sized  mineral  discovery  has  the  potential  to  add 
substantial  value  to  Stellar.    Against  this,  Company  funds  must  be  expended  in  this  exploration/discovery 
endeavour and the Board may decide to raise new equity to replenish funds along the path. 
 
Future Developments 
 
The  Consolidated  Entity’s  activities  will  continue  to  focus  on  the  Heemskirk  Tin  Project  in  Tasmania.    In  the 
forthcoming  year,  the  Consolidated  Entity  plans  to  attract  funding  partners  to  continue  exploration  around  the 
known Mineral Resource ahead of in-fill drilling, metallurgical testing and various studies to support preparation of 
a Definitive Feasibility Study. 
 
Environmental Issues 
 
The Consolidated Entity’s exploration activities are subject to various environmental regulations under both state 
and federal legislation in Australia.  The ongoing operation of these tenements is subject to compliance with the 
respective mining and environmental regulations and legislation. 
 
Licence requirements relating to ground disturbance, rehabilitation and waste disposal exist for all tenements held.  
The  Directors  are  not  aware  of  any  significant  breaches of  mining  and  environmental  regulations  and  legislation 
during the period covered by this report.

(b)  Directors’ and Executives’ Compensation
Remuneration Policy 
The  Board  is  responsible  for  determining  and  reviewing  the  remuneration  of  the  Directors  including  the 
Managing Director and executive officers of the Company.  This process requires consideration of the levels 
and  form  of  remuneration  appropriate  to  securing,  motivating  and  retaining  executives  with  the  skills  to 
manage the Company’s operations.  In order to retain and attract executives of sufficient calibre to facilitate 
the efficient and effective management of the Company’s operations, the Board seeks where necessary the 
advice  of  external  advisers  in  connection  with  the  structure  of  remuneration  packages.    The  Board  also 
recommends the levels and form of remuneration for non-executive Directors with reference to performance, 
relevant comparative remuneration and independent expert advice.  The total sum of remuneration payable 
to non-executive Directors shall not exceed the sum fixed by members of the Company in a general meeting. 
Shareholders fixed the maximum aggregate remuneration for non-executive Directors at $500,000. 
 
The three key elements of Director and executive remuneration are:
-
-
-
base  salary  and  fees,  which  are  determined  by  reference  to  the  market  rate  based  on  payments  by 
similar size companies in the industry;
superannuation contributions; and
equity-based  payments,  the  value  of  which  are  dependent  on  the  Company’s  share  price  and  other 
factors.
(c)  Relationship between the Remuneration Policy and Company Performance
The  tables  below  set  out  summary  information  about  the  Consolidated  Entity’s  earnings  and  movements  in 
shareholder wealth for the five years to June 2016.  As the table indicates, earnings have varied significantly 
over  the  past  five  financial  years,  due  to  the  nature  of  exploration  activities.    It  has  been  the  focus  of  the 
Board of Directors to attract and retain management personnel essential to continue exploration activities.

(f)  Details Concerning Share-based Remuneration of Directors and Executives 
 
The  Company’s  policy  for  determining  the  nature  and  amount  of  emoluments  of  Board  members  and 
executives of the Company is as follows: 
 
The  remuneration  structure  for  executive  officers,  including  Directors,  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors, 
including length of service, particular experience of the individual concerned, and overall performance of the 
Company.  The contracts for service between the Company and Directors and executives are on a continuing 
basis  the  terms  of  which  are  not  expected  to  change  in  the  immediate  future.    There  are  no  termination 
benefits  or  incentives  provided.    Should  the  Company  terminate  the  Managing  Director’s  contract 
immediately, the Company shall pay an amount equal to the total remuneration for 12 months.   Any options 
not exercised before or on the date of termination will lapse. 
 
The objective of the share-based schemes is to both reinforce the short and long-term goals of the Company 
and to provide a common interest between management and shareholders.  
 
The  Board  is  responsible  for  the  review  and  operation  of  the  Stellar  Option  Plan  including  terms  and 
conditions for all options issued.  The number of options offered under the plan is limited to less than 5% of 
the total number of shares on issue at the time of the offer.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
STELLAR RESOURCES LIMITED 
ACN 108 758 961 
AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 
 
Indemnifying Officers 
 
The  Company  has  paid  premiums  to  insure  each  of  the  Directors,  Company  Secretary  and  executive  officers 
against liabilities for costs and expenses incurred by them in defending any legal proceedings arising out of their 
conduct while acting in the capacity of Director/officer of the Company, other than conduct involving a wilful breach 
of  duty  in  relation  to  the  Company.    The  terms  and  conditions  of  the  insurance  are  confidential  and  cannot  be 
disclosed. 
 
Dealing in the Company’s Securities 
 
The Company’s share trading policy restricts Directors, executives, employees and contractors to only trade in the 
Company’s securities during the 30 days (the “trade window”) commencing immediately after each of the following 
occasions:
-
-
-
the release by the Company of its quarterly report to the ASX;
the release by the Company of its half-yearly results to the ASX;
the release by the Company of its annual results to the ASX;
A Director, executives, employees or contractors may not trade in the Company’s securities outside of the trading 
window unless approval is given in accordance with the share trading policy. 
 
Prior  to  trading  in  (either  buying  or  selling)  the  Company’s  securities,  Directors,  executives,  employees  and 
contractors  must  notify  the  appropriate  person  of  their  intention  to  trade  and  confirm  that  they  are  not  in 
possession  of  any  published  price  sensitive  information.    This  requirement  does  not  apply  to  the  acquisition  of 
securities  through  an  incentive  plan,  nor  to  the  exercise  of  any  security  that  has  vested  in  accordance  with  any 
incentive plan resulting in the holding of a listed security in the Company.  However, the requirement does apply to 
the trading of the listed securities once they have been acquired. 
 
The  share  trading  policy  requires  the  Company  Secretary  to  maintain  a  register  of  all  trades  and  holdings  in 
Company securities by Directors, executives, employees and contractors.  Directors, executives, employees and 
contractors  must  notify  the  Company  Secretary  of  any  trade  in  the  Company’s  securities  within  2  days  of  such 
trade  occurring.    The  Company  Secretary  will  comply  with  the  ASX  Listing  Rule  3.19A  requirement  to  notify  the 
ASX of any change in a notifiable interest held by a Director. 
 
Proceedings on Behalf of the Company 
 
No  person  has  applied  for  leave  of  court  to  bring  proceedings  on  behalf  of  the  Company  or  intervene  in  any 
proceedings to which the Company is a party for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the Company for 
all or any part of these proceedings. 
 
Non Audit Services 
 
Details of amounts paid or payable to the auditor for non-audit services provided during the year by the auditor are 
outlined in note 5.6 to the financial statements. 
 
The Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services, during the year, by the auditor (or by another 
person or firm on the auditor’s behalf) is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors 
imposed by the Corporations Act 2001. 
 
Auditor’s Independence Declaration 
 
The auditor’s independence declaration for the year ended 30 June 2016 has been received and can be found on 
page 41 of the Annual Report. 
 
This  Directors’  Report  is  signed  in  accordance  with  a  resolution  of  Directors  made  pursuant  to  s.298(2)  of  the 
Corporations Act 2001 and dated this 31st day of August, 2016.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 30 JUNE 2016
Stellar  Resources  Limited  (the  Company)  is  a  public  company  listed  on  the  Australian  Stock  Exchange, 
(SRZ),  incorporated  in  Australia,  operating  in  Australia  and  comprises  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the Group).
Registered Office and Principal Place of Business 
Level 17, 
530 Collins Street, 
MELBOURNE VIC 3000 
Tel: (03) 9618 2540
The  principal  activities  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  was  mineral  exploration  with  the  objective  of 
identifying and developing economic reserves.
1.2  Statement of compliance
These  financial  statements  are  general  purpose  financial  statements  which  have  been  prepared  in 
accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, Accounting Standards and Interpretations, and comply with other 
requirements of the law. 
 
The  financial  report  comprises  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  Group.    For  the  purposes  of 
preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a for-profit entity. 
 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.   
 
Accounting  Standards  include  Australian  equivalents  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (“A-
IFRS”).  Compliance with A-IFRS ensures that the financial statements and notes of the Group comply with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). 
 
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 31 August 2016.
1.3  Basis of preparation
The  financial  report  has  been  prepared  on  the  basis  of  historical  cost,  except  for  the  revaluation  of  certain 
non-current assets and financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end 
of  each  reporting  period.    Historical  cost  is  generally  based  on  the  fair  values  of  the  consideration  given  in 
exchange for assets.  All amounts are presented in Australian dollars, unless otherwise noted.
1.4  Going concern
Stellar  Resources  Limited’s  financial  statements  are  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which  assumes 
continuity  of  normal  business  activities  and  the  realisation  of  assets  and  settlement  of  liabilities  and 
commitments in the normal course of business.  During the year ended 30 June 2016, the Group generated a 
profit  of  $2,332,  had  net  cash  outflows  from  operating  activities  of  $440,875,  payments  for  exploration 
activities of $608,498 and had an accumulated loss of $19,052,723 as at 30 June 2016.  The continuation of 
the  Group  as  a  going  concern  is  dependent  upon  its  ability  to  generate  sufficient  cash  from  operating  and 
financing  activities  and  manage  the  level  of  exploration  and  other  expenditure  within  available  cash 
resources.  The Directors consider that the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate for the following 
reasons: 
 
As at 30 June 2016, the Group had cash assets of $1,577,410, net working capital of $1,655,114, as well as 
investments  in  UraniumSA  Limited  of  $58,712,  Samphire  Uranium  Limited  of  $21,774  and  Renascor 
Resources Limited of $30,000 which could be sold if required.   
 
The  most  recently  prepared  cash  flow  forecast  prepared  by  management  and  reviewed  by  the  Directors 
indicates that the Group will hold sufficient cash reserves to meet their operating requirements to 31 August 
2017.  This cash flow forecast takes into account the Group’s implementation of cost reviews which includes 
exploration activity and overhead expenditure, as well as raising new equity capital in order for the Group to 
meet its planned exploration expenditure.  The Group is able to meet its minimum exploration commitments 
and  overhead  expenditure  through  31  August  2017,  should  new  equity  capital  not  be  raised  during  this 
period. 
 
The  Group’s  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which  contemplates  the 
continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary 
course of business.

1.  GENERAL NOTES (cont’d)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 30 JUNE 2016
1.5  Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgments, estimates 
and  assumptions  about  carrying  values  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  not  readily  apparent  from  other 
sources.    The  estimates  and  associated  assumptions  are  based  on  historical  experience  and  other  factors 
that are considered to be relevant.  Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
The  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.    Revisions  to  accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period 
or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
 
The critical accounting judgement areas primarily relate to the carrying values in respect of exploration costs.  
Refer note 3.5 for details.
1.6  Application of new and revised Accounting Standards
In the current year, the Group has applied all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by 
the Australian Accounting Standards Board (the AASB) that are relevant to its operations and effective for the 
current annual reporting period. 
 
The application of these amendments does not have any material impact on the disclosures or the amounts 
recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

2.1  Segment Information
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 30 JUNE 2016
Information  reported  to  the  chief  operating  decision  maker  for  the  purposes  of  resource  allocation  and
assessment of segment performance focuses on the types of resources held.
The Group operates in the Australian mineral exploration sector where it is actively pursuing opportunities for 
a  number  of  mineral  targets  through  various  tenements  all  of  which  are  currently  at  exploration  stage  and 
require further funding to proceed to revenue generation stages.  As such the Group is required to prioritise 
its  funding  allocation  and  does  so  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  market  sentiment  and  the  potential  of 
finding a viable mineral resource.  Each exploration licence may be identified as a separate business activity 
that  has  revenue  earning  potential.    However,  licences  of  the  same  mineral  exploration  targets  have  been 
aggregated  into  the  same  segment  based  on  similar  economic  characteristics.    Various  corporate  and 
investing activities have been allocated to a corporate operating segment of the Group.
The following is an analysis of the Group’s revenue and results from operations by reportable segment.

Revenue  is  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  received  or  receivable.    Interest  revenue  is 
accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, 
which  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts  through  the  expected  life  of  the 
financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount. 
 
All revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax (“GST”).

2.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (cont’d) 
 
2.4  Taxation (cont’d)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 30 JUNE 2016
Current tax is calculated by reference to the amount of income taxes payable or recoverable in respect of the 
taxable profit or tax loss for the period.  It is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by reporting date.  Current tax for current and prior periods is recognised as a liability 
(or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable). 
 
Deferred tax is accounted for using the comprehensive balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary 
differences  arising  from  differences  between  the  carrying  amount  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  financial 
statements and the corresponding tax base of those items. 
 
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.  Deferred tax assets 
are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable amounts will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences or used tax losses and tax offsets can be utilised. 
 
The  Company  and  all  its  wholly-owned  Australian  resident  entities  have  formed  a  tax-consolidated  group 
under  Australian  taxation  law.    Stellar  Resources  Limited  is  the  head  entity  in  the  tax-consolidated  group.  
Tax expense/income, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences of the 
members of the tax-consolidated group are recognised in the separate financial statements of the members 
of the tax-consolidated group using the “separate taxpayer within group” approach.  Current tax liabilities and 
assets  and  deferred  tax  assets  arising  from  unused  tax  losses  and  tax  credits  of  the  members  of  the  tax-
consolidated group are recognised by the Company (as head entity in the tax-consolidated group).  Under the 
tax sharing arrangements, amounts will be recognised as payable or receivable between group companies in  
relation to their contribution to the tax benefits and amounts of tax paid or payable.  No amounts have been 
recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax 
sharing arrangement is considered remote. 
 
Tax Consolidation 
Relevance of tax consolidation to the consolidation entity 
The  Company  and  its  wholly-owned  Australian  resident  entities  have  formed  a  tax-consolidated  group  with 
effect from 1 October 2004 and are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date.  The head entity within 
the tax-consolidated group is Stellar Resources Limited. 
 
Nature of tax sharing agreements 
Entities  within  the  tax-consolidated  group  have  entered  into  a  tax  sharing  agreement  with  the  head  entity.  
The  tax  sharing  agreement  entered  into  between  members  of  the  tax-consolidated  group  provides  for  the 
determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on 
its tax payment obligations.  No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this 
agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.
Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  (except  receivables)  are  recognised  net  of  the  amount  of  GST,  except 
where  the  amount  of  GST  incurred  is  not  recoverable  from  the  Australian  Taxation  Office.    In  these 
circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the 
expense.  Receivables and payables in the statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST.
The  net  amount  of  GST  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the  taxation  authority  is  included  as  part  of 
receivables or payables. 
 
Cash flows are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows on a gross basis.  The GST component 
of  cash  flows  arising  from  investing  and  financing  activities  which  is  recoverable  from,  or  payable  to,  the 
taxation authority is classified as operating cash flows.

3.  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (cont’d) 
 
3.3  Other Financial Assets (cont’d)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 30 JUNE 2016
Other  financial  assets  are  classified  into  the  following  specified  categories:  financial  assets  “at  fair  value 
through  profit  or  loss”,  “held-to-maturity  investments”,  “available-for-sale”  financial  assets,  and  “loans  and 
receivables”.  The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined 
at  the  time  of  initial  recognition.    At  balance  date,  the  entity  held  the  following  available-for-sale  financial 
assets: 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets 
Certain shares held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value.  Fair 
value  is  determined  in  the  manner  described.    Gains  and  losses  arising  from  changes  in  fair  value  are 
recognised  directly  in  the  investments  revaluation  reserve  with  the  exception  of  impairment  losses,  interest 
calculated  using  the  effective  interest  method  and  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  monetary  assets 
which  are  recognised  directly  in  profit  or  loss.   Where  the  investment  is  disposed  of or  is  determined  to  be 
impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is included 
in profit or loss for the period. 
 
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
-
-
the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on 
active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices; and
the  fair  value  of  other  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  (excluding  derivative  instruments)  are 
determined  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  pricing  models  based  on  discounted  cash  flow 
analysis; and
the  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  are  calculated  using  quoted  prices.   Where  such  prices  are  not 
available, use is made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration 
of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial  assets,  other  than  those  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  are  assessed  for  indicators  of 
impairment  at  each  statement  of  financial  position  date.    Financial  assets  are  impaired  where  there  is 
objective  evidence  that  as  a  result  of  one  or  more  events  that  occurred  after  the  initial  recognition  of  the 
financial asset the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.

Land  and  building  are  recognised  at  cost.    Plant  and  equipment,  leasehold  improvements  and  building  are 
stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment.    Cost  includes  expenditure  that  is  directly 
attributable  to  the  acquisition  of  the  item.    In  the  event  that  settlement  of  all  or  part  of  the  purchase 
consideration is deferred, cost is determined by discounting the amounts payable in the future to their present 
value as at the date of acquisition. 
 
Depreciation  is  provided  on  property,  plant  and  equipment,  including  freehold  buildings  but  excluding  land.  
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write off the net cost or other revalued amount of 
each  asset  over  its  expected  useful  life  to  its  estimated  residual  value.    Leasehold  improvements  are 
depreciated over the period of the lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter, using the straight 
line  method.    The  estimated  useful  life,  residual  values  and  depreciation  method  is  reviewed  at  the  end  of 
each annual reporting period.
The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:
Class of Fixed Asset
Depreciation Period
Office furniture and equipment
2 to 5 years
Software
Buildings
2.5 years

Ultimate  recovery  of  capitalised  exploration  expenditure  is  dependent  upon  success  in  exploration  and 
development, sale or farm-in\farm-out of the exploration interests.
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  incurred  is  accumulated  in  respect  of  each  identifiable  area  of 
interest.  These costs are only carried forward on the statement of financial position where rights to tenure are 
current and to the extent that costs are expected to be recouped through either the successful development 
of the area or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment 
of the existence of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant exploration activity in, or in 
relation to, the area is continuing.  A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the 
appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area of interest and are assessed for 
impairment if:
-
sufficient data exists to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability; or
other facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
- 
 
For  the  purposes  of  impairment  testing,  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  allocated  to  cash-generating 
units to which the exploration activity relates.  The application of this policy requires judgement to determine 
whether future economic benefits are likely, from either future exploitation or sale, or whether activities have 
not reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. 
 
Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written down in full in profit or loss during the period 
in which the decision to abandon the area is made.   
 
Proceeds on sale or farm-out of an area within an exploration area of interest are offset against the carrying 
value  of  the  particular  area  involved.   Where  the  total  carrying  value  of  an  area  has  been  recouped  in  this 
manner, the balance of the proceeds is brought to account in profit or loss.

A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and 
long  service  leave  when  it  is  probable  that  settlement  will  be  required  and  they  are  capable  of  being 
measured reliably. 
 
Liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months, are measured 
at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement. 
 
Liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits which are not expected to be settled within 12 months 
are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Group in respect 
of services provided by employees up to reporting date.

4.  CAPITAL STRUCTURE 
 
4.1  Financial instruments
(c)  Credit Risk Exposure
(b)  Commodity Contracts
As at 30 June 2016, the Group does not have in place any commodity contracts.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial 
loss  to  the  Group.    The  Group  has  adopted  a  policy  of  only  dealing  with  creditworthy  counterparties  as  a 
means  of  mitigating  the  risk  of  financial  loss  from  defaults.    The  Group’s  exposure  to  credit  risks  are 
continuously monitored and controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by management 
on a regular basis.
The  Group  does  not  have  any  significant  credit  risk  exposure  to  any  single  counterparty  or  any  group  of 
counterparties  having  similar  characteristics.    The  credit  risk  on  liquid  funds  and  derivative  financial 
instruments is limited as the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit 
rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, 
represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.

The  Group  manages  its  capital  to  ensure  that  entities  in  the  Group  will  be  able  to  continue  as  a  going 
concern.  
 
The  capital  structure  of  the  Group  consists  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  equity  holders  of  the  parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and accumulated losses disclosed in notes 4.2 and 4.3.  
 
None of the Group’s entities are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
 
(f)  Market Risk 
 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates  and price risk on 
listed shares and unlisted options (refer note 4.1(d)).  
 
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and 
measures the risk from the previous period.   
 
(g) 
 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash and cash equivalents. 
 
The  Group’s  exposure  to  interest  rates  on  financial  assets  are  detailed  in  the  liquidity  risk  management 
section of this note.

(j)  Equity Price Sensitivity 
 
The  sensitivity  analyses  below  have  been  determined  based  on  the  exposure  to  equity  price  risks  at  the 
reporting date. 
 
At reporting date, if the equity prices had been 5% p.a. higher or 5% p.a. lower: 
 
-
net profit for the year ended 30 June 2016 would have been affected as the equity instruments classified 
as available-for-sale would have increased/decreased further by $nil (2015: net loss for the year would 
have increased/decreased by $1,500). 
 
Investment  revaluation  reserve  would  have  increased/decreased  by  $5,525  at  30  June  2016  (2015: 
investment revaluation reserve would have increased/decreased by $3,888).
-
The Group’s sensitivity to equity prices has changed significantly from the prior year.  
 
(k)  Liquidity Risk Management 
 
Ultimate  responsibility  for  liquidity  risk  management  rests  with  the  Board  of  Directors,  who  have  built  an 
appropriate  liquidity  risk  management  framework  for  the  management  of  the  Group’s  funding  and  liquidity 
management requirements.  The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash balances.  
 
(l)  Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk Exposure  
 
The  following  table  details  the  Group’s  remaining  contractual  maturity  for  its  non-derivative  financial  assets 
and liabilities.  The table has been drawn up based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required

(b)  Movements in Shares on Issue
At the beginning of the reporting period
At the end of the reporting period
Ordinary shares participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the 
number of shares held.
At shareholders meetings, each ordinary share is entitled to one vote when a poll is called, otherwise each 
shareholder has one vote on a show of hands.
(c)  Share-based Payments
The Company has in place an Employee Option Plan under which employees of the Company, including non-
executive Directors can be offered both short term and long term incentives.  Under the plan each option is to 
subscribe  for  one  share  and,  when  issued,  these  shares  rank  equally  with  other  shares.    Options  issued 
under the Employee Option Plan are not transferable.   
 
The  Company  provides  benefits  to  employees  (including  Directors)  of  the  entity  in  the  form  of  share-based 
payment  transactions,  whereby  employees  render  services  in  exchange  for  shares  or  rights  over  shares 
(“equity-settled transactions”).  These benefits are currently provided under the Employee Option Plan.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity reserve 
on vesting date.
The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of 
earnings per share.
At 30 June 2016, the Company had on issue the following options to acquire shares in the Company:

Fair Value of Share Options Granted in the Year 
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted during the financial year is $0.02c per share option

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Stellar Resources Limited
Report on the Financial Report
We have audited the accompanying ﬁnancial report of Stellar Resources Limited, which comprises
the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of
profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the
consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended on that date, notes comprising a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors’
declaration of the consolidated entity, comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the
year’s end or from time to time during the financial year as set out on pages 15 to 40.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 1.2, the directors also state, in accordance
with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the consolidated
financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting standards.
Auditor’s Responsibi/ity
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the ﬁnancial report based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we
comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the ﬁnancial report is free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disdosures in the financral report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement,
Including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due
to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control, relevant
to the company’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view, in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
report,
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.
