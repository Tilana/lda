The information provided in this remuneration report has been audited as required by section 308(3C) of the Corporations Act 
2001.
A     Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration
The Group's policy for determining the nature and amounts of emoluments of board members and senior executive officers of 
the Group is as follows:
Tychean Financial Statement     10 | P a g e
TYCHEAN RESOURCES LIMITED
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Remuneration report – audited (continued)
The Company's Constitution specifies that the total amount of remuneration of non-executive directors shall be fixed from time 
to time by a general meeting. The current maximum aggregate remuneration of non-executive directors has been set at 
$300,000 per annum. Directors may apportion any amount up to this maximum amount amongst the non-executive directors as 
they determine. Directors are also entitled to be paid reasonable travelling, accommodation and other expenses incurred in 
performing their duties as directors. The remuneration of the Managing Director is determined by the non-executive directors 
on the Board as part of the terms and conditions of his employment which are subject to review from time to time. The 
remuneration of other executive officers and employees is determined by the Managing Director subject to the approval of the 
Board.
Non-executive director remuneration is by way of fees and statutory superannuation contributions. Non-executive directors do 
not participate in schemes designed for remuneration of executives nor do they receive options or bonus payments and are not 
provided with retirement benefits other than salary sacrifice and statutory superannuation.
The Company's remuneration structure is based on a number of factors including the particular experience and performance of 
the individual in meeting key objectives of the Company. The Board is responsible for assessing relevant employment market 
conditions and achieving the overall, long term objective of maximising shareholder benefits, through the retention of high 
quality personnel.
The Company does not presently emphasise payment for results through the provision of cash bonus schemes or other 
incentive payments based on key performance indicators of the Company given the nature of the Company's business as a 
mineral exploration entity and the current status of its activities. However the Board may approve the payment of cash bonuses 
from time to time in order to reward individual executive performance in achieving key objectives as considered appropriate by 
the Board.
The Company also has an Employee Share Option Plan approved by shareholders that enables the Board to offer eligible 
employees options to acquire ordinary fully paid shares in the Company. Under the terms of the Plan, options for ordinary fully 
paid shares may be offered to the Company's eligible employees at no cost unless otherwise determined by the Board in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan. The objective of the Plan is to align the interests of employees and 
shareholders by providing employees of the Company with the opportunity to participate in the equity of the Company as an 
incentive to achieve greater success and profitability for the Company and to maximise the long term performance of the 
Company.
The employment conditions of the Managing Director, Mr Houldsworth are formalised in a contract of employment. The base 
salary as set out in the employment contract is reviewed annually. The Managing Director’s contract may be terminated at any 
time on three months’ notice by either party. The Company may terminate these contracts without notice in serious instances 
of misconduct. Mr Houldsworth resigned as Managing Director on 1 September 2015.
Voting and comments made at the company’s 2015 Annual General Meeting
Tychean Resources Limited received more than 95% of ‘yes’ votes on its remuneration report for the 2015 financial year.   
The company did not receive any specific feedback at the AGM or throughout the year on its remuneration practices.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
For the Year Ended 30 June 2016

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated Financial Statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated. The Financial 
Statements are for the consolidated entity consisting of Tychean Resources Limited and its subsidiaries.
(a)
Basis of Preparation
These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting 
Standards and interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations 
Act 2001. Tychean Resources Limited is a for profit entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.
(i)
Compliance with IFRS 
These consolidated financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
(ii)
New and amended standards adopted by the Group.
A number of new and revised standards became effective for the first time to annual periods beginning on or after 
1 July 2015.  Information on the more significant standard(s) is presented below.
  AASB 2015-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Financial Reporting Requirements for
Australian Groups with a Foreign Parent.
  AASB 2015-4 amends AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures to ensure that its
reporting requirements on Australian groups with a foreign parent align with those currently available in 
AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements for such groups.  AASB 128 will now only require the 
ultimate Australian entity to apply the equity method in accounting for interests in associates and joint 
ventures, if either the entity or the group is a reporting entity, or both the entity and group are reporting 
entities.
  AASB 2015-4 is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2015.
The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the Group.
(b)  Basis of Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Parent and all of its subsidiaries as of 30 June 2016. 
The Parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. All subsidiaries have 
a reporting date of 30 June. All transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on 
consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies. Where 
unrealised losses on intra-group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested 
for impairment from a group perspective. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been 
adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.
Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, represent the portion of a subsidiary’s profit or loss and net 
assets that is not held by the Group. The Group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries 
between the owners of the parent and the non-controlling interests based on their respective ownership 
interests.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
(c)
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method which requires an acquiring entity 
to be identified in all cases.  The acquisition date under this method is the date that the acquiring entity obtains 
control over the acquired entity.
The fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are recognised in the consolidated financial 
statements at the acquisition date.
On the acquisition date the consideration transferred is compared with the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
acquired. The excess of consideration over the assets acquired is recorded as an exploration & evaluation 
asset.
(d)
Investments in associates and joint ventures
Associates are those entities over which the Group is able to exert significant influence but which are not 
subsidiaries.
A joint venture is an arrangement that the Group controls jointly with one or more other investors, and over 
which the Group has rights to a share of the arrangement’s net assets rather than direct rights to underlying 
assets and obligations for underlying liabilities. A joint arrangement in which the Group has direct rights to 
underlying assets and obligations for underlying liabilities is classified as a joint operation.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Interests in joint 
operations are accounted for by recognising the Group assets (including its share of any assets held jointly), its 
liabilities (including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly), its revenue from the sale of its share of the output 
arising from the joint operation, its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation and its 
expenses (including its share of any expenses incurred jointly).
Any goodwill or fair value adjustment attributable to the Group’s share in the associate or joint venture is not 
recognised separately and is included in the amount recognised as investment.
The carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures is increased or decreased to recognise 
the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate and joint venture, 
adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies of the Group.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group interest in those entities. Where unrealised losses are eliminated, the 
underlying asset is also tested for impairment.
(e)
Comparative Amounts
Comparatives are consistent with prior years, unless otherwise stated.
Where a change in comparatives has also affected the opening retained earnings previously presented in a 
comparative period, an opening statement of financial position at the earliest date of the comparative period has 
been presented.

(f)
Income Tax
The tax expense recognised in the profit or loss and other comprehensive income relates to current income tax 
expense plus deferred tax expense (being the movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities and unused tax 
losses during the year). 
 
Current tax is the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for the 
year and is measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, using the 
tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences which are determined by comparing the carrying amounts of 
tax bases of assets and liabilities to the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when 
the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. 
 
Deferred tax consequences relating to a non-monetary asset carried at fair value are determined using the 
assumption that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered through sale. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and 
losses can be utilised.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend either to 
settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are 
expected to be settled or recovered.
Current and deferred tax is recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the period 
except where the tax arises from a transaction which is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, in 
which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Tychean Resources Limited and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax 
consolidated group under tax consolidation legislation. Each entity in the group recognises its own current and 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such taxes are measured using the ‘stand-alone taxpayer’ approach to 
allocation.
Current tax liabilities (assets) and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and tax credits in the 
subsidiaries are immediately transferred to the head entity.
The tax consolidated group has entered into a tax funding arrangement whereby each company in the group 
contributes to the income tax payable by the group in proportion to their contribution to the group’s taxable 
income. Differences between the amounts of net tax assets and liabilities derecognised and the net amounts 
recognised pursuant to the funding arrangement are recognised as either a contribution by, or distribution to the 
head entity.

(g)
Leases
Lease payments for operating leases, where substantially all of the risks and benefits remain with the lessor, are 
charged as expenses on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term.
(h)
Revenue and other income
Revenue is recognised when the amount of the revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and specific criteria relating to the type of revenue 
as noted below, has been satisfied.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is presented net of 
returns, discounts and rebates.
All revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST).
(i)
Goods and Services Tax (GST)
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), except 
where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
Receivables and payable are stated inclusive of GST.   
 
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included as part of receivables or payables 
in the statement of financial position.
Cash flows in the statement of cash flows are included on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows 
arising from investing and financing activities which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is 
classified as operating cash flows.
(j)
Property, Plant and Equipment
Where the cost model is used, the asset is carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any 
impairment losses. Costs include purchase price, other directly attributable costs and the initial estimate of the 
costs of dismantling and restoring the asset, where applicable.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is measured on a cost basis. The carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed 
annually by directors to ensure it is not in excess of the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
assessed on the basis of the expected net cash flows that will be received from the assets’ employment and 
subsequent disposal. The expected net cash flows have been discounted to their present values in determining 
recoverable amounts.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amounts or recognised as separate assets as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost 
can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income during the financial year in which they are incurred.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Depreciation
The depreciable amount of all property, plant and equipment, except for freehold land is depreciated on a 
reducing balance method from the date that management determine that the asset is available for use. The 
depreciation rates used for each class of depreciable assets vary from 25% to 40%.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount 
is greater than its estimated recoverable amount (note 1(l)). 
 
 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are 
included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. When revalued assets 
are sold, it is Group policy to transfer any amounts included in other reserves in respect of those assets to 
retained earnings.
(k)
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised initially using trade date accounting, i.e. on the date the Group becomes 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
On initial recognition, all financial instruments are measured at fair value plus transaction costs (except for 
instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss where transaction costs are expensed as incurred).
(l)
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, 
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are 
tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds 
its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value 
in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets (cash generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment 
are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
(m)  Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of presentation in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes 
cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short term, highly liquid investments with 
original maturities of 12 months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Any bank overdrafts the Group have are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.

(n)
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are benefits, other than termination benefits, that are expected to be settled wholly 
within twelve (12) months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service.  
Examples of such benefits include wages and salaries, non-monetary benefits and accumulating sick leave.  
Short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amounts expected to be paid when the 
liabilities are settled.
Other long-term employee benefits
The Group’s liabilities for annual leave and long service leave are included in other long term benefits as they 
are not expected to be settled wholly within twelve (12) months after the end of the period in which the 
employees render the related service.  They are measured at the present value of the expected future payments 
to be made to employees.  The expected future payments incorporate anticipated future wage and salary levels, 
experience of employee departures and periods of service, and are discounted at rates determined by reference 
to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds (2015: government bonds) 
that have maturity dates that approximate the timing of the estimated future cash outflows.  Any re-
measurements arising from experience adjustments and changes in assumptions are recognised in profit or loss 
in the periods in which the changes occur. 
 
The Group presents employee benefit obligations as current liabilities in the statement of financial position if the 
Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve (12) months after the reporting 
period, irrespective of when the actual settlement is expected to take place.
(o)
Earnings per share
Tychean Resources Ltd presents basic and diluted earnings per share information for its ordinary shares.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax effect 
of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average 
number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.
(p)
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares 
and share options which vest immediately are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
(q)
Share Based Payments
The Group operates equity-settled share-based payment employee share and option schemes. The fair value of 
the equity to which employees become entitled is measured at grant date and recognised as an expense over 
the vesting period, with a corresponding increase to an equity account. The fair value of shares is ascertained as 
the market bid price. The fair value of options is ascertained using a Binomial pricing model which incorporates 
all market vesting conditions. The amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
options or shares granted.  This expense takes in account any market performance conditions and the impact of 
any non-vesting conditions but ignores the effect of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account when considering the number of options expected to vest. 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options which are expected 
to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. Revisions to the prior period estimate are recognised in 
profit or loss and equity.
(r)
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency of each of the Group entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which that entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian 
dollars which is the parent entity’s functional and presentation currency.
(s)
Exploration and development expenditure
Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure incurred is accumulated in respect of each identifiable 
area of interest. These costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped 
through successful development of the area or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage that 
permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves. As the asset is not 
available for use it is not depreciated or amortised.
Accumulated costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit or loss in the period in 
which the decision to abandon that area is made.
A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry 
forward costs in relation to that area of interest.
(t)
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
A number of new and revised standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2015. 
Information on these new standards is presented below.
Recently issued accounting standards to be applied in future accounting periods.
The accounting standards that have not been early adopted for the year ended 30 June 2016, but will be

AASB 9 introduces new requirements for the 
classification and measurement of financial assets and 
liabilities and includes a forward-looking ‘expected loss’ 
impairment model and a substantially-changed approach 
to hedge accounting. 
These requirements improve and simplify the approach 
for classification and measurement of financial assets 
compared with the requirements of AASB 139.  The main 
changes are: 
a  Financial assets that are debt instruments will be 
classified based on: (i) the objective of the entity’s 
business model for managing the financial assets; and 
(ii) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.


the change attributable to changes in credit risk are 
presented in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) 
the remaining change is presented in profit or loss
 
If this approach creates or enlarges an accounting 
mismatch in the profit or loss, the effect of the 
changes in credit risk are also presented in profit or 
loss. 
Otherwise, the following requirements have generally 
been carried forward unchanged from AASB 139 into 
AASB 9:
  classification and measurement of financial
liabilities; and
  derecognition requirements for financial assets and
liabilities
AASB 9 requirements regarding hedge accounting 
represent a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting that 
enable entities to better reflect their risk management 
activities in the financial statements. 
Furthermore, AASB 9 introduces a new impairment 
model based on expected credit losses.  This model 
makes use of more forward-looking information and 
applies to all financial instruments that are subject to 
impairment accounting.
In May 2015, the AASB decided to revise Australian 
Accounting Standards that incorporate IFRSs to minimise 
Australian-specific wording even further.  The AASB 
noted that IFRSs do not contain application paragraphs 
that identify the entities and financial reports to which the 
Standards (and Interpretations) apply.  As a result, the 
AASB decided to move the application paragraphs 
previously contained in each Australian Accounting 
Standard (or Interpretation), unchanged, into a new 
Standard AASB 1057 Application of Australian 
Accounting Standards.

Amendments to 
Australian 
Accounting 
Standards – 
Clarification of 
Acceptable 
Methods of 
Depreciation and 
Amortisation
The amendments to AASB 11 state that an acquirer of an 
interest in a joint operation in which the activity of the joint 
operation constitutes a ‘business’, as defined in AASB 3 
Business Combinations, should: 
1  Apply all of the principles on business combinations
accounting in AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting 
Standards except principles that conflict with the 
guidance of AASB 11.  This requirement also applies 
to the acquisition of additional interests in an existing 
joint operation that results in the acquirer retaining 
joint control of the joint operation (note that this 
requirement applies to the additional interest only, i.e. 
the existing interest is not re-measured) and to the 
formation of a joint operation when an existing 
business is contributed to the joint operation by one of 
the parties that participate in the joint operation; and
2  Provide disclosures for business combinations as
required by AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting 
Standards.
The amendments to AASB 116 prohibit the use of a 
revenue-based depreciation method for property, plant 
and equipment.  Additionally, the amendments provide 
guidance in the application of the diminishing balance 
method for property, plant and equipment. 
The amendments to AASB 138 present a rebuttable 
presumption that a revenue-based amortisation method 
for intangible assets is inappropriate.  This rebuttable 
presumption can be overcome (i.e. a revenue-based 
amortisation method might be appropriate) only in two (2) 
limited circumstances: 
1  The intangible asset is expressed as a measure of
revenue, for example when the predominant limiting 
factor inherent in an intangible asset is the 
achievement of a revenue threshold (for instance, the 
right to operate a toll road could be based on a fixed 
total amount of revenue to be generated from 
cumulative tolls charged); or
2  When it can be demonstrated that revenue and the
consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible 
asset are highly correlated.

1 January 
2016
When these amendments 
are first adopted for the year 
ending 30 June 2017, there 
will be no material impact 
on the financial statements.
The amendments address a current inconsistency 
between AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
and AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures. 
The amendments clarify that, on a sale or contribution of 
assets to a joint venture or associate or on a loss of 
control when joint control or significant influence is 
retained in a transaction involving an associate or a joint 
venture, any gain or loss recognised will depend on 
whether the assets or subsidiary constitute a business, 
as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations.  Full gain 
or loss is recognised when the assets or subsidiary 
constitute a business, whereas gain or loss attributable to 
other investors’ interests is recognised when the assets 
or subsidiary do not constitute a business. 
This amendment effectively introduces an exception to 
the general requirement in AASB 10 to recognise full gain 
or loss on the loss of control over a subsidiary.  The 
exception only applies to the loss of control over a 
subsidiary that does not contain a business, if the loss of 
control is the result of a transaction involving an 
associate or a joint venture that is accounted for using 
the equity method.  Corresponding amendments have 
also been made to AASB 128. 
AASB 2015-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting 
Standards – Effective Date of Amendments to AASB 10

of AASB 2014-10 from 1 January 2016 to 1 January 
2018.  Refer to the section on AASB 2015-10 below for 
further information.
These amendments arise from the issuance of Annual 
Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle in September 
2014 by the IASB.  
Among other improvements, the amendments clarify that 
when an entity reclassifies an asset (or disposal group) 
directly from being held for sale to being held for 
distribution (or vice-versa), the accounting guidance in 
paragraphs 27-29 of AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for 
Sale and Discontinued Operations does not apply.  The 
amendments also state that when an entity determines 
that the asset (or disposal group) is no longer available 
for immediate distribution or that the distribution is no 
longer highly probable, it should cease held-for-
distribution accounting and apply the guidance in 
paragraphs 27-29 of AASB 5.

The Standard makes amendments to AASB 101 
Presentation of Financial Statements arising from the 
IASB’s Disclosure Initiative project. 
The amendments:
  clarify the materiality requirements in AASB 101,
including an emphasis on the potentially detrimental 
effect of obscuring useful information with immaterial 
information
  clarify that AASB 101’s specified line items in the
statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income and the statement of financial position can be 
disaggregated
  add requirements for how an entity should present 
subtotals in the statement(s) of profit and loss and 
other comprehensive income and the statement of 
financial position
  clarify that entities have flexibility as to the order in
which they present the notes, but also emphasise that 
understandability and comparability should be 
considered by an entity when deciding that order 
remove potentially unhelpful guidance in AASB 101 
for identifying a significant accounting policy

AASB 2015-8 amends the mandatory application date of 
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers so 
that AASB 15 is required to be applied for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 
instead of 1 January 2017.  It also defers the 
consequential amendments that were originally set out in 
AASB 2014-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting 
Standards arising from AASB 15.
AASB 2015-9 inserts scope paragraphs into AASB 8 
Operating Segments and AASB 133 Earnings per Share 
in place of application paragraph text in AASB 1057. 
In July and August 2015, the AASB reissued AASB 8, 
AASB 133 and most of the Australian Accounting 
Standards that incorporate IFRSs to make editorial 
changes.  The application paragraphs in the previous 
versions of AASB 8 and AASB 133 covered scope 
paragraphs that appear separately in the corresponding 
IFRS 8 and IAS 33.  In moving those application 
paragraphs to AASB 1057 when AASB 8 and AASB 133 
were reissued in August, the AASB inadvertently deleted 
the scope details from AASB 8 and AASB 133.  This 
amending Standard puts the scope details into those 
Standards, and removes the related text from 
AASB 1057.  There is no change to the requirements or 
the applicability of AASB 8 and AASB 133.
This Standard defers the mandatory application date of 
amendments to AASB 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements and AASB 128 Investments in Associates 
and Joint Ventures that were originally made in AASB 
2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting 
Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between an 
Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture so that the 
amendments are required to be applied for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 
instead of 1 January 2016.

2.  Determine whether a company is a principal or
an agent in a transaction (by clarifying how to 
apply the control principle);
3.  Determine whether a licence transfers to a 
customer at a point in time or over time (by 
clarifying when a company’s activities 
significantly affect the intellectual property to 
which the customer has rights).
The amendments also create two (2) additional practical 
expedients available for use when implementing IFRS 15:
1.  For contracts that have been modified before 
the beginning of the earliest period presented, 
the amendments allow companies to use 
hindsight when identifying the performance 
obligations, determining the transaction price, 
and allocating the transaction price to the 
satisfied and unsatisfied performance 
obligations.
2.  Companies applying the full retrospective 
method are permitted to ignore contracts 
already complete at the beginning of the 
earliest period presented.
The AASB is expected to publish the equivalent 
Australian amendments in quarter 2 of 2016.

(u)       Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision makers. The chief operation decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.
(v)       Trade Receivables
Trade Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement 
within 30 days. They are presented as current assets unless collection is not expected for more than 12 months 
after the reporting date.
(w)  Reserves
Reserves represent the share option reserve. This reserve records items recognised as expenses on valuation 
of employee share options and rights.

Key estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
judgments. These estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience 
and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group and that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by 
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below:
(i) Estimated impairment
The Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group that may 
lead to impairment of assets. Where an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
determined.
(ii) Exploration and evaluation
The Group policy for exploration and evaluation is discussed in note 1 (s). The application of this policy requires 
management to make certain assumptions as to future events and circumstances. Any such estimates and 
assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after having capitalised exploration and 
evaluation expenditure, management concludes that the capitalised expenditure is unlikely to be recovered by 
future sale or exploration, then the relevant capitalised amount will be written off through the statement of profit 
or loss. The related carrying amounts are disclosed in note 3.

Utilised Tax losses through Exploration Development and Incentive Scheme
A deferred tax asset (DTA) has not been recognised in respect of temporary differences as they do not meet the 
recognition criteria per AASB 112 Income Taxes. A DTA has not been recognised in respect of tax losses as realisation 
of the benefit is not regarded as probable.
The Group has unrecognised assessed losses of $6,696,701 (2015: $9,161,569) that are available indefinitely for offset 
against future taxable profits of the Group.
The tax rates applicable to each potential tax benefit are as follows:  
Timing differences - 30%;  
Tax losses - 30%.

5  Operating Segments
Segment information
Identification of reportable segments
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board 
of Directors (chief operating decision makers) in assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources.
The Group is managed primarily on the basis of geographical area of interest as the diversifications of the Group’s 
operations inherently have notably different risk profiles and performance assessment criteria. Operating segments are 
therefore determined on the same basis.
Reportable segments disclosed are based on aggregating operating segments where the segments are considered to 
have similar economic characteristics and are also similar with respect to the following: 
 
 

geographical location; and 
any external regulatory requirements.
Basis of accounting for purposes of reporting by operating segments
(a)       Accounting policies adopted
Unless stated below, all amounts reported to the Board of Directors, being the chief operating decision maker with 
respect to operating segments, are determined in accordance with accounting policies that are consistent to those 
adopted in the annual financial statements of Tychean Resources Ltd

The carrying value of trade receivables is considered a reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short-term 
nature of the balances.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable in the financial 
statements.
As at 30 June 2016 there were no material trade and other receivables that were considered to be past due or impaired 
(2015: Nil).

The recoverability of the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful 
development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas of interest.
The impairment of the exploration assets in 2015/2016 relates predominantly to the impairment within the Spargoville 
and Valley Floor Areas of Interest. An agreement was entered into to dispose of its interest in the Spargoville Project to 
a third party. Tenements with the Valley Floor Area of Interest were surrendered within the 2015/2016 year.

Objectives, policies and processes
Specific information regarding the mitigation of each financial risk to which the Group is exposed is provided below.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become 
due. The Group maintains cash to meet its liquidity requirements for up to 30-day periods.
The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring long-term financial liabilities as well as cash-outflows due 
in day-to-day business.
Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis, as well as on the basis 
of a rolling 30-day projection. Long-term liquidity needs for a 180-day and a 360-day period are identified monthly.
At the reporting date, these reports indicate that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its 
obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.
The Group liabilities have contractual maturities which are summarised below:
Not later than 1 month

All of the Group transactions are carried out in Australian Dollars, therefore the Group is not exposed to foreign 
exchange risk.
(ii) Cash flow interest rate sensitivity
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net result for the year and equity to a reasonably possible change in 
interest rates of +2.00% and -2.00% (2015: +2.00%/-2.00%), with effect from the beginning of the year. These changes 
are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.

Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the 
Group.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions, as well as credit exposure to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables and 
committed transactions.
Management considers that all the financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review 
are of good credit quality, including those that are past due.
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short-term financial assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties 
are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
Net fair values
Fair value estimation
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are presented in the following table and can be compared to 
their carrying values as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position. Fair values are those amounts at 
which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length 
transaction.
Fair values derived may be based on information that is estimated or subject to judgement, where changes in 
assumptions may have a material impact on the amounts estimated. Areas of judgement and the assumptions have 
been detailed below. Where possible, valuation information used to calculate fair value is extracted from the market, 
with more reliable information available from markets that are actively traded.

28   Going concern
The financial report has been prepared on the basis of going concern.
The cash flow projections of the Group indicate that it will require positive cash flows from additional capital or sale of 
assets for continued operations. The Group incurred a loss of $3,677,163. The Group’s cash balance at 30 June 2016 
was $288,331.
The Group's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent on obtaining additional capital and/or sale of assets. If 
additional capital is not obtained or assets not sold, the going concern basis may not be appropriate, with the result that 
the consolidated entity may have to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities, other than in the ordinary course of 
business and in amounts different from those stated in the financial report. No allowance for such circumstances has 
been made in the financial report.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF TYCHEAN RESOURCES LIMITED
Report on the financial report 
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Tychean Resources Limited (the 
“Company”), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 
2016, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, 
notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information 
and the directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the Company and the entities 
it controlled at the year’s end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that 
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Corporations Act 2001. The Directors’ responsibility also includes such internal control as the 
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true 
and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The 
Directors also state, in the notes to the financial report, in accordance with Accounting Standard 
AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, the financial statements comply with 
International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require 
us to comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial report is free from 
material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the 
Company’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion.
Independence 
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001.
Auditor’s opinion 
In our opinion:
a
b
the financial report of Tychean Resources Limited is in accordance with the Corporations 
Act 2001, including:
i
ii
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 
2016 and of its performance for the year ended on that date; and
complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 
2001; and
the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Material uncertainty regarding continuation as a going concern 
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 28 in the financial report which 
indicates that the consolidated entity incurred a net loss of $3,677,163 during the year ended 30 
June 2016 and, as of that date, had cash and cash equivalents of $288,331. These conditions, 
along with other matters as set forth in Note 28, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty 
which may cast significant doubt about the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and therefore, the consolidated entity may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its 
liabilities in the normal course of business, and at the amounts stated in the financial report.
3
Report on the remuneration report  
We have audited the remuneration report included in the directors’ report for the year ended 30 
June 2016. The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation 
of the remuneration report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on the remuneration report, based on our audit conducted 
in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.
Auditor’s opinion on the remuneration report 
In our opinion, the remuneration report of Tychean Resources Limited for the year ended 
30 June 2016, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.
