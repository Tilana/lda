<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/36, the Human Rights Council established the Expert Mechanism 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a subsidiary body to assist the Council in the 
implementation of its mandate by providing it with thematic expertise on the rights of 
indigenous peoples, as requested by it. In the resolution, the Council decided that the 
thematic expertise would focus mainly on studies and research-based advice and the 
mechanism could suggest proposals to it for its consideration and approval. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Adoption of studies, advice, reports and proposals 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Expert Mechanism adopted its study and advice on access to justice in the 
promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/2); its 
report on the summary of responses to the questionnaire seeking the views of States and 
indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/3); and the proposals set out below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Adoption of the study and advice on access to justice in the promotion 
and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p> (a) Refers to paragraph 7 of Human Rights Council resolution 21/24, in which 
the Council requested the Expert Mechanism to prepare a study on access to justice in the 
promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, and to present it to the 
Human Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session; 
</p>
<p> (b) Adopts the study and advice on access to justice in the promotion and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/2); 
 (c) Authorizes the Chairperson-Rapporteur, in consultation with the other 
members of the Expert Mechanism, to make the necessary revisions to the study in the light 
of discussions carried out at its sixth session<b> </b>and to submit the final study to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Adoption of the report on the summary of responses to the 
questionnaire seeking the views of States and indigenous peoples on 
best practices with regard to possible appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies in order to attain the goals of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Refers to paragraph 8 of Human Rights Council resolution 21/24, in which 
the Council requested the Expert Mechanism to continue to undertake, with the assistance 
of the Office of the High Commissioner, the questionnaire seeking the views of States and 
indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples; </p>


<p>(b) Adopts the report on the summary of responses to the questionnaire seeking 
the views of States and indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate 
measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/3); 
</p>
<p>(c) Authorizes the Chairperson-Rapporteur, in consultation with the other 
members of the Expert Mechanism, to make the necessary revisions to the report in the 
light of discussions during its sixth<b> </b>session<b> </b>and to submit the report to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-fourth session. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Proposals 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Proposal 1: Continuation of the access to justice study 
</b>5. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples proposes that Human 
Rights Council authorize the Expert Mechanism to continue its study on access to justice in 
the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, with a focus on restorative 
justice and indigenous juridical systems, particularly as they relate to achieving peace and 
reconciliation. This would include an examination of access to justice related to indigenous 
women, children, youth and persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 2: World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  
</b></p>
<p>6. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Refers to General Assembly resolution 65/198, wherein the General 
Assembly decided to organize a high-level plenary meeting in 2014, to be known as the 
World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, in order to share perspectives and best practices 
on the realization of the rights of indigenous peoples, including the objectives of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; 
</p>
<p>(b) Proposes that the Human Rights Council consider the themes identified in the 
Alta Outcome Document (A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/CRP.2) as the themes adopted for the 
World Conference; 
</p>
<p>(c) Proposes that the Human Rights Council support the consideration of the 
Alta Outcome Document in the drafting of the final outcome document of the World 
Conference;  
</p>
<p>(d) Proposes that the Human Rights Council recommend to the President of the 
sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly that the practice of appointing a State 
representative and an indigenous peoples&#8217; representative to conduct informal consultations 
be continued. The Expert Mechanism thanks the Government of Mexico and the Sami 
Parliament for their involvement to date as co-facilitators in this regard in the preparations 
for the World Conference;   
</p>
<p>(e) Proposes that the Human Rights Council support increased financial, 
technical and political support for the participation of indigenous peoples in the World 
Conference. This would include urging States that have not yet provided financial support 
for indigenous preparatory activities to do so as a matter of urgency. Such preparatory 
activities include local and national activities aimed at raising the understanding of the 
issues, rights and processes of indigenous peoples leading up to the World Conference, and 
diverse forms of participation by indigenous peoples, through video for example. 
Furthermore, related documentation should be made available in formats accessible to 
indigenous peoples with disabilities, as proposed in the Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines (WCAG);  </p>


<p>(f) Proposes that the Human Rights Council follow up on its recommendation 
that the studies and advice of the Expert Mechanism be considered in the process leading 
up to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.  This would include drawing on the 
compilation of recommendations, conclusions and advice from studies completed by the 
Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/CRP.1);   
</p>
<p>(g) Proposes that the Human Rights Council support the equal participation of 
the three United Nations mechanisms on indigenous peoples1 in the World Conference, as 
well as in its preparatory and follow-up processes;  
</p>
<p>(h) Proposes that the Human Rights Council support the full and effective 
participation of indigenous peoples, including traditional indigenous Governments, 
indigenous parliaments, assemblies and councils, in the World Conference. 
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 3: Implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Proposes that the Human Rights Council urge States and indigenous peoples 
to report on the measures taken to implement the rights enshrined in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, through the continuation of the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s questionnaire survey; 
</p>
<p>(b) Further proposes that the Human Rights Council request States to establish, 
with the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples, independent mechanisms to 
oversee and promote the implementation of the rights contained in the Declaration, and to 
ensure that these mechanisms are mandated to oversee the implementation of 
recommendations made by the human rights treaties bodies, the Human Rights Council&#8217;s 
special procedures, the universal periodic review and other mechanisms related to the rights 
of indigenous peoples. Such mechanisms should cooperate closely with regional and 
national human rights institutions.   
</p>
<p>8. Referring to Proposal 3 on strengthening indigenous peoples&#8217; participatory rights at 
the United Nations, contained in the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s report on its fourth session 
(A/HRC/18/43) and acknowledging the efforts taken to date in that regard, including the 
Secretary General&#8217;s report on ways and means of promoting participation at the United 
Nations of indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives on issues affecting them (A/HRC/21/24), as 
referenced in Human Rights Council resolution 21/24, the Expert Mechanism reiterates its 
proposal whereby it: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;recognizes that the United Nations consultative arrangements for non-State entities 
can prevent indigenous peoples&#8217; governance bodies and institutions, including 
traditional indigenous Governments, indigenous parliaments, assemblies and 
councils, from participating in decision-making processes at the United Nations, as 
they are not always organized as non-governmental organizations; [and] proposes 
that the Human Rights Council encourage the General Assembly to adopt, as a 
matter of urgency, appropriate permanent measures to ensure that indigenous 
peoples&#8217; governance bodies and institutions, including traditional indigenous 
Governments, indigenous parliaments, assemblies and councils, are able to 
participate at the United Nations as observers with, at a minimum, the same 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
  The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. </p>


<p>participatory rights as non-governmental organizations in consultative status with 
the Economic and Social Council.&#8221;2   
</p>
<p>9.  The Expert Mechanism proposes that the Human Rights Council review the 
language and terminology used in United Nations documents pertaining to the rights of 
indigenous peoples with a view to ensuring that they reflect the terminology contained in 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In particular, the 
Expert Mechanism calls upon the Human Rights Council to propose that the General 
Assembly amend the title of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations 
and rename it the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples. It also calls upon 
the United Nations and other international organizations to review their spelling rules with 
a view to using capital letters in spelling the term &#8220;Indigenous Peoples.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 4: Post-2015 Development Agenda 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples proposes that the 
Human Rights Council support the Expert Mechanism and representatives of indigenous 
peoples in their efforts to ensure that the rights of Indigenous peoples are firmly 
incorporated in the Post-2015 Development Agenda, including the participation of the 
Expert Mechanism in related activities.  
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 5: Universal periodic review (UPR) 
</b>11. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples proposes that the 
Human Rights Council and Member States draw increasingly on the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the thematic work of the Expert 
Mechanism in the universal periodic review (UPR) process, including through references to 
the Declaration, studies and advice in recommendations. The Expert Mechanism also 
proposes that, in future UPR cycles, the Declaration be explicitly included in the list of 
standards on which the UPR process is based.    
</p>
<p><b> III. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Attendance

</p><p>17. Two conference room papers were introduced during the session: the compilation of 
recommendations, conclusions and advice from studies completed by the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/CRP.1) and the 
Alta Outcome Document of the Global Indigenous Preparatory Conference for the United 
Nations high-level plenary to be known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, 
held from 10 to 12 June (A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/CRP.2). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Chairperson of the Expert Mechanism, International Chief Wilton Littlechild, 
opened the sixth session of the Expert Mechanism and introduced the Director of the 
Research and Right to Development Division, Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Marcia V. J. Kran, and the President of the 
Human Rights Council, Ambassador Remigiusz Achilles Henczel, who made the opening 
remarks. 
</p>
<p>19. Ms. Kran highlighted the importance of the thematic study on access to justice by 
indigenous peoples and noted the challenges faced by indigenous peoples. She also 
emphasized that the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples must be built on genuine and trusting partnerships between States and 
indigenous peoples. She underlined the importance of working together towards action-
oriented results of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples (to be held in 2014) in 
order to encourage concrete measures to improve the implementation of the Declaration, for 
example through increased implementation action plans and strategies at national level. Ms. 
Kran also commented on the ways in which OHCHR assists in the implementation of the 
rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>20. In his opening statement, the President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador 
Remigiusz Achilles Henczel, noted that the studies and advice of the Expert Mechanism 
were well received by the Human Rights Council and have positively contributed to the 
efforts to further the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. He also noted that the 
Council attached high importance to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. Ambassador Henczel emphasized that the Council has continuously 
called for the participation of indigenous peoples in the preparations for the World 
Conference and for the studies and advice of the Expert Mechanism to be considered in the 
preparatory process leading up to the World Conference.  </p>


<p>21. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples noted the key role the 
Expert Mechanism has played in helping to make the Declaration operational. He 
welcomed the ongoing collaboration between the United Nations mechanisms on 
indigenous peoples and called for continued coordination, especially in the development of 
proposed joint guidelines or principles on key issues affecting indigenous peoples. He 
emphasized the need to focus more attention on the issue of access to justice by indigenous 
peoples and encouraged States to recognize indigenous customary justice systems without 
rigid jurisdictional boundaries.    
</p><p>22. The Chairperson of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues noted the 
coordination between the three United Nations mechanisms on indigenous peoples and 
emphasized the overarching goal of implementing the Declaration. He gave an overview of 
the recommendations and studies of the twelfth session of the Permanent Forum and 
welcomed the constructive dialogue with international financial institutions and multilateral 
development banks on the impact of their policies on the rights and livelihood of 
indigenous peoples. He reported on the recent creation of a caucus of indigenous persons 
with disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Election of officers 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Chairperson of the Expert Mechanism invited the members of the mechanism to 
nominate a Chairperson-Rapporteur and Vice-Chairperson for its sixth session. Ms. 
Lasimbang nominated International Chief Littlechild and Mr. Titus as Chairperson-
Rapporteur and Vice-Chairperson respectively; they were then appointed by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>24. The Chairperson-Rapporteur, International Chief Littlechild, thanked the members 
of the Expert Mechanism for electing him, and welcomed the new members of the 
mechanism, Messrs. Deterville and Tsykarev. 
</p>
<p>25. The Chairperson-Rapporteur highlighted that the Declaration provides the 
foundational framework for the attainment of the human rights of indigenous peoples and 
informs every aspect of the mechanism&#8217;s work. He noted the valuable contributions of the 
participants of the sixth session to the work of the mechanism. The Chairperson-Rapporteur 
emphasized the importance of sessions such as this one in providing collaborative and 
participatory space for dialogue between States, indigenous peoples and other stakeholders 
and in this way contributing to the full realization of the rights of indigenous peoples as 
enshrined in the Declaration.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Expert Mechanism adopted the agenda and the programme of work of its sixth 
session.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. World Conference on Indigenous Peoples 
</b>27. The Chairperson-Rapporteur presented the compilation of recommendations, 
conclusions and advice from studies completed by the mechanism 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/CRP.1) in preparation for the World Conference on Indigenous 
Peoples, and noted that it was a work in progress. The Alta Outcome Document 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/CRP.2) was introduced for the first time as an official United 
Nations document, and was welcomed and encouraged by many participants.   </p>


<p>28. Mr. Tsykarev thanked the Sami Parliament and the Government of Norway for 
hosting and providing financial support for the Global Indigenous Preparatory Conference, 
which was held in Alta, Norway. He highlighted that the sixth session of the Expert 
Mechanism provided the first opportunity to consider further the Alta Outcome Document, 
which outlines four themes proposed for discussion at the World Conference on Indigenous 
Peoples. He emphasized that the Expert Mechanism welcomed the opportunity to initiate 
global consultations on the formulation of the outcome of the World Conference. Mr. 
Tsykarev further noted that the seventh session of the Expert Mechanism might be the last 
opportunity for a global dialogue on the World Conference prior to September 2014.     
</p>
<p>29. Mr. Tsykarev noted that the Expert Mechanism is committed to participating in 
further preparatory meetings in Mexico and New York, as well as coordinating its work 
with other United Nations bodies and mechanisms, including the Human Rights Council.  
He underscored that the mechanism&#8217;s studies and advice inform the Alta Outcome 
Document and the preparatory process provides an opportunity for greater analysis and 
monitoring of the use of such studies and advice by States, indigenous peoples and the 
United Nations system, including the opportunity to ensure national legislation is consistent 
with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>30. Mr. Tsykarev noted that 2014 will also mark the end of the Second International 
Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous Peoples and called for the establishment of a Third 
International Decade.   
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, James Anaya, 
considered how the three United Nations mechanisms on indigenous peoples could 
contribute to the preparations for the World Conference and to the event itself.  He 
recognized that the Alta Outcome Document is an important normative instrument and plan 
of action and further noted that the outcome document provides an important overview of 
the issues that are of central concern to indigenous peoples and adds to the understanding of 
the priorities of indigenous peoples, both in terms of the content of the rights and how those 
rights might be protected. He also encouraged other actors, including the United Nations 
system, indigenous peoples, civil society and the private sector, to apply the Alta Outcome 
Document. 
</p>
<p>32. The Chairperson of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Paul Kanyinke 
Sena, outlined the forum&#8217;s recommendations relating to the World Conference, contained in 
the report of its twelfth session. He noted the enhanced cooperation with the Special 
Rapporteur and the Expert Mechanism, especially in the preparatory process leading up to 
the World Conference, and considered ways of enhancing the United Nations mechanisms 
on indigenous peoples going forward as part of the World Conference.   
</p>
<p>33. The Co-Chair of the Indigenous Global Coordinating Group, Ghazali Ohorella, gave 
an overview of the participation of indigenous peoples leading up to the Global Indigenous 
Preparatory Conference held in Alta, Norway, and acknowledged the contributions of the 
members of the Expert Mechanism, whose expertise assisted in building consensus during 
the meeting. He highlighted key areas of the Alta Outcome Document, including the four 
proposed themes, and made recommendations to the Expert Mechanism. Mr. Ohorella 
recommended that the themes set out in the Alta Outcome Document be adopted as the 
themes for the World Conference; that the Alta Outcome Document be used as the basis for 
the final outcome document of the World Conference; that the Expert Mechanism 
recommend to the President of the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly that a State 
representative and an indigenous peoples&#8217; representative be appointed to conduct informal 
consultations; and that the Expert Mechanism urge States which have not yet done so to 
financially support indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in the World Conference, including in 
the preparatory activities.   </p>


<p>34.  The Chairperson-Rapporteur referred to the work completed by the Expert 
Mechanism to date, in terms of how it supports the Alta Outcome Document, which, in 
turn, builds on the Declaration. He outlined, as an example, the way in which the Expert 
Mechanism and others can effectively contribute to the advancement of the human rights of 
indigenous peoples through collaboration leading up to the World Conference. 
</p>
<p>35.  Participants expressed support for the Alta Outcome Document and the 
recommendations of the Indigenous Global Coordinating Group and called upon States to 
engage indigenous peoples in constructive dialogue at the national level. Several 
indigenous people&#8217;s representatives made recommendations concerning the need for the 
full, effective and equal participation and consultation of indigenous peoples through all 
stages of the process, including in the development of the action-oriented outcome 
document of the World Conference. Participants also emphasized the need to ensure the 
equal participation of indigenous women, youth and persons with disabilities. Many 
participants voiced the importance of ensuring the availability of sufficient financial 
resources to enable such participation and recommended different forms of participation, 
including webcasting. Numerous States acknowledged the Alta Outcome Document, noting 
that it would be considered in the preparation for the World Conference.  
</p>
<p>36. Ms. Lasimbang emphasized the need to explore technical, financial and political 
support to facilitate the participation of indigenous peoples in the World Conference and 
urged that local and national activities to be undertaken with the aim of raising awareness 
and fostering understanding of the issues of indigenous peoples. Such activities should 
focus on the themes set out in the Alta Outcome Document. Mr. Deterville also highlighted 
that the Alta Outcome Document has been introduced as an official document of the sixth 
session of the Expert Mechanism.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Follow-up to thematic studies and advice 
</b></p>
<p>37. Mr. Titus introduced the agenda item on the follow-up to thematic studies and 
advice, underscoring that the mechanism&#8217;s studies constitute an authoritative interpretation 
of the human rights of indigenous peoples. He added that the studies and advice are 
grounded in binding international human rights norms as applied to indigenous peoples, 
including the Declaration. He noted the direct relationship between the right of self-
determination and the full enjoyment of the rights of indigenous peoples.  
</p><p>38. The Expert Mechanism heard how States, indigenous peoples, national human rights 
institutions and other stakeholders have used the mechanism&#8217;s studies and advice to further 
the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, more specifically under 
four thematic areas: indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education; languages and culture; the right 
to participate in decision-making; and the right to participate in decision-making with a 
focus on extractive industries. Participants shared good practices, lessons learned and 
challenges to achieving the rights of indigenous peoples in these thematic areas. 
Interventions highlighted, inter alia, the role of United Nations agencies in disseminating 
the mechanism&#8217;s studies and advice at the country level and the importance of training 
government officials on the rights of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>39. Participants referred to the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s study on lessons learned and 
challenges to achieving the right to education of indigenous peoples and highlighted a range 
of concerns ranging from the importance of teaching indigenous histories and cultures in 
educational institutions and curricula to the protection of educational facilities in militarized 
indigenous territories. Some participants called for, inter alia, the establishment of adult 
educational institutions that focus on the maintenance, transmission and development of </p>


<p>indigenous knowledge and the ratification of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against Discrimination in Education.  
</p><p>40. Innovative ways were shared on how to ensure access to education for indigenous 
peoples with nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles. Participants also explained the work 
undertaken at the national level to develop a policy approach to indigenous education that is 
consistent with the guidance provided in the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s advice No. 1 (2009) on 
the right of indigenous peoples to education.  
</p>
<p>41. Participants also provided updates to the study on the role of languages and culture 
in the promotion and protection of the rights and identity of indigenous peoples, 
highlighting the importance of full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in 
programmes to preserve and revitalize indigenous cultures, and of overcoming challenges 
concerning language loss. Participants encouraged the media to cover indigenous issues 
based on the recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples, and welcomed the efforts of 
communities to increase their own access to information through the development of 
community-based media.  
</p>
<p>42. Some participants called for the ratification and implementation of international 
standards, including International Labour Office (ILO) Convention No. 169 concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, the UNESCO Convention on the 
Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, and the UNESCO 
Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.  Some participants also 
called for increased engagement of indigenous peoples and related mechanisms in the 
ongoing processes related to indigenous peoples in the World Intellectual Property 
Organization.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>43.  Concerning the mechanism&#8217;s study and advice on indigenous peoples and the right 
to participate in decision-making, some participants drew attention to the lack of 
implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples in the context of the UNESCO 
Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, 
specifically on issues such as free, prior and informed consent, and encouraged the United 
Nations mechanisms on indigenous peoples to take an active monitoring role in this 
process.  
</p>
<p>44. In relation to the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s advice No. 2 (2011) on indigenous peoples 
and the right to participation in decision-making, some participants shared the good practice 
concerning participation of indigenous youth in decision-making through the establishment 
of Children and Youth Parliaments to support the development of future indigenous leaders 
and to promote electoral participation by indigenous youth. 
</p>
<p>45. Participants also referred to the mechanism&#8217;s follow-up report on indigenous 
peoples and the right to participate in decision-making, with a focus on extractive industries 
(A/HRC/21/55). Interventions highlighted the impact of extractive industries in the lives of 
indigenous peoples, including the negative effects on health, lands, the environment, 
cultures and livelihoods. Concerns were expressed more specifically about the negative 
effects on indigenous women and girls, and conflict between indigenous peoples and 
businesses.  
</p>
<p>46.  Some participants reaffirmed the need for States and extractive industries to 
implement the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in all judicial, 
administrative, legislative and policy processes in order to genuinely respect indigenous 
peoples&#8217; decision-making authority and power over their lives. Participants discussed the 
importance of regional and national dialogue with States, business enterprises, civil society 
organizations and indigenous peoples in order to promote understanding of the rights of 
indigenous peoples in the context of extractive industries. For example, participants </p>


<p>recommended that impact assessments should consider cultural impacts in addition to 
economic, environmental and social impacts.  
</p>
<p>47.  The Chairperson of the Permanent Forum referred positively to the World Bank&#8217;s 
Open Contracting initiative, which aims to ensure effective disclosure and participation of 
indigenous peoples in all public investment concerning extractive industries. He also noted 
the importance of ongoing collaboration between the Working Group on the issue of human 
rights and transitional corporations and other business enterprises, the Special Rapporteur 
on the rights of indigenous peoples, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the 
Expert Mechanism to promote the effective implementation of the Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous peoples in relation to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights (A/HRC/17/31, annex).3  He also highlighted the importance of indigenous peoples 
as entrepreneurs.   
</p>
<p>48. Ms. Lasimbang reported on the South-East Asia Sub-regional Meeting on Extractive 
Industries and Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Rights to Land and Natural Resources, organized by the 
United Nations Indigenous Peoples Partnership (UNIPP) in June 2013 in Thailand, where 
she had the opportunity to present the follow-up report and advice on indigenous peoples 
and the right to participate in decision-making, with a focus on extractive industries 
(A/HRC/21/55). Ms. Lasimbang recommended that businesses ensure that their employees 
have an understanding of the rights of indigenous peoples, including the right to participate 
in decision-making. She called upon indigenous peoples to continue to play a positive role 
by asserting their human rights in relation to extractive industries, with an emphasis on 
forming equal partnerships with States and business enterprises in order to engage in 
sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>49. The Chairperson-Rapporteur referred to the study on the right to education and 
updated participants on a national development concerning the implementation of this right, 
whereby a task force was created and, as a result, work is currently under way on the 
development of an Education Act. He called for the implementation of article 19 of the 
Declaration, referred to by said task force, which requires States and indigenous peoples to 
work together as partners.   
</p>
<p>50. The Chairperson-Rapporteur emphasized that the right to culture is one of the 
fundamental pillars of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and referred to a 
consultation organized by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in association 
with the University of Ulster and in cooperation with the United Nations Special 
Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, in June 2013. The consultation examined how 
cultures in divided and post-conflict societies are reflected in museums, memorials and in 
history textbooks. He welcomed the reference to the mechanism&#8217;s advice No. 3 (2012) on 
indigenous peoples&#8217; languages and cultures for consideration in the outcome document.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Chairperson-Rapporteur referred to the Global Compact work on guidelines 
focusing on free, prior and informed consent. He also complimented the United Nations 
Children Fund (UNICEF) and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues on the 
publication of the adolescent-friendly version of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples.

<p><b> VI. Study on access to justice in the promotion and protection of 
the rights of indigenous peoples  
</b></p>
<p>52. In its resolution 21/24, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism 
to prepare a study on access to justice in the promotion and protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples, and to present it to the Council at its twenty-fourth session. 
Accordingly, the Expert Mechanism prepared a study on this theme 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2012/2).  In order to inform the study, the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Institute for the Study of Human Rights, 
Columbia University, and the International Centre for Transitional Justice co-organized an 
Expert Seminar on Access to Justice for Indigenous Peoples, including Truth and 
Reconciliation Processes. The seminar was held at Columbia University, New York, from 
27 February to 1 March 2013. 
</p>
<p>53. Mr. Titus introduced the panel discussion on the recommendations of the Expert 
Seminar on Access to Justice for Indigenous Peoples, including Truth and Reconciliation 
Processes and welcomed the panellists: International Chief Wilton Littlechild, Chairperson 
of the Expert Mechanism; Celeste McKay, Technical Analyst for International Chief 
Wilton Littlechild; Ellen Walker, International Disability Alliance, and June Lorenzo, 
Indigenous World Association and Laguna Acoma Coalition for a Safe Environment.  
</p>
<p>54. International Chief Littlechild began by focusing on the recommendations related to 
the truth and reconciliation processes set out in the study, which were informed by the 
presentations at the Expert Seminar. This included the full and effective involvement of 
indigenous peoples at all stages and the requirement that the processes be reflective of the 
cultures and values of indigenous peoples. It was also recommended that the Declaration on 
the Right of Indigenous Peoples be applied to the work of truth commissions and that truth 
commissions address historical injustices experienced by indigenous peoples and the 
contemporary effects of continued human rights violations, including against the right to 
self-determination.  
</p>
<p>55. International Chief Littlechild outlined a national example, the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission of Canada. He discussed the history of residential school 
systems in Canada, including the related policies and laws, as well as the impact on the 
lives of indigenous peoples, including thousands of deaths of children who attended the 
residential schools. He outlined the mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
of Canada &#8211; a court-ordered mandate arising from the largest class-action lawsuit in 
Canadian legal history. The mandate includes statement gathering; conducting research; 
establishing a National Research Centre to create an accurate and public historical record of 
the residential schools; issuing a public report with recommendations; and guiding and 
inspiring a process of healing and reconciliation within indigenous families and 
communities and between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in the country.  
</p>
<p>56. Ms. Walker discussed access to justice from the perspective of indigenous peoples 
with disabilities. She gave a brief overview of the study on the situation of indigenous 
persons with disabilities, with a particular focus on challenges faced with regard to the full 
enjoyment of human rights and inclusion in development (E/C.19/2013/6), prepared by the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Ms. Walker referred to the recommendations in the 
Expert Mechanism&#8217;s study on access to justice that relate specifically to indigenous persons 
with disabilities. These include methodologies to collect data on indigenous persons in 
detention, disaggregated by disability, and increasing the accessibility of the justice system.  
</p><p>57. Ms. Walker requested that the Expert Mechanism consider additional 
recommendations, including, inter alia, ensuring the sensitivity and accessibility of 
indigenous and State justice systems (i.e. the availability of sign language, accessible </p>


<p>premises and information in alternative formats), and requested that the Expert Mechanism 
and the Permanent Forum follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and 
ensure that websites and reports are accessible, including by posting documents in 
Microsoft Word.   
</p>
<p>58. Ms. McKay informed participants about the discussion on women, youth and 
children during the Expert Seminar, highlighting this discussion within the context of the 
study and advice on access to justice. She welcomed further dialogue on the topic with 
participants in this session, noting statements related to sexual and reproductive rights of 
indigenous women in custody.   
</p>
<p>59. Ms. McKay highlighted the barriers to access to justice for indigenous women, 
youth and children, which include multiple discrimination, structural violence, high rates of 
incarceration and poverty, and the need to involve youth in truth and reconciliation 
commissions. Remedies highlighted included taking measures aimed at ensuring equality 
before the law. Concrete examples of this include gender-sensitization training of justice 
officers (in this case, with regard to indigenous women&#8217;s issues in particular), increased 
appointment of women to the judiciary, and legal reforms in areas where access to legal 
mechanisms is formally prohibited for women. She urged States to work in partnership, 
especially with indigenous women, to achieve equality before the law, particularly in the 
context of State and indigenous judicial systems.  
</p><p>60. Ms. Lorenzo highlighted the importance of understanding that access to justice is not 
only about righting past wrongs, but rather remedying current wrongs and preventing future 
injustices. She highlighted that the peremptory norm of non-discrimination is key when 
addressing substantive and restorative justice. 
61. Citing the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s advice and study on access to justice, Ms. Lorenzo 
emphasized that indigenous peoples&#8217; understanding of access to justice is different from 
that of States, and stressed that this must, first of all, include business operations within 
indigenous territories. She noted that monetary settlements do not equate with justice for 
indigenous peoples and urged the Expert Mechanism to take note of the differences in 
defining &#8220;justice&#8221; by States, indigenous peoples and businesses.  
62. Ms. Lorenzo stressed that access to justice for indigenous peoples involves access to 
their cultures, territories, children, languages and ceremonies. She called for policies and 
laws that address access to justice in the future. 
63. Participants expressed concern about achieving access to justice from extractive 
industries, as well as country-specific concerns.   
</p>
<p>64. Ms. Lasimbang referred to commissions of inquiry and transitional justice processes 
as one modality for increasing access to justice, underscoring that these are particularly 
effective where indigenous peoples participate fully. She expressed the need for indigenous 
peoples&#8217; organizations to facilitate the participation of indigenous peoples.    
</p>
<p>65. Mr. Tsykarev highlighted the importance of recommendations of advice No. 5 to 
provide access to legal remedies for indigenous peoples and the continuing importance of 
access to justice in the work of the Expert Mechanism. An Ombudsman for the rights of 
indigenous peoples is a mechanism that could provide a powerful tool to increasing access 
to justice. He recommended that States and indigenous peoples encourage human rights 
organizations to advance the implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 22/6 on 
the protection of human rights defenders. Mr. Tsykarev recommended that continuing 
reference be made to the studies and advice of the Expert Mechanism and, in particular, that 
the studies and advice be referred to in the review and consideration of States under the 
universal periodic review and by the treaty bodies. </p>


<p>66. Mr. Deterville highlighted article 13 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, which recognizes the right of indigenous peoples to designate their own traditional 
names for communities and territories. The preamble of the Declaration highlights its 
purpose in addressing marginalization and abuse caused by colonialism. He recommended 
that the Human Rights Council permit indigenous peoples and nations to display their 
names during the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s sessions.    
</p>
<p>67. Concern about respect for national and international laws, including free, prior and 
informed consent of indigenous peoples, by extractive industries operating outside of the 
country in which they are registered was raised by some participants.  
</p>
<p>68. Some States requested the panellists to provide more information about examples of 
good practices. Ms. McKay highlighted the efforts to utilize alternative justice systems to 
address the particular needs of indigenous women as one example and referred participants 
to the plans of the Expert Mechanism and Columbia University to publish the proceedings 
of the Expert Seminar. 
</p>
<p>69. Specific issues relating to access to justice were raised by participants, including 
concerns regarding violence against indigenous women; police violence and forced removal 
from land. Barriers to access to justice identified by participants included lack of legal 
knowledge, legal services, and courts; unaffordable legal fees; procedural discrimination 
and lack of participation by indigenous peoples in policy development.   
</p>
<p>70. Some participants identified the need for the Expert Mechanism to further examine 
ways to improve access to justice through increased culturally sensitive communications. It 
was noted that in many parts of the world, the media continues to portray indigenous 
peoples in a racist manner.  
</p>
<p>71. One participant outlined the connection between reconciliation and the guarantee of 
non-recurrence as an essential element of justice. Also, it was noted that indigenous peoples 
need to define what restorative justice means in relation to previous and current violations 
with continuing impacts, and what form the processes to achieve justice in these cases 
should take. 
</p>
<p>72. Some participants underlined the importance of recognition of the legal status of 
indigenous peoples. Without such status, indigenous peoples are more vulnerable to loss of 
territory and are less likely to have access to redress and reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>73. Prior to opening the discussion on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, the Chairperson-Rapporteur invited Joenia Batista de Carvalho, 
member of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous 
Populations, to address the participants of the session. 
</p>
<p>74.  Ms. de Carvalho welcomed the 20 beneficiaries of the Voluntary Fund and 
emphasized its role in ensuring the participation of indigenous peoples in United Nations 
meetings. She noted that since 2012, the Voluntary Fund has supported the participation of 
indigenous peoples in the sessions of the Permanent Forum, the Expert Mechanism, the 
Human Rights Council and the UPR process, as well as the Human Rights Committee, the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee 
Against Torture, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.  </p>


<p>75.  Ms. de Carvalho noted the expansion of the fund&#8217;s scope to support the 
participation of indigenous peoples in the World Conference, and expressed concern about 
the financial implications on the mandate of the Voluntary Fund without increased 
resources to support this addition. Ms. de Carvalho expressed gratitude to the contributors 
to the Voluntary Fund and called upon States to express their support and commitment to 
indigenous peoples worldwide by making contributions to the Voluntary Fund. 
</p>
<p>76.  Ms. Lasimbang recalled that the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 21/24, had 
requested the Expert Mechanism to continue to undertake, with the assistance of OHCHR, a 
questionnaire to seek the views of States and indigenous peoples on best practices with 
regard to possible appropriate measures and implementation strategies in order to attain the 
goals of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.   
</p>
<p>77.  Ms. Lasimbang welcomed the responses received from States and indigenous 
peoples to the questionnaire.4 She noted with concern that only 21 States and 17 indigenous 
peoples and indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations responded to the questionnaire. She 
recommended that alternative methods of data collection be considered to ensure the 
meaningful participation of indigenous peoples in future efforts.   
</p>
<p>78.  Ms. Lasimbang reviewed the submissions received from States and indigenous 
peoples and organizations and shared many specific examples of laws, policies and 
programmes towards implementation of the Declaration. She further noted that overall the 
tenor of some responses underscores the ongoing tension between States and indigenous 
peoples on the best approaches to achieving the goals of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>79.  Ms. Lasimbang also noted that, according to the results of the questionnaire, no 
State has yet passed explicit laws requiring the Declaration to be considered when devising 
new laws, policies or other measures relating to indigenous peoples and that lack of 
awareness of the Declaration remains one of the biggest challenges to implementing the 
rights of indigenous peoples. She highlighted that there was evidence to suggest that States 
sometimes perceive a conflict between the recognition and implementation of the rights 
contained in the Declaration and the principle of equality. She emphasized that such a 
perception can be overcome by applying an analysis of substantive equality, which may 
require treating indigenous peoples as distinct groups facing unique circumstances. 
</p>
<p>80.  Ms. Lasimbang explained that some of the best practices identified were 
partnerships between States and indigenous peoples, which facilitate the full and effective 
participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making. She noted that the responses to the 
questionnaire should provide inspiration to others in devising creative strategies to 
implement the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>81.  Ms Lasimbang noted that the responses from indigenous peoples and organizations 
were mainly focused on thematic issues and their activities were often limited due to 
financial resources and the lack of State willingness to cooperate. She also noted that only a 
few indigenous peoples who responded have strategies in place to implement the 
Declaration.  She highlighted that indigenous peoples and organizations had identified good 
practices that could include the development of various initiatives targeting national 
policies, laws and regulations to make them consistent with the Declaration.  This includes 
strengthening the links between United Nations mechanisms and indigenous peoples 
through proposing measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the 
Declaration.   
</p>
<p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>4
  See A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/3. </p>


<p>82.  Ms. Lasimbang asked the participants to provide information on whether the Expert 
Mechanism should continue with the questionnaire. Some participants recommended that 
the Council encourage States to work with indigenous peoples in completing the 
mechanism&#8217;s questionnaire in a substantive manner. The questionnaire survey seeks the 
view of States and indigenous peoples on best practices. Accessing a global scope of 
responses is useful in this regard.  
</p>
<p>83. Participants underlined the importance of the Declaration as an instrument for 
attaining the full realization of the human rights of indigenous peoples and acknowledged 
the role of the Expert Mechanism in helping to promote the effective implementation of the 
Declaration. Participants also noted that a wide gap continues to exist between the 
implementation of the Declaration and its application on the ground. Some participants 
expressed regret that some States continue to deny the presence of indigenous peoples 
within their borders, and called for the Declaration to be included as one of the bases of the 
UPR.    
</p>
<p>84. Specifically, participants highlighted challenges concerning the rights of indigenous 
peoples to access to justice; issues related to the protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, 
territories and resources; the situation of human rights defenders and assassination of 
indigenous leaders; the impact of climate change; violence against indigenous women and 
their lack of representation in decision-making; and the marginalization of indigenous 
persons with disabilities. Some participants also stressed the importance of the role of the 
media in the promotion of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>85. Numerous participants and experts raised concerns about the militarization of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources. Participants also highlighted the impact 
of extractive industries and mega development projects in indigenous lands and encouraged 
stronger collaboration between the Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises and the three United Nations 
mechanisms on indigenous peoples to promote the effective implementation of the 
Declaration, including respecting the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous 
peoples and the provision of accessible grievance and redress mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>86. Participants emphasized that they continue to face challenges in exercising the right 
to self-determination and called for dialogue between States and indigenous peoples to 
identify and address the barriers to full implementation of the Declaration. Participants also 
encouraged the development of comprehensive national strategies that include 
constitutional, legislative and policy changes developed and implemented in partnership 
with indigenous peoples to attain the goals of the Declaration. Participants also encouraged 
States to apply a human rights-based approach with regard to the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>87. Participants noted that the Declaration is an essential tool in the protection and 
promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples and that implementation of the Declaration 
remains a challenge and may require new laws. They also recommended that follow-up to 
the implementation of the Declaration should be completed in coordination with the United 
Nations system. Participants also recommended that the three United Nations mechanisms 
on indigenous peoples work in close collaboration with the human rights treaty bodies to 
ensure that clarity with regard to the status of indigenous peoples is secured and clearly 
articulated.  
</p>
<p>88. States highlighted their efforts to find new ways of translating the rights set out in 
the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into concrete benefits for indigenous 
peoples. They shared many examples of the programmes and laws developed to implement 
the Declaration. States also highlighted public policies that promote the participation, 
consultation, self-governance, economic development and entrepreneurship of indigenous 
peoples; indigenous cultures; and the overall improvement of living standards of indigenous </p>


<p>peoples. States also highlighted the situation of indigenous women and girls and their 
efforts to ensure the effective participation of women and girls in decision-making 
processes. Some States noted the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s role in providing technical advice in 
the creation of specialized mechanisms to realize the rights enshrined in the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>89. National human rights institutions (NHRIs) highlighted their efforts to increase 
awareness of the Declaration among indigenous communities, government agencies and 
indigenous peoples, especially through advocacy, complaint handling, educational 
activities, policy analysis and human rights&#8217; monitoring. NHRIs also noted their strategic 
role for forging better communication between the State and indigenous peoples, and 
advancing the standards contained in the Declaration. NHRIs highlighted their strategies to 
combat the increased marginalization of indigenous peoples with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>90. Mr. Tsykarev noted that the Declaration is widely acknowledged as containing a set 
of minimum standards for the rights of indigenous peoples and it should be used as an 
instrument to promote constructive dialogue between States and indigenous peoples, based 
on the recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to self-determination. He also highlighted 
the importance attached to the legal recognition of indigenous peoples as indigenous 
peoples, and to the development of strategies to preserve and revitalize indigenous 
languages using internationally recognized standards and methods. Mr. Tsykarev 
emphasized the need for policies that recognize and promote cross-border rights of 
indigenous peoples and for parliamentary attention to the implementation of the 
Declaration. In particular, he mentioned States&#8217; bias in implementing cultural rights to the 
exclusion of other rights. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Interactive dialogue with the United Nations mandated 
mechanisms on indigenous peoples and international, 
regional and national mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>91. Ms. Lasimbang, in her opening as the chairperson of the interactive dialogue, 
welcomed the panellists: International Chief Wilton Littlechild, Chairperson of the Expert 
Mechanism and Chairperson-Rapporteur of the session; James Anaya, Special Rapporteur 
on the rights of indigenous peoples; Paul Kanyinke Sena, Chairperson of the Permanent 
Forum on Indigenous Issues; Francisco Cali Tzay, member of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination; Rafendi Djamin, ASEAN Intergovernmental 
Commission for Human Rights; and Michael Gooda, Australian Human Rights 
Commission.  She expressed the hope that the interactive dialogue would prove useful to 
States, indigenous peoples and other participants, and that the discussion would highlight 
and inform the critical role of different actors in advancing the application of the rights 
enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>92. International Chief Littlechild discussed the implementation of the Declaration at the 
international and national levels. He explained that the Declaration is the normative 
framework for the work of the Expert Mechanism, including its studies and advice and 
emphasized that the mechanism&#8217;s studies are built on the foundational right of self-
determination.  
</p>
<p>93. Mr. Anaya underscored that the full implementation of the Declaration is a complex 
process that requires sustained efforts by a myriad of State and other actors. He highlighted 
that the Declaration calls upon States to play a central role in operationalizing it, including 
by adopting specific affirmative measures in relation to the various rights. He reminded 
participants that greater efforts are required by States to implement the standards of the 
Declaration and to harmonize existing laws policies and programmes with those standards.  </p>


<p>94. Mr. Anaya also emphasized that the Declaration specifically calls upon the United 
Nations system to promote respect for and the full application of the provisions of the 
Declaration, and welcomed initiatives within the various United Nations mechanisms and 
agencies to advance the rights of indigenous peoples. He also noted the importance of 
involvement by the private sector in implementing the Declaration. This is especially the 
case for business enterprises that develop or seek to develop natural resources on or 
affecting indigenous peoples&#8217; lands and territories. Mr. Anaya emphasized that the 
implementation of the Declaration should involve indigenous peoples and their authorities 
and organizations in a spirit of cooperation with States and other relevant actors.  
</p>
<p>95. Mr. Sena noted that the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has taken great care 
to integrate the United Nations Declaration into its recommendations. He noted with 
concern that the implementation of these recommendations has been impeded by a lack of 
resources, capacity and the non-binding nature of the recommendations of the Permanent 
Forum.  
</p>
<p>96. Mr. Sena welcomed the work of the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous 
Peoples&#8217; Issues and recognized the role of the Permanent Forum in mainstreaming 
indigenous peoples&#8217; issues within the United Nations system. Mr. Sena encouraged 
discussion on different approaches for promoting the implementation of the Declaration 
with the ultimate aim of promoting the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>97. Mr. Cali Tzay highlighted the participation of indigenous peoples in the making of 
the Declaration and recognized the need to promote its interpretation in harmony with other 
standards that concern the rights of indigenous peoples.  He highlighted that the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, when analysing a country report, pays 
attention to the implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples, particularly in relation 
to the scope of the Convention to combat racial discrimination. He also recalled the 
Committee&#8217;s general recommendation No. 23 (1997) on indigenous peoples, noting that 
although it predates the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it 
contains many elements that are covered in the Declaration, such as the rights of indigenous 
peoples to education, health, culture, language and spirituality.  
</p>
<p>98. Mr. Djamin commented on the complementary role of regional mechanisms and 
highlighted the importance of promoting a regional approach to address the rights of 
indigenous peoples. Mr. Djamin welcomed the recent adoption of the ASEAN Human 
Rights Declaration, which, although it does not specifically mention indigenous peoples, 
recognizes the rights of vulnerable and marginalized groups. Regarding the work of the 
ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission for Human Rights, Mr. Djamin noted that it is 
looking forward to seeking a common understanding about the specific needs of indigenous 
peoples in that region.  He also highlighted the efforts of ASEAN to close the gap of weak 
protection mechanisms and existing laws that have not been adequately implemented at the 
national level. 
</p>
<p>99. Mr. Gooda highlighted that NHRIs are an exceptional model for advancing the 
recognition and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. He emphasized the positive 
example of the Australian Human Rights Commission, which reports directly to Parliament 
on an annual basis. This practice serves as a means to ensure that the exercise and 
enjoyment of the human rights of indigenous peoples is promoted, advocated and advanced 
at every opportunity. He also noted that the Australian Human Rights Commission, in 
partnership with the Asia Pacific Forum and OHCHR, is producing a training toolkit for 
NHRIs that focuses on the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>100. Several participants sought the advice of the panel on how indigenous peoples can 
collaborate with United Nations mechanisms on indigenous peoples to influence an 
increased level of participation of indigenous peoples in future sessions. Participants also </p>


<p>discussed strategies to disseminate information that profiles the achievement of promoting 
the rights of indigenous peoples, which may encourage their greater engagement with 
mechanisms on indigenous peoples and the human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>101. Participants highlighted the importance of engaging other actors in the session of the 
Expert Mechanism, such as academics and the Working Group on the issue of human rights 
and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. This was supported by the 
panellists. Mr. Anaya expressed his full support for the need to invite academics to 
participate in the sessions of the Expert Mechanism, and expressed appreciation for the 
support received from his academic unit, the University of Arizona Law School, in meeting 
the demands of his mandate. The Chairperson-Rapporteur expressed his support for inviting 
the Working Group to future sessions, and recommended that the members of the Expert 
Mechanism also attend the Forum on Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>102. Several participants expressed concern for the lack of follow-up on the 
recommendations of human rights treaty bodies concerning indigenous peoples, and asked 
for advice on effective follow-up practices. The Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that 
indigenous peoples have a responsibility to call for the implementation of recommendations 
issued by the human rights treaty bodies, especially when they concern indigenous peoples.  
He highlighted that the most important call of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples is for indigenous peoples and States to work together. This can, in turn, ensure 
follow-up and implementation of the recommendations of the human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>103. The Chairperson of the Permanent Forum addressed participants&#8217; concern regarding 
the dissemination of information at the local level, and acknowledged the specific 
challenges experienced in Africa, Latin America and Asia.  He supported the view that the 
World Conference is an opportunity to address this gap. 
</p>
<p>104. In his concluding remarks on the dialogue, the Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled the 
Expert Mechanism&#8217;s compilation of recommendations, conclusions and advice 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2013/CRP.1) and supported the strong call for the implementation of the 
rights of indigenous peoples in the context of the World Conference. He noted that two 
themes of the Alta Outcome Document called for stronger implementation of the rights of 
indigenous peoples and referred to specific preambular and other paragraphs of the Alta 
Outcome Document.   
</p>
<p><b> IX. Proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</b>105. The Chairperson-Rapporteur invited observers to share their recommendations 
regarding the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s proposals to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>106. Participants recommended that the Expert Mechanism conduct studies on peace and 
security; violence against women and girls; the situation of indigenous human rights 
defenders; cultural heritage and sacred sites; climate change and the human rights of 
indigenous peoples; land, territories and resources; traditional livelihoods; the role of 
women as entrepreneurs; the preservation of indigenous cultures; indigenous governance; 
the rights of indigenous persons with disabilities; and the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>107. Participants also recommended that the Expert Mechanism continue to undertake its 
study on access to justice in the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples with a 
focus on challenges and barriers for access to justice for indigenous women, children, youth 
and persons with disabilities; peace, including in peace and conflict resolution processes; 
lands, territories and resources; indigenous peoples&#8217; understanding of restorative justice; 
non-repetition and non-recurrence; justice for historic human rights violations including 
those which have inter-generational and ongoing impacts; the role of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
traditional justice systems, authorities and institutions; and the role of treaties, agreements 
and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples.  </p>


<p>108. Participants also recommended further interactive dialogues, further involvement of 
the Expert Mechanism in the preparatory process for the World Conference on Indigenous 
Peoples, and engagement between the Expert Mechanism and the Working Group on the 
issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Adoption of reports, studies and proposals 
</b></p>
<p>109. At the last meeting of its sixth session, the Expert Mechanism adopted the study and 
advice on access to justice in the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples and the 
report on the summary of responses to the questionnaire seeking the views of States and 
indigenous peoples on best practices with regard to possible appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. All the proposals were adopted by consensus by the 
members of the Expert Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>110. The members of the Expert Mechanism also adopted a provisional agenda for the 
seventh session of the mechanism (see annex II). </p>
