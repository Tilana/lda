<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth session from 3 
to 14 October 2011. The review of the Syrian Arab Republic was held at the 9th meeting on 
7 October 2011. The delegation of Syria was headed by Mr. Faysal Mekdad, Vice-Minister 
for Foreign Affairs. At its 13th meeting held on 11 October 2011, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Syria. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Syria: Djibouti, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Singapore: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/SYR/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/SYR/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/SYR/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to the Syrian Arab Republic through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. In its opening statement, the Syrian Arab Republic affirmed its appreciation for the 
importance of the UPR process as a universal and non-selective mechanism, and expressed 
the hope for a constructive interactive dialogue. Syria had contributed to the development 
of the Human Rights Council mechanisms and hoped that the review would not become a 
tool to politicize the question of human rights.   
</p>
<p>6. The national report had been prepared through a collective institutional process, 
initiated by a decision of the Prime Minister, taken over a year in advance, to form a 
national committee headed by the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs and comprising 
representatives from different government entities as well as non-governmental 
organizations concerned with human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. Syria reiterated that it continued its efforts to strengthen human rights and build a 
democratic society in line with fundamental rule of law principles. It reaffirmed the 
universality of human rights, which did not belong to any single civilization or culture or 
religion. The principle of democracy also had to include democratic relations between 
countries, without the domination of the strong over the weak. 
</p>
<p>8. During the past seven months, Syria had experienced many threats and was 
subjected to a media war conducted through misinformation and lies. Syria was faced with 
the hegemony of the West, the United States of America and Israel, and was the target of </p>


<p>terrorist threats. For this reason, the law enforcement organs faced many challenges. The 
Government would submit to the High Commissioner for Human Rights a list of martyrs 
among the police and security officials, over 1,100 of whom had been killed by terrorists 
who received support from some neighbouring countries. These countries, whose actions 
violated the right to life, were the same countries that were holding conferences on human 
rights and democracy. 
</p>
<p>9. Syria noted that the killings were accompanied by incitement in the regional and 
international media, which provided instructions and directed these criminal activities. 
Billions of dollars had been smuggled into Syria in recent months and distributed among 
extremists, arms dealers, drug traffickers and criminal organizations, and pay TV channels 
were fabricating footage available to those paying the highest price. Syria asserted that it 
was in a position to provide the Human Rights Council with audio-visual evidence 
exposing the lies of these TV stations and their backers, and indicated that the Council 
procedures as explained by the Bureau did not allow for the viewing of a short video 
supporting the State&#8217;s assertion in this regard. Syria referred to numerous media stories 
about Zeinab El-Hosni, the girl who allegedly had been murdered by the security forces, 
but who in fact was alive and well and had given her testimony on Syrian television. 
</p>
<p>10. Syria was situated in an explosive region, as a result of colonialism and policies of 
occupation, and it had suffered from political, economic and social problems. While it 
could accept advice from some African, Asian and Latin American countries, the Western 
colonial powers had no right to give advice on human rights, especially after having killed 
over 50,000 Libyans only a short while ago, and a million Iraqis after the American 
invasion, as well as thousands in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and central Africa, without mentioning Abu 
Ghraib and Guantanamo. Western countries did not care about human rights, but only 
sought to secure their supply of oil and mineral resources. If they truly cared about human 
rights they would also care about the rights of the Palestinian people and not use their veto 
against them. 
</p>
<p>11. The President of Syria had undertaken a number of reform measures, including 
political reforms towards pluralism and democracy, by holding elections and granting 
freedom of the media. However, so-called humanitarian problems should not be used by the 
United Nations and the Human Rights Council as grounds for interference in Syrian affairs, 
which would only serve to justify aggression against Syria and plans for a Western and 
Israeli hegemony in the region. 
</p>
<p>12. The fact that Syria had received delegations from the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
demonstrated that it had nothing to hide. Syria was willing to benefit from any advice 
provided by true friends to make further progress in its socio-economic development, 
including in the area of human rights. The President had issued a decree providing for the 
freedom to establish parties, and progress had been made with the permits for over 15 new 
political parties. Local government elections would be held in December within the 
framework of the new Election Law, and parliamentary elections were planned for 
February, which would complete the reforms desired by the Syrian people. 
</p>
<p>13. Since the early stages of the recent events, the President had addressed their causes 
by issuing a number of decrees and decisions, including on the repeal of the Emergency 
Law and the abolition of the Supreme State Security Court, as well as three decrees on a 
general amnesty and a law on the right to peaceful demonstration. In addition, an 
independent judicial committee had been established to investigate the events and the 
circumstances which had led to the death of both civilians and military personnel. The door 
for dialogue had remained open throughout, with the aim of ensuring broad participation in 
the search for solutions to the political, economic and social problems. Within this 
framework, consultations had been held for a comprehensive national dialogue. However, </p>


<p>some of those people who had called for a national dialogue used this as a pretext to 
continue to commit acts of violence, including killings, and to fabricate false accusations 
against the security forces, as part of the media war against Syria. 
</p>
<p>14. The two resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council were based on such false 
accusations. These resolutions should be set aside, and the work of the Council be rectified 
to ensure truth, clarity and transparency. 
</p>
<p>15. Despite the difficulties which Syria was facing, the national committee had prepared 
a comprehensive report on the human rights situation in the State. The report also referred 
to provisions on human rights contained in the Constitution. Syria was currently in the 
process of reviewing the Constitution with a view to strengthening human rights protection 
in all areas. 
</p>
<p>16. However, the human rights culture had been afflicted by a dangerous disease, as the 
Western countries acted as if human rights were a cultural product that they were bringing 
to the developing countries. At the same time, the human rights record of some Western 
countries was less than honourable, in particular when they invaded other countries and 
pursued a policy of double standards and sanctions in different international forums, thus 
turning human rights into a tool to ensure their hegemony over other countries in the 
international arena.  
</p>
<p>17. Syrians wished their culture to emanate from their own values and history, which 
dated back to around 10000 B.C. Syria was committed to the fundamental values common 
to the civilizations of the world, such as freedom, justice, independence, sovereignty, 
family traditions, and the eradication of poverty and corruption, and it abided by its human 
rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>18. The Syrian people were convinced that their future lay in the harmony of all their 
components, and that their children should be raised in an environment free from hatred, 
and where justice worked for all citizens. The Syrian people had given their support to that 
goal and were committed to continuing on that path.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>19. During the interactive dialogue, 51 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations welcomed the participation of the Syrian Arab Republic in the universal 
periodic review and appreciated its cooperation despite the difficult situation in the country. 
Additional statements which could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing 
to time constraints are posted on the extranet of the universal periodic review when 
available.1 Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the 
present report. 
</p>
<p>20. Cuba welcomed the adoption of a number of measures and the opening of a dialogue 
with the opposition. It also noted the lifting of the state of emergency, the establishment of 
an independent judiciary, and the promulgation of new laws for political parties. Cuba 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. Nicaragua stated that it was necessary to take into account the difficult situation in 
which Syria found itself. It was ready to accompany Syria on the road to peace and 
reconciliation. Nicaragua made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Argentina, Austria, Botswana, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Mauritania, Nigeria, Romania, 
</p>
<p>Uganda, Yemen. </p>


<p>22. The Russian Federation was convinced that a stable and democratic development 
could only be achieved through a constructive dialogue and the implementation of the 
announced political reforms and social and economic transformations. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. The Plurinational State of Bolivia regretted that the translation of the Syrian national 
report had not been received in due time. It referred to the recognition by Syria of the 
legitimate claims of its people, the lifting of the state of emergency, and the fight against 
corruption. The Plurinational State of Bolivia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Ecuador reaffirmed the right of peoples to self-determination, the respect of 
sovereignty and territorial integrity and the principle of non-intervention in the internal 
affairs of other States. It recognized that the only way forward was that of peace and 
reconciliation. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela stated that, despite serious difficulties and 
suffering, Syria had sent a message of commitment to human rights. It drew attention to the 
efforts made by Syria to achieve peace and national reconciliation by promoting reforms to 
ensure economic and social rights. It reiterated its support for the efforts by Syria to 
preserve national unity and stability when faced with the siege of imperialism. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Japan was deeply concerned by the use of force in response to peaceful protests. It 
reiterated the need to introduce political reforms, to take account of the aspirations of the 
Syrian people with regard to how they are governed. Japan took a positive note of the 
ratification by Syria of many core international human rights instruments. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Uruguay reiterated its preoccupation with the violent repression of peaceful protests 
and the increase of acts contrary to international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law. It noted with satisfaction the adoption of the Plan of Action (2005&#8211;2009) 
for the World Programme for Human Rights Education and the withdrawal of reservations 
to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Algeria supported all efforts similar to those being undertaken in other parts of the 
Arab world, as Algeria itself had undergone intensive reform. It stressed the efforts of Syria 
to promote and protect human rights. It asked how Syria had been able to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals and encouraged it to cooperate constructively with the 
recommendations emanating from the interactive dialogue. Algeria made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>29. The Czech Republic urged a stop to the crackdowns on protests, which had resulted 
in hundreds of civilian casualties, including women and children. Syria should make a 
genuine effort to comply with the Security Council Presidential Statement of 3 August 2011 
and put an end to the use of force against protesters. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland remained deeply 
concerned about the brutal suppression of thousands of peaceful protestors and strongly 
urged the Government to cease arbitrary executions, arbitrary detention, torture, ill-
treatment and enforced disappearances of thousands of citizens. It asked whether steps had 
been taken to implement the announced lifting of the state of emergency. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. The United States of America condemned the Government&#8217;s gross violations of 
human rights resulting in over 2,900 civilians killed in military and security operations. It </p>


<p>noted that the mass arrests, arbitrary detentions, torture and targeted killings by the 
Government continued unabated, and called upon President Assad to step aside 
immediately.2 It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Bangladesh acknowledged that Syria was going through a political turmoil. It noted 
progress in social and economic rights and commended the country for hosting a large 
number of refugees. It urged all concerned to give up violence, ensure the protection of 
innocent civilians, and engage in a constructive, inclusive and transparent dialogue to 
resolve the ongoing impasse. Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. France stated that around 3,000 persons, including children, had been killed in the 
repression of peaceful protests, that at least 10,000 persons, including women and children, 
were in detention, and that more than 100 people had died under torture. It noted the 
statement of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that some of these crimes might be 
qualified as crimes against humanity. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea commended Syria on its efforts to 
maintain security and stability. It highlighted the importance of respect for the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and independence of Syria. It indicated that any solution could only be 
the outcome of Syrian-led policies without foreign intervention. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>35. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted the establishment of several human rights 
mechanisms as well as achievements in economic, social and cultural rights. It welcomed 
the announcement by Syria of reforms intended to bring comprehensive change and a better 
future for the Syrian people. It asked about measures to end the human rights violations 
committed in the occupied Golan. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>36. Lebanon inquired about steps to provide youth with opportunities for employment. It 
noted that it had a long-standing and strong brotherly relationship with Syria, rooted in 
geography, history, culture and social proximity. It was on this basis that Lebanon wished 
for the stability and prosperity of Syria, and for progress in the promotion and protection of 
human rights, especially in those difficult times. Lebanon made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Slovakia reiterated its regret over the failure of Syria to grant access to the fact-
finding mission established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution S-16/1. It stated 
that Syria had lost legitimacy due to human rights violations that may amount to crimes 
against humanity. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Brazil was seriously concerned over the human rights situation in Syria. It 
condemned acts of violence perpetrated by all sides and stated that the violent response to 
peaceful protests was unacceptable. It appreciated efforts to ensure food security, improve 
health indicators and address protection issues for refugees raised by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Turkey called on Syria to respect international human rights and amend laws that 
obstruct fundamental freedoms, and to stop its security forces from using live ammunition 
against protesters. It urged Syria to promptly investigate and prosecute those responsible for 
deaths in custody and to cooperate fully with the Human Rights Council and other 
international organizations. 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Cuba made a point of order stating that it was entirely unacceptable for the United States to call upon 
</p>
<p>the Syrian authorities to step down immediately. Neither the Human Rights Council, nor any other 
United Nations forum, was the appropriate forum for such request. The President of the Human 
Rights Council urged all delegations to remember that points of order were for raising procedural 
matters, and called on the delegation to continue the dialogue in the Council&#8217;s customary climate of 
respect. </p>


<p>40. Syria expressed its satisfaction with many elements of the dialogue, but considered 
that some comments by countries such as the United States amounted to interference in the 
domestic affairs of Syria and were characterized by contradictions and double standards.    
</p>
<p>41. Comments relating to the alleged use of weapons against citizens were a result of the 
global media campaign against Syria, which gave a distorted picture of the situation. Security 
forces had been deployed to keep the peace, but many of them had been killed, including 
unarmed police officers. In the case of the city of Hama, security forces had stayed outside the 
city for 50 days so that a dialogue could be established. When they finally intervened they 
tried to avoid casualties, but they were attacked by armed groupings. Similarly, in the city of 
Homs, there had been supposedly peaceful demonstrations, but then some elements began to 
target police officers, murdering 12 of them. The Government usually did not even arm its 
security forces when they went to such demonstrations. There was also false information on 
the use of tanks, which had not been used against demonstrators, but had been deployed only 
for the rescue of police officers who were overwhelmed and had no means to defend 
themselves. They had never fired on demonstrators. 
</p>
<p>42. Regarding comments on alleged bans on certain Internet sites, Syria referred to clear 
Presidential instructions allowing full access to Internet sites, including social media, 
contrary to what had happened in other parts of the world. 
</p>
<p>43. Syria further explained that the judicial committee tasked with the investigation of 
the recent events was totally independent and transparent, composed of highly qualified 
judges known for their impartiality. A large number of cases were under investigation. 
</p>
<p>44. The delegation noted that, while many protests had been conducted in full legality, 
others had taken place without notification and disrupted public order. 
</p>
<p>45. Concerning efforts to fight trafficking in persons, Syria referred to the issue of 
Decree No. 3 in 2010, which set out a framework to combat trafficking. Two centres for 
victims had been opened, in Damascus and Aleppo. 
</p>
<p>46. As regards capital punishment, the delegation assured that the strictest controls were 
in place for its application, and that it could be considered as almost suspended. 
</p>
<p>47. Concerning a question on differences in wages between men and women, the 
delegation stated that no discrimination existed in this regard, and that the salary depended 
solely on the type of work performed. Regarding comments on youth unemployment, Syria 
noted that thousands of new jobs had been created and that further steps would be taken in 
that direction. 
</p>
<p>48. Commenting on questions concerning the realization of the Millennium 
Development Goals, the delegation stated that Syria had incorporated the Goals in its 
development plans. Since 2003, Syria had issued national reports on the implementation of 
those objectives. Among others, there had been significant improvements in the indicators 
for poverty and food security. Major efforts had also been made in the field of education. 
</p>
<p>49. On questions regarding child labour, Syria referred to a national law prohibiting the 
recruitment of children and adolescents. Syria worked in cooperation with the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Labour Organization, especially 
regarding the worst forms of child labour. 
</p>
<p>50. On freedom of associations, the delegation informed that associations could be 
formed through the submission of a request to Ministry for Social Affairs and Labour. 
Permissions were granted if an application met the legal requirements and if the relevant 
association would make a positive contribution to Syrian society. 
</p>
<p>51. China stated that maintaining peace and stability in Syria would be in the interest of 
the Syrian people and the international community. All parties must exercise maximum </p>


<p>restraint and avoid violence. An inclusive political process should be launched. The 
Government should implement reforms, and all parties should participate in the political 
process. Any assistance from the international community should be constructive. 
</p>
<p>52. Malaysia noted with concern the deteriorating human rights situation. It reiterated 
the call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and spare no effort in starting dialogue 
and peaceful negotiations. It stated that wide-ranging economic sanctions imposed on 
countries could lead to deprivation of basic needs and services. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Slovenia expressed concern over the current situation and regretted that violence and 
repression by the security forces against the civilian population, arbitrary detentions, arrests 
of human rights activists, and killings of human rights defenders still continued. It 
welcomed that Syria had adopted the Plan of Action (2005&#8211;2009) for the World 
Programme for Human Rights Education. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Viet Nam took note of efforts in ensuring the enjoyment of all human rights, 
especially economic, social and cultural rights. It applauded Syria for its commitment to 
political reform to better protect and promote fundamental rights and freedoms. It expressed 
its concern over rising violence that had a serious impact on fundamental rights and 
freedoms, in particular those of women and children. Viet Nam made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Germany found it unacceptable that the ongoing brutal human rights violations had 
not been raised in the Syrian national report. It noted that Syria had not undertaken any 
steps to rescind the decrees granting immunity for crimes committed on duty, with resulting 
impunity for acts of torture committed by members of the security services, intelligence 
agencies and police. Germany made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>56. Zimbabwe was aware that the national report was prepared under very challenging 
circumstances. It commended the commitment of Syria to human rights and its international 
obligations in spite of the foreign interference. Zimbabwe was encouraged by efforts to 
promote dialogue and reconciliation. It noted that the imposition of economic sanctions 
violated fundamental human rights and called for an end to foreign interference. 
</p>
<p>57. Myanmar welcomed positive measures, particularly the introduction of the plan of 
action for human rights education for the school system. It noted the pledge by Syria to 
continue engaging with the Council. It also welcomed successful efforts to ensure food 
security and create advanced health care. Myanmar made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>58. South Africa sought clarification on concrete measures to facilitate gender equality, 
given the concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women on the stereotypical role of women, the revision of the Personal Status Act, 
and measures to address gender-based violence. It asked about changes envisaged in 
relation to the prison review process. It welcomed reform initiatives and expressed deep 
concern at the ongoing violence. South Africa made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Belarus positively noted the accession by Syria to most core human rights treaties 
and the lifting of reservations. However, Syria had been faced with sanctions, which had a 
negative impact on the enjoyment of economic and social rights. Sanctions also aggravated 
the humanitarian situation in the country. Belarus made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Switzerland noted that, despite the Human Rights Council&#8217;s two special sessions on 
Syria, human rights violations of extraordinary gravity had not ceased, and fundamental 
human rights were not respected. It was shocked by the violence used by the security 
services and by numerous reports of ill-treatment, torture and enforced disappearances. 
Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Thailand expressed its apprehension over the current socio-economic and political 
challenges, which should be resolved through an internally led political process, based on </p>


<p>an inclusive and credible national dialogue. Such reconciliation could not flourish in a 
climate of impunity. It commended Syria for positive steps such as the provision of health 
care to over 1.5 million Iraqi refugees and the granting of citizenship to the Kurdish 
population earlier this year. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Canada was greatly concerned by the grave human rights situation in Syria. Five 
decades of imposed restrictions had been further exacerbated by the violent repression. It 
wished for the people of Syria a government that respected freedom, democracy, human 
rights, and the rule of law, reminded its call on President Assad and his supporters to step 
down immediately and looked forward to working with a new Syrian government to 
improve respect for human rights. Canada made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. The Sudan regretted the loss of lives, and noted efforts in promoting and protecting 
human rights and to address the current situation, including the lifting of the state of 
emergency. The Sudan commended achievements in women rights, including for women 
living under foreign occupations, and the right of education for all, including in remote 
areas. It asked about efforts to combat illiteracy. The Sudan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Norway stated that political prisoners were systematically exposed to ill-treatment 
and torture in overcrowded and often improvised detention facilities, and also cited recent 
reports of systematic monitoring and harassment of protesters outside of Syria by agents 
believed to be acting on behalf of the Government. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Indonesia remained deeply concerned and deplored the use of force against civilians. 
It noted the lifting of the state of emergency in April 2011, which provided the opportunity 
to bring the situation back to normalcy, through a democratic political process. Indonesia 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Chile stated that the situation in Syria was causing deep concerns in Chilean society. 
It called upon Syria to generate conditions to put an end to violence and repression, 
guaranteeing human rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly the right to demonstrate. 
It was important to bring to justice those responsible. The state of emergency needed to be 
lifted in order to protect human rights. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Australia noted that over 2,700 Syrians had been killed in protests demanding 
reform and democratic freedoms, and condemned the murder of overwhelmingly non-
violent protesters and the torture of detainees. It urged Syria to implement the 
recommendations of the High Commissioner&#8217;s report and reiterated its call to the Security 
Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court. Australia called on President 
Assad to step aside to allow credible democratic reforms to take place. Australia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. In relation to comments provided by different speakers, the delegation noted that 
Syria respected and accepted the views and advice of friends, but could not accept false 
accusations made without any proof. 
</p>
<p>69. Concerning calls for an accelerated dialogue, Syria again acknowledged the 
importance of dialogue, which had been initiated already at the beginning of the events. 
Two weeks earlier, consultations had been held in all provinces of the country, as part of 
the comprehensive national dialogue, and another round of consultations was planned to be 
held in the coming weeks.  
</p>
<p>70. The delegation emphasized however that some of those calling for change were not 
willing to engage in dialogue but rather manipulated the emotions of people, including at 
the time of Friday prayers, when people coming out of the mosques and engaging in 
demonstrations were joined by armed elements and extremists, who falsely purported to 
represent the whole people.  </p>


<p>71. The delegation reported that there was a clear timeline for the dialogue and reform 
process, with municipal elections to be conducted within a month and a half and 
parliamentary election in February next year, once the new parties would have been 
constituted according to the new guidelines.  
</p>
<p>72. Concerning a suggestion for Syria to ratify the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court, the delegation noted that the Court could be exploited to threaten the 
territorial integrity and sovereignty of States and to punish those who the West wished to 
punish. Some major powers such as the United States themselves had not ratified the Rome 
Statute.  
</p>
<p>73. The delegation asserted that Syria gave full access to all humanitarian operations in 
Syria, and expressed in pride in hosting and providing for many refugees, including over a 
million Iraqi refugees, and about half a million Palestinian refugees since 1948, in addition 
to about half a million Syrian internally displaced persons from the occupied Golan.  
</p>
<p>74. In response to comments by Canada, Syria expressed its consternation at the 
hostility demonstrated towards Syria and questioned what the real intention was behind its 
calls for reforms and human rights, noting that it had rejected all calls for human rights for 
the Palestinian people and shown itself hostile to the pride and dignity of developing 
nations. Accordingly, the delegation rejected any interference in the internal affairs of 
Syria, which ran counter to international law. 
</p>
<p>75. The delegation stressed that Syria was a country comprising different ethnic groups 
and civilizations. However, the term &#8220;minority&#8221; was not a notion that was legally supported 
</p>
<p>in Syria as every person had equal rights, regardless of their race, colour or religion. 
</p>
<p>76. The delegation commented on elements included in the statements of the United 
States, Norway and Canada, regarding freedom of opinion and the rights of demonstrators. 
The delegation stated that Syria guaranteed the right to freedom of expression, opinion and 
belief, and that limitations were imposed only insofar as the exercise of these rights 
interfered with the rights of others, especially through libel or insult.  
</p>
<p>77. Concerning human rights defenders, the delegation stated that there were more than 
15,000 lawyers in Syria, many of whom worked on human rights issues. Allegations 
concerning the harassment of rights defenders were incorrect.  
</p>
<p>78. The delegation was surprised to hear comments on an insufficient representation of 
women in public life, as United Nations bodies, such as the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women had indicated that great efforts had been made by the 
Government in that area. Women could occupy any position, and their equal rights were 
guaranteed by the law.  
</p>
<p>79. Regarding queries on illiteracy, the delegation noted that efforts for its eradication 
were ongoing in accordance with the national development plan, and that the rate of 
illiteracy had been brought down to 14 per cent. 
</p>
<p>80. The Netherlands stated that Syria should extend cooperation to the commission of 
inquiry established by the Human Rights Council. Radical change was needed to improve 
the protection of human rights. The violence against peaceful protesters since March 2011 
was unacceptable. Syria should respect the right to life, the freedom of expression and 
opinion, and the freedom of assembly. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. Belgium regretted that the human rights situation had not improved after two special 
sessions of the Human Rights Council. It was concerned by reports of extrajudicial 
executions, arrests, arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, and excessive use of 
force against detainees. It asked what urgent measures Syria was taking to make its 
legislative system more transparent. Belgium made recommendations. </p>


<p>82. Ireland urged Syria to immediately desist from the unacceptable use of violence 
against peaceful protestors and to heed the condemnation expressed across the world at the 
shocking loss of life that resulted. It strongly urged Syria to extend its full cooperation to 
the international commission of inquiry established by the Human Rights Council and to 
grant it free access to its territory. Ireland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Maldives expressed its concerns about the killings of 2,700 protestors, including 
children. While welcoming the lifting of the state of emergency and the commitment to 
undertaking reforms, it noted a lack of progress in implementation. It called for an end to 
the violence and urged the authorities to allow people to protest peacefully and to address 
demands for reforms. Maldives made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. India welcomed reform measures aimed at improving the democratic system and 
strengthening public freedoms. India noted the commitment by Syria to realizing the right 
to health, and to provide health care for up to 1.5 million Iraqi refugees. It appreciated that 
Syria had granted citizenship to the Kurdish population in Hassake. India requested further 
information on the work of the Commission for Family Affairs. 
</p>
<p>85. The Republic of Korea appreciated the engagement of Syria with the international 
human rights mechanisms, such as the current UPR session. It restated its grave concern at 
the situation in Syria and urged the Government to stop the violence against its own 
citizens, hold perpetrators accountable and respect its obligations under international human 
rights law. The Republic of Korea made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. Spain stated that systematic violations of human rights and violent repression of 
peaceful demonstrations had led the Human Rights Council to hold two extraordinary 
sessions. Syria must cooperate with the Council and allow the commission of inquiry 
access to the country. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>87. Poland noted with regret the reports of systematic violations of human rights and the 
lack of cooperation with OHCHR. It was particularly concerned by reported human rights 
abuses, including indiscriminate violations of the right to life, mass arrests, targeted killings 
and the lack of judicial independence. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. Costa Rica expressed its extreme concern at the number of persons who lost their 
lives in violent incidents, which exceeds by far that of any of the other countries in the 
region with an unstable political situation. The number of reported human rights violations 
was equally alarming. 
</p>
<p>89. Guatemala recognized the improvements in main health indicators and efforts to 
guarantee food security. However, Syria should fight discrimination and violence against 
women and children. Guatemala was concerned about the recent events and condemned the 
ongoing loss of lives. It called upon Syria to abstain from using force and abide by the 
international obligations to protect, especially women and children. Guatemala made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>90. Peru regretted that Syria did not live up to the commitments made in March 2011 to 
uphold the highest standards in the protection of human rights. It also regretted that Syria 
had not granted access to OHCHR as per Human Rights Council resolution S-16/1. It noted 
that Syria had not extended a standing invitation to special procedures and did not authorize 
access to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. Peru 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Mexico urged Syria to immediately put an end to the escalating violence against 
peaceful political demonstrators, respecting their right to the freedoms of expression and 
assembly. Mexico also appealed to Syria to open the door to an inclusive dialogue that 
responds to the legitimate requests of the people. Mexico made recommendations. </p>


<p>92. Kyrgyzstan condemned the use of force against peaceful demonstrators and urged all 
parties to show restraint. It hoped that Syria would implement the announced political 
reforms, and welcomed steps to amend legislation under which prisoners of conscience had 
been jailed, and to regulate peaceful assembly and the establishment of political parties. It 
urged Syria to fully cooperate with the commission of inquiry. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. Sweden was concerned that the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of violence 
was continuing. It referred to repeated promises to investigate and prosecute all crimes 
against civilians and security personnel. It also noted a policy of arbitrary arrests and 
detention by security and military forces, and reports of enforced disappearances, including 
of children, and of detainees being held in unofficial detention centres. Sweden made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>94. Commenting on observations made by the Netherlands, Syria reaffirmed its 
continued engagement in comprehensive reform, but rejected allegations that persons 
wounded in the recent events did not have access to health care or to hospitals. The 
delegation furthermore regretted that in all the statements made concerning protesters, there 
was no mention of the presence of armed gangs, although more than 1,100 members of the 
military and security forces had been killed. 
</p>
<p>95. The delegation stressed that Syria was cooperating with the human rights 
mechanisms, noting that last year, Syria had received visits from the Special Rapporteur on 
the right to food and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and it would welcome more 
such visits once the situation returned to normal. 
</p>
<p>96. Concerning queries on the Kurdish population, the delegation stated that they were 
an integral part of the citizenship of Syria, and that there was no discrimination against 
them or any other citizens based on race, ethnicity or origin. 
</p>
<p>97. On allegations concerning massive arrests, detentions and killings, Syria assured that 
such information was unfounded, as arrests only targeted those who were breaking the law 
and attacking private and public property. Such persons were detained according to the law, 
and there were no enforced disappearances. Detention centres and prisons were constantly 
monitored. The ICRC had visited prisons and not found any cases of torture or enforced 
disappearance. Last year, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
had considered similar accusations and concluded that they were unfounded. Concerning 
the alleged impunity of security personnel involvement in torture, the delegation assured 
that it could give to the Human Rights Council the names of officers who had committed 
violations and had been referred to justice for prosecution. 
</p>
<p>98. Syria appreciated the constructive, positive observations and proposals made by 
friendly delegations, which would encourage Syria to continue its efforts for the protection 
and promotion of human rights. However, it noted that unfortunately some statements had 
deliberately politicized the issues and used hostile terminology, which did not serve the 
cause of human rights. 
</p>
<p>99. In conclusion, the delegation reaffirmed that Syria remained strong and would 
overcome the crisis. It had already made much progress in that regard. With its long history, 
Syria would continue to be a pioneer among the countries adhering to their human rights 
obligations. After completion of the reforms initiated by the President it would be a model for 
democracy, with a multiparty system and full respect for human rights. Syria still needed 
some time to achieve this and hoped to return at the next review with a new image of Syria. </p>
