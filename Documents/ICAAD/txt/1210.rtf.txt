"On the 27th May, 2011 after meeting with some accountants, the complainant then went to Nadi Club to have a few beers. Whilst the complainant was having beer, Accused 1 and Accused 2 then approached him. The complainant then offered them beers and also bought some beer after the two accused persons had asked for a packet of BH 10 cigarettes. They then got to know each other.

The complainant and the accused persons then went to Tu's place at Martintar, Nadi and had dinner. Then Vilitati Vuadromo (PW2) later joined them. The complainant, Accused 1, Accused 2 and PW2 then went to After Dark Nightclub.

At the After Dark nightclub they drank beer for some time and they were joined by another Fijian man. The complainant, PW2 and the Fijian man went back to Novotel Hotel, Nadi. The complainant then realized that his mobile phone was missing and he went back to the same night club. At the night club, the complainant met Accused 2 and asked him if he had stolen his phone but Accused 2 told the complainant that PW2 must have stolen it. The complainant asked Accused 2 to help him to look for PW2.

On the early morning of the 28th May 2011, at about 3.00am, the complainant, Accused 1 and Accused 2 then went to look for PW2 somewhere near Denarau. At a gravel road near Denarau, Accused 2 got off the rental car and walked towards the house of PW2 and the complainant followed him. Accused 1 was inside the car and switched the car lights off.
