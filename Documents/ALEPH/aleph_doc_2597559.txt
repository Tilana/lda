Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Statements as at 30 June 2016
0 Successful drilling program extended Gwalia Ore Reserves below 1,800 metres below surface for the first time
c Total Ore Reserves maintained at 4.01 Moz of contained gold, despite production of 377 koz and sale of King of the
Hills mine and Kailis resource during FV16

Successful drilling at Gwalia targeting orebody extensions below 1,800 metres below surface has created significant new
resources and reserves which have increased mine life at Gwalia. The gross additions from deep drilling and design
changes at Gwalia amounted to 490 koz to Ore Reserves and 938 koz to Mineral Resources. The extent of this addition to
reserves has offset depletion across the group and reductions through the divestment of King of the Hills and Kailis,
resulting in reserves being maintained at 4.01 Moz.
Company Summary at 30 June 2016
> Total Ore Reserves are estimated at: 37.0 Mt @ 3.4 g/t Au for 4.01 Moz of contained gold, comprising:

> Leonora Operations: 9.4 Mt @ 7.0 g/t Au for 2.11 Moz of contained gold

> Simberi Operations: 27.7 Mt @ 2.1 g/t Au for 1.90 Moz of contained gold
> Total Mineral Resources1 are estimated at: 119.7 Mt @ 2.4 g/t Au for 9.08 Moz of contained gold, comprising:

> Leonora Operations: 22.4 Mt @ 6.3 g/t Au for 4.52 Moz of contained gold

> Simberi Operations: 97.3 Mt @ 1.5 g/t Au for 4.56 Moz of contained gold

Table 1:  St Barbara 2015 and 2016 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Summary
The  Company’s  Ore  Reserves  are  effectively  unchanged  as  an  increase  in  the  Gwalia  Ore  Reserves  resulting  from 
successful  surface  drilling  targeting  mineralisation  extensions  below  the  1800  has  offset  depletion  from  production 
(Figure 1).
The successful drilling at Gwalia has offset reductions in the Company’s Mineral Resources inventory due to:
˃  Production,
˃
Sterilisation of non-recoverable resources at Gwalia,
˃  Divestment of the King of the Hills and Kailis Projects, and
˃  Revised optimal pit shell from US$1,875 to US$1,800 per ounce at Simberi (Figure 2).

Mineral Resource Revisions
Gwalia (+592,000 ounces (net))
The  Gwalia  Mineral  Resource  has  been  updated  following  the  completion  of  a  surface  drilling  program  targeting 
mineralisation below 1800 mbs and underground grade control and resource definition drilling completed from the 1540 
level platform. The previous  publicly reported Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate reported at 
30 June 2015 was  12,929 kt  @ 7.9 g/t Au containing 3,304 koz  of gold. This has increased by  a  net  592 koz of  gold to 
17,294 kt @ 7.0 g/t Au containing 3,896 koz of gold. Variances between the two estimates are primarily due to:
˃  Depletion due to mining and sterilisation of non-recoverable resources, and
˃  Resource extensions below 1800 mbs and changes to local geological models as a result of drilling.
King of the Hills (-170,000 ounces)
The King of the Hills Project was sold in October 2015 to Saracen Metals Pty Ltd.  The Company announced the sale of the 
King of the Hills mine and Kailis resource on 20 August 2015, refer to the corresponding ASX announcement for details.
Kailis (-104,000 ounces)
The Kailis Project was sold in October 2015 to Saracen Metals Pty Ltd.  The Company announced the sale of the King of 
the Hills mine and Kailis resource on 20 August 2015, refer to the corresponding ASX announcement for details.
Simberi Oxide (-462,000 ounces)
A revised Mineral Resource estimate was completed for Simberi Oxide incorporating an updated base of oxidation model, 
based on sulphur assays and geological logging data. Previous models did not  account for sulphur content. In addition, 
material that was previously classified as ‘transitional’ (partly oxidised) and reported as part of the oxide resource is now 
reported as part of the sulphide resource. The previous publicly reported Measured, Indicated and Inferred Oxide Mineral 
Resource Estimate reported at 30 June 2015 was 43,979 kt @ 1.0 g/t Au containing 1,413 koz of gold. This has decreased 
by  462  koz  of  gold  to  29,428  kt  @  1.0  g/t  Au  containing  951  koz  of  gold.  Variances  between  the  two  estimates  are 
primarily due to depletion through mining and removal of transitional ore.
Simberi Sulphide (0 ounces)
The  Simberi  Sulphide  Mineral  Resource  estimate  was  updated  incorporating  a  revised  base  of  oxidation  model  and 
additional attributes necessary for the Simberi  sulphide pre-feasibility study. The previous publicly reported Measured, 
Indicated  and  Inferred  Sulphide  Mineral  Resource  Estimate  reported  at  30  June  2015  was  76,914  kt  @  1.5  g/t  Au 
containing  3,607  koz  of  gold.  The  revised  model  shows  no  net  change  in  contained  ounces  and  is  now  67,850  kt  @ 
1.7 g/t Au containing 3,607 koz of gold.  Variances between the two estimates are primarily due to the reclassification of 
transitional material as sulphide, depletion through mining and a change in gold price (from US$1,875 to US$1,800 per 
ounce) used to constrain the reporting of the sulphide Mineral Resource.
St Barbara Limited Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Statement 30 June 2016

Ore Reserve Revisions
Gwalia (+214,000 ounces (net))
The  previous  publicly  reported  Proved  and  Probable  Ore  Reserve  Estimate  reported  at  30  June  2015  was  5,290  kt  @ 
9.4 g/t Au containing 1,594 koz of gold. This has increased by a net 214 koz of gold to 6,795 kt @ 8.3 g/t Au containing 
1,808 koz of gold. Variances between the two estimates are primarily due to:
˃  Depletion due to mining,
˃  Depth  extension  to  the  Mineral  Resource  as  a  consequence  of  surface  drilling  targeting  resource  extensions
below 1800 mbs,
˃  Design changes as a consequence of the revised Mineral Resource estimate, and
˃  Removal of the ‘mine call factor’.
A  mine  call  factor  has  previously  been  applied  to  South  West  Branch  (SWB)  stopes  greater  than  8.0  g/t  Au  to  address 
concerns that the Mineral Resource and, as a consequence, the Ore Reserve over-estimated grade in areas of limited or 
no grade control drilling. A review of factored areas subsequent to grade control drilling has shown that the un-factored 
grade is a more reliable estimate of grade.
Simberi (oxide and sulphide combined: -206,000 ounces)
The  previous  publicly  reported  Proved  and  Probable  Ore  Reserve  Estimate  reported  at  30  June  2015  was  38,999  kt  @ 
1.7 g/t  Au  containing  2,103  koz  of  gold.  This  has  reduced  by  206  koz  of  gold  to  27,650  kt  @  2.1  g/t  Au  containing 
1,897 koz of gold. The Simberi reserve combines the oxide reserve with 14,094 kt @ 1.3 g/t Au containing 576 koz of gold 
and the sulphide reserve with 13,556 kt @ 3.0 g/t Au containing 1,321 koz of gold.
The  Simberi  sulphide  reserve  profile  variance  from  previous  years  predominately  relates  to  changes  in  the  sulphide 
resource  model  and  an  update  to  modifying  factors  as  defined  through  the  updated  pre-feasibility  study  for  sulphide 
treatment at Simberi.
