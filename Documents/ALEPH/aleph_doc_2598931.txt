NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE
Description of the Business and Summary of Activities
Fort St. James Nickel Corp.  (the (cid:8220)Company(cid:8221)) is incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations 
Act and its common shares are listed on the NEX Exchange under the symbol FTJ.H. The Company is a 
junior mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition, evaluation and exploration, if warranted, 
of mineral properties in North America.   
 
The  Company  has  incurred  recurring  losses  since  its  inception,  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of 
$13,553,303  as  at  April  30,  2016  which  has  been  funded  primarily  by  the  issuance  of  shares.  The 
Company has no source of operating cash flows and expects to incur further losses in the exploration and 
development  of  its  mineral  properties.  The  Company's  ability  to  continue  its  operations  and  to  realize 
assets at their carrying values is dependent upon obtaining additional financing or maintaining continued 
support from its shareholders and creditors, and generating profitable operations in the future. 
 
 
Shares Issued
On  July  20,  2015  the  Company  closed  a  non-brokered  private  placement  whereby  400,000  Units  were  issued  at 
$0.10 per Unit for total proceeds of $40,000 (which included $20,000 share subscriptions received prior to April 30, 
2015).    Each  Unit  consists  of  one  common  share  in  the  capital  of  the  Company  and  one  non-transferable  share 
purchase  warrant  entitling the holder  to  purchase  one  additional  common  share at  a  price  of  $0.10  until  July  20, 
2020.
Trading Halt, Review of Company by TSX Venture Exchange and Listing on NEX Exchange
On September 10, 2015, trading in the Company(cid:8217)s shares was halted by the BC Securities Commission and the TSX 
Venture Exchange for failure to file its financial statements and management analysis and discussion on SEDAR on 
or before 120 days after the Company(cid:8217)s fiscal year end.   
 
On September 28, 2015 the Company filed the required documents on SEDAR and on September 29, 2015 the BC 
Securities Commission issued a revocation order thereby allowing the Company to commence trading of its shares, 
subject to approval by the TSX-V.  During the period the stock was halted the TSX-V undertook a review of the 
Company(cid:8217)s  operations.    The  result  of  the  review  was  the  TSX-V  determined  the  Company  was  inactive  and 
therefore, the Company(cid:8217)s listing was moved from a Tier 2 Venture Issuer to inactive status on the NEX Exchange.  
On  November  16,  2015  the TSX-V removed  the  cease  trade  order  and  the  Company  commenced  trading  on the 
NEX Exchange under the symbol FTJ.H.
On May 13, 2016, the Company announced a non-brokered private placement totaling up to $250,000 at a price of 
$0.05 per unit. Each Unit will consist of one post consolidated common share in the capital of the Company and one 
non-transferable share purchase warrant entitling the holder to purchase one additional post consolidated common 
share  at  a  price  of  $0.05  for  5  years.  The  private  placement  is  subject  to  the  acceptance  of  the  TSX  Venture 
Exchange.

Resource Properties
Kilometre 26 (cid:8211) Central British Columbia
There has been no exploration activities on the Kilometre 26 Project during the year end April 30, 2016 and up to 
the date of this report, August 29, 2016.   Following is a description of the property and results of past exploration 
activities. 
 
The Company owns a 100% interest in the Kilometre 26 Project, a group of mineral claims located approximately 
50  kilometers  northwest  of  Fort  St.  James  in  central  British  Columbia.    On  September  28,  2009  the  Company 
entered into a three year Option Agreement with Eastfield Resources Ltd. ((cid:8220)Eastfield(cid:8221)) to acquire a 60% interest in 
the claims.  On September 9, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with Eastfield to acquire a 100% interest 
in  the  Property  and  to  terminate  the  Option  Agreement  in  consideration  for  the  issuance  of  2,000,000  common 
shares. The fair value of the property was determined to be $775,000.  On December 1, 2011 the Company issued 
the 2,000,000 common shares. 
 
Since April 30, 2013 there has been no exploration activity on the Company(cid:8217)s property.  Management has assured 
the Company(cid:8217)s rights to all mineral claims in the Kilometre 26 area are secure.  Assessment work has been filed on 
all the claims in the Kilometer 26 property such that current expiry dates range to December 2017. 
 
Approximately  $1,000,000  has  been  spent  on  exploring  the  property  to  date.  Eastfield  completed  an  initial  rock 
sampling program in 2009 while the Company completed more extensive programs consisting of grid establishment, 
rock and soil geochemical surveying and ground based induced polarization and magnetometer surveying in 2010 
and 2011 and a six hole (813 metre) diamond drilling program in 2011.  
 
The entire claim area occurs within a gentle to undulating landscape all of which occurs on government land. The 
predominant  target  of  interest  on  the  Kilometre  26  property  is  ophiolite  hosted  disseminated  nickel.  Motherlode 
style (ophiolite gold) mineralization constitutes a secondary objective.

The Company proposes to meet any additional financing requirements through equity financing.  Raising additional 
capital may be difficult or not possible.  The Company is in the business of exploring its mineral property interests 
and  does  not  generate  any  cash  from  operations.    Without  the  ability  to  attract  additional  equity  funding  the 
Company:
Fort St James Nickel Corp 
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
For the Year Ended April 30, 2016
•  Does not have the working capital necessary to fund current operations for the 2017 fiscal year;
•  Will not have sufficient funds to complete planned exploration activities;
•  Has additional liquidity risks associated with financial instruments where trading volumes have declined; and
•  Has  a  working  capital  deficiency,  which may  result  in  the  Company(cid:8217)s  inability  to  meet  obligations  as  they
Future  cash requirements  will  depend  primarily  on  the  extent  of  future  exploration  programs.  Subsequent  phases 
will depend, both on cost and duration, and on results from previous phases, and it is therefore extremely difficult to 
predict  future  cash requirements.    In  order  to  meet  its  option  payment  costs  and  expenditure requirements  on  its 
current properties the Company will need to raise additional financing, loans or proceeds from sale or joint venture 
of properties.
The  Company  is  dependent  on  raising  funds  by  the  issuance  of  shares  or  disposing  of  interests  in  its  unproven 
mineral  interests  (by  options,  joint  ventures  or  outright  sales)  in  order  to  finance  further  acquisitions,  undertake 
exploration and development of mineral interests and meet general and administrative expenses beyond one year in 
the future. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising their required financing.
The Company has limited financial resources and there is no assurance that additional funding will be available to 
allow  the  Company  to  fully  explore  its  existing  properties.  Failure  to  obtain  financing  could  result  in  delays  or 
indefinite postponement of further exploration and the possible, partial or total loss of the Company(cid:8217)s interest in 
certain properties. The Company may, in the future, be unable to meet its obligations under agreements to which it is 
a  party  and  the  Company  may  consequently  have  its  interest  in  the  properties  subject  to  such  agreements 
jeopardized. Furthermore, if other parties to such agreements do not meet their share of such costs, the Company 
may be unable to finance the costs required to complete recommended programs. 
 
Private Placement 
 
On  July  20,  2015, the  Company  closed  a  non-brokered  private  placement  whereby  400,000  Units  were  issued  at 
$0.10 per Unit for total proceeds of $40,000 (which included $20,000 share subscriptions received prior to April 30, 
2015).    Each  Unit  consists  of  one  common  share  in  the  capital  of  the  Company  and  one  non-transferable  share 
purchase  warrant  entitling the holder  to  purchase  one  additional  common  share at  a  price  of  $0.50  until  July  20, 
2020.   
 
Loan Payable 
 
As at April 30, 2016 and as of the date of this report, the loan outstanding amounts to $47,000 and the Company is 
paying monthly interest at 10% per annum. 
 
 
OFF-BALANCE SHETT ARRANGEMENTS

PPROPOSED TRANSACTIONS
The  Company  has  no  specific  proposed  transactions.    However,  consistent  with  the  nature  of  the  Company(cid:8217)s 
operations,  the  Company  is  continuously  reviewing  potential  mineral  property  acquisitions  and  may  acquire 
additional mineral properties in the future.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Company(cid:8217)s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations, including the discussion 
on liquidity and capital resources, are based on its financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards ((cid:8220)IFRS(cid:8221)).  The preparation of financial statements requires management 
to  make  estimates  and  judgments  that  affect  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses,  and 
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, management re-evaluates its estimates 
and judgments, particularly those related to the determination of the impairment of long-lived assets.  Management 
bases  its  estimates  and  judgments  on  historical  experience,  contractual  arrangements  and  commitments  and  on 
various  other  assumptions  that  it  believes  are  reasonable  in  the  circumstances.    Changes  in  these  estimates  and 
judgments  will  impact  the  amounts  recognized  in  the  financial  statements,  and  the  impact  may  be  material.  
Management believes  significant estimates and assumptions include those related to the recoverability  of mineral 
Page | 6
properties and deferred exploration expenditures, estimated useful lives of capital assets, stock-based compensation, 
determination as to whether costs are expensed or deferred and asset retirement obligations.
Fort St James Nickel Corp 
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
For the Year Ended April 30, 2016
Critical  accounting  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  include  the  assumption  that  the 
Company is a going concern, recoverable value of its mineral properties, asset retirement obligations, valuation of 
stock-based compensation and future income taxes. These estimates involve considerable judgment and are, or could 
be, affected by significant factors that are out of the Company(cid:8217)s control.
GOING CONCERN
The  financial  statements have  been  prepared  on  a going  concern  basis,  which  contemplates  continuity  of  normal 
business activities and the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of  business.  The 
Company has not generated revenues from operations. The Company is considered to be in the exploration stage as 
it  has  not  placed  any  of  its  mineral  properties  into  production.  The  underlying  value  of  the  Company(cid:8217)s  mineral 
properties is dependent upon the existence and economic recovery of such reserves in the future and the ability of 
the  Company  to  raise  financing  to  complete  the  future  exploration  and  development  of  the  properties,  including 
meeting option payment requirements as they fall due.  
 
While the financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company is a going concern and will 
be  able  to  realize  its  assets  and meet  its  obligations in the  normal  course  of  operations,  there  are  conditions and 
events that cast doubt on the validity of that assumption. The Company has not generated revenue from operations. 
The Company has a loss from operations of $99,310 for the year ended April 30, 2016, a history of prior year losses 
and, as of that date the Company(cid:8217)s accumulated deficit was $13,553,303.  The Company is considered to be in the 
exploration stage as it has not placed any of its mineral properties into production.  The financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the 
normal course of business. While the financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company 
is a going concern and will be able to realize its assets and meet its obligations in the normal course of operations, 
there are conditions and events that cast significant doubt on the validity of that assumption. The Company(cid:8217)s ability 
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the ability of the Company to raise debt or equity financings and the 
attainment of profitable operations.
Management  has  taken  steps  to  reduce  cash  expenditures  to  a  level  that  will  enable  operations  to  continue  and 
minimum mineral property commitments to be met for a minimum of twelve months from the date of these financial 
statements.  There can be no assurance that management(cid:8217)s plans will be successful.  The financial statements do not 
include  any  adjustments  to  the  recoverability  and  classification  of  recorded  asset  amounts  and  classification  of 
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  Such adjustments 
could be material.
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure 
 
The application of the Company(cid:8217)s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgment 
in determining whether it is likely that future economic benefits will flow to the Company, which may be based on 
assumptions about future events or circumstances.  Estimates and assumptions made may change if new information 
becomes available.  If, after expenditure is capitalized, information becomes available suggesting that the recovery 
of expenditure is unlikely, the amount capitalized is written off in the profit (loss) in the year the new information 
becomes available. 
 
Title to Mineral Property Interests 
 
Although  the  Company  has  taken  steps  to  verify  title  to  mineral  properties  in  which  it  has  an  interest,  these 
procedures do not guarantee the Company(cid:8217)s title.  Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers 
and title may be affected by undetected defects. 
 
Provision for Site Restoration 
 
Provision for site restoration has been created based on the Company(cid:8217)s internal estimates.   Assumptions, based on 
the current economic environment, have been made which management believes are a reasonable basis upon which
Page | 7
Fort St James Nickel Corp 
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
For the Year Ended April 30, 2016
to estimate the future liability.  These estimates take into account any material changes to the assumptions that occur 
when  reviewed  regularly  by  management.    Estimates  are  reviewed  annually  and  are  based  on  current regulatory 
requirements.  Significant changes in estimates of contamination, restoration standards and techniques will result in 
changes to provisions from period to period.  Actual rehabilitation costs  will ultimately depend on future market 
prices for the rehabilitation costs which will reflect the market condition at the time the rehabilitation cost is actually 
incurred.  The final cost of the currently recognized rehabilitation provisions may be higher than currently provided 
for.  The Company currently has no rehabilitation provisions. 
 
Functional Currency 
 
Management has concluded the functional currency of the Company, being the currency of the primary economic 
environment  in  which  the  Company  operates,  is  the  Canadian  dollar.    In  determining  the  functional  currency 
management  considered  the  currency  that  revenue  will  primarily  be  derived  in  and  the  currency  that  mainly 
influences the cost of providing goods and services in each jurisdiction in which the Company operates. 
 
Income Taxes
Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes.  There are many transactions and 
calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  
The  Company  recognizes  liabilities  and  contingencies  for  anticipated  tax  audit  issues  based  on  the  Company(cid:8217)s 
current  understanding  of  the  tax  law.    For  matters  where  it  is  probable  that  an  adjustment  will  be  made,  the 
Company records its best estimate of the tax liability including the related interest and penalties in the current tax 
provision.    Management  believes  they  have  adequately  provided  for  the  probable  outcome  of  these  matters; 
however,  the  final  outcome  may  result  in  a  materially  different  outcome  than  the  amount  included  in  the  tax 
liabilities. 
 
In addition, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried forward to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profit will be available against which a deductible temporary difference can be utilized.  This is 
deemed to be the case when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority 
and the same taxable entity which are expected to reverse in the same year as the expected reversal of the deductible 
temporary  difference.    However,  utilization  of  the  tax  losses  also  depends  on  the  ability  of  the  taxable  entity  to 
satisfy certain tests at the time the losses are recouped. 
 
Share-based Payment and Warrant Valuation Transactions 
 
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the 
equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.  Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions 
requires determining the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the 
grant.    This  estimate  also  requires  determining  the  most  appropriate  inputs  to  the  valuation  model  including  the 
expected  life  of  the  stock  option,  volatility  and  dividend  yield  and  making  assumptions  about  them.    The 
assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 9 
of the April 30, 2016 audited financial statements.  
 
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with non-employees at the fair value of the goods or 
services  received  unless  that  fair  value  cannot  be  estimated  reasonably.    Estimating  fair  value  for  share-based 
payment  transactions  with non-employees  requires  determining  the  most  reasonable  estimate  of  value.    The  best 
determination of value will be established by previous cash transactions for similar goods or services provided by 
the  non-employee  and  as  agreed  to  between  the  parties.    In  the  absence  of  such  agreement  the  Company  will 
determine a reasonable estimate of fair value by reference to similar transactions in a similar market place. If the 
parties  do  not  agree  on  a  fair  value  or  the  Company  cannot  otherwise  reasonably  estimate  the  fair  value  the 
Company measures the goods or services by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. 
 
The Company measures the fair value of warrants determined to be financial instruments at the date they are issued.  
Estimating  fair  value  for  share-based  payment  transactions  requires  determining  the  most  appropriate  valuation

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING INITIAL ADOPTION
Significant Accounting Policies Adopted during the period. 
 
Certain  pronouncements  were  issued  by  the  IASB  of  the  IFRS  Interpretations Committee  that are  mandatory  for 
accounting periods beginning after January 1, 2016 or later years.  
 
Accounting standards or amendments to existing accounting standards that have  been issued  but have  future  effective 
dates are either not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company(cid:8217)s financial statements. The 
following new standards, interpretations and amendments, which have not been applied in these financial statements, will 
or may have an effect on the Company(cid:8217)s future financial statements: 
 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement is part of the IASB(cid:8217)s wider project to replace IAS 
39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.   IFRS  9  retains  but  simplifies  the  mixed  measurement 
model and establishes two primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized costs and fair value.  The 
basis of  classification depends on the entity(cid:8217)s  business model and the contractual cash flow  characteristics of the 
financial asset.  The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016.  The Company is 
in the process of evaluating the impact of the new standard. 
 
Annual improvements: In December 2013, the IASB issued the Annual Improvements 2010-2012 and 2011- 2013 
cycles,  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or after  July  1,  2014.  In  September  2014,  the  IASB  issued  the 
Annual  Improvements  2012-2014  cycle,  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  July  1,  2016.  These 
Annual Improvements made necessary  but non-urgent amendments to existing IFRSs. These amendments are not 
expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements. 
 
 
DISCLOSURE AND INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK FACTORS
Internal Controls and Procedures
In contrast to the certificate required under National Instrument 52-109 Certificate of Disclosure in Issuers(cid:8217) Annual 
and Interim Filings (NI 52-109), the Venture Issuer Basic Certificate does not include representations relating to the 
establishment and maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures ((cid:8220)DC&P(cid:8221)) and internal control over financial 
reporting  ((cid:8220)ICFR(cid:8221)),  as  defined  in  NI  52-109.    In  particular,  the  certifying  officers  filing  this  certificate  are  not 
making any representation relating to the establishment and maintenance of:
a.  Controls  and  other  procedures  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  information  required  to  be 
disclosed by the issuer in its annul filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under securities 
legislation  is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  securities 
legislation; and
b.  A process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of 
financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  the  issuer(cid:8217)s  generally  accepted  accounting 
policies.
The  Company(cid:8217)s  certifying  officers  are  responsible  for  ensuring  processes  are  in  place  to  provide  them  with 
sufficient knowledge to support the representations they are making in their certification. 
 
Investors should be aware that inherent limitations on the ability of certifying officers of a venture issuer to design 
and implement, on a cost effective basis, DC&P and ICFR as defined in NI 52-109 may result in additional risks to 
the  quality,  reliability,  transparency  and timeliness  of  interim and annual  filing and  other reports  provided  under 
securities legislation.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
For the Year Ended April 30, 2016
Risk Factors
In conducting its business, the Company, like all development-stage mineral exploration companies, faces a variety 
of risks and uncertainties.  While unable to eliminate all of them, the Company aims at managing and reducing such 
risks as much as possible.
Exploration  and  Development  -  Resource  exploration  and  development  is  a  highly  speculative  business, 
characterized by a number of significant risks including, but not limited to, unprofitable efforts resulting not only 
from  the  failure  to  discover  mineral  deposits  but  also  from  finding  mineral  deposits  that,  though  present,  are 
insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production. Few exploration projects successfully achieve 
development  due  to  factors  that  cannot  be  predicted  or  anticipated,  and  even  one  such  factor  may  result  in  the 
economic viability of a project being detrimentally impacted such that it is neither feasible nor practical to proceed. 
The  Company  closely  monitors  its  activities  and  those  factors  that  could  impact  them,  and  employs  experienced 
consultants to assist in its risk management and to make timely adequate decisions.
Title Risks  -  Title  to  mineral  properties  involves  certain  inherent risks  due  to  the  difficulties  of  determining  the 
validity of certain claims, as well as the potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyance 
history characteristic of many mineral properties.
Fluctuating Metal Prices - Factors beyond the control of the Company have a direct effect on global metal prices, 
which  have  fluctuated  widely,  particularly  in  recent  years.  Consequently,  the  economic  viability  of  any  of  the 
Company(cid:8217)s  exploration  projects  and  the  Company(cid:8217)s  ability  to  finance  the  development  of  its  projects  cannot  be 
accurately predicted and may be adversely affected by fluctuations in metal prices.  
 
Environmental  Regulations,  Permits  and  Licenses  -  Environmental  laws  and  regulation  could  also  impact  the 
viability of a project. The Company has ensured that it has complied with these regulations, but there can be changes 
in legislation outside the Company's control that could also add a risk factor to a project.
Competition - The mineral exploration industry is intensely competitive in all its phases, and the Company competes 
with  some  companies  that have  greater  financial and  technical resources.  Competition  could  adversely  affect  the 
Company's ability to acquire suitable properties or prospects in the future.
Future  Financings  -  The  Company's  continued  operation  will  be  dependent  in  part  upon  its  ability  to  generate 
operating revenues and to procure additional financing. To date, the Company has done so through a combination 
of: (i) equity financing; (ii) cash payments received as property option payments from third parties; (iii) the sale of 
junior company shares received as property option payments; and, (iv) profits from the investment in and subsequent 
sale of junior company shares through its investment portfolio. The current state of global equity markets has had a 
direct  effect  on  the  ability  of  exploration  companies,  including  the  Company,  to  finance  project  acquisition  and 
development  through  the  equity  markets.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  funds  will  be  generated  from  the 
Company(cid:8217)s  current  funding  sources  or  that  other  forms  of  financing  can  be  obtained  at  a  future  date.  Failure  to 
obtain additional financing on a timely basis may cause the Company to postpone development plans, forfeit rights 
in some or all of the properties or joint ventures, or reduce or terminate some or all of the operations.
Price Volatility of Publicly Traded Securities (cid:8211) In recent months global securities markets have experienced a high 
level of price and volume volatility and the market prices of securities of many companies have experienced wide 
fluctuations in price that have not necessarily been related to the operating performance, underlying asset values or 
prospects of such companies. There can be no assurance that continual fluctuations in price will not occur.

future results, performance or achievements that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  
Important factors are identified in this MD&A. These statements are prepared as of the date of this MD&A and are 
expressly qualified, in their entirety, by this cautionary statement. 
 
In particular, this MD&A contains forward-looking statements pertaining to the following: 
 
1.  The Company(cid:8217)s business plans, 
2.  The impact of increasing competition, 
3.  Unpredictable changes to the market prices for minerals,

5.  The Company(cid:8217)s ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, and 
6.  The Company(cid:8217)s future investments and allocation of capital resources. 
 
With  respect  to  forward-looking  statements  listed  above  and  contained  in  the  MD&A,  the  Company  has  made 
assumptions regarding, among other things: 
 
1.  Volatility in market prices for minerals,

materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by 
these forward looking statements. 
 
While these forward looking statements and any assumptions upon which they are based are made in good faith and 
reflect  our  current  judgment  regarding  the  direction  of  our  business,  actual  results  will  almost  always  vary, 
sometimes  materially,  from  any  estimates,  predictions,  projections,  assumptions  or  other  future  performance 
suggested herein.
