QUARTERLY 
ACTIVITIES REPORT
for period ending:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
30 June 2016
1.  HIGHLIGHTS
1.  The Office of the WA Environmental Protection Authority (OEPA) accepted Toro’s Response to Submissions 
document following the 12 week public comment period for the Public Environmental Review  (PER) for an 
extension to the Wiluna Uranium Project1.
2.  The Chairman of the Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia (EPA), Dr Tom Hatton, fellow 
Board member Glen McLeod, and assessing officers from the OEPA visited the Wiluna Project site on 3 June.
3.  A mining agreement with the Wiluna People has been ratified by a community meeting, signed and has taken
immediate effect.
4.  Beneficiation results at Lake Maitland showed a four and a half times upgrade in the effective grade of the 
beneficiated  concentrate  to  9,968  ppm.  Beneficiation  testwork  program  has  been  expanded  to  a  scoping 
study level.

respectively.
6.  Cash balance at end of the quarter was $10.4M.
7.  H2 2016 cash receipts from R&D tax incentive refunds and non-core asset sales estimated to be in excess of
$2.5M.
8.  Vanessa Guthrie was appointed Chair of the Minerals Council of Australia.
2.  Corporate and Finance
The quarter end closing cash balance was $10.4M with H2 2016 cash receipts from R&D tax incentive refunds and 
non-core asset sales estimated to be in excess of $2.5M.
1 The Centipede and Lake Way deposits have been approved by federal (EPBC 2009/5174) and state government (Ministerial Statement No. 913) subject to 
conditions.
Toro’s Managing Director was appointed to the Chair of the Minerals Council of Australia in June for a period of 
two years.
3.  Uranium Market
Inventory overhang continues to frustrate uranium price recovery. Despite this a number of encouraging demand 
side news items appeared over the quarter including:
  Russia and Bangladesh signed a US$11.4B loan agreement paving the way for main construction work on


the 2.4Gwe Rooppur Nuclear power Plant; 
Shikoku  Electric  Power  Company  loaded  nuclear  fuel  into  its  Ikata  Unit  3  plant,  paving  the  way  for  a 
resumption to commercial operation in mid August as Japan's fifth reactor reactivated since the Fukushima 
accident (note that 2 reactors Takahama 1 and 2 were forced to close shortly after reactivation due to 
court injunction which is likely to be appealed in the High Court); 
French Economy Minister Macron urged state controlled power utility Électricité de France (EDF) to make 
the final investment decision to go ahead with the £18 billion (US$24 billion) Hinkley Point C nuclear power 
project in UK despite the country's vote to leave the EU;
  NuGen, the consortium behind the three-reactor Moorside plant in Britain, pledged that "Brexit" would not

derail multi-billion pound plans for a new nuclear power station in west Cumbria, England; and 
International Energy Agency report that nuclear power capacity additions hit 10.2GWe in 2015, the highest 
growth in 25 years driven by construction of new nuclear power plants, mainly in China.
Euratom Supply Agency published its Annual Report highlighting Australia’s continued role as an important supplier 
of uranium into the EU.
4.  Wiluna Uranium Project (Western Australia)
4.1.   Approvals and Community
Toro completed a Response to Submissions document to address all issues raised during the 12 week public review 
of the PER for mining at Millipede and Lake Maitland. There were 59 individual submissions made on the PER and 
2392  pro-forma  submissions.  Subsequent  to  the  reporting  date,  the  OEPA  advised  Toro  that  its  Response  to 
Submissions  had  been  accepted  for  consideration  by  the  EPA  Board  which  will  now  provide  a  report  and 
recommendations to the Western Australian Environment Minister. To inform the EPA’s assessment, the Chairman, 
Dr Tom Hatton, fellow Board member Glen McLeod and assessing officers from the OEPA visited the Wiluna Project 
site on 3 June. 
 
During  the  quarter,  negotiations  were  finalised  for  a  mining  agreement  with  the  Wiluna  /Tarlpa  Native  Title 
Holders. After seven years of negotiation, the agreement was ratified by a community meeting at Wiluna on 6 July 
and has taken immediate effect. The agreement is comprehensive and provides compensation for effects of the 
Project  on  native  title  and  cultural  heritage,  as  well  as  covering  a  range  of  other  important  issues  including 
environmental management and protection, liaison between Toro and the Native Title Holders, and employment 
and business development opportunities. The agreement also includes a detailed Cultural Heritage Management 
Plan.  The  agreement  covers  proposed  mining  at  Millipede,  Centipede  and  Lake  Way  as  well  as  the  project 
infrastructure and processing facilities.
(L-R Alan Ashwin, Vanessa Guthrie (Managing Director - Toro Energy), Dallas Harris, Vera Armstrong, Kelman Patch, Victor Ashwin)
Toro is also engaging with the Barwidgee People who claim an interest in land on which mining at Lake Maitland 
is proposed to be undertaken after the Millipede and Centipede deposits have been mined.
The Wiluna People
4.2.  Project Development
Based on significant resource upgrades at the Centipede, Millipede and Lake Maitland deposits during 2016, a re-
interpretation of the geology of the ‘calcrete hosted’ uranium deposits was completed during the quarter which 
has revealed an opportunity for beneficiation.  
 
There are two key findings that facilitate beneficiation:
  The Wiluna calcrete hosted uranium deposits are not restricted to and thus hosted by ‘calcrete’, in fact
there is very little ‘calcrete’ within the areas of economic mineralisation at all; and
  When there is little to no calcrete (concretions of carbonate) the uranium mineralisation (the ore mineral 
Carnotite)  is  often  concentrated  to  a  certain  fine  grained  size  fraction  slightly  larger  than  clay  (<5.5 
microns) and so can be isolated by the use of screens and cyclones.
Re-interpretation of the Wiluna deposits indicates they should be thought of as concentrations of uranium formed 
along  continuous  shallow  groundwater  channel  systems  loaded  with  Mg-Ca  carbonate.  That  is  the  uranium 
mineralisation is  related  to a shallow  carbonate groundwater  ‘system’ from which  calcrete or most commonly, 
dolocrete, can also form but to which the uranium is not always related. 
 
The definitive common host to all deposits are the shallow sediments through which the carbonate groundwater 
system flows. These sediments comprise a mixture of clays, silts and sands in varying proportions dependent upon 
the particular environment in which they have been deposited. Large areas of the deposits previously represented 
by  the  ‘calcrete’  lithology  unit  are  now  represented  by  ‘clay  sediment’,  ‘fine  grained  sediments  with  minor 
concretions of carbonate and silica’ and ‘semi-consolidated carbonate and silica with clay’.  
 
 
Beneficiation steps in the process flow sheet were not considered by Toro during past feasibility studies. The aim 
of the beneficiation process is to recover and concentrate uranium to a lower mass, higher grade concentrate. 
This will enable a smaller downstream processing plant due to the lower mass and potentially higher percent solids 
throughout the refinery.  
 
During the quarter Toro undertook a preliminary beneficiation testwork on a sample from the dominant geology 
within the Lake Maitland  deposit. The process  resulted in an increase of four  and a  half times in the effective 
grade of the beneficiated concentrate to 9,968 ppm (1.00%2) compared to the feed grade of the sample of 2,209 
ppm (0.20%) U3O8. Screens and cyclones were used to reject 80% of the total mass whilst maintaining 90% of the 
total uranium (recovery). 
 
A further six samples are now being tested from the Centipede, Millipede and Lake Maitland deposits to understand 
how beneficiation may apply to various types of lithologies from each of these deposits. Results are expected in 
the September quarter.
5.  Exploration
Toro  continues  to  work  towards  meeting  the  conditions  precedent  to  the  Heads  of  Agreement  (HoA)  with  OZ 
Minerals  Ltd  for  a  joint  venture on  nickel  exploration  on  two  exploration  tenements  in  the Lake Maitland land 
package. (Refer Appendix 1).  
 
The Joint Venture is targeting the Yandal One nickel prospect where shallow rotary air blast drilling in the 1990’s 
by prior tenement holders showed nickel grades of up to 0.45% average over 5 metres from end of hole.  Further 
follow-up exploration was not conducted.  
 
Further  rationalisation  of  exploration  tenements  that  are  prospective  for  minerals  other  than  uranium  is 
continuing.
