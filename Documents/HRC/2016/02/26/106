</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the obligation of States under the Charter to promote universal respect 
</p>
<p>for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the enhancement of international cooperation is essential for the 
</p>
<p>effective promotion and protection of human rights, which should be based on the 
</p>
<p>principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity of 
</p>
<p>States to prevent human rights violations and comply with their human rights obligations 
</p>
<p>for the benefit of all human beings, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the mandate of the Human Rights Council to promote advisory services, 
</p>
<p>technical assistance and capacity-building, to be provided in consultation with and with the 
</p>
<p>consent of States concerned, and provisions in Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 
</p>
<p>2007 and 16/21 of 25 March 2011 that aim to enable the Council to fulfil such a mandate,

<p><b> 
</b></p>

<p>the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, as 
</p>
<p>well as the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to their 
</p>
<p>communities of origin and destination and the need to identify appropriate means of 
</p>
<p>maximizing development benefits, to respond to the challenges that migration poses to 
</p>
<p>countries of origin, transit and destination, to promote dignified, humane treatment with 
</p>
<p>applicable protections and access to basic services, and to strengthen mechanisms for 
</p>
<p>international cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that States are responsible for promoting and protecting the human 
</p>
<p>rights of all persons, including irregular migrants, who are in their territory, and subject to 
</p>
<p>their jurisdiction, in accordance with their international human rights obligations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the shared responsibilities of countries of origin, transit and 
</p>
<p>destination in promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants and avoiding 
</p>
<p>approaches that might aggravate their vulnerability, bearing in mind the need to address  
</p>
<p>the special situation and vulnerability of migrant women and girls, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>deep concern</i> that the number of people who are forcibly displaced has 
</p>
<p>reached the highest level since the Second World War, and underlining that it is necessary 
</p>
<p>for Member States to respect their obligations under international law, including provision 
</p>
<p>of international protection, as appropriate, </p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the large and growing number of migrants, especially women 
</p>
<p>and children, including those unaccompanied or separated from their parents, who find 
</p>
<p>themselves in a vulnerable situation by attempting to cross international borders, and 
</p>
<p>recognizing the obligation of States to respect the human rights of those migrants in 
</p>
<p>accordance with their applicable international human rights obligations, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Encourages</i> Members and observers of the Human Rights Council to use, 
</p>
<p>where relevant, the general debate under agenda item 10 as a platform to share experiences, 
</p>
<p>challenges and information on assistance needed in the implementation of their human 
</p>
<p>rights obligations and voluntary pledges and commitments, including accepted universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review recommendations, as well as their achievements and good practices in the 
</p>
<p>area of technical cooperation in the field of human rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Emphasizes</i> that the discussion to promote technical cooperation and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building in the Human Rights Council should be based on consultations with and 
</p>
<p>the consent of the States concerned, and should take into account their needs, as well as the 
</p>
<p>fact that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and aim 
</p>
<p>to make a concrete impact on the ground; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Affirms</i> that technical cooperation should be an inclusive exercise that 
</p>
<p>engages and involves all national stakeholders, including government agencies and civil 
</p>
<p>societies, at all stages; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Reaffirms</i> <i>the need</i> for enhanced voluntary contributions to the relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations funds to support technical assistance and capacity-building, particularly the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the Voluntary Fund for participation in the universal periodic review and the Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Trust Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance for the Implementation of the Universal 
</p>
<p>Periodic Review, and encourages States to make contribution to these funds, especially 
</p>
<p>those who have not yet done so; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Welcomes</i> the panel discussion held under agenda item 10 at the twenty-
</p>
<p>eighth session of the Human Rights Council on the theme &#8220;Technical cooperation to 
</p>
<p>support inclusive and participatory development and poverty eradication at the national </p>


<p>level&#8221;, which underlined the importance of technical cooperation and capacity-building to 
</p>
<p>fill the gaps and support States in overcoming challenges in the implementation of their 
</p>
<p>national development and poverty eradication policies to ensure that such policies are 
</p>
<p>inclusive, participatory and leave no one behind; 
</p>
<p>6.<i> Underscores</i> <i>the importance</i> of international, regional and bilateral 
</p>
<p>cooperation and dialogue in the protection of the human rights of all migrants, particularly 
</p>
<p>at a time when both regular and irregular migration flows have increased in  
</p>
<p>the globalized economy and occur in a context of conflicts and continued security concerns, 
</p>
<p>while taking into account the multidimensional character of the migratory phenomenon; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> States, relevant international organizations, intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>bodies, civil society, including non-governmental organizations, and the private sector to 
</p>
<p>continue and to enhance their dialogue with a view to strengthening and making more 
</p>
<p>inclusive public policies aimed at promoting and respecting the human rights of all 
</p>
<p>migrants; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i>, in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of its resolution 18/18 of 29 
</p>
<p>September 2011, that the theme for the annual thematic panel discussion under agenda item 
</p>

</p>
<p>building to promote and protect the rights of all migrants, including women, children, older 
</p>
<p>persons and persons with disabilities&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to prepare a report on the activities undertaken by the Office, other relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies and, where applicable, regional organizations to support efforts by States 
</p>
<p>to promote and protect the rights of migrants in their national legislation, policies and 
</p>
<p>programmes, and to submit it to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-first session, to 
</p>
<p>serve as a basis for the thematic panel discussion, and to liaise with States, relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations bodies and agencies, relevant special procedures and other stakeholders, including, 
</p>
<p>where applicable, those involved in technical cooperation projects that demonstrate best 
</p>
<p>practices, constructive engagement and positive impact on the ground with a view to 
</p>
<p>ensuring their participation in the thematic panel discussion.
