<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth 
session from 21 January to 1 February 2013.  The review of Bahamas was held at the 6th 
meeting on 23 January 2013. The delegation of Bahamas was headed by Z. C. Allyson 
Maynard-Gibson, Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs, Office of the Attorney 
General and Ministry of Legal Affairs. At its 10th meeting held on 25 January 2013, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Bahamas. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Bahamas: Costa Rica, Gabon and Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued 
for the review of Bahamas: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/BHS/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/BHS/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/BHS/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland were 
transmitted to Bahamas through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of 
the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Head of Delegation congratulated the President of the Human Rights Council 
and thanked the troika members for the assistance rendered to her delegation in this 
process. 
</p>
<p>6. The Head of Delegation pointed out that their participation in this process was 
indicative of the significance which the Bahamas attributed to the promotion and protection 
of fundamental freedoms and human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. The Head of Delegation explained that the modern history of the Bahamas began 
with a quest for religious freedoms as, throughout the centuries, the people who settled 
these islands had assimilated a respect for human rights and the rule of law which continued 
to thrive. The Bahamas had been a place of refuge to tens of thousands of immigrants from 
Haiti, who had found access to employment, free education, health and social services, and 
full affirmation of their rights and dignity as people. Added to this matrix was a long and 
proud history of democracy and the rule of law, with a system of parliamentary democracy 
which could be traced back unbroken to 1729, making it the third oldest parliamentary 
system in the Western Hemisphere. It currently operated a vibrant participatory democracy 
based on the principle of separation of powers, with a Constitution providing for entrenched 
fundamental rights, an independent judiciary to enforce those rights and strong institutions </p>


<p>of civil society, which included an independent press, organized trade unions and the 
Church. 
</p>
<p>8. The Head of Delegation outlined a few general considerations which had important 
sociocultural, legal and institutional implications for the implementation of human rights on 
the domestic level. There were also two jurisprudential issues, which formed an important 
part of the legal and institutional framework of the human rights environment.  First, the 
Bahamas had a Constitution in force which entrenched many fundamental provisions, 
especially those related to fundamental rights and freedoms. To amend them required 
special procedures, parliamentary majorities and referenda. This truly reposed the final say 
in the hands of the people. 
</p>
<p>9. The Head of Delegation indicated that the Government had relaunched a 
Constitutional Reform Commission to conduct a comprehensive review, and to recommend 
changes to the Constitution by the end of March 2013, in advance of the fortieth 
anniversary of independence in July. The issues included: discrimination and gender 
equality; citizenship and nationality; distribution of state power vis-&#224;-vis individual rights; 
capital punishment; and conferral of full equal rights on women. This last would be put to 
referendum by June 2013. 
</p>
<p>10. The Commission&#8217;s Report would be accompanied by public consultation and 
education. 
</p>
<p>11. The Head of Delegation described the second jurisprudential issue: the dualist nature 
of the legal system that required the incorporation of international conventions into 
domestic law. Nevertheless, the Government was committed to this process and was 
determined to improve the domestication of such instruments. 
</p>
<p>12. On thematic considerations, the Head of Delegation reported that civil society had 
been involved more deeply in the preparation for the review. Consultations were held with 
key national stakeholders, namely representatives of all the major religious groups and 
representatives of civil society (including the official opposition). 
</p>
<p>13. On reporting obligations to the various treaty bodies and increasing dialogue with 
such bodies, the Head of Delegation acknowledged that there were still outstanding reports 
to several human rights instruments, due to technical and legal challenges. The Head of 
Delegation reported that a project management team was being established to conduct an 
audit of all international treaties to which they were party, with a view to identifying 
reporting obligations while welcoming offers of technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>14. On the creation of national human rights institutions, such as an ombudsman or 
human rights commission, the Head of Delegation clarified that the Bahamas had a 
&#8220;Westminster-style&#8221; Constitution where the Court constituted the primary human rights 
institution. The High Courts had almost unlimited powers to enforce fundamental rights. 
Nevertheless, the Bahamas was generally supportive of the concept of national human 
rights institutions, and their potential additional value. Thus, best practices thereon were 
being researched. 
</p>
<p>15. The Head of Delegation stated that a division had been formed to harmonize 
national legislation and international agreements. An inter-agency committee had also been 
established to oversee the implementation of convention mandates and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>16. The Head of Delegation acknowledged that there had been a delay in the 
implementation of both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), 
because they required amendments to the Constitution, and would therefore have to be 
subjected to the referendum process, which would require time and public education. 
Therefore, it was not in a position to ratify either the First Optional Protocol to the </p>


<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. With respect to the 
accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (OP-CEDAW), this could not be accomplished before the 
removal of the reservations to article 29. 
</p>
<p>17. Concerning the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
the involvement of children in armed conflict and the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, 
the Head of Delegation pointed out that, concerning the latter, domestic law prohibited the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. As the Bahamas was not 
involved in any armed conflict, the issue of ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict 
would be dealt with at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>18. On administration of justice, the Head of Delegation noted that the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office was implementing a number of initiatives to deal with the backlog of 
cases (particularly criminal). The most significant of these was the &#8220;Swift Justice&#8221; system, 
and its corollary, the integrated justice system, which provided an information system to 
manage serious cases (especially murder) from the investigative stage, and automation and 
connectivity of all the stakeholders in the criminal justice system (police, prosecutors, 
prison officials, courts, etc.). There were plans to create a Family Court to provide a suite of 
alternative dispute resolution support services, such as mediation and counseling and to 
harmonize more than twenty pieces of legislation.<b> </b>And, on treaty reporting, she stated 
national efforts and requested technical assistance could be maximized for timeliness and 
effective, synergistic implementation by United Nations clustering of relevant instruments. 
</p>
<p>19. The Head of Delegation referred to a programme called &#8220;Urban Renewal&#8221;, which 
was introduced to bring a social dimension to the administration of justice, and to address 
root causes. The main thrust of the programme was, therefore, to strengthen communities 
with social interventionist programmes administered by a cross-section of agencies, 
including the police, social service and health workers. 
</p>
<p>20. The Head of Delegation conveyed the current position of the Bahamas on the death 
penalty. She emphasized that death penalty had been on the statute books of the Bahamas 
since the inception of English common law in 1799. It had been mandatory for murder and 
treason until a seminal case in 2006, when the Privy Council had ruled that the relevant 
provisions of Bahamian law were to be construed as prescribing a discretionary, not a 
mandatory death sentence. In 2012, further judicial restrictions were imposed by the Privy 
Council ruling that the death penalty should only be imposed where the offence was 
deemed to be the &#8220;worst of the worst&#8221; or the &#8220;rarest of the rare&#8221;. The majority of the 
population, guided by strong Judeo-Christian principles, supported capital punishment. She 
noted that the international community was still very much divided on this issue. This issue 
would be before the Constitutional Reform Commission. Moreover, the last mandated 
execution had taken place 12 years prior, even in the absence of a formal moratorium. 
</p>
<p>21. On the issue of the legality of corporal punishment in specified circumstances, the 
Head of Delegation stated that it remained a practice under Bahamian law in two broad 
categories. The first was in respect of the legal right of parents or guardians, and the 
second, as punishment for criminal or prison disciplinary offences. 
</p>
<p>22. Notwithstanding the legal ability to employ corporal punishment in respect of 
minors, the Bahamas recognized the merit of behavioural modification mechanisms, and 
encouraged such disciplinary measures in lieu of physical discipline. The Head of 
Delegation conveyed their country&#8217;s desire to undertake a study on the effects of corporal 
punishment in the Bahamas. </p>


<p>23. The Head of Delegation explained that physical abuse of a child was punishable 
under the law of the Bahamas. The Government remained dedicated to granting full 
measure to protecting the rights of the child and addressing the issue of child abuse in the 
country. This was explicitly demonstrated in the integration (with a minor reservation) of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child into domestic legislation, via the Child 
Protection Act 2009. 
</p>
<p>24. The Head of Delegation explained the measures taken, where technical experts were 
presently designing a system whereby the birth of all infants born in the Bahamas, 
including on the far-flung islands of the archipelago, would be registered in a national 
database, which would also assist officials in processing claims for nationality. The 
Department of Social Services had also spearheaded the National Child Abuse Prevention 
Inter-Agency Protocol, which attempted to document current practices of abuse, and set out 
policies and procedures in respect of child protection issues. It was envisaged to be 
operational early in 2013. 
</p>
<p>25. The Head of Delegation addressed the allegations of sex tourism involving children 
in the Bahamas. After a comprehensive investigation, they had found no support for such 
claims. She noted that the Government had just granted permission for the Special 
Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, to visit during this 
year, upon her request. She reaffirmed to the international community that any credible 
reports of such activities would be vigorously investigated, pursued and prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>26. With respect to the rights of children born out of wedlock, and in answer to a 
question which had been asked, since the enactment of the Status of Children Act in 2002, 
the Head of Delegation stated that those children had equal status as those born to married 
persons in their legal relations to their parents, including inheritance rights. The notable 
exception had to do with the right to nationality, which could not be changed by the Act 
and would have to await constitutional amendment. 
</p>
<p>27. The Head of Delegation assured that the Bahamas enjoyed a free and very tolerant 
racial climate. The Government of the Bahamas was aware of recommendations to 
criminalize racial discrimination. However, after conducting extensive investigations in 
conjunction with several government agencies, no cases of discrimination on the basis of 
race had been identified to date. The Constitution of the Bahamas provided protection from 
racial discrimination and effective redress for violations of that right. 
</p>
<p>28. The Head of Delegation assured that the Government was acutely aware of the need 
to protect the rights of persons with physical or mental disabilities. In collaboration with the 
private sector, the Government had been active in efforts to provide support and promote a 
high quality of life for persons with disabilities and their participation in national 
development. Consultations to enact domestic legislation on disability were ongoing and it 
was anticipated during 2013 both to accede to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, and to enact legislation to give effect to that Convention. 
</p>
<p>29. On sexual orientation or gender identity, the Head of Delegation reported that the 
Bahamas Constitution, in its preamble, referred to its respect for Christian values. They 
believed that &#8220;family&#8221; was the foundation of a strong nation. Marriage in the Bahamas was 
the union of a man and a woman. There was no formal or positive legal discrimination 
against persons in the Bahamas based on sexual orientation or gender identity, although it 
was not included as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Constitution, or in 
legislation which prohibited discrimination in specific areas (such as employment). Neither 
had there been any reported cases where anyone had alleged discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation. There had been, within the past few years, a few instances of violence 
which had involved persons alleged to be &#8220;gay&#8221;. However, these incidents had been </p>


<p>domestic in nature, characterized by a dispute between the parties themselves, and had not 
been provoked by any form of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>30. The Bahamas had been the first country in the Commonwealth Caribbean (in 1991) 
to decriminalize consensual sex between persons of the same gender. Also, in 2010, and 
again during the current sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, the Bahamas had 
voted in support of the retention of language in a resolution condemning killings for any 
discriminatory reason to specifically include &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221; as a discriminatory 
ground for such killings. The Bahamas would remain engaged in the international 
discussions on the matter. 
</p>
<p>31. The Head of Delegation reported that, in 2009, a bill was tabled to amend the Sexual 
Offences and Domestic Violence Act to criminalize marital rape where the couple was 
living together. Consultation with civil society indicated that public opinion was strongly 
against the bill, and it was subsequently withdrawn. At the same time, spouses who might 
be subject to sexual abuse by their partners were not without legal protection under 
Bahamian laws such as the Domestic Violence (Protection Orders) Act. In addition, the 
Government had embarked, in schools, through its social agencies and in conjunction with 
civil society, on a variety of programmes to sensitize persons to this issue, which, it was 
hoped, would contribute to a decrease in domestic violence generally, including all forms of 
spousal violence. 
</p>
<p>32. The Head of Delegation noted that they were aware of the concerns with respect to 
the high incidents of reported rape. She told of steps taken to reduce such incidents, such as 
taking action to effectively investigate and prosecute rape cases and respond sensitively to 
the victims, when they did occur. On the Strategic Plan for the Management, Prevention 
and Elimination of Family Violence, she stated that a multi-disciplinary team had been 
established in March 2012 to review the plan and make recommendations on the way 
forward. The team expected to have the report completed by March 2013. 
</p>
<p>33. The Head of Delegation reiterated that the Bahamas had for many years attracted a 
steady flow of immigrants, mainly from its sister CARICOM (Caribbean Community) 
country of Haiti, although in recent times this had included vulnerable migrants from other 
countries. Such persons were housed in a detention centre until they could be repatriated to 
their countries, unless they qualified for refugee status after appropriate screening. Where 
children were involved, every effort was made to repatriate, determine refugee status or 
resettle them as quickly as possible. In this regard, the Department of Immigration adhered 
to guidelines based on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) mandates to screen immigrants to determine whether they were at risk of 
persecution in their country. The Government and UNHCR enjoyed a regular dialogue, 
whereby national asylum assessments were shared with UNHCR and, when necessary, 
advisory opinions were requested. In addition, the Government was reviewing existing 
policies in respect of both the Carmichael Road Detention Centre and asylum seekers. The 
Government had also begun a process of renovating the physical infrastructure at the 
Detention Centre, beginning with the refurbishment of plumbing facilities. 
</p>
<p>34. The Bahamas continued to engage in very close cooperation with the United States 
in addressing this issue, and members of the TIP (Trafficking in Persons) Committee had 
received American-sponsored training to identify and respond to victims and perpetrators of 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>35. The Government had undertaken several cross-cutting, bilateral and multilateral 
initiatives to deal with the scourge of trafficking in persons. In addition to putting in place 
the Trafficking in Persons (Prevention and Suppression) Act, 2008, it had established a 
National Inter-Agency Committee and Task Force, drafted national protocols for the 
Security Forces and Health and Social Services, conducted awareness programmes in </p>


<p>conjunction with civil society, and undertaken close cooperation and training with the 
United States. The Government remained committed to doing all it could to prevent and 
protect against trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>36. The Head of Delegation highlighted the reports of excessive use of force by the 
security forces, in particular the police, which continued to be of concern to the 
Government.  First, she pointed out that members of the security forces were subject to the 
jurisdiction of the civil courts, and over the past years several had been prosecuted for acts 
of violence in excess of their legal authority. There was also a complaints procedure which 
provided for complaints in respect of police officers to be investigated by the Complaints 
and Corruption Branch of the Police Force. She noted that, in accordance with the 2009 
Police Act, a civilian Police Complaints Inspectorate had been established to oversee 
complaints made against the police. 
</p>
<p>37. The Head of Delegation assured that the Government was fully committed to 
educating its populace on human rights issues, including introducing such training in the 
primary and secondary school curriculum. Although the Bahamas had not fully adopted the 
World Programme for Human Rights Education as laid out in 2005, there were numerous 
subjects taught in both primary and secondary schools that incorporated themes of human 
rights education. 
</p>
<p>38. The Head of Delegation noted that the Constitution of the Bahamas guaranteed 
freedom of expression and opinions, and human rights defenders in the Bahamas were 
accorded full respect and allowed to actively defend such rights without any restrictions or 
hindrance by the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>39. During the interactive dialogue, forty-five delegations made statements. 
Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present 
report. 
</p>
<p>40. New Zealand recognized the capacity and resource challenges the Bahamas faced as 
a small island developing State. It noted that the Bahamas had accepted a recommendation 
to consider acceding to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) 
and welcomed its accession to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It also welcomed the 
country&#8217;s acceptance of a recommendation to consider measures to promote tolerance and 
non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and thanked the Government for 
information provided on steps taken in that regard. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Norway was concerned about reported high incidences of domestic violence and 
acknowledged efforts to combat the problem. It observed the country&#8217;s efforts to improve 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights but expressed concern that corporal punishment of children still occurred 
</p>
<p>and was lawful. It noted that the Bahamas had accepted recommendations to consider 
measures to promote non-discrimination regarding sexual orientation. It noted also that the 
Bahamas retained the death penalty. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Paraguay congratulated the Bahamas on its efforts to address the needs of persons 
with disabilities, especially through various forms of financial assistance. It highlighted the 
legislative efforts made to combat and prevent trafficking in persons. It noted the new act 
on the protection of children which increased the age of criminal responsibility and 
encouraged the adoption of measures regarding violence against women. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>43. Peru acknowledged the commitment of the Government of the Bahamas to social 
development and to respect of the human rights of the country&#8217;s population. It highlighted 
the implementation of the Swift Justice programme, aimed at facilitating cooperation 
between institutions and judicial bodies, and national discussion encouraging meetings and 
public consultation on various issues affecting society. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. The Philippines noted that the withdrawal of the reservation to Article 16 (1) (h) of 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW) was a giant step forward towards the eventual elimination of discrimination 
against women. It hoped that the Bahamas would further strengthen the normative 
framework for migrants&#8217; rights in society. It welcomed intensified efforts to combat human 
</p>
<p>trafficking and the establishment of the interministerial committee on trafficking in persons. 
The Philippines made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>45. Portugal welcomed the ratification by the Bahamas of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, and the withdrawal of its reservation to article 16 (1) of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. It noted that the Bahamas had 
rejected the recommendation to abolish the death penalty in the first UPR cycle. Portugal 
recalled that the Bahamas had stated during the first cycle its intention to repeal laws 
authorizing judicial corporal punishment and requested information on steps taken to ensure 
children&#8217;s right to legal protection from all corporal punishment. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Singapore recognized the challenges faced by the country as a small island 
developing State and the progress made towards the Millennium Development Goals 
despite that. It noted the Government&#8217;s provision of free education from kindergarten to 
grade 12. It noted also the efforts to combat trafficking in persons, including the 
establishment of the Trafficking in Persons Task Force. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Slovakia commended the Bahamas for withdrawing its reservation to article 16 (1) 
of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, for 
its accession to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and for launching initiatives to combat 
violence against women, such as the campaign &#8220;Domestic Violence is Everyone&#8217;s 
Business&#8221;. It also noted the reported increase in the rate of primary education enrolment. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Slovenia noted that the Bahamas was combatting discrimination through the training 
of educators. It welcomed the fact that guidance counsellors provided education 
programmes to raise awareness among students of human rights, particularly regarding 
gender-based and racial discrimination. It welcomed the country&#8217;s ratification of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. South Africa commended the withdrawal by the Bahamas of its reservation to article 
16 (1) (h) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. It was encouraged by progress made in preparation for accession to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and, in that regard, would appreciate 
further information on the review of the draft legislation on disability. It noted the 
commitment of the Bahamas to combating discrimination through education. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Spain welcomed the delegation of the Bahamas and appreciated the participation of 
the country in the current process. It acknowledged efforts made in the field of human 
rights and commended particularly the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. It made recommendations. </p>


<p>51. Sri Lanka welcomed the enactment of the Child Protection Act, guided by the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. It noted that progress had been made in the 
advancement of women and that women served in high-level positions in the Bahamas. It 
welcomed the measures taken regarding trafficking in persons, including the establishment 
of the Trafficking in Persons Task Force in 2012. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Thailand welcomed the withdrawal by the Bahamas of its reservation to article 16 
(1) (h) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, thereby ensuring equal property rights for both spouses in a marriage. It noted the 
progress made in preparation for accession to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. It applauded efforts to overcome the challenges of trafficking in persons. 
Thailand expressed concern at particular legislation relating to women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s 
rights and referred to the treatment of female prisoners. It invited all countries to respond 
positively to requests for sharing good practices, assistance and technical cooperation to 
support enhancing human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Trinidad and Tobago noted the constraints of the Bahamas in relation to promoting 
and protecting human rights, but recognized its efforts therein, as evidenced by its 
ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It acknowledged the Government&#8217;s 
commitment and the services it provided to enhance the quality of life of its differently 
abled citizens. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Turkey appreciated that the Bahamas considered human rights as an integral part of 
social development and commended the Bahamian education system and high Human 
Development and Gender Equality Index. Turkey also commended the legislative work of 
the Bahamas towards harmonizing key areas of education, judiciary and criminal execution 
with international standards and the withdrawal of its reservation to Article 16 (1) of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Turkey 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted the efforts of the 
Bahamas to ensure that law enforcement forces observe, respect and protect human rights, 
to protect women&#8217;s rights and to combat violence against them. It urged the Bahamas to 
raise awareness of and to criminalize marital rape. It asked whether the Government had 
considered establishing a moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of the 
death penalty. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. The United States of America applauded the Bahamas for responding to concerns 
raised by several special rapporteurs and civil society representatives of poor conditions at 
the Carmichael Road Detention Centre; however, there were still reports that access to 
basic necessities and medical care was restricted and that physical abuse by officers was 
common. It appreciated efforts to combat discrimination, nevertheless harassment and 
violence against members of marginalized populations continued to surface. It commended 
the Bahamas for holding a human trafficking event, setting up a task force to handle 
specific allegations thereof and establishing official guidance protocols. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Uruguay highlighted the fact that despite the abrogation of the crime of 
homosexuality, certain legal loopholes generated discrimination against lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender persons. It noted that, while courts recognized property rights in 
de facto unions, there was no legal mechanism regulating such unions. It invited the 
Bahamas to prohibit all forms of violence against children in accordance with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, including corporal punishment. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>58. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela highlighted the Government&#8217;s progress 
concerning gender-based violence and gender equality, which was currently driving 
consultations in that area. It commended training sessions for the police on sexual crime 
and domestic violence with a view to effectively applying protection orders. It noted that 
women held high-level positions throughout society. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>59. Viet Nam was pleased to note the concrete initiatives and achievements of the 
Bahamas in protecting and promoting human rights reflected, inter alia, by its Human 
Development Index, its ratification of many international instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the establishment of the interministerial 
committee on human trafficking. It made recommendations.

implementing recommendations through &#8220;town hall&#8221; meetings to promote development and 
</p>
<p>dialogue. It commended the Bahamas on its Domestic Violence Act 2007, which 
comprehensively defined violence in the home and criminalized stalking and harassment. 
However, it was concerned that the term &#8220;partner&#8221; only referred to a relationship between a 
man and a woman and was hence discriminatory. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>85. In response to questions, comments and observations made during the interactive 
dialogue, the Head of Delegation responded by clarifying some issues, such as on 
citizenship, and recalled that they there had two jurisprudential issues as the Constitution 
required special procedures, parliamentary majorities and referenda for their change or 
amendment. On the death penalty, the Bahamas had consistently maintained this view and 
had been an active participant in the retentions group of countries (&#8220;Like-minded Group&#8221;) 
at the United Nations, which had maintained the position that the issue of the death penalty 
was a criminal one within the domestic jurisdiction of the State. This group had repeatedly 
reaffirmed that there was no international consensus on the issue of the death penalty and 
that every State had an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and 
cultural systems without interference in any form from another State. 
</p>
<p>86. Concerning disabilities, the Head of Delegation reiterated that consultations 
continued to enact domestic legislation on disability as well as to accede to the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>87. Regarding the Detention Centre, the Government was aggressively reviewing 
existing policies, with a view to identifying weaknesses and taking corrective action, and 
the Bahamas and the UNHCR enjoyed a regular dialogue and cooperation. Children were 
also placed in homes and no children were presently in the Detention Centre. In relation to 
asylum issues, the Department of Immigration adhered to guidelines based on the UNHCR 
mandates to screen immigrants to determine whether they were at risk of persecution in 
their country. 
</p>
<p>88. On the issue of trafficking, the Head of Delegation reiterated that after 
comprehensive investigation, the Government had found no support for claims of sex 
tourism. In fact, it had emerged in consultation with civil society that a local human rights 
group, funded by international aid agencies, had also conducted a survey, independent from 
the Government, and had come to a similar conclusion.    
</p>
<p>89. With respect to marital rape, the Head of Delegation noted that they were aware of 
the concerns of the Council and human rights treaty bodies with respect to this particular 
issue. In 2009, a bill was tabled to amend the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Act 
to criminalize marital rape where the couple was living together. Consultation with civil </p>


<p>society had indicated that public opinion was strongly against the bill, which was 
subsequently withdrawn. 
</p>
<p>90. The Head of Delegation also highlighted the progress made with &#8220;Swift Justice&#8221; 
system, in order not to repeat mistakes. 
</p>
<p>91. In closing, the Head of Delegation quoted the Preamble to the Constitution of the 
Bahamas as the ethos and guideline for the protection of human rights, namely: 
 Whereas Four hundred and eighty one years ago the rediscovery of this Family of 
</p>
<p>Islands, Rocks and Cays heralded the rebirth of the New World; 
 And WHEREAS the People of this Family of Islands recognise that the preservation 
</p>
<p>of their Freedom will guaranteed by national commitment to Self-discipline, 
Industry, Loyalty, Unity and abiding respect for Christian and the Rule of Law.  
</p>
<p> NOW KNOW YE THEREFORE:  
 We the inheritors of and Successors to this Family of Islands, recognising the 
</p>
<p>Supremacy of God and believing in the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the 
Individual, DO HEREBY PROCLAIM IN SOLEMN PRAISE the Establishment of 
Free and Democratic Sovereign Nation founded on Christian Values and in which 
no Man, Woman, child shall ever be slave or Bondsman to anyone or their Labour 
exploited or their Lives frustrated by deprivation, AND DO HEREBY PROVIDE by 
these Articles for the indivisible Unity and Creation under God of the 
Commonwealth of The Bahamas.
