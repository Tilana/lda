amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments,
to the
entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal

management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Dios Exploration Inc. as at December 31, 2013 and 2012 and
its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Emphasis of Matter
Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 2 in the financial
statements which indicates the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast
significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Dios Exploration Inc. (the “Company”) is a mining exploration and evaluation company with activities in Canada.
GOING CONCERN ASSUMPTION
The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the going concern assumption, meaning the Company will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations.
Given that the Company has not yet determined whether its mineral properties contain mineral deposits that are economically recoverable, the
Company has not yet generated income or cash flows from its operations. As at December(cid:160)31, 2013, the Company has a cumulated deficit of
$10,147,603 ($9,872,772 as at December 31, 2012). These material uncertainties cast significant doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as
a going concern.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional financing to further explore its mineral
properties. Even if the Company has been successful in the past in doing so, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in
the future.
The carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses presented in the financial statements and the classification used in the statement of
financial position have not been adjusted as would be required if the going concern assumption was not appropriate.
3.
GENERAL INFORMATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH IFRS
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The Company is incorporated under the Canada Business Corporation Act. The address of the Company's registered office is 4076, Kensington
Avenue, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Company's shares are listed ont the TSX Venture Exchange, under the symbol DOS.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Overall considerations
The significant accounting policies and measurement bases that have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements are summarized below.
4.2
Functional and presentation currency
These financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is also the functional currency of the Company.
4.3
Financial instruments
Recognition, initial measurement and derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus transactions costs, except for financial assets and financial liabilities
carried at fair value through profit or loss, which are measured initially at fair value.
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and all
substantial risks and rewards are transferred.
A financial liability is derecognized when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or when it expires.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Financial instruments (continued)
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets other than those designated and effective as hedging instruments are classified into the
following categories upon initial recognition:
-
-
-
loans and reveivables;
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; and
available-for-sale financial assets.
All financial assets, except fo those at fair value through profit or loss, are reviewed for impairment at least at each reporting date to identidy whether
there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Different criteria to determine impairment are applied
for each category of financial assets.
Objective evidence of impairment could include: significant financial difficulties on the part of the issuer or counterparty; breach of contract, such as a
failure to pay interest or principal; or increasing the probability of bankruptcy or other financial reorganization of the borrower.
The category determines subsequent measurement and whether any resulting income and expense is recognized in profit or loss or in other
comprehensive income. All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognized in profit or loss are presented within Finance costs or
Finance income, if applicable.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial
recognition, these are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the
effect of discounting is immaterial. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, guaranteed investment certificates and receivables from a mining
company are classified into this category of financial instruments.
Les prêts et créances sont des actifs financiers non dérivés à paiements fixes ou déterminables, qui ne sont pas cotés sur un marché actif. Après leur
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets that are either classified as held-for-trading or that meet certain conditions
and are designated at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition. The Company's listed shares are classified into this category of financial
instruments.
Assets in this category are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized in profit or loss. The fair value of financial assets in this category are
determined by reference to active market transactions.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for inclusion in any of
the other categories of financial assets. The Company's available-for-sale financial assets include investments in bank obligations. These assets were
disposed during the year 2013.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Net change in fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income and reported within
the available-for-sale reserve within equity, if applicable. When the asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss in Finance income or Finance costs, if applicable, and presented as a reclassification adjustment
within other comprehensive income.
Interest calculated using the effective interest method and dividends are recognized in profit or loss within Finance income.
Reversals of impairment losses are recognized in other comprehensive income, if applicable.
Classification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities
The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables.
Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
All interest-related charges are reported in profit or loss within Finance costs, if applicable.

4.4
SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Basic and diluted loss per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the
Company, and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares which include
options and warrants. Dilutive potential ordinary shares shall be deemed to have been converted into ordinary shares at the beginning of the period or,
if later, at the date of issue of the potential ordinary shares.
4.5
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in bank and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less, and that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes
in value.
4.6
Tax credits receivable
The Company is entitled to a refundable tax credit on qualified exploration expenses incurred and the refundable tax credit on duties for losses under
the Mining Tax Act . These tax credits are recognized as a reduction of the exploration and evaluation expenses incurred based on estimates made by
management. The Company records these tax credits when there is reasonable assurance with regards to collections and assessments and that the
Comapny will comply with the conditions associated to them.
4.7
Exploration and evaluation expenditures and exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation expenditures are costs incurred in the course of initial search of mineral resources before the technical feasability and
commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. Costs incurred before the legal right to undertake exploration and evaluation
activities are recognized in profit or loss when they are incurred.
Once the legal right to undertake exploration and evaluation activities has been obtained, all costs of acquiring mineral rights, expenses related to the
exploration and evaluation of mining properties, less refundable tax credits and credits on duties related to these expenses, are capitalized as
exploration and evaluation assets. Expenses related to exploration and evaluation include topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical
studies, exploration drilling, trenching, sampling and other costs related to the evaluation of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of
extracting a mineral resource. The various costs are capitalized on a property-by-property basis pending determination of the technical feasibility and
commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource. These assets are recognized as intangible assets and are carried at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. No depreciation expenses are recognized for these assets during the exploration and evaluation phase.
Whenever a mining property is considered no longer viable, or is abandoned, the capitalized amounts are written down to their recoverable amounts
(see Note 4.8), the difference is then immediately recognized in profit or loss.
When technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets related to the
mining property are transferred to property and equipment in Mining assets under construction. Before the reclassification, exploration and evaluation
assets are tested for impairment (See Note 4.8) and any impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss before reclassification.
To date, neither the technical feasibility nor the commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource has been demonstrated.
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to the mining properties in which it holds an interest, in accordance with industry practices for the
current stage of exploration and development of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the validity of the Company’s titles. Property titles
may be subject to unregistered prior agreements and non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
Disposal of interest in connection with option agreement
On the disposal of interest in connection with the option agreement, the Company does not recognize expenses related to the exploration and
evaluation performed on the property by the acquirer. In addition, the cash consideration received directly from the acquirer is credited against the
costs previously capitalized to the property, and the surplus is recognized as a gain on the disposal of exploration and evaluation assets in profit or loss.

4.8
SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (cash-generating
units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at a cash-generating unit level.
Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, an asset or cash-generating unit is reviewed
for impairment.
Impairment reviews for exploration and evaluation assets are carried out on a project by project basis, with each project representing a potential single
cash generating unit. An impairment review is undertaken when indicators of impairment arise, but typically when one of the following circumstances
apply:
- the right to explore the areas has expired or will expire in the near future with no expectation of renewal;
- no further exploration of evaluation expenditures in the area are planned or budgeted;
- no commercially viable deposits have been discovered, and the decision has been made to discontinue exploration in the area;
- sufficient work has been performed to indicate that the carrying amount of the expenditure carried as an asset will not be fully recovered.
Additionally, when technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resources are demonstrable, the exploration and evaluation
assets of the related mining property are tested for impairment before these items are transferred to property and equipment.
An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss for the amount by which the asset's or cash-generating unit's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
An impairment charge is reversed if the asset's or cash-generating unit's recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount.
4.9
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are recognized when present obligations as a result of a past event will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources from the
Company and amounts can be estimated reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. Provisions are measured at the estimated
expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence available at the reporting date, including the risks and
uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Provisions are discounted when the time value of money is significant.
The Company’s operations are governed by government environment protection legislation. Environmental consequences are difficult to identify in
terms of amounts, timetable and impact. As of the reporting date, management believes that the Company’s operations are in compliance with current
laws and regulations. Site restoration costs currently incurred are negligible. When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a
mineral resource have been demonstrated, a restoration provision will be recognized in the cost of the mining property when there is constructive
commitment that has resulted from past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation and the amount of the obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability.
In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, no liability is
recognized, unless it was assumed in the course of a business combination.
All provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. As at December 31, 2013 and 2012, there was no
provision recorded in the statement of financial position.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
4.10
Income taxes
Tax expense recognized in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity.
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal authorities relating to the current or prior reporting
periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is payable on taxable profit, which differs from profit or loss in the financial statements.
Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
However, since the Company is in exploration phase and has no taxable income, tax expense recognized in profit or loss is currently comprised only of
deferred tax.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and
their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business
combination or affects tax or accounting profit.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realization,
provided they are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the underlying tax loss or deductible temporary difference will be utilized
against future taxable income. This is assessed based on the Company's forecast of future operating results, adjusted for significant non-taxable income
and expenses and specific limits on the use of any unused tax loss or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Company has a right and intention to set off current tax assets and liabilities from the same
taxation authority.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized as deferred income tax expense in profit or loss, except where they relate to items that are
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also recognized in other comprehensive
income or equity, respectively.
4.11 Equity
Share capital
Share capital represents the amount received on the issue of shares. If shares are issued when options and warrants are exercised, the share capital
account also comprises the compensation costs or the fair value of warrants previously recorded as contributed surplus. In addition, if shares were
issued as consideration for the acquisition of a mineral property or some other form of non-monetary assets, they are measured at their fair value
according to the quoted price on the day immediately preceding the conclusion of the agreement.
Flow-through placements
Issuance of flow-through shares represents in substance an issue of ordinary shares and the sale of the right to tax deductions to the investors. When
the flow-through shares are issued, the sale of the right to tax deductions is deferred and presented as other liabilities in the statement of financial
position. The proceeds received from flow-through placements are allocated between share capital and other liabilities using the residual method.
Proceeds are first allocated to shares according to the quoted price of shares at the time of issuance and the residual proceeds are allocated to other
liabilities. The liability component recorded initially on the issuance of shares is reversed on renouncement of the right to tax deductions to the
investors and when eligible expenses are incurred and recognized in profit or loss in reduction of deferred income tax expense. A deferred tax liability
is also recognized for the taxable temporary difference that arises from the difference between the carrying amount of eligible expenditures capitalized
as an asset and its tax basis.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
4.11 Equity (continued)
Other elements of equity
Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale financial assets net of relevant income taxes.
Contributed surplus includes charges related to share options and warrants not exercized. When share options and warrants are exercized, the related
compensation cost is transferred to share capital.
Deficit includes all current and prior period retained profits or losses and issuances costs of equity instruments, net of any underlying income tax
benefit from these issuance costs.
4.12 Equity-settled share-based payments
The Company operates equity-settled share-based payment plans for its eligible directors, employees and consultants. None of the Company’s plans
feature any options for a cash settlement.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payments are measured at their fair values, unless that fair value cannot be
estimated reliably. If the entity cannot estimate reliably the fair value of the goods or services received, the entity shall measure their value indirectly by
reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. For the transactions with employees and others providing similar services, the Company
measured the fair value of the services received by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
All equity-settled share-based payments (except equity-settled share-based payments to brokers) are ultimately recognized as an expense in the profit
or loss or capitalized as an exploration and evaluation asset, depending on the nature of the payment with a corresponding credit to contributed surplus,
in equity. Equity-settled share-based payments to brokers, in respect of an equity financing are recognized as issuance cost of the equity instruments
with a corresponding credit to contributed surplus, in equity.
The expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Non -market
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently
revised if there is any indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to
vesting is recognized in the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognized in prior period if share options ultimately exercised are
different to that estimated on vesting.

The Company presents and discloses segmental information based on information that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker, i.e.
the Chairman and the Board of Directors. The Company has determined that there was only one operating segment being the sector of exploration and
evaluation of mineral resources.
4.14 New and revised standards that are effective
A number of new and revised standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Information on theses new standards is
presented below.
Adoption of amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income
The Company has adopted Presentation of items of other comprehensive income (amendments to IAS 1). The amendments to IAS 1 require entities to
group items presented in other comprehensive income into those that, in accordance with other IFRS, will not be reclassified subsequently to profit of
loss and those that will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met. The existing option to present items of other
comprehensive income either before tax or net of tax remain unchanged; however, if the items are presented before tax, then the amendments to IAS1
required the tax related to each of the two groups of other comprehensive incore to be shown separately. The amendments have been applied
retrospectively, and only the presentation of items of other comprehensive income has been modified to reflect the changes. The application of the
amendments did not result in any other impact.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
4.14 New and revised standards that are effective (continued)
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IFRS 13 clarifies the definition of fair value and provides related guidance and enhanced disclosures about fait value measurements. It does not affect
the items that are required to be fair-valued.
The scope of IFRS 13 is broad and applies for both financial and non-financial items for which other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements
of disclosures about fair value measurements except in certain circumstances.
IFRS 13 applies prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. Its disclosure requirements need not be applied to comparative
information in the first year of application.
Management reviewed its valuation methodologies and the application of the new standard did not have any effect on the fair value measurement.
4.15
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company
At the date of authorization of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been
published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Company.
Management anticipates that all of the pronouncements will be adopted in the Company's accounting policy for the first period beginning after the
effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Company's
financial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have an impact on the
Company's financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) aims to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements in its entirety
with IFRS 9. To date, the chapters dealing with recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities as well as
the chapter dealing with hedge accounting have been published. The chapter dealing with impairment methodology is still being developed. In
November 2011, the IASB decided to consider making limited modifications to IFRS 9 financial asset classification model to address application
issues. In addition, in November 2013, the IASB decided to defer to a date to be announced the implementation of IFRS 9. The Company's
management has yet to assess the impact of this new standard on the Company's financial statements. Management does not expect to implement IFRS
9 until has been completed and its overall impact can be assessed.
5.
JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
When preparing the financial statements, management undertakes a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions about recognition and
measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Significant management judgements
The following are significant management judgments in applying the accounting policies of the Company that have the most significant effect on the
financial statements.
Recognition of deferred income tax assets and measurement of income tax expense
Management continually evaluates the likehood that its deferred tax assets could be realized. This requires management to assess whether it is probable
that sufficient taxable income will exit in the future to utilize these losses within the carry-forward period. By its nature, this assessment requires
significant judgment. To date, management has not recognized any deferred tax assets in excess of existing taxable temporary differences expected to
reverse within the carry-forward period (see Note 4.10).

JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS (continued)
Going concern
The assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to raise sufficient funds to pay for its ongoing operating expenditures,
meets its liabilities for the ensuing year and to fund planned and contractual exploration programs, involves judgments based on historical experience
and other factors including expectation of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. See Note 2 for more information.
Estimation uncertainty
Information about estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and
expenses is provided below. Actual results may be substantially different.
Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets
Determining if there are any facts and circumstances indicating impairment loss or reversal of impairment losses is a subjective process involving
judgment and a number of estimates and interpretations in many cases (see Note 4.8).
When an indication of impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss exists, the recoverable amount of the individual asset must be estimated.
In assessing impairment, the Company must make some estimates and assumptions regarding future circumstances, in particular, whether an
economically viable extraction operation can be established, the probability that the expenses will be recover from either future exploitation or sale
when the activities have not reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves, the Compan'ys capacity to obtain
financial resources necessary to complete the evaluation and development and to renew permits. Estimates and assumptions may change if new
information becomes available. If, after expenditure is capitalized, information becomes available suggesting that the recovery of expenditure is
unlikely, the amount capitalized is written off in profit or loss in the period when the new information becomes available.
There were no write-off of exploration and evaluation asset as at December 31, 2013 ($24,368 as at December 31, 2012). No reversal of impairment
losses has been recognized for the reporting periods.
For the properties Hotish, Pontax, AU33 ouest and Shipshaw, no testing for impairment was conducted despite the fact that the carrying value of the
Company's net asset is superior to its market capitalization and despite the fact that no significant fieldwork was undertaken on certain properties
during the year. Management judged that there was no testing for impairment required this year on those properties because despite an unfavourable
change of the overall climate of the sector as well as the general situation of the economy that have had an impact on the Company's capacity to raise
additional capital in order to pursue its exploration activities, coupled with a decrease in the share price, the Company has sufficient funds to respect
its short term obligations and has both the intention and capacity to keep these properties until the economic context improves and the company can
pursue exploration activities on the properties after raising additional capital.
Share-based payments
The estimation of share-based payment costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs necessary for
the valuation model chosen. The Company has made estimates as to the volatility of its own share, the probable life of share options granted and the
time of exercise of those share options. The model used by the Company is the Black-Scholes valuation model (see Note 10.2).
Tax credits receivable
The calculation of the Company's refundable tax credit on qualified exploration expenditure incurred and refundable tax credit involves a degree of
estimation and judgment in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until a notice of assessment has been issued by
the relevant taxation authority and payment has been received. Difference arising between the actual results following final resolution of some of these
items and the assumptions made could necessitate adjustments to the refundable tax credit and refundable tax credit, exploration and evaluation assets,
and income tax expense in future periods. See Note 4.6 for more information.

EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION (continued)
Share-based payments (continued)
On December 13, 2012, the Company granted 995,000 options exercisable at $0.15 to officers, directors and employees of the Company
under its incentive stock option plan. The options have a term of five years and can be exercised gradually over a period of eighteen months.
On February 28, 2012, the Company granted 995,000 options exercisable at $0.235 to officers, directors and employees of the Company
under its incentive stock option plan. The options have a term of five years and can be exercised gradually over a period of eighteen months.
No options were granted in 2013.
The weighted fair value of the granted options in 2012 of $0.13 per option granted (no options granted in 2013) was determined using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model and based on the following weighted average assumptions:
Average share price at date of grant
Expected dividends yield
Expected weighted volatility
Risk-free interest average rate
Expected average life
Average exercise price at date of grant
2012
$0.19

The underlying expected volatility was determined by reference to historical data of the Company’s shares over a period of five years. No
special features inherent to the options granted were incorporated into measurement of fair value.
An amount of $114,251 of employee remuneration expense (all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions) were
included in profit or loss for the reporting period ended December 31, 2013 ($207,187 for the reporting period ended December(cid:160)31, 2012)
and credited to contributed surplus.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
11.1
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three levels of a fair value
hierarchy. The three levels are defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:
– Level 1:
– Level 2:
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly; and
– Level 3:
unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities.
The fair value of listed shares was determined according to the quoted price at the reporting date. As at December 31, 2012, the fair value of
investments in bank obligations was determined from the calculation of discounted cash flows using the effective interest rate that could get
the Company at the closing date for similar instruments.
Listed shares measured at fair value in the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2013 and 2012, are classified in Level 1. As at
December 31, 2012, the investments in bank obligations were classified in Level 2.
11.2
Financial instruments measured at amortized cost for which the fair value is disclosed
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, guaranteed investment certificates, receivables from a mining company, trade and other
payables is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

The calculation of basic loss per share is based on the loss for the period divided by the weighted average number of shares in circulation
during the period. In calculating the diluted loss per share, dilutive potential ordinary shares such as share options and warrants have not
been included as they would have the effect of decreasing the loss per share. Decreasing the loss per share would be antidilutive. Details of
share options and warrants issued that could potentially dilute earnings per share in the future are given in Notes(cid:160)9.2 and 10.2.
Both the basic and diluted loss per share have been calculated using the net loss as the numerator, i.e. no adjustment to the net loss was
necessary in 2013 and 2012.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
The Company's capital management objectives are :
1.(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160) To ensure the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern;
2.(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160) To increase the value of the assets of the business; and
3.(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160)(cid:160) To provide an adequate return to shareholders.
These objectives will be achieved by identifying the right exploration projects, adding value to these projects and ultimately taking them
through to production or sale and cash flow, either with partners or by the Company’s own means.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of equity.
The Company is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements except when the Company issues flow-through shares for
which an amount should be used for exploration work. See all the details in Notes 9.1 and 19.
The Company finances its exploration and evaluation activities principally by raising additional capital either through private placements or
public offerings. When financing conditions are not optimal, the Company may enter into option agreements or other solutions to continue
its activities or may slow its activities until conditions improve.
18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISKS
The Company is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities by category are
summarized in Note 11. The main types of risks the Company is exposed to are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company manages risks by working closely with the Board of Directors. The Company focuses on actively securing short- to medium-
term cash flows by minimizing the exposure to financial markets.
The most significant financial risks to which the Company is exposed are described below.
18.1
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. At
Decembre 31, 2013, the Company is exposed to the following type of market risk: other price risk sensitivity.
Other price risk sensitivity
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in the market prices of its listed shares. The fair value of the listed shares represents the maximum
exposure to price risk.
If the quoted stock price for these listed shares had changed by ± 20% as at December 31, 2013 and 2012, other comprehensive loss and
equity would have changed by $11,314 ($13,215 in 2012).
18.2
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that another party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the Company by failing to discharge an
obligation.
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets at the reporting date, as summarized
below:
Cash and cash equivalents
Guaranteed investment certificates
Receivables from a mining company
Investments in bank obligations
Carrying amounts

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT RISKS (continued)
18.2
Credit risk (continued)
As at Decembre 31, 2012, receivables from a mining company is considered limited. The Company continuously monitors defaults of
counterparties. No impairment loss has been recognized in the periods presented.
The Company’s management considers that all the above financial assets that are not impaired or past due for each of the reporting dates
under review are of good credit quality.
No allowance for credit losses was recognized as at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external
credit ratings.
18.3
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by
delivering cash or another financial asset.
Liquidity risk management serves to maintain a sufficient amount of cash and to ensure that the Company has financing sources such as
private and public investments for a sufficient amount.
During the year, the Company has financed its exploration and evaluation programs, its working capital requirements and acquisitions of
mining properties through last years private and flow-through financings.
Trade and other payables for an amount of $113,146 have contractual maturities of less than 3 months on December 31, 2013 ($152,029 on
December 31, 2012). The Company considers cash flows from financial assets in assessing and managing liquidity risk, in particular its
cash and cash equivalents and tax credits receivable. Cash and cash equivalents and tax credits receivable exceed the current outflow
requirements.
20.
CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
The Company is partially financed through the issuance of flow-through shares and, according to tax rules regarding this type of financing,
the Company is engaged in realizing mining exploration work.
These tax rules also set deadlines for carrying out the exploration work, which must be performed no later than the earlier of the following
dates:
-
-
Two years following the flow-through placements;
One year after the Company has renounced the tax deductions relating to the exploration work.
However, there is no guarantee that the Company's exploration expenses will qualify as Canadian exploration expenses, even if the
Company is committed to taking all the necessary measures in this regard. Refusal of certain expenses by the tax authorities would have a
negative tax impact for investors.
During the reporting period, the Company received $90,000 (nil for 2012) following flow-through placements for which the Company
renounced tax deductions on December 31, 2013. The management is required to fulfill its obligations in the period of one year from the
date of renouncement.
The balance on flow-through financing not spent represents $90,000 at December 31, 2013. The Company has to dedicate these funds to the
exploration of Canadian mining properties exploration.
