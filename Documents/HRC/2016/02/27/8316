<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report provides an overview of the human rights situation in Guatemala 
and the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights in Guatemala (OHCHR-Guatemala) during 2011. In compliance with its 
mandate, OHCHR-Guatemala conducted monitoring activities and provided advisory and 
technical assistance to State institutions and civil society to assist in the implementation of 
the international human rights obligations of Guatemala and the recommendations 
contained in previous reports. 
</p>
<p> As a new Government is to take office in January 2012, the High Commissioner 
reaffirms that the time has come to implement an agenda of urgent actions to address 
important, long-standing gaps in the enjoyment of human rights, such as reducing the high 
levels of insecurity, impunity and poverty, putting an end to malnutrition and eradicating 
discrimination and violence against women. A part of the report is also dedicated to the 
situation of indigenous peoples and the structural discrimination suffered in the political, 
economic, cultural and social spheres. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner also calls on the State to implement the recommendations 
made in previous reports, and stresses that the examination of Guatemala under the 
universal periodic review mechanism during 2012 should be seen as an opportunity for the

<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 January 2005, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) signed an agreement with the Government of Guatemala for the 
establishment of a country office. Under the agreement, the functions of OHCHR-
Guatemala are to monitor the human rights situation and provide advice to State institutions 
and civil society. The agreement was extended for a second time, for three years, on 19 
September 2011. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report provides an overview of the human rights situation in Guatemala, 
focusing on several key issues. It also describes the work conducted by OHCHR-Guatemala 
and includes a series of recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. National context 
</b></p>
<p>3. In 2011, the national political context was marked by general elections. On 11 
September, voting for President, Congress, the Central American Parliament, mayors and 
municipal councils took place. As the required majority was not obtained in the Presidential 
election, a second round was held on 6 November, and former general Otto P&#233;rez Molina 
was elected as President. No party obtained sufficient seats for a majority in Congress. 
</p>
<p>4. Campaign debates were dominated by the issue of insecurity. Candidates appeared 
to focus on ways to combat insecurity through mostly repressive measures (including a 
return to the application of death penalty), rather than addressing root causes or proposals 
for a preventive approach. Human rights issues were mostly absent from the debate. The 
High Commissioner issued a public statement urging candidates to include human rights 
priorities at the top of the political agenda. 
</p>
<p>5. A historic number of voters were registered for this election (7,340,841). For the 
first time, women constituted the majority. The number of registered voters from 
indigenous departments increased substantially. The overall level of voter participation was 
68.4 per cent in the first round and 60.8 per cent in the second round. Nevertheless, the 
proportion of elected indigenous and women candidates did not increase compared to 
previous elections, which reflects a contrast between electoral participation and 
representation. 
</p>
<p>6. According to the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson, more than 160 acts of 
violence took place during the electoral period. These included assassinations, attacks and 
threats affecting delegates from the Supreme Electoral Court, political parties, candidates 
and their family members and party sympathizers. Investigations into these incidents have 
yet to lead to effective prosecutions. The lack of transparency on party funding and the 
extremely limited control and sanctioning power of the Supreme Electoral Court reinforce 
the need to reform the Law on Elections and Political Parties (Decree No. 1-85 of 1985). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Overall human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>7. High rates of violence and impunity in the country continued to be linked to the 
generalized weakness of public institutions and the lack of a comprehensive State policy to 
combat them. Investigations carried out by the Attorney General, head of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, with the support of the International Commission against Impunity in 
Guatemala (CICIG) continued to reveal the expansion of organized criminal networks. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. Although advances in the criminal investigation and prosecution in emblematic 
cases were notable, necessary reforms of the justice sector to overcome impunity remain 
unaccomplished. 
</p>
<p>9. The poverty rate has increased by 2.71 per cent since 2006, reaching 53.71 per cent 
of the population (7.8 million), while extreme poverty declined by 1.87 per cent, affecting 
13.3 per cent of the population (1.9 million).1 Although Guatemala is classified as a middle-
income country, its Human Development Index is lower than that of other countries of 
Central America with lower incomes.2 Regarding children underweight for age (under 5), 
Guatemala is in a position similar to some of the poorest countries in the world,3 which 
have a per capita income 10 per cent that of Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>10. These figures reveal that, as in previous years, economic growth and the 
implementation of targeted social programmes, such as conditioned cash transfer 
programmes, were insufficient on their own to eliminate the structural causes that lead to 
poverty.4 Although there has been an increase of social expenditure&#8212;up by 5.5 per cent of 
the gross national product5&#8212;Guatemala is still the second-to-last of the 21 countries in the 
region, well below the average of 18 per cent.6 
</p>
<p>11. No political agreements were reached to adopt fiscal reforms. During 2011 the tax 
revenue was 10.3 per cent of the gross domestic product, while the Peace Agreements of 
1996 had established the goal of 12 per cent by 2000 (later postponed to 2002). The High 
Commissioner has reiterated that under-budgeting of State institutions has been one of the 
main obstacles to complying with international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>12. The situation of indigenous peoples epitomizes the structural patterns of racism and 
discrimination that persist in Guatemala, to a degree that could amount to segregation. The 
exclusion of indigenous peoples was observed in all spheres, including land ownership, 
access to basic services, labour conditions, access to the formal economy and to justice, 
participation in public decision-making processes and State institutions, and representation 
in mainstream media and public debate.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Security and justice 
</b></p>
<p>13. The State continued to lack a strategic policy to combat insecurity and impunity. 
The failure to implement the National Agreement for the Advancement of Security and 
Justice,7 approved in 2009 by all branches of power, puts into question the political will to 
make urgently needed structural changes. 
</p>
<p>14. Draft laws relevant to human rights protection in the areas of security and justice, 
including reforms to the judicial and prosecutorial careers, the laws on <i>amparo </i>(writ of 
protection), impeachment, arms and ammunitions, corruption, as well as on the reparations 
programme and a search commission for victims of enforced disappearance, were still not

<p>approved by Congress. No effective oversight or control mechanisms for the 
implementation of adopted legislation were applied by Congress. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Security 
</b></p>
<p>15. Worrying levels of insecurity continued, generating mistrust and despair among the 
population. According to the National Civilian Police (NCP), from 1 January to 31 August, 
there were 3,806 violent deaths, including 448 women and 295 children; 4,162 people were 
injured as a result of violent attacks, and 34 deaths and 15 injuries resulted from lynching. 
However, the numbers on lynching reported by the Human Rights Ombudsperson (39 
deaths and 160 injured) suggest significant underreporting by the NCP. 
</p>
<p>16. The violence caused by organized crime was of particular concern. On 15 May, 27 
peasants, including two women and two children, were beheaded by members of an 
organized criminal group in La Libertad, El Pet&#233;n. The homicide and dismembering of 
Allan Stowlinsky, an auxiliary prosecutor in Cob&#225;n, Alta Verapaz, two weeks later 
appeared related to this act, as he was investigating cases relating to drug trafficking and 
organized crime. These cases illustrated the State&#8217;s weakness in protecting its population 
and its loss of territorial control, leaving Guatemalans vulnerable in the face of organized 
crime. 
</p>
<p>17. Two states of emergency were declared: one in response to the increased presence of 
organized crime in Alta Verapaz (December 2010 to January 2011) and one following the 
massacre of 27 peasants in El Pet&#233;n (May to August 2011). OHCHR-Guatemala considers 
that measures that could better have an impact on the decrease of violence (i.e. increased 
presence by security forces, better inter-institutional coordination and effective weapons 
control), should have been taken under non-exceptional conditions. 
</p>
<p>18. The NCP has a total of 24,255 active officers, which corresponds to 1.68 officers per 
1,000 inhabitants, far below the international standard of 4 per 1,000.8 This makes the 
reform of the NCP all the more urgent, including effective mechanisms for selection, 
internal monitoring, accountability and modifications to the police career, training and 
incentives. 
</p>
<p>19. The State continued delegating citizen security functions to private companies, with 
minimal accountability. Guatemala has one of the highest ratios worldwide of private 
security officers to police officers.9 The High Commissioner has repeatedly expressed 
concern over the fact that private security companies have substituted the State in providing 
security, without adequate registration or control. Although the General Directorate for 
Private Security Services was put in place in 2011 to perform these functions, there is 
concern that it does not have the adequate resources or institutional backing to fulfil its 
mandate. 
</p>
<p>20. Delegation of citizen security functions to the military was revealed in the issuance 
of Governmental Decree No. 216-2011, which authorizes the military to expand without 
any limit the number of its forces &#8213;according to the current national security needs&#8214;. This 
measure differs from previous ones issued in 2004 and 2009 that clearly established a 
maximum of military forces, following the spirit of the Peace Agreements.

</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/2006/10/Add.1 and Corr. 2), para. 27, endnote 10. 
 9 The Small Arms Survey 2011 estimates that the ratio of private security officers to National Civilian 
</p>
<p>Police officers is 6:1 (<i>Small Arms Survey 2011: States of Security</i> (Geneva, 2011), p. 105). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>7 
</b></p>
<p>21. In the departments of Quetzaltenango, San Marcos and Solol&#225;, OHCHR-Guatemala 
observed that local security committees10 and security commissions11, originally constituted 
under the notion of community-based crime prevention, in some cases carried out State 
security functions, including territorial control and the use of force, with the acquiescence 
or direct participation of local authorities. In Solol&#225;, OHCHR-Guatemala received 
complaints of severe abuses and illegal detentions committed by members of these bodies. 
</p>
<p>22. The authorities should derogate General Order 11-99 of the NCP, which established 
local security committees, as it blurs the State&#8217;s obligation to guarantee human rights, 
specifically those related to liberty, security and justice. They should also implement 
operational and normative measures that clearly define community participation in crime 
prevention, guaranteeing that citizens do not carry out State security functions.  
</p>
<p>23. The legal framework on arms and ammunitions and its interpretation by the 
Constitutional Court allows for unlimited numbers of arms per person and inadequate 
controls over the possession of arms and ammunitions. In a country where 82 per cent of 
violent deaths12 were committed with firearms, the State has a responsibility to amend the 
aforementioned legal framework and urgently implement a public policy on disarmament, 
to ensure and guarantee the right to life. 
</p>
<p>24. The penitentiary system continued to face serious challenges, including 
overcrowded detention facilities with precarious living conditions and frequent allegations 
of ill-treatment. The regulations to implement the 2006 Law on the Penitentiary System 
(Decree 33-2006) have not yet been approved.  
</p>
<p>25. Despite the approval of Decree 40-2010 on the creation of a national torture 
prevention mechanism, the selection process has so far not complied with the principles of 
transparency, objectivity, suitability and publicity, and was stalled in the Congressional 
Human Rights Commission.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Justice 
</b></p>
<p>26. The High Commissioner welcomes the important results obtained in investigations 
by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in high-profile cases relating to corruption by public 
servants, drug trafficking and organized crime, such as the bombing of a bus in Ciudad 
Quetzal in January, the massacre of 27 people in El Pet&#233;n and the assassination of an 
auxiliary prosecutor in Alta Verapaz, in May. These actions demonstrated a strengthened 
institutional commitment to combat impunity and the political will of the authorities within 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to cooperate and coordinate 
actions. It is expected that this will evolve into a permanent and sustainable institutional 
mechanism. The technical support provided by CICIG certainly contributed to achieving 
these results. 
</p>
<p>27. Overcoming impunity requires that such progress is achieved in all institutions of 
the justice system, particularly in the Judiciary. To this end, it is essential to overcome 
obstacles regarding the independence of the Judiciary. However, no effective measures 
were taken to guarantee that judges are able to impart justice protected from improper 
interferences, with full impartiality, transparency and accountability.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
 10 Local security committees are regulated by General Order 11-99 of the National Civilian Police. 
 11 Security commissions were established under article 24 of the Law on Urban and Rural Development 
</p>
<p>Councils (Decree 11-2002).

</p>
<p>28. The Supreme Court of Justice has yet to demonstrate its readiness to implement 
reforms that would allow for a separation of administrative functions (e.g. appointment and 
relocation of judges) from jurisdictional ones.  
</p>
<p>29. In addition, the disciplinary regime in the Judiciary and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office still did not ensure agile, objective and transparent procedures that respect 
guarantees of due process. Current procedures do not allow for the removal of public 
servants who do not perform their duties in an independent and impartial manner.  
</p>
<p>30. Congress should prioritize the discussion and approval of the necessary legal 
reforms to the career system in the Judiciary and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, including 
the proposed constitutional reform in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>31. Programmes driven by the Supreme Court of Justice to combat impunity and 
corruption have not yet shown results. Under its new leadership, the Court has the 
opportunity to carry out the transformations that are urgently needed, in particular with 
regard to the judicial career, in full compliance with international standards.  
</p>
<p>32. In a positive development during 2011, crucial decisions by the Constitutional Court 
regarding cases of adoption, the legal personality of indigenous authorities and the right to 
consultation have shown an increasing application of international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>33. Relevant progress was made in 2011 in the investigation, prosecution and trial of 
those responsible for serious human rights violations committed during the internal armed 
conflict. The High Commissioner welcomes this progress and acknowledges the efforts by 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, victims and civil society organizations to confront and break 
current patterns of impunity. The High Commissioner further welcomes actions taken to 
restore victims&#8217; dignity and the formal apologies by the State to honour the memory of 
</p>
<p>victims, as well as the creation of a unit in the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to investigate 
crimes committed by non-State actors during the internal armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>34. An encouraging development is the progress achieved in the investigation of the first 
case of genocide, which includes the presentation of charges against a former Chief of Staff 
of the Armed Forces on 6 September, relating to the atrocities committed in the Ixil region 
in 1982 and 1983. For the first time, the racial character of the violence suffered during the 
internal armed conflict is being recognized.  
</p>
<p>35. In a historical trial in the case of the 1982 massacre in Dos Erres<i>, </i>concluded on 2 
August, the court found four former military officers guilty of &#8213;crimes against the duties of 
</p>
<p>humankind&#8214; and assassination, and ordered the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to continue 
investigations until all those responsible are brought to justice. This ruling, as well as the 
detention of four high-ranking military officers in June and October, and of two high-
ranking police officers in April and July suspected of serious human rights violations, sends 
an encouraging message that justice is possible in Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>36. Nonetheless, intimidations, threats and attacks suffered by some victims, witnesses 
and judicial operators in proceedings relating to cases from the past remain an obstacle to 
the fulfilment of the rights to truth and justice. The Attorney General was also subject to 
pressure as these cases moved forward in the justice system. 
</p>
<p>37. The achievements of the National Reparations Programme should be strengthened 
and ensured through the provision of some form of institutional sustainability. The main 
forms of reparation under the Programme have been financial, while other important 
aspects, such as psychosocial care and symbolic reparations, including culturally and 
linguistically appropriate comprehensive care, were not prioritized, particularly in cases of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>9 
</b></p>
<p>sexual violence. The High Commissioner recalls the right of victims to comprehensive 
reparations, as set out in international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>38. In 2011, continued progress was made in the systematization and digitalization of 
the Historical Archive of the National Police, discovered in 2005, which has provided a 
significant contribution to the investigation and prosecution of emblematic cases from the 
past, as well as for the elucidation of historic memory. According to official information 
received by OHCHR-Guatemala, the standards found in the Johannesburg Principles on 
National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information were not applied in 
the process of declassifying the military archives. Additionally, obstacles to and limitations 
on accessing the archives persist. 
</p>
<p>39. The State failed to comply with the 2010 reparations agreement reached with the 
communities whose rights were affected by the construction of a hydroelectric plant in 
Chixoy (1978-1982), infringing its duty to redress past human rights violations. The failure 
to comply with this agreement, mediated by the Organization of American States, and in 
which OHCHR-Guatemala participated as an observer, resulted in an increased mistrust in 
the Government and a loss of legitimacy of dialogue processes. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>40. Human rights defenders in Guatemala continued to be subjected to a high level of 
attacks. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office received 159 complaints of attacks during 2011. 
The year was marked by the death of several young human rights defenders. Among these 
was V&#237;ctor Leiva, who promoted artistic activities for those who wanted to break free from 
the spiral of violence in an effort to challenge the stereotypes linking youth with crime. He 
was killed on 2 February. Three young indigenous defenders, Sebasti&#225;n Xuc, Alberto Coc 
and Catalina Muc&#250; were assassinated on 12 February They were seeking, through dialogue, 
a solution to the land conflict of their community of Quebrada Seca, Izabal. This conflict 
was exacerbated by the presence of organized crime in the department of Izabal and by its 
interests in acquiring large segments of land for drug-trafficking. Investigations on these 
cases have not led to any prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>41. OHCHR-Guatemala has observed that some authorities tended to discredit human 
rights defenders and criminalize their activities. In March, defenders of indigenous rights 
who participated in a public rally related to the Technological Corridor project in 
Chiquimula were convicted of &#8213;activities against national security&#8214; and their five-year 
imprisonment sentence was commuted to a prohibition to participate or promote illegal 
public demonstrations. In El Quich&#233;, local authorities referred to the communities that 
claimed their right to consultation as &#8213;groups that were seeking to destabilize the system&#8214;.  
</p>
<p>42. Moreover, in press releases issued in March related to the evictions in Polochic 
Valley and acts of protest by the communities affected by the Chixoy dam, the Government 
referred to some social organizations as ones &#8213;with radical behaviour [that] have 
systematically recurred to the implementation of de facto measures&#8214;.13 These public 
statements, rather than promoting opportunities for dialogue, increased polarization and 
contributed to the stigmatization of human rights defenders. 
</p>

<p>Park, El Pet&#233;n. Although their protests were aimed at securing the implementation of core 
legal provisions for the protection of the officially declared natural areas, they were 
criticized by the Government and subjected to strong pressures. Some high-level CONAP 
officials were forced to resign. 
</p>
<p>44. On the south coast, OHCHR-Guatemala observed that labour rights defenders were 
targets of threats and unfair dismissals. In March, the Palo Gordo sugar refinery dismissed 
seven members of the only existing union of the sugar industry in Guatemala, and invited 
other unionists to quit, seemingly to discourage the defence of labour rights. 
</p>
<p>45. When women defenders of gender and reproductive rights questioned traditional 
structures of male power, such as the case of members of the Generando association in 
Chimaltenango and of the Observatory on Reproductive Health in Alta Verapaz, they were 
subjected to harassment. In a social environment where prejudices prevail, OHCHR-
Guatemala received information from defenders working with lesbians, gays, bisexuals and 
transsexuals who were stigmatized and discriminated against when they tried to file 
complaints, which were mostly rejected by the authorities, including in cases of presumed 
hate crimes. 
</p>
<p>46. Despite this challenging context, some progress was made in terms of investigations 
related to violations affecting human rights defenders referred to in previous reports, such 
as the cases of the policeman who was lynched in San Juan Cotzal (A/HRC/13/26/Add.1, 
para. 13), Leonardo Lisandro Guarcax (A/HRC/16/20/Add.1, para. 42), V&#237;ctor G&#225;lvez 
(ibid., para. 46) and Emilia Quan (ibid., para. 42).  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Women</b>&#8217;<b>s rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>47. Femicide and gender-based violence remained of utmost concern, with 448 deaths 
between January and August.14 The cruelty with which some of these crimes were 
perpetuated shows how deeply rooted patterns of discrimination are in society, and also 
reveals the lack of institutional measures to tackle them. Despite the important work carried 
out by the three specialized tribunals against femicide, there is still an enormous gap 
between the cases resolved by the Judiciary and the number of complaints filed (144 out of 
6,318).15 
</p>
<p>48. Although violence against women is a phenomenon that goes beyond class and 
ethnicity, OHCHR-Guatemala observed that indigenous women who decide to break the 
cycle of violence face a double barrier permeating the justice system: male chauvinism and 
racism. Important deficiencies remained regarding the application of the Law against 
Femicide and Other Forms of Violence against Women (Decree 22-2008) in non-
specialized tribunals, such as their resistance to apply the criminal definition of femicide 
and to adopt measures to protect the victims. 
</p>
<p>49. Despite the number of complaints regarding violence against women received by the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (30,256 from January to August),16 the National Plan for the 
Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women (PLANOVI) has not been 
fully implemented, as the State funding for prevention and attention to victims was 
insufficient. In this regard, the limited number of care centres that provide the only support

</b></p>
<p>for female survivors of violence can assist only a minimum number of victims, leaving 
many women in rural areas with all but no support. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual and reproductive rights 
</b></p>
<p>50. Despite important legislative progress,17 women still face difficulties in gaining 
access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services. The goal of reducing 
maternal mortality to 55 per 100,000 live births is still far from being reached&#8212;currently it 
stands at 136 per 100,000.18 This situation is worse among indigenous women, with a 
mortality rate that is three times higher than that of non-indigenous women. Another major 
concern is the large number of pregnancies among girls between 10 and 14 years old (748 
cases),19 the majority of them resulting from sexual violence within the family and a lack of 
access to sex education. The resistance of some sectors to provide sex education and 
services derived from the right to sexual and reproductive health is a matter of special 
concern. 
</p>
<p>51. In line with recommendations made by the Human Rights Committee20, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women21 and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to health22, it is necessary to widen the criteria established by the 
criminal code for the exemption from punitive measures for abortion, at least in cases of 
sexual violence and medical emergencies. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Racism and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>52. Although the Constitution recognizes the principle of equality and there is no 
explicit legal restriction for indigenous people to access State services, they remained de 
facto excluded from access to the social, political and cultural spheres. Being indigenous in 
Guatemala continued to entail a denial of rights, despite the fact that indigenous peoples 
constitute the majority population (60 per cent).23 
</p>
<p>53. The enormous disparity in social indicators between indigenous and non-indigenous 
populations reveals discrimination patterns that compromise the State&#8217;s international 
obligation to ensure adequate development and protection, as well as the full and equal 
enjoyment of their rights. The departments with an indigenous majority register higher rates 
of both poverty (74.8 per cent) and extreme poverty (27.2 per cent).24 The chronic 
malnutrition rate for indigenous children under five is 58.6 per cent.25 The departments with

<p>higher levels of maternal and infant mortality also have an indigenous majority.26 In Alta 
Verapaz and Quich&#233;, both with indigenous majorities, the rate of enrolment in and 
completion of primary school are the lowest.27 Literacy rates showed a significant disparity 
between indigenous (59.6 per cent) and non-indigenous populations (83.4 per cent).28 
</p>
<p>54. OHCHR-Guatemala reiterates that the structure of the State does not reflect the 
multicultural nature of its society. Isolated governmental institutions with specific mandates 
on indigenous people, such as the Presidential Commission against Discrimination and 
Racism against Indigenous Peoples in Guatemala (CODISRA) and the Office for the 
Defence of Indigenous Women (DEMI), carried on their functions without adequate 
funding, political power, regional presence or independence.  
</p>
<p>55.  There are still challenges in ensuring full participation of indigenous peoples in the 
design and implementation of development policies and programmes and in breaking the 
existing social preconceptions according to which indigenous peoples are seen as an 
obstacle to development. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to lands and territories 
</b></p>
<p>56. Although the Constitution grants general protection for indigenous peoples&#8217; lands 
and territories, there are still no laws that recognize the traditional practices of land tenure, 
possession and collective ownership by indigenous communities. This creates serious 
obstacles for communities to legally defend the rights over their lands, particularly in the 
face of irregular or illicit registration of property and the overlap of registries, the 
uncertainty of land delimitations and the lack of a reliable cadastre. In this regard, OHCHR-
Guatemala observed the current legal struggle of the Soledad Sayaxut community in San 
Pedro Carch&#225;, Alta Verapaz, to recover its land, where 32 Q&#8217;eqchi&#8217; families were evicted 
</p>
<p>from their ancestral land in 2004, after the area was declared vacant by the State and the 
families could not present proof of their ancestral ownership. In the case of the Indigenous 
Municipality of Santo Tom&#225;s Chichicastenango,29 after five years of litigation, the 
Constitutional Court established an important precedent by recognizing the legal standing 
of the indigenous authorities before the Judiciary. However, the Court did not decide on the 
question of ownership, which will now be resolved by ordinary jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>57. The lack of legal and institutional guarantees to protect indigenous lands and 
territories places indigenous peoples in a vulnerable situation, particularly when facing 
large-scale development projects. OHCHR-Guatemala observed that in the context of the 
F&#233;nix mining project of the Guatemalan Nickel Company in El Estor, Izabal, some 
indigenous communities that were displaced since 2007 due to their supposed lack of rights 
remain without legal recognition with regard to these lands.  
</p>
<p>58. In 2011, the Constitutional Court took a positive step in the case of the Agua 
Caliente [Lote 9] community, ordering the adoption of necessary measures to give legal 
certainty to their right to property.30 
</p>
<p>59. In 2011, the Ministry of Energy and Mines granted four licences, and eight are in 
process of approval, for the installation of hydroelectric plants in indigenous territories. 
These licences are in addition to other concessions granted since 2008: 15 for hydroelectric

<p>projects, 18 for exploration and exploitation of construction material, and 33 for exploration 
for and exploitation of metals and non-metals&#8212;all have been granted without respect for 
the indigenous peoples&#8217; right to consultation recognized in international standards.31 This is 
the case of the Ixil region in El Quich&#233;, where OHCHR-Guatemala monitored social 
conflicts due to a lack of consultation prior to the granting of the licences for the Xacbal, 
Palo Viejo I and Hidroxil hydroelectric plants. 
</p>
<p>60. In Lanqu&#237;n, Alta Verapaz, legal action was taken to appeal against the Ministerial 
Agreement authorizing the Entre R&#237;os hydroelectric project, on the grounds of failure to 
carry out prior consultation. The appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court of Justice, 
although one of the magistrates, in a dissenting opinion based on international standards, 
argued that the Agreement should have been considered null as a result of the lack of 
consultation with indigenous peoples. The case is now pending before the Constitutional 
Court. Additionally, some indigenous communities have carried out 10 &#8213;good faith 
community consultations&#8214; in different regions, adding up to a total of 58 consultations 
undertaken since 2005, which resulted in the rejection of these activities in their territories. 
</p>
<p>61. In March, the Government promoted an initiative to regulate the right of indigenous 
peoples to consultation. This initiative was widely rejected by many indigenous 
communities, who alleged that they were not adequately consulted during the process. 
Some indigenous organizations filed an injunction (<i>amparo</i>) before the Constitutional 
Court against the process established by the Government to approve this initiative. The 
Court ordered the definitive suspension of the process, considering that it was not in 
accordance with the scope of the right to consultation established in International Labour 
Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>62. The efforts made in the last four years to reduce poverty constituted a positive change 
in public policies. There was rapid expansion of Mi Familia Progresa, a conditional cash 
transfer programme, which covered 800,000 families.32 Nevertheless, there were significant 
obstacles to guaranteeing sufficient resources to maintain adequate levels of operations, as 
well as to ensuring transparency and accountability.  
</p>
<p>63. The lack of adequate budgeting for education and health, made evident by the critical 
drug shortage, the scarcity of textbooks, and the precarious infrastructure in schools, 
revealed that conditional cash transfer programmes might lose their impact if wider public 
policies that guarantee quality in education and health services are not strengthened. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to food and access to land 
</b></p>
<p>64. Access to food continued to be critical, especially for rural and low-income families. 
The cost of the basic food basket showed a sharp increase (11.2 per cent between March 
2010 and March 2011), and the national price of white maize increased 46 per cent 
compared to 2010.33 
</p>
<p>65. In April, the National Food Security and Nutrition Council (CONASAN) approved 
the 2011 Emergency Plan and declared a state of &#8213;nutritional risk&#8214;34 in order to assist 96,060

</p>
<p>families living in conditions of food insecurity. Nevertheless, the implementation of this 
strategy lacked sufficient coverage, was hampered by insufficient resources, and 
institutional efforts were focused mainly on short-term strategies, such as direct food 
assistance and provision of private goods (fertilizers or pesticides), rather than on the full 
implementation of the National Policy for Comprehensive Rural Development. 
</p>
<p>66. An unequal system of land distribution continued to prevail, hampering the right to 
food of rural families, including access to adequate food and to the necessary means to 
provide it for themselves. Large-scale production still covered 70 per cent of the fertile 
land, controlled by 2 per cent of landowners, while the parcel-owning peasants, mainly 
indigenous people, had access to only 2.5 per cent of this land. 
</p>
<p>67. OHCHR-Guatemala received information regarding land buying and selling 
processes, mainly in the departments of Izabal and El Pet&#233;n, that resulted in an increasing 
number of peasant families without land. A significant number of these land transfers were 
seemingly the result of threats and pressures made by some palm oil companies aimed at 
forcing the consent of small landowners. Although State institutions recognized the need to 
provide these peasants with alternatives to prevent land transfers, no effective protective 
measures were implemented. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food has stated that the 
acquisition, or long-term leasing of large swathes of arable land (more than 1,000 ha) can 
violate the right to food, if this limits the availability of land and subsequently deprives 
local communities of the access they need to the resources required for subsistence 
(A/HRC/13/33/Add.2, paras. 4 and 11).   
</p>
<p>68. Despite important efforts made by the land fund (FONTIERRAS), the institution 
mandated to promote access to land, the low budget assigned (82 million quetzales in 2011) 
and the reliance solely upon the free market proved to be insufficient to meet the demand of 
land of the poorest families. FONTIERRAS estimated that, following the reception of 
285,000 applications for access to land since its creation in 2000, the number of families 
without land in Guatemala may currently reach 800,000, out of which only 19,968 have 
benefitted from the land purchase programme.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>69. The issuance of an internal directive by the Labour Inspectorate in February, 
establishing that labour inspectors cannot violate workers&#8217; inalienable rights when carrying 
</p>
<p>out conciliation procedures, is a positive measure. Nonetheless, the State has not yet 
complied with its duty to monitor labour practices and sanction those that violate labour 
rights, in accordance with ILO Convention No. 81 (1947) concerning Labour Inspection in 
Industry and Commerce, mainly due to the absence of adequate budgetary allocations to the 
Labour Inspectorate (2.8 per cent of the total budget of the Ministry of Labour). There is 
also a great imbalance between the total number of inspectors and establishments to be 
inspected (i.e. there are 124 inspectors for 14,314 tax-paying agricultural establishments).35 
It is urgent that the Labour Inspectorate recovers its power to impose administrative 
sanctions. 
</p>
<p>70. The human rights situation of domestic and agricultural workers illustrates the great 
challenges ahead in the fulfilment of labour rights. Domestic workers (about 183,000),36 
mainly indigenous women, are frequently subjected to a quadruple form of discrimination: 
based on their gender and their ethnic origin, as well as on their social and rural status. 
Most domestic workers also suffer forms of segregation in everyday life, including the 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>provision of inadequate living conditions, restrictions on the quality and quantity of food, 
the imposition of degrading activities and the use of exclusive entrances. 
</p>
<p>71. The Labour Code establishes a special regime for these workers that weakens their 
rights and leaves them vulnerable to work in precarious conditions, including earning 
wages below the minimum wage, unpaid overtime, and denial of benefits such as indemnity 
pay and access to social security. The ratification by Guatemala of ILO Convention No. 
189 (2011) concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers would strengthen the protection 
of their rights. 
</p>
<p>72. With regard to the 475,600 agricultural workers,37 the vast majority live in poverty, 
without access to adequate housing, water and food, and with an average of 2.4 years of 
schooling.38 Based on interviews with agricultural workers, OHCHR-Guatemala observed 
that in some situations they are forced to accept labour conditions that infringe their rights 
due to the lack of better work alternatives. 
</p>
<p>73. OHCHR-Guatemala also observed a tendency by the agro-industry to condition 
workers&#8217; salaries to their productive outputs, with targets in place that are usually 
</p>
<p>excessive, and without guarantees of earning the minimum wage (the average monthly 
salary was 1,215 quetzales, while the minimum wage was 1,953),39 contrary to ILO 
Convention No. 99 (1951) concerning Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery in Agriculture. 
Women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s work assisting the male worker to meet his imposed goals is often 
invisible and thus unrecognized and unpaid. The use of strategies to avoid paying benefits 
and social security (only 29 per cent of agricultural workers are registered for Social 
Security) was also observed.  
</p>
<p>74. The working and sanitary conditions frequently put these workers&#8217; health and even 
their lives at risk. Following similar incidents that occurred in the previous year, an 
accident that took place in September 2011 in San Marcos&#8212;two Mam agricultural workers 
were killed and eight were severely injured while being transported in an overcrowded bus 
from a coffee plantation&#8212;highlights the persistence of inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p>75. In relation to access to justice, OHCHR-Guatemala observed that agricultural 
workers face a series of obstacles when they file labour complaints, such as a lack of free 
legal aid, lack of the sanctioning power of the Labour Inspectorate and the delays 
associated with conflict resolution in labour tribunals (average of five years). At the one 
hundredth session of the ILO Conference in 2011, the situation of attacks against trade 
unions in Guatemala was described as &#8213;a serious situation of almost total impunity&#8214;.40 
</p>
<p><b> C. Forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Judiciary issued 44 judicial orders to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, to 
undertake evictions with the support of the NCP, out of which only 14 were executed as at 
August.41 OHCHR-Guatemala observed the evictions that took place in the Polochic Valley, 
Alta Verapaz, which affected 732 Q&#8217;eqchi&#8217; families (15 March); Retalhuleu, which affected 
139 peasants (28 July); and Sierra del Lacand&#243;n National Park, El Pet&#233;n, which affected 69 
families (24 August). Taking into account Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural

</p>
<p>Rights general comment No. 7 (1997) on the right to adequate housing: forced evictions, 
OHCHR-Guatemala observed actions that were inconsistent with human rights standards 
and principles with regard to the manner in which those evictions took place, such as the 
absence of prior notification and of the opportunity for those being evicted to exercise their 
rights to defence and due process; the participation of non-State agents (security guards and 
groups of workers); the infringement of the right of those being evicted to housing and food 
throughout the destruction and burning of housing and crops; the lack of a plan to relocate 
the communities to a different area; and elements that suggest the excessive use of force by 
the police. 
</p>
<p>77. The High Commissioner welcomes general instruction 07-2011 issued by the 
Attorney General on 3 August, which seeks to harmonize actions with international 
standards before and during evictions. Similar complementary internal instructions were not 
adopted by the Judiciary, and a protocol drafted by the Presidential Commission on Human 
Rights (COPREDEH) had not yet been approved by the Ministry of the Interior. To avoid 
such violations, a moratorium on evictions should be established by all relevant institutions, 
until an internal mechanism consistent with human rights standards is adopted. 
</p>
<p><b> IX.  Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights monitoring  
</b></p>
<p>78. OHCHR-Guatemala conducted 52 missions to monitor the human rights situation 
throughout the country, and held meetings with authorities, public institutions, social 
organizations, witnesses, victims and their families to follow up on reports of possible 
human rights violations relating to economic, social and cultural rights; the rights of 
indigenous people, women and human rights defenders; security; justice for past and 
present human rights violations; and the electoral process. 
</p>
<p>79. OHCHR-Guatemala further monitored the selection process for magistrates of the 
Constitutional Court and for the Rapporteurs of the National Mechanism for the Prevention 
of Torture, as well as judicial proceedings in emblematic cases.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Technical assistance  
</b></p>
<p>80. Technical assistance was provided to Government authorities and other stakeholders 
on a number of issues. OHCHR-Guatemala provided assistance on international human 
rights standards relating to a number of legislative initiatives, including reforms to the 
Statutory Law of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and reforms to the Criminal Code relating 
to anticorruption measures and the death penalty, as well as a constitutional reform on 
security and justice. OHCHR-Guatemala also provided support to civil society 
organizations lobbying for the approval of the Law on the National Search Commission for 
Victims of Enforced Disappearance, the National Reparations Programme and the 
ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Additionally, OHCHR-
Guatemala continued monitoring the discussion on a project to reform the Law on the 
Judicial Career, promoted by the Supreme Court of Justice.  
</p>
<p>81. OHCHR-Guatemala continued the training programme with the School of Judicial 
Trainers, in which non-discrimination, indigenous peoples, gender and transitional justice 
modules were implemented. It further continued capacity-building activities with legal 
clerks and magistrates of the Constitutional Court, and provided specialized documents </p>

<p>systematizing international human rights standards to complement the analyses of the 
Court. Trainings were further held as part of ongoing capacity-building efforts with the 
Human Rights Unit and the Unit for <i>Amparos</i> within the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>82. Technical assistance was provided to State institutions in drafting the third periodic 
report on the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights and in preparing the reports on the implementation of the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p>83.  OHCHR-Guatemala participated in capacity-building activities directed at key 
actors in the fields of transitional justice, women deprived of their liberty, the death penalty,

how many more?&#8214;, with the participation of the Attorney General, the CICIG 
Commissioner, the Governor of El Pet&#233;n, the local bishop and representatives of civil

Development Programme, and participated in several inter-agency working groups, as well 
as in the establishment of the Peacebuilding Fund. In addition, OHCHR-Guatemala </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.1 
</b></p>

Commissioner&#8217;s annual report on the activities of OHCHR-Guatemala in the capital and 
four departments; and disseminated a compilation of recommendations by the High 
Commissioner and a priority human rights agenda for the new authorities. It distributed 
more than 56,000 copies of publications and supported the Second Film Festival on Truth, 
Memory and Justice and the Sixth Exhibit on Theatre for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Follow-up to recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>92. In her previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/16/20/Add.1), the High 
Commissioner compiled all the recommendations made in her previous five reports to the 
Government, Congress, the Judiciary, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, civil society 
organizations and the international community, relating to the following themes: the legal 
framework for the protection of human rights; the right to life and security; the rule of law 
and impunity; indigenous peoples&#8217; rights; women&#8217;s rights; and economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights. The issues reflected in these recommendations are also addressed in the 
recommendations made to Guatemala under the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>93. Despite certain advances in the implementation of some of these recommendations, 
particularly regarding an increase of social expenditure, the prioritization of social 
programmes in the poorest municipalities, and criminal investigation and prosecution in 
emblematic cases, most of them have yet to be implemented.
