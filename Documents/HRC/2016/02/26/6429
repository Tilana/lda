<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the 2005 World Summit Outcome adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 60/1 of 24 October 2005, in which the Assembly emphasized the responsibilities of all 
States, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, to respect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language or 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, and 
acknowledged the importance of respect and understanding for religious and cultural diversity 
throughout the world, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in 
September 2001,<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, proclaimed by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the valuable contribution of all religions to modern civilization and the 
contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make to an improved awareness and 
understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the Declaration adopted by the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers at its 
thirty-fourth session in Islamabad, in May 2007, which condemned the growing trend of 
Islamophobia and systematic discrimination against the adherents of Islam and emphasized the 
need to take effective measures to combat defamation of religions,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Noting also </i>the final communiqu&#233; adopted by the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
at its eleventh summit, in Dakar, in March 2008, in which the Organization expressed concern at 
the systematically negative stereotyping of Muslims and Islam and other divine religions, and 
denounced the overall rise in intolerance and discrimination against Muslim minorities, which 
constitute an affront to human dignity and run counter to the international human rights 
instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the joint statement of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the 
European Union and the Secretary-General of 7 February 2006, in which they recognized the 
need, in all societies, to show sensitivity and responsibility in treating issues of special 
significance for the adherents of any particular faith, even by those who do not share the belief 
in question,
</p>
<p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the call made by the President of the General Assembly in his statement 
of 15 March 2006 that, in the wake of existing mistrust and tensions, there is a need for dialogue 
and understanding among civilizations, cultures and religions to commit to working together to 
prevent provocative or regrettable incidents and to develop better ways of promoting tolerance, 
respect for and freedom of religion and belief, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>all international and regional initiatives to promote cross-cultural and interfaith 
harmony, including the Alliance of Civilizations and the International Dialogue on Interfaith 
Cooperation and their valuable efforts towards the promotion of a culture of peace and dialogue 
at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming also </i>the report by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on the situation of Muslims and Arabs 
in various parts of the world,<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming further </i>the reports of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the Council at its 
fourth and sixth session<b>s</b>,<b>3</b> in which he draws the attention of Member States to the serious nature 
of the defamation of all religions and to the promotion of the fight against these phenomena by 
strengthening the role of interreligious and intercultural dialogue and promoting reciprocal 
understanding and joint action to meet the fundamental challenges of development, peace and 
the protection and promotion of human rights, as well as the need to complement legal strategies, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating </i>the call made by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to Member States to wage a systematic 
campaign against incitement to racial and religious hatred by maintaining a careful balance 
between the defence of secularism and respect for freedom of religion and by acknowledging 
and respecting the complementarity of all the freedoms embodied in the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights,<b>4</b>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that States, non-governmental organizations, religious bodies and the media 
have an important role to play in promoting tolerance and freedom of religion and belief through 
education, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with concern </i>that defamation of religions is among the causes of social disharmony 
and instability, at the national and international levels, and leads to violations of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with deep concern </i>the increasing trend in recent years of statements attacking 
religions, including Islam and Muslims, in human rights forums, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses deep concern </i>at the negative stereotyping of all<b> </b>religions and 
manifestations of intolerance and discrimination in matters of religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also expresses deep concern </i>at attempts to identify Islam with terrorism, violence 
and human rights violations and emphasizes that equating any religion with terrorism should be 
rejected and combated by all at all levels; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further expresses deep concern </i>at the intensification of the campaign of defamation 
of religions and the ethnic and religious profiling of Muslim minorities in the aftermath of the 
tragic events of 11 September 2001; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at the recent serious instances of deliberate stereotyping 
of religions, their adherents and sacred persons in the media and by political parties and groups 
in some societies, and at the associated provocation and political exploitation; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes </i>that, in the context of the fight against terrorism, defamation of religions 
becomes an aggravating factor that contributes to the denial of fundamental rights and freedoms 
of target groups and their economic and social exclusion; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Expresses concern </i>at laws or administrative measures that have been specifically 
designed to control and monitor Muslim minorities, thereby stigmatizing them and legitimizing 
the discrimination that they experience; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Strongly deplores </i>physical attacks and assaults on businesses, cultural centres and 
places of worship of all religions and targeting of religious symbols; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges </i>States to take actions to prohibit the dissemination, including through political 
institutions and organizations, of racist and xenophobic ideas and material aimed at any religion 
or its followers that constitute incitement to racial and religious hatred, hostility or violence; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also urges </i>States to provide, within their respective legal and constitutional systems, 
adequate protection against acts of hatred, discrimination, intimidation and coercion resulting 
from the defamation of any religion, to take all possible measures to promote tolerance and 
respect for all religions and their value systems and to complement legal systems with 
intellectual and moral strategies to combat religious hatred and intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Emphasizes</i> that respect of religions and their protection from contempt is an 
essential element conducive for the exercise by all of the right to freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges </i>all States to ensure that all public officials, including members of law 
enforcement bodies, the military, civil servants and educators, in the course of their official 
duties, respect all religions and beliefs and do not discriminate against persons on the grounds of 
their religion or belief, and that all necessary and appropriate education or training is provided; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes </i>that, as stipulated in international human rights law, everyone has the 
right to freedom of expression, and that the exercise of this right carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities, and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but only those provided by 
law and necessary for the respect of the rights or reputations of others, or for the protection of 
national security or of public order, or of public health or morals; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Reaffirms </i>that general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee stipulates that the prohibition of the 
dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom 
of opinion and expression, is equally applicable to the question of incitement to religious hatred; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Deplores </i>the use of printed, audio-visual and electronic media, including the 
Internet, and of any other means to incite acts of violence, xenophobia or related intolerance and 
discrimination towards Islam or any religion; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 15. <i>Invites </i>the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to continue to report on all manifestations of 
defamation of religions, and in particular on the serious implications of Islamophobia, on the 
enjoyment of all rights to the Council at its ninth session; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the implementation 
of the present resolution and to submit a study compiling relevant existing legislations and 
jurisprudence concerning defamation of and contempt for religions to the Council at its ninth 
session.
