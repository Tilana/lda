(b)          If a Brigus Event of Default occurs and is continuing, in addition to and not in substitution
for any other remedies available at law or in equity, Sandstorm shall have the right, upon written
notice to Brigus, at its option, to: (i) demand repayment of the remaining Uncredited Balance,
without interest, at the time of the occurrence of the applicable Brigus Event of Default; and
(ii) Sandstorm shall have the right to seek damages in excess of the Uncredited Balance (the
amounts in (i) and (ii), being collectively referred to as the “Brigus Default Fee”). Upon demand
from Sandstorm, which demand shall include a calculation of the Brigus Default Fee, Brigus shall
promptly pay the Brigus Default Fee in cash by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to a
bank account designated by Sandstorm. For greater certainty and without limitation, in the event
Brigus is required to pay the Brigus Default Fee to Sandstorm, the provisions set forth in section
3(c) requiring the refund of the Uncredited Balance will no longer be applicable.
(c)          The Parties hereby acknowledge that: (i) Sandstorm will be damaged by a Brigus Event of
Default; and (ii) any sums payable or retainable pursuant to this Article 9 are in the nature of
liquidated damages, not a penalty and are fair and reasonable.

deemed terminated upon the payment by or on behalf of Brigus of the Brigus Default Fee.
(e)          Termination of this Agreement under this Article shall not terminate any payment or
delivery obligation hereunder that arose prior to the time of termination.
10.         Offtake Agreements
Each Offtake Agreement shall be on arm’s length commercial terms, consistent with normal
industry standards and practice in Canada with respect to the payable adjustment factor. Brigus
shall promptly disclose to Sandstorm the terms of any such
- 14 -
agreements and any amendments to the material terms and conditions of any Offtake
Agreements that may affect Sandstorm and any refining, smelting or other purchase agreements
in respect of Au from the Property.
11.         Books; Records; Inspections
Brigus shall keep true, complete and accurate books and records of all material operations and
activities with respect to the Property, including the processing of Minerals therefrom, where
applicable. Subject to the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement and in addition to the
provisions of section 6(d), Sandstorm and its authorized representatives shall be entitled to
perform audits or other reviews and examinations of the books and records of Brigus relevant to
the delivery of Sandstorm Payable Au pursuant to this Agreement during the Term or the
Extended Term, as the case may be, to confirm compliance by Brigus with the terms of this
Agreement. Sandstorm shall diligently complete any audit or other examination permitted
hereunder. For greater certainty and without limitation, Sandstorm shall have access to all
documents provided by Brigus to an Offtaker, as contemplated under the Offtake Agreements or
which otherwise relate to the Au produced from the Property vis a vis the Offtaker and that are, in
any manner, relevant to the calculation of Sandstorm Payable Au or the delivery and credit in
respect thereof, in each instance. All costs and expenses of any audit or other examination
permitted in this section shall be paid by Sandstorm, unless the results of such audit or other
examination permitted in this section, disclose a discrepancy in calculations made by Brigus of
equal to or greater than two percent, in which event the reasonable costs of such audit or other
examination shall be paid by Brigus.
12.         Conduct of Mining Operations, etc.
(a)          All decisions concerning methods, the extent, times, procedures and techniques of any
exploration, development and mining operations related to the Property shall be made by Brigus
in its sole and absolute discretion.
(b)          Sandstorm has no contractual rights relating to the development or operation of any of the
operations of Brigus, including without limitation, the Property or any of its properties and
Sandstorm shall not be required to contribute to any capital or expenditures in respect of
operations at the Property. Except as provided in this Agreement and the Project Charge,
Sandstorm has no right, title or interest in and to the Property.
(c)          Sandstorm is not entitled to any form or type of compensation or payment from Brigus if
Brigus discontinues or ceases operations from the Property save and except as provided in
Article 3. This Agreement shall in no way be construed or considered a guarantee as to the
delivery of any amount of Sandstorm Payable Au, on an annual basis or over the life of the
Property.
(d)          Brigus shall perform or cause to be performed all processing operations and activities in
respect of the Property in a commercially prudent manner and in
- 15 -
accordance with good processing, engineering and environmental practices prevailing in the
industry.
(e)          At reasonable times and with the prior consent of Brigus (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), at the sole risk and expense of Sandstorm, Sandstorm shall have a right of
access by its representatives to the Property and any mill, smelter, concentrator or other
processing facility owned or operated by Brigus and/or its affiliates and that is to process
Minerals produced from the Property, for the purpose of enabling Sandstorm to monitor
compliance by Brigus with the terms of this Agreement and to prepare technical reports on the
Property in compliance with National Instrument 43-101.
(f)           Brigus will cooperate with and will allow Sandstorm access to technical information
pertaining to the Property to permit Sandstorm to prepare technical reports on the Property in
accordance with National Instrument 43-101 at the sole cost and expense of Sandstorm to
comply with Sandstorm’s disclosure obligations under applicable Canadian and/or US securities
laws and/or stock exchange rules and policies provided that: (i) to the extent permitted by law,
Sandstorm will use the same report writer as Brigus to prepare all technical reports that
Sandstorm is required to prepare and to use the same reports as Brigus (re-addressed to
Sandstorm). For greater certainty and without limitation, so long as Brigus’ then current technical
report is in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 from the perspective of Sandstorm in the
opinion of counsel to Sandstorm, Sandstorm will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
use the same National Instrument 43-101 technical report, re-addressed to Sandstorm; and (ii) if
Sandstorm is unable to use the same report writer as Brigus to prepare a required technical
report, it will choose a Person to write the technical report that is acceptable to Brigus, acting
reasonably, and Sandstorm will not finalize the technical report until Brigus has been provided
with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the contents of the technical report and Sandstorm
will act in good faith and will use its best efforts to incorporate Brigus’ comments into the
technical report to the extent Brigus’ comments are made to conform the technical report with the
existing disclosure of Brigus. Brigus will promptly deliver to Sandstorm any updated National
Instrument 43-101 reports or mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates produced that
pertain to the Property.
(g)          Brigus shall ensure that all Au is produced from the Property in a prompt and timely
manner consistent with sound mining processing, engineering and environmental practices. In
addition, Brigus shall mine and process the ore from the Property in a manner consistent with
industry standards and practices that would be expected by a person receiving/buying Payable
Au. If Brigus wishes to commingle the Minerals produced from the Property with other Minerals, it
may do so, as long as Sandstorm shall not be disadvantaged as a result of such commingling
including ensuring that ore to which Sandstorm is entitled to a percentage of is neither displaced
nor processed at a lower rate as a result of such co-mingling and further provided that a method
is agreed upon by Sandstorm and Brigus to determine the quantum of Au produced from the
Property. If Sandstorm and Brigus can not agree upon such a method, the matter
- 16 -
will be determined in accordance with the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in Article 16.
Brigus may not cease to process ore from the Property in favour of ore from other sources.
13.         Restricted Transfer Rights of Brigus
During the Term or the Extended Term, as the case may be, Brigus shall be permitted to
Transfer, in whole or in part: (i) the Property; or (ii) its rights and obligations under this
Agreement; so long as the following conditions are satisfied and upon such conditions being
satisfied in respect of such Transfer, Brigus shall be released from its obligations under this
Article:
(i)                                  Brigus shall provide Sandstorm with at least 30 days prior written notice of its
intent to Transfer;
(ii)                              any purchaser, merged company, transferee or assignee agrees in writing in
favour of Sandstorm to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (in which event Brigus shall be
released from its obligations under this Agreement so long as there is compliance with
subsections 13(i) and (iii)), including without limitation, this section and any transferee that is a
mortgagee, chargeholder or encumbrancer undertakes to obtain an agreement in writing in
favour of Sandstorm from any subsequent purchaser or transferee of such mortgagee,
chargeholder or encumbrancer that such subsequent mortgagee, chargeholder or encumbrancer
will be bound by the terms of this Agreement and the Project Charge, as applicable and to the
extent possible; and
(iii)                          Sandstorm does not suffer a Material Adverse Change in relation to the
transactions set forth in this Agreement.
14.         Buy-Back Option
For a period of time that commences on the Execution Date and that terminates on January 1,
2013 (the “Buy-Back Option Period”), Brigus shall have the sole and irrevocable option (the
“Buy-Back Option”) to require that Sandstorm reduce the Sandstorm Payable Au with respect to
the Black Fox Property from 12% by increments of 1% to an amount of not less than 6% in
consideration of the payment by Brigus to Sandstorm of the Buy-Back Purchase Price, or part
thereof. The Buy-Back Option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the Buy-
Back Option Period, provided that any partial exercise must be in increments of not less than
US$6,099,167 (which shall constitute reductions of the Upfront Deposit) for each 1% of the Buy-
Back Option. To exercise the Buy-Back Option, Brigus shall provide five Business Days notice to
such effect to Sandstorm and shall forward to Sandstorm within such five Business Days the
Buy-Back Purchase Price or part thereof in case of a partial exercise, in cash by wire transfer. As
and when the Buy-Back Option is exercised with respect to the Black Fox Property, there shall be
a corresponding adjustment to the
- 17 -
Sandstorm Payable Au with respect to the Black Fox Extension on the following basis:

consent of the other Party, disclose any non-public information received under or in connection
with this Agreement, other than to its respective directors, employees, agents, bankers,
consultants, requisite regulatory authorities and/or prospective transferees and neither Party shall
issue any press releases concerning the Property without the consent of the other Party, after the
other Party has first reviewed the terms of such press release (to the extent practicable). Each
Party agrees to reveal such information only to its respective directors, employees, agents,
bankers, consultants and/or prospective transferees who need to know, who are informed of the
confidential nature of the information and who agree to be bound by the terms of this Article 15. In
addition, neither Party shall use any such information for its own use or benefit except for the
purpose of enforcing its rights under this Agreement.
(b)          Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) Sandstorm and Brigus shall be entitled to publicly file a

to be procured within five Business Days of the execution and delivery of this Agreement);
(ii) each Party may disclose information obtained under this Agreement if required to do so for
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations or orders of any governmental authority or

to review and object to the data or information to be disclosed prior to any public release subject
to any reasonable changes proposed by such other Party; and (iii) each Party may disclose
information for the purposes of any arbitration proceeding commenced under Article 16 of this
Agreement.

applicable. The arbitrator(s) may make an interim order, including injunctive relief and other
provisional, protective or conservatory measures, as well as orders seeking assistance from a
court in taking or compelling evidence or preserving and producing documents regarding the
