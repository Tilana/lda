<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.

</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Turkey: Angola, Cuba and Saudi Arabia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. In the introductory statement, the head of the Turkish delegation noted the benefit of 
the present review for Turkey and thanked all stakeholders who had contributed to the 
process and those countries that had submitted written advance questions. In the preparation 
of the national report, civil society consultation had been given priority. Inputs received at a 
consultation meeting in December 2009 and through an appeal on the webpage of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been decisive in determining the report&#8217;s priorities. It was 
intended that that cooperation would continue. New developments had occurred since the 
submission of the report owing to the dynamic human rights reform agenda in Turkey.  
</p>
<p>6. Turkey considers the protection and promotion of human rights as a political 
priority. An extensive reform process, which included two constitutional amendments 
(2001, 2004), nine reform packages and new Civil and Penal Codes, was undertaken while 
struggling against terrorism. The Reform Monitoring Group, composed of several 
ministers, played a leading role in the process.  
</p>
<p>7. Turkey has adopted universal standards in amending legislation, accelerated the 
ratification of international conventions and intensified the training of law enforcement 
personnel and other civil servants, which has resulted in a complete change in mindset. 
Accession negotiations with the European Union started in 2005. In 2009, Turkey applied 
to become an observer of the European Fundamental Rights Agency.  </p>


<p>8. Article 90 of the amended Constitution stipulates that, in the event of conflict 
between the provisions of national legislation and international agreements, the latter will 
prevail.  
</p>
<p>9. Capital punishment, which had not been applied since 1984, was totally abolished in 
</p><p>2004. 
</p>
<p>10. In 1987, Turkish citizens were granted the right to individual application to the 
European Court of Human Rights. Its compulsory jurisdiction was recognized in 1990. 
Judgements are translated and distributed to relevant institutions, their impact and results 
are assessed, the necessary preventive measures are taken and, once they are final, 
compensation is paid to the relevant parties.  
</p>
<p>11. New constitutional amendments in May 2010 included positive discrimination for 
children, the elderly, persons with disabilities and relatives of martyrs; personal data 
protection; the obligation to take all measures to prevent child abuse; the establishment of 
an ombudsman institution; the granting of the right to individual application to the 
Constitutional Court; the introduction of collective bargaining rights for civil servants and 
public employees; and the introduction of judicial scrutiny of decisions of the Supreme 
Military Council and the Supreme Council of Judges and Prosecutors.   
</p>
<p>12. The judicial reform strategy and related action plan, finalized in August 2009, are 
aimed at enhancing the independence of the judiciary, its neutrality, productivity, efficiency 
and professional competency. An important element was the introduction of intermediary 
courts of appeal in civil and administrative justice.  
</p>
<p>13. A national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles, which will 
concurrently serve as the national preventive mechanism under OPCAT, will be 
established. Constitutional obstacles on the Ombudsman Law have been removed. A draft 
law on a new law enforcement agency independent complaint mechanism is under way.  
</p>
<p>14. A draft law on a non-discrimination and equality board, based on international 
standards, has been prepared. The grounds of non-discrimination include, inter alia, sexual 
identity, disability and ethnic origin.  
</p>
<p>15. Turkey is a State party to the anti-corruption conventions of the United Nations, the 
Council of Europe and OECD, and actively participates in GRECO of the Council of 
Europe. A national anti-corruption strategy and its action plan were adopted in 2010.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation emphasized that important steps in the protection of human rights 
had been taken over the past decade and, while noting the need for further legal and 
administrative measures, expressed its determination and its political will to pursue its 
efforts.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>17. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations expressed appreciation for the comprehensive presentation of the national 
report and for answers to advance questions. Additional statements that could not be 
delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time constraints will be posted on the 
extranet of the universal periodic review when available1.  Recommendations made during 
the dialogue are found in section II of the present report.

human rights. It noted efforts to combat inequalities and discrimination as well as Turkey&#8217;s 
attachment to improving education, which was compulsory and free for all. 
</p>
<p>23. Cyprus noted that the European Court of Human Rights has ruled repeatedly that 
Turkey is liable for violations of basic ECHR articles in Cyprus. The Court underlined that 
Turkey is accountable, due to its continuing military presence on the island, for such 
violations by its armed forces or by its subordinate local administration and has thus an 
obligation to secure all human rights in that area. Cyprus made recommendations.

recommendation. 
</p>
<p>28. Switzerland acknowledged that the Turkish delegation had addressed questions sent 
in advance.  It mentioned that allegations of torture and other ill treatment remained 
frequent.  Articles 301 and 318 of the Penal Code legitimized acts of harassment and 
persecution of human rights defenders.  It made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>29. Lebanon underscored Turkey&#8217;s decision to issue a standing invitation to special 
procedures and noted Criminal Code reforms, exemplifying a strategy for improving the 
judicial system. Lebanon asked about measures to create an independent human rights 
institution and highlighted efforts to promote women&#8217;s rights and address domestic

</p>
<p>32. Denmark inquired how Turkey planned to prevent acts of torture and ill treatment, 
which remained frequent despite efforts to the contrary, and requested further information 
about measures taken to ensure the rights of ethnic and religious groups, in particular non-
Muslim religious communities.  Denmark made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Kyrgyzstan acknowledged Turkey&#8217;s contribution in promoting security and safety in 
the region. Kyrgyzstan highlighted its robust policies to combat child labour and the 
attention devoted to education, the protection of children, gender equality and women&#8217;s 
rights. Kyrgyzstan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Somalia acknowledged the inclusive consultative process carried out during the 
preparation of the national report and the priority placed by the Government on human 
rights since 2001.  It mentioned several national plans as examples and encouraged the 
development of the road map on asylum and migration.  It recognized the Government of 
Turkey for having hosted the international conference on Somalia from 21 to 23 May 2010. 
</p>
<p>35. Responding to questions, Turkey noted the constitutional safeguards regarding the 
prohibition of discrimination, which were construed to include lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender persons. The right to freedom of assembly for such persons was confirmed by 
case law of supreme courts, and all hate crimes were considered unacceptable, including 
those on grounds of sexual identity.  
</p>
<p>36. In order to ensure equality in practice, Turkey collaborated with representatives of, 
inter alia, the Alevis and the Roma, and was reviewing the curriculums in order to eliminate 
any discriminatory items.  
</p>
<p>37. Various dialects and languages traditionally used were taught in private courses and 
at newly founded university departments, and broadcasts in languages such as Kurdish and 
Arabic were available.  
</p>
<p>38. With the Lausanne Peace Treaty, Turkey had assumed responsibility for the 
protection of non-Muslim citizens as minorities. Any ethnic, racial, linguistic or other 
groups were not recognized as such. Minorities benefited from positive discrimination, 
including teaching in mother tongue in minority schools. The new Law on Foundations had </p>


<p>brought about important progress for foundations in acquiring property, engaging in 
international activities and obtaining financial aid.  
</p>
<p>39. Gender equality before the law was a constitutional principle. Honour killings were 
punished by aggravated life sentences, and initiatives to protect women from violence were 
ongoing.  The Inter-ministerial Monitoring Committee on Violence against Women and the 
Women and Men Equal Opportunity Parliamentary Commission had been established in 
2005 and 2009, respectively. Training on the issue of domestic violence and the reinforced 
legislative framework on gender equality were provided for law enforcement officers, 
health personnel, judges, prosecutors and soldiers, and would soon begin for religious 
leaders.  
</p>
<p>40. Polygamy and mere religious marriages and genital examinations were prohibited. 
Shelters for women subjected to violence were available, and more were planned.  
</p>
<p>41. A parliamentary committee had been founded in 2009 to monitor the 
implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In 2005, the Law on the 
Protection of the Child had entered into force. The Law against Terrorism would be 
amended to ensure that all children suspects, without distinction as to age, would be tried 
under the same regime in the relevant juvenile courts. A significant reduction of child 
labour had occurred since 1997, and the worst forms of child labour would be eliminated by 
</p><p>2015. ILO considered Turkey to be among the countries most effectively combating child 
labour. 
</p>
<p>42. A new justice system based on the protection of children had been developed. 
Juvenile suspects could not be interrogated or investigated without the presence of a 
lawyer, and the provision of legal counsel was compulsory. Judges must receive expertise 
in child psychology and social services, and juvenile suspect trials were closed hearings. 
Law enforcement officers dealing with child delinquency received special training in 
psychology and did not wear uniforms. The use of handcuffs was prohibited.  
</p>
<p>43. Turkey had signed the European Convention for the Protection of Children against 
Sexual Abuse and Exploitation. A &#8220;183&#8221; helpline was available for children and women 
who faced abuse. There were 38 Child and Youth Centres providing social services for 
children living or working in the streets.   
</p>
<p>44. Turkey was determined to ensure full accessibility for persons with disabilities to 
education, training, employment, property and services.  
</p>
<p>45. Freedom of religion and belief and freedom of assembly were guaranteed for all. 
The indication of information on religion in family registries was voluntary. Unfortunate 
isolated attacks against people belonging to different religions had been witnessed in the 
past. Turkey stated that it deplored all hate crimes and noted that the 2007 circular issued 
by the Ministry of Interior contained instructions for preventing such incidents and 
promoting a culture of coexistence and peace. 
</p>
<p>46. The Philippines noted Turkey&#8217;s plans to establish a national human rights institution

persons of Bulgarian identity from Eastern Thrace had been forced to leave their homes and 
had found asylum in Bulgaria.  It stressed that there were pending issues regarding their 
right to housing, land and property, and inquired about the state of implementation of the 
Law on Foundations. Bulgaria made recommendations. </p>

ensuring human rights, it deemed important to underline several measures that would help 
to bring Turkey&#8217;s human rights record in line with its international obligations. It stated that 
persistence of violence against women and children was disconcerting and welcomed the

</p>
<p>63. The delegation of Turkey referred to its struggle against PKK, a terrorist 
organization internationally recognized as such, which was involved in drug and human 
trafficking and had been responsible for the deaths of 40,000 people. Turkey had worked 
not to sacrifice human rights in its fight against terrorism. It noted that difficulties had 
resulted from the lack of an international definition of terrorism. Turkey was determined to 
fight against torture and ill treatment, with a zero-tolerance policy, and was cooperating 
with all international monitoring bodies. The recommendations of CPT and CAT had been  
taken into account. Turkey had published all CPT reports since 2001.  
</p>
<p>64. A judgement adopted by the Court of Cassation in 2002 recognized torture as crime 
against humanity, and statements extracted under torture were not recognized as evidence.

handbook on human rights and the taking of statements had been prepared. Thirty new 
statement-taking rooms had been established in line with international standards.  
</p>

been carried out in 2009, disciplinary sanctions had been implemented, and a project on 
prevention was planned for 2011.   
</p>
<p>66. Relatives of suspects in custody, including for alleged terrorist crimes, were notified 
of the arrest by public prosecutors. Suspects had the right to gain access to a lawyer. This 
freedom could only be restricted for 24 hours by a judge&#8217;s decision for crimes of terrorism, 
and no statement could be taken without a lawyer&#8217;s presence. In 2008 and 2009, anti-terror 
departments of the police departments had been equipped with audio-visual recording 
systems in 44 provinces. There were no other official custody areas other than those 
belonging to the law enforcement forces.  
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>67. Freedom of expression was an integral part of Turkey&#8217;s democratic order, and the 
relevant legislation was being harmonized with the case law of the ECHR and other 
international instruments. In order to eliminate some of the problems with its 
implementation, article 301 of the Penal Code had been amended. The Ministry of Justice 
had formed a working group to review certain articles found problematic by non-
governmental organizations and international bodies.  
</p>
<p>68. Judges and prosecutors were trained at the justice academy on press freedom and 
freedom of expression. In 2007, the law on access to the Internet and on countering crimes 
committed through the Internet had been promulgated. Internet access could be restricted 
for only a limited number of crimes by a judge&#8217;s decision, in accordance with the law.  
</p>
<p>69. To eliminate income disparities between regions, Turkey had been implementing 
development plans and strategies since the 1960s.  
</p>
<p>70. The voluntary return of internally displaced persons were facilitated through the 
Return to Village Project, implemented together with UNDP, which included 
comprehensive measures such as infrastructure investment and direct material and 
professional assistance. Furthermore, under Compensation Law 5233, damages caused to 
citizens as a result of terrorism were settled amicably. 
</p>
<p>71. The Netherlands welcomed the precedence of international agreements over 
domestic law, and improvements of prison conditions. Concerns remained regarding the 
suspension of the establishment of the ombudsman institution, the non-recognition of 
minorities other than non-Muslim ones mentioned in the Lausanne Peace Treaty, and a 
number of laws that might limit freedom of expression, including the anti-terrorism law and 
article 301 of the Penal Code, as amended in 2008. The Netherlands made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>72. Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed Turkey&#8217;s ratification of a number of treaties, but

</p>
<p>91. The delegation of Turkey stated that those asylum-seekers without refugee status 
whose lives were under threat in their own countries were allowed to temporarily stay in 
Turkey and that their educational, social and medical needs were covered. Since March 
2010, refugees had been exempted from paying residence fees and granted the right to 
asylum until the date of their deportation. 
</p>
<p>92. Relevant legislation was being aligned with international standards, and Turkey was 
working on a new asylum law. Turkey was also trying to improve the accommodation 
conditions of irregular migrants, who, according to a new Ministry of Interior circular 
issued in March 2010, were kept in removal centres and not placed in detention centres. 
</p>
<p>93. Equal rights were provided for refugees and asylum-seekers from the east of Turkey. 
They benefited from health services and eight years of primary education, and could reside 
in Turkey until resettled in a third country by UNHCR. Removal centres had been 
established in 33 provinces, and 6 more were planned.  
</p>
<p>94. Turkey was determined to combat human trafficking. In March 2009, it had signed 
the European Convention against Human Trafficking and established a taskforce to review 
its legislation. Trafficking had been recognized as a crime in 2002, and the definition in the 
new Turkish Penal Code was in line with the Palermo Protocol. The concept of forced 
prostitution had been added to the definition in 2006. Redrafting was under way in order to 
overcome the implementation problems experienced with article 79 of TPC, so that an 
attempt to traffic would be sufficient for penalizing such acts.  
</p>
<p>95. The National Action Plan to combat human trafficking envisaged extensive 
measures for the rehabilitation of victims, such as providing shelters for their treatment and 
care, ensuring their safe and voluntary return to their countries, training law enforcement 
officers and protecting witnesses. The second national action plan to combat trafficking had 
been approved in 2009.  
</p>
<p>96. Turkey had issued a standing invitation to special procedures in 2001 and closely 
cooperated with international and regional human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>97. The delegation noted that legislative work aimed at the harmonization of trade union 
legislation with ILO and European Union standards was continuing with the cooperation of 
the social partners. Restrictions on the right to freedom of assembly and to strike had been 
removed, and Turkey had signed the Decent Work Country Programme with ILO in 2009. 
Labour law provided for the prohibition of all forms of discrimination in employer-</p>


<p>employee relations, including discrimination regarding gender and pregnancy. For women 
employees, a social security employer premium could be paid out of the unemployment 
fund for five years. Certain products manufactured by women were exempted from the 
income tax, and positive results had been obtained through microcredit projects. Sexual 
harassment in the workplace was a crime punishable by two years of imprisonment and 
gave the worker the right to revoke her or his work contract. 
</p>
<p>98. The Turkish delegation reiterated its well-known position with regard to the Cyprus 
question; referred to document A/HRC/13/G/4 that had been circulated; recalled that 
Turkey did not recognize Republic of Cyprus; reaffirmed that legitimate presence of 
Turkey on the island was the result of its obligations and rights stemming from the Treaties 
of 1960; noted that negotiations between the two parties on the island were ongoing under 
the auspices of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>99. In conclusion, the head of the Turkish delegation thanked all participants in the 
dialogue and emphasized that all questions and recommendations would be carefully 
assessed. He stated that the review had given Turkey an opportunity for an extensive 
evaluation of the human rights situation and indicated that the recommendations would lend 
greater impetus to the reforms. Turkey would submit a voluntary interim report and pursue 
its efforts.
