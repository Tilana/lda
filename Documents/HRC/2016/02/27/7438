<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>This report presents an overview of the human rights situation in the Plurinational 
</p>
<p>State of Bolivia and the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights office in Bolivia (OHCHR-Bolivia) in 2014. 
</p>
<p>President Evo Morales Ayma was re-elected in the October 2014 general elections. 
</p>
<p>As a result of the elections, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly will have equal male 
</p>
<p>and female representation. 
</p>
<p>Income redistribution programmes have registered progress in the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights and in the fight against extreme poverty. Food 
</p>
<p>insecurity fell from 38 per cent to 19.5 per cent. 
</p>
<p>The High Commissioner is concerned about the number of femicides, the length of 
</p>
<p>the related investigations and the low number of convictions. The adoption in 2013 of 
</p>
<p>Comprehensive Law 348 guaranteeing women a life free from violence, and the publication 
</p>
<p>of the corresponding regulation in October 2014, constitute an important step forward in 
</p>
<p>the struggle against gender-based violence.

<p>The High Commissioner welcomes the initiative taken in October by female judges 
</p>
<p>of the judicial branch and the Constitutional Court to present a draft policy on gender 
</p>
<p>equality in judicial institutions. 
</p>
<p>President Morales presented a bill to the Legislative Assembly on free, prior and 
</p>
<p>informed consultation, which is still under debate. 
</p>
<p>The main structural problems facing the administration of justice mentioned in 
</p>
<p>previous reports persist and have become worse. The High Commissioner hopes that the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the National Council for Strategic Development of the Bolivian Justice 
</p>
<p>System will be the first step towards effective judicial reform. 
</p>
<p>The emblematic cases cited in the present report exemplify the delays in the delivery 
</p>
<p>of justice, resulting in impunity. OHCHR remains concerned at the high level of pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention (82.09 % of prisoners), despite short- and medium-term measures taken to 
</p>
<p>combat it. 
</p>
<p>Also of concern to the High Commissioner are developments affecting human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and civil society organizations. OHCHR-Bolivia has received reports of delays in 
</p>
<p>the granting of legal status to some non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>Finally, this report refers to the activities carried out by OHCHR-Bolivia and 
</p>
<p>includes 10 recommendations by the High Commissioner.

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4  
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In February 2007, at the invitation of the Government of Bolivia, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) signed an agreement to 
</p>
<p>set up an office in that country (OHCHR-Bolivia) with a mandate to monitor and report on 
</p>
<p>the situation of human rights and to provide public institutions and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations with technical assistance. The agreement was approved by Congress on 
</p>
<p>13 July 2007 and renewed for a second period up to 21 August 2015. 
</p>
<p><b> II. National context 
</b></p>
<p>2. In the general elections held on 12 October 2014, Evo Morales Ayma was re-elected 
President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for a third term, with 61.36 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>votes. As a result of those elections, 49.78 per cent of the representatives in the new 
</p>
<p>Legislative Assembly will be women (66 deputies, 16 senators and 5 supranational 
</p>
<p>deputies).1 
</p>
<p>3. In June, a summit of heads of State and government of the Group of 77 and China 
on the theme &#8220;Towards a New World Order for Living Well&#8221;, was held in Santa Cruz de la 
Sierra, Plurinational State of Bolivia, with the participation of 16 presidents, high-level 
</p>
<p>representatives of 133 States and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The 
</p>
<p>participants adopted the Declaration of Santa Cruz, with a human rights focus on economic 
</p>
<p>and social development, climate change, migration, women&#8217;s rights, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights and cooperation. The Secretary-General also undertook a tour of the country on that 
</p>
<p>occasion.  
</p>
<p>4. In October 2014, the General Assembly of the United Nations elected the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia to the Human Rights Council for a second term, for the period 
</p>
<p>2015-2017.  
</p>
<p>5. Also in October, the Plurinational State of Bolivia underwent its second-cycle 
examination by the Human Rights Council Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
</p>
<p>Review. While it was generally recognized that the country had made progress in the field 
</p>
<p>of human rights, 193 recommendations were made on economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>the administration of justice, gender-based violence and femicide, the prison system and 
</p>
<p>child labour. The Plurinational State of Bolivia accepted 46 recommendations, rejected 15 
</p>
<p>and identified 132 as having been already implemented or as currently being implemented. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR-Bolivia provided technical assistance to the State and to civil society in this 
</p>
<p>process.  
</p>
<p>6. In recent years, the Plurinational State of Bolivia has demonstrated its commitment 
to human rights by ratifying numerous treaties and by submitting pending reports. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the High Commissioner urges it to better coordinate the drafting of the 
</p>
<p>reports among the State institutions involved, to use statistical data, and to consider 
</p>
<p>establishing a body for monitoring and implementing international recommendations. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 United Nations Development Programme and UN-Women, October 2014: &#8220;Bolivia: results of the 
</p>
<p>general elections 2014 from a gender perspective&#8221;.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Human rights situation  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. The High Commissioner considers that income-distribution programmes have led to 
progress in the enjoyment of social and economic rights and the fight against extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty, primarily among the most vulnerable. These programmes benefit 38.3 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the population.
2
 They should continue focusing on reducing the inequality gaps among the 
</p>
<p>population and promoting more complete inclusiveness. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Education  
</b></p>
<p>8. The Plurinational State of Bolivia is the second country in Latin America in terms of  
investment in education and culture, which amounts to 6.7 per cent of the gross national 
</p>
<p>product.3 
</p>
<p>9. Until December 2014, the Juancito Pinto grant,4 designed to promote school 
attendance, benefited 2,262,867 boys, girls and young people throughout the country. Its 
</p>
<p>coverage was extended to include those in the sixth year of secondary school, as well as 
</p>
<p>8,500 students with disabilities.5 A Certificate of Excellence in  Baccalaureate-level Studies 
</p>
<p>was established,  whereby US$ 146
6
  was awarded at the end of the 2014 school year to the 
</p>
<p>two students in every school&#8212;a boy and a girl&#8212;with the highest average grade.  
</p>
<p>10. A programme offering 100 scholarships for international postgraduate study in areas 
considered strategic by the State was launched in 20147 for professionals and students at 
</p>
<p>public and private universities, with an excellent academic record.   
</p>
<p>11. By July, under the &#8220;A computer for every teacher&#8221; project to promote the use of new 
technologies in education, 78,153 laptops had been distributed free of charge to all the 
</p>
<p>teachers across the country. And under the &#8220;A computer for every student&#8221; programme,8 a 
further 25,000 computers were distributed free of charge to primary and secondary school 
</p>
<p>students to use for at school.   
</p>
<p><b>2. Health 
</b></p>
<p>12. Under the &#8220;My health&#8221; programme, which began in June 2013, to provide home 
medical services free of charge, work was carried out to expand, remodel and equip 40 
</p>
<p>health centres.9 In addition, a community rehabilitation centre for persons with disabilities 
</p>
<p>was set up in each department, which also offered services free of charge. Nevertheless, the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner notes weaknesses in the health system, particularly with regard to 
</p>
<p>protocols for patient care, the lack of human resources and equipment and the absence of 
</p>
<p>adequate budgetary allocations.<b>

<p>the school dropout levels from 6 per cent in 2006 to 1.7 per cent in 2014.  
</p>

<p><b>3. Water, housing and basic services  
</b></p>
<p>13. By the end of 2013, clean water coverage was 81 per cent and sanitation 51.7 per 
cent.
</p>
<p>10
 There were, however, significant differences among the country&#8217;s regions.11  
</p>
<p>14. The Vice-Ministry for Housing and City Planning carried out a programme offering 
loans with a 3 per cent interest rate to sectors of the population wishing to acquire State 
</p>
<p>housing. Beneficiaries were chosen from persons whose income was less than that set out in 
</p>
<p>the Financial Services Act.
12
</p>
<p>  As a result, more than 10,000 families have received housing 
</p>
<p>loans.13 The Law has also opened up greater access to private housing through lowering 
</p>
<p>interest rates and through offering mortgage facilities.  
</p>
<p>15. The public electricity service &#8220;decent rate&#8221; (<i>tarifa dignidad</i>) in place since 2006, 
which offers a discount to low-income families, has reached around 900,000 beneficiaries a 
</p>
<p>month across the country.  
</p>
<p>16. In December 2013, the Plurinational State of Bolivia launched the T&#250;pac Katari 
satellite to provide equitable access to telecommunications, including the Internet, and 
</p>
<p>telephone and television services throughout the country&#8217;s nine departments, especially in 
rural areas. The satellite went into service in April 2014. Since September, 1,000 centres
</p>
<p>14
 
</p>
<p>have been constructed, mostly in isolated rural areas, providing Internet access, computers, 
</p>
<p>satellite television and telephone services. Remote educational and medical services are 
</p>
<p>also being developed to contribute to existing efforts in the provision of education and 
</p>
<p>health in isolated areas.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>4. The right to food 
</b></p>
<p>17. As a result of the implementation of policies led by the National Council of Food 
and Nutrition (CONAN)&#8212;an interministerial body aimed at promoting the right to 
adequate and sufficient food&#8212;the malnutrition rate dropped from 38 per cent  in 1990-1992 
to 19.5 per cent in 2012-2014.15  
</p>
<p>18. The multisectoral programme &#8220;Zero malnutrition&#8221;, aimed at improving the overall 
health of children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and nursing mothers brought the 
</p>
<p>chronic malnutrition rate down to 16 per cent in 2014.
16
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>5. Human rights indicators 
</b></p>
<p>19. Since 2012, the Ministry of Justice and the National Institute of Statistics have been 
leading efforts to develop human rights indicators, with technical assistance from OHCHR-
</p>
<p>Bolivia. This process is to help the Plurinational State of Bolivia monitor the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in the country and the impact of public policies, and the incorporation of 
</p>
<p>statistical and quantitative information with a human rights-based approach into the State&#180;s 
</p>
<p>reports to the international human rights mechanisms. Along with 25 State institutions, they 
</p>
<p>have defined 400 indicators for six prioritized rights: food, education, health, work and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 Ministry of the Environment and Water. Coverage for 2014 will be calculated at the end of the year. 
</p>
<p>As of December 2012, the Plurinational State of Bolivia exceeded the Millennium Development Goal  
</p>
<p>on the right to water, two years before the deadline, thanks to the implementation of the &#8220;My Water&#8221; 
</p>
<p>and &#8220;My Water II&#8221; programmes (see A/HRC/25/19/Add.2, para.31).

<p>housing, and the right of women to a life free from violence. Comparative human rights 
</p>
<p>information and statistical data are available over time for 65 per cent of the indicators. In 
</p>
<p>2014, priority was given to three further rights: access to potable water, a life free from 
</p>
<p>trafficking, and access to justice and a fair trial.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>6. National Plan of Action for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>20. In 2014 the Ministry of Justice coordinated the development of the new National 
Plan of Action for Human Rights for 2015-2020 with  technical assistance from OHCHR-
</p>
<p>Bolivia, within the framework of the National Human Rights Council&#8212;a body comprising 
State institutions and civil society. The Plan gives priority to the rights highlighted in the 
</p>
<p>Patriotic Agenda 2025,17 to actions remaining from the 2009-2013 Plan and to 
</p>
<p>recommendations from international human rights mechanisms. The plan includes six 
</p>
<p>strategic areas: civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural rights; the rights of 
</p>
<p>rural native peoples and nations; women&#8217;s rights; the rights of people in vulnerable 
situations; and the management of rights (<i>gesti&#243;n de derechos</i>). The Plurinational Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Policy 2015-202018 was drawn up using the same methodology.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. </b>Women&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>21. The adoption in 2013 of Comprehensive Law348 guaranteeing women a life free 
from violence, along with the promulgation of its implementing decree in 2014, mark a step 
</p>
<p>forward in the fight against gender-based violence. Of particular note in the decree is the 
</p>
<p>allocation of increased resources to certain bodies tasked with addressing gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, including the national police&#8217;s Special Force against Violence (FELCV), and to 
departments for the construction of women&#8217;s shelters. Nevertheless, the delay between the 
promulgation of the Law and the promulgation of its implementing decree has not 
</p>
<p>facilitated implementation. 
</p>
<p>22. According to the Observatory of Violence against Women of the Women&#8217;s Centre 
for  Information and Development of Women (CIDEM), a non-governmental organization 
</p>
<p>(NGO) specializing in the issue of violence against women, 105 femicides were 
</p>
<p>documented between January and October 2014. Most were allegedly committed by 
</p>
<p>partners or ex-partners of the victims. These figures differ from those presented by the 
</p>
<p>FELCV for the same period, which registered 54 femicides. This difference may indicate 
</p>
<p>the need to harmonize the criteria and methodology for addressing the application of the 
</p>
<p>newly defined crime of femicide. 
</p>
<p>23. The High Commissioner is concerned at the high number of femicides, the long 
duration of investigations and the low number of prosecutions in 2014, despite the adoption  
</p>
<p>of Act 348 in 2013.19 
</p>
<p>24. OHCHR-Bolivia followed up on one case of femicide  which occurred in September 
in Achacachi, in which two army sergeants invited two 17-year-old girls who were doing 
</p>
<p>their pre-military service20 to drink some strong alcohol with them. Afterwards, the men 
</p>
<p>reportedly drugged the girls, raped them and killed one of them. The sergeants were 
</p>
<p>dismissed from their posts, arrested and detained on charges of femicide. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 See A/HRC/25/19/Add.2, para. 2. 
</p>
<p> 18 At the end of 2014, both documents were pending approval by the National Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p> 19 The Ministry of Communications reported that up to November 2014 only five sentences had been 
</p>
<p>handed down. 
</p>
<p> 20 Supreme Decree No. 27057 calls on young people of both sexes to do their military service 
</p>
<p>voluntarily when they are in the fifth year of secondary school. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8  
</b></p>
<p>25. The High Commissioner is also concerned about the alleged rape of a woman with 
disabilities which was committed by seven police officers in Cochabamba in July 2014, and 
</p>
<p>the reported cover-up of the incident by some police authorities. The High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>awaits the results of the investigation, as well as a strong response from the State in relation 
</p>
<p>to this case.  
</p>
<p>26. In February 2014, the Constitutional Court issued a decision eliminating the 
requirement for judicial authorization for legal abortion services in cases of rape, sexual 
</p>
<p>abuse during kidnapping, incest, and danger to the life or health of the mother.21 The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner  considers this to be a step forward for women&#8217;s rights, in compliance with 
various special procedures&#8217; and treaty bodies&#8217; recommendations, as it reduces the legal 
obstacles that used to be faced by women in seeking legal abortion.  
</p>
<p>27. Under article 11 of the Electoral Procedure Law, the Supreme Electoral Court, 
guaranteed parity and the principle of alternation of male and female candidates for deputy 
</p>
<p>and senator seats in the October 2014 elections, and required political parties to ensure that 
</p>
<p>50 per cent of their registered candidates were women. Whereas in 1982, 2 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s legislators were women,  they now constitute 49.78 per cent of parliamentarians 
(i.e. 66 deputies, 16 senators and 5 supranational deputies). The Plurinational State of 
</p>
<p>Bolivia is the country with the second highest level of women&#8217;s participation in parliament 
in the world, and the highest in the Americas.  
</p>
<p>28. The High Commissioner welcomes, in particular, the initiative by women 
magistrates of  the high courts to publicly present in October 2014 a draft policy on gender 
</p>
<p>equality in judicial institutions. This draft policy foresees the creation of a gender unit and a 
</p>
<p>gender  observatory. The women judges&#8217; steering committee decided to put in place some 
of the key monitoring instruments before their official adoption. 
</p>
<p><b> C. </b>Indigenous peoples&#8217; rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>29. The rights of indigenous peoples remain high on the national agenda, and are 
becoming increasingly important at the municipal and departmental levels. In May 2014,  
</p>
<p>President Morales submitted a bill to Parliament on prior, free and informed consultation. 
</p>
<p>At the end of 2014, the bill remained under discussion in the Constitution and Legislation 
</p>
<p>Commission of the Chamber of Deputies. The High Commissioner believes that its prompt 
</p>
<p>adoption will afford the greatest protection possible for the collective rights of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples. 
</p>
<p>30. Also in May 2014, the Mining and Metallurgy Law 535 came into effect,  
recognizing the right of indigenous peoples to have a share in the benefits of the 
</p>
<p>exploitation of the resources in their lands, in conformity with the mining regulation on 
</p>
<p>participation in benefits and with the application of the collective right to prior, free and 
</p>
<p>informed consultation.22 Nevertheless, the application of the Law is mandated only for new 
</p>
<p>mining contracts and is limited to the exploitation phase, excluding consultation and 
</p>
<p>consent for the prospecting and exploration phases. This exclusion fails to comply with 
</p>
<p>international standards. The High Commissioner is of the opinion that the regulations under 
</p>
<p>this Act, which could affect the interests of indigenous peoples, should be drawn up in 
</p>
<p>consultation with the organizations that represent them. 
</p>
<p>31. The Constitutional Court confirmed as constitutional the autonomous-statute 
projects to convert the municipalities of Charagua, Totora Marka and Mojocoya into 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 Constitutional Decision 0206/2014 eliminating the requirement of a judicial authorization for legal 
</p>
<p>abortion services in case of rape, sexual abuse during kidnapping, incest, and danger to the life or 
</p>
<p>health of the mother.  
</p>
<p> 22 Law 535 on Mining and Metallurgy, arts. 19 and 207-222. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b> 9 
</b></p>
<p>autonomous indigenous areas. The status of nine other municipalities undergoing similar 
</p>
<p>procedures remains pending. The National Coordinating Body of Indigenous Autonomous 
</p>
<p>Areas requested that the Court speed up its analysis of their proposed autonomous status in 
</p>
<p>view of the municipal elections planned for 2015. Although the autonomous status of three 
</p>
<p>municipalities has been declared constitutional, the process has been quite slow, to the 
</p>
<p>detriment of indigenous populations&#8217; exercising their autonomy. 
</p>
<p>32. In March, the Vice-Minister for Energy Development  brokered agreements between 
those involved in the restitution of the collective rights of the Guaran&#237; people in the Alto 
</p>
<p>Parapet&#237; territory. The organization representing them had denounced the oil company 
</p>
<p>active on Guaran&#237; lands for interference in their organizational structure. Such interference 
</p>
<p>by oil-company employees in Guaran&#237; affairs has been a source of constant complaint. In 
</p>
<p>this context the technical and operational capacity of the Office of Socio-environmental 
</p>
<p>Management within the Ministry for Hydrocarbons needs to be increased to enable it to 
</p>
<p>carry out its functions properly,  including the duty to protect the collective rights of the 
</p>
<p>Guaran&#237; people and to insist on and promote the business sector&#8217;s obligation to respect 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>33. OHCHR-Bolivia has monitored the petitions submitted by the Yampara and Qhara 
Qhara indigenous organizations of Chuquisaca to obtain a favourable response to their 
</p>
<p>requests to be considered as minorities and to be represented before the Legislative 
</p>
<p>Departmental Assembly. In November 2014, the Assembly approved their request, in 
</p>
<p>compliance with a resolution by the Constitutional Court. The High Commissioner is 
</p>
<p>concerned about the lack of police protection provided to the Yampara and Qhara Qhara 
</p>
<p>indigenous leaders during a vigil in June 2014, when they were victims of physical violence 
</p>
<p>and discriminatory language and behaviour, including the destruction of symbols of 
</p>
<p>indigenous authority, by some peasants from the area.  
</p>
<p>34. The High Commissioner welcomes the decision on 10 July by the Chuquisaca 
Departmental Court of Justice on 10 July 2014 to recognize the Quila Quila as an 
</p>
<p>indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>35. With regard to the organizational status of the National Council of Ayllus and 
Markas of Qullasuyu (CONAMAQ), OHCHR-Bolivia publicly called on the authorities23 to 
</p>
<p>protect the collective rights of this organization and the indigenous peoples it represents. 
</p>
<p>The High Commissioner is concerned about acts of violence against a group of leaders in 
</p>
<p>the area outside the CONAMAQ offices carried out by another group of Council members 
</p>
<p>in defiance of the procedures and peaceful mechanisms for resolving differences within the 
</p>
<p>organization.  
</p>
<p>36. The investigation by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office into excessive use of force by 
the police during the 8th Indigenous March in September 2011, en Chaparina (Beni), 
</p>
<p>described in previous reports,24 is still continuing. The victims lodged a writ of protection 
</p>
<p>against the April 2014 decision of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to exclude a former 
government minister from the investigations.25 The review court granted the victims&#8217; writ, 
asking the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to issue a new resolution. In July 2014, the Attorney&#8217;s 
Office carried out a reconstruction of the events, which provided better insight what 
</p>
<p>happened. Some of the victims claimed they could not participate in this judicial action.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23 OHCHR-Bolivia, press release of 6 January 2014. 
</p>
<p> 24 In 2012, for the first time (A/HCR/19/21/Add. 2, para. 21): &#8220;On 24 September, several marchers 
</p>
<p>stopped the Foreign Minister, David Choquehuanca C&#233;spedes, forcing him to cross the police barrier 
</p>
<p>near the indigenous encampment and march with them against his will for some seven kilometres. A 
</p>
<p>number of marchers and police were injured during this incident&#8221;.  See also the reports from 2013  
</p>
<p>   (A/HRC/19/21/Add.2)  and 2014 (A/HRC/25/19/Add.2). 
</p>
<p> 25 The penal investigation was opened in September 2011. In July 2012, the prosecution decided to 
</p>
<p>exclude the minister from any further investigation. In February 2014, the decision was confirmed.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> D. Racism and other forms of discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>37. The National Committee against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination, a 
consultative body with plural representation created in 2010 by Law 45, held only one of 
</p>
<p>the two annual sessions foreseen in its regulations. During that session, it evaluated the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the programmes on access to justice for and consultations with 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples under the Action Plan against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>The Committee drew attention to the content of the draft law on prior, free and informed 
</p>
<p>consultation, in particular the elements on full participation and advances towards 
</p>
<p>coordination of the ordinary and indigenous justice systems. The Committee also approved 
</p>
<p>a monitoring system for the implementation of the Action Plan. Nonetheless, the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner is concerned that the Plan has yet to be implemented in a coordinated 
</p>
<p>manner by the executive branch, which has weakened the National Committee&#180;s 
</p>
<p>enforcement capacities, as well as its leadership in that respect.  
</p>
<p>38. The Committee has resolved a complaint by Afro-Bolivian organizations regarding 
the stigmatization of their history of slavery in popular culture manifestations. It determined 
</p>
<p>that traditional dance groups must eliminate all traces of racist, discriminatory or distorting 
</p>
<p>content.26 
</p>
<p>39. By 31 October, the General Directorate against Racism and All Forms of 
Discrimination had registered 157 complaints, of which it accepted 137 relating to 
</p>
<p>discrimination based on physical appearance, level of education, origin, gender or age, inter 
</p>
<p>alia. The main institutions denounced are education centres, as well as some State and 
</p>
<p>private institutions. Complaints in the education sector related to harassment, physical or 
</p>
<p>psychological violence, and bullying.  
</p>
<p>40. The Vice-Ministry for Decolonization and the Ministry of Education took various 
actions to fight against discrimination in education, including meeting with directors of 
</p>
<p>educational centres in all the departmental capitals. In La Paz, more than one thousand 
</p>
<p>school directors of that department got together to review the application of  Law 45, which 
</p>
<p>calls for a revision of the regulations governing educational establishments.   
</p>
<p><b> E. Administration of justice and the fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>41. The main structural problems facing the administration of justice mentioned in past 
reports by the High Commissioner persisted and became more serious: low coverage, a 
</p>
<p>large backlog of cases,27 impunity, low public confidence in institutions of justice, lack of 
</p>
<p>access to justice, long delays in the delivery of justice, lack of independence of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary, and obvious incapacity to guarantee due process. The budget of judicial 
</p>
<p>institutions28 is insufficient.29 Furthermore, the sector is vulnerable to corruption and 
</p>
<p>political influence. At the beginning of the year, the judicial crisis deepened as a result of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 26 The Committee determined that the traditional dance associations must eliminate all racist, 
</p>
<p>discriminatory or distorting content specifically from the dance of the &#8220;tundiquis&#8221; and / or &#8220;negritos&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>It recommended eliminating from the performance and execution of the dances attitudes, expressions 
</p>
<p>or other content misrepresenting, mocking, ridiculing or recreating taunts or stereotypes about Afro-
</p>
<p>Bolivian people and culture. 
</p>
<p> 27 Only 47 per cent of the country&#8217;s 339 municipalities have a judge, and 41 per cent a prosecutor. In all, 
</p>
<p>63 per cent (330,548) of proceedings begun &#8211; in all areas &#8211; have been left pending until the next court 
</p>
<p>session. Judicial Council (2013), Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office (2014).

</b></p>
<p>the changes in the presidencies of the main judicial institutions,30 and this provoked public 
</p>
<p>discontent and statements by high-ranking authorities of the executive and legislative 
</p>
<p>branches of government about the performance of the judicial authorities elected in 2011.31 
</p>
<p>Discussion about the legal mechanisms to shorten their mandates began in the media.32 The 
</p>
<p>judicial reform, started almost five years ago, has so far not delivered the expected results 
</p>
<p>to redress the persisting and deep structural problems relating to the administration of 
</p>
<p>justice.  
</p>
<p>42. The High Commissioner welcomes in particular the creation, in January 2014, of the 
National Council for Strategic Development of the Bolivian Judicial System, made up of 
</p>
<p>the Constitutional Court, the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. The Council has 
begun drafting a proposal for judicial reform, on the basis of the recently approved strategic 
</p>
<p>plans of the institutions of justice.33 The High Commissioner also welcomes the setting up 
</p>
<p>of  the Sectoral Justice Board, which brings together the above-mentioned institutions, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice and international cooperation agencies. He recognizes the efforts of the 
</p>
<p>institutions of justice and their international partners to implement projects and measures to 
</p>
<p>consolidate judicial independence and transparency, as well as access to justice.  
</p>
<p><b>1. Judicial independence 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Chamber of Deputies suspended Constitutional Court judges Ligia Vel&#225;squez, 
Rosario Ch&#225;nez and Gualberto Cusi as a result of criminal and administrative proceedings 
</p>
<p>brought against them by the Legislative Assembly in accordance with Law 044,
34
</p>
<p> for 
</p>
<p>allegedly making unconstitutional and unlawful decisions, perversion of the course of 
</p>
<p>justice and non-fulfilment of duty. At the initiative of the Government, Law 044 was 
</p>
<p>amended by Law 612 on 3 December 2014, removing the criminal prosecution attributions 
</p>
<p>and maintaining only the possibility to dismiss high judicial authorities for administrative 
</p>
<p>reasons.    <b> 
</b></p>
<p>44. However, OHCHR-Bolivia noted that the manner in which the proceedings were  
conducted could constitute a violation of the right to due process and in particular the right 
</p>
<p>to a complete defence for the accused. 
</p>
<p>45. With regard to the procedures for appointing judges, the High Commissioner 
highlights the efforts of the Council of the Judiciary to draft, in a participatory manner, the 
</p>
<p>Judicial Career Rules approved in April 2014. The implementation of these rules will 
</p>
<p>provide judges with stability of tenure and promote judicial independence.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Institutional transparency and judicial corruption 
</b></p>
<p>46. With regard to the effectiveness of the disciplinary regime for judges and justice 
officials,35 in 2013 the disciplining judges received 1,878 complaints from throughout the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 30 In February 2014, the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and the President of the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court resigned (one year before the end of their mandates). In April 2014, the 
</p>
<p>President of the Agro-environmental Court resigned.

<p>country, and the Disciplinary Office of the Council of the Judiciary conducted 
</p>
<p>384 proceedings (at the review stage). Annually, 65 per cent of the complaints received are 
</p>
<p>processed, with the remaining 35 per cent being carried over to the next session. There is no 
</p>
<p>computerized database of complaints, which makes monitoring difficult. During the first six 
</p>
<p>months of 2014, the disciplinary courts issued 252 resolutions, declaring 52 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>complaints unfounded and 37.4 per cent justified; 7.5 per cent were dismissed and 3.1 per 
</p>
<p>cent were considered to have lapsed. 36 
</p>
<p>47. In July 2014, the Ministry of Transparency and the Fight against Corruption, with 
the support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), received a visit 
</p>
<p>from a United Nations team to evaluate the implementation of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Corruption. In 2015, the team will present a report to the 
</p>
<p>Implementation Review Group of the Convention. The High Commissioner acknowledges 
</p>
<p>the Government&#8217;s initiative and the positive results achieved by the Ministry, which has 
recovered over 100,000,000 dollars, sometimes even placing its own staff at risk.   
</p>
<p><b>3. Penal justice system  
</b></p>
<p>48. The High Commissioner remains concerned about the high rates of pretrial detention 
and the backlog of criminal cases.37 In response to this situation, judicial institutions 
</p>
<p>approved a series of short- and medium-term measures. The High Commissioner would like 
</p>
<p>to draw attention to the 49.8 per cent increase in the 2014 budget of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office over 2013. This enabled the institution to increase its coverage from 23 per cent to 
</p>
<p>41 per cent of municipalities and to raise the number of forensic personnel from 54 to 61. 
</p>
<p>49. The Supreme Court of Justice and the Council of the Judiciary approved a plan to 
deal with the backlog in the penal system which foresees an increase in the number of penal 
</p>
<p>judges in order to improve the effectiveness of the departmental courts. The Public 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the Council of the Judiciary approved a pilot programme of special 
units for suspects caught in flagrante delicto. These units cover four districts (La Paz, 
</p>
<p>Cochabamba, Santa Cruz and Chuquisaca) and aim to process cases within 72 hours.  
</p>
<p>50. On 30 October 2014, Law 586 was adopted, with the aim of reducing the backlog of 
cases in the penal system by accelerating the processing of cases. The Law abolishes some 
</p>
<p>norms of the Code of Criminal Procedure: for instance, it removes the institution of citizen 
</p>
<p>judges, which the High Commissioner had considered a constitutional improvement with 
</p>
<p>regard to the exercise of people&#8217;s right to participation in the administration of justice.38 
While urging the swift reduction of the backlog of cases, the High Commissioner finds that 
</p>
<p>this and other measures included in the law, such as the possibility for judges to financially 
</p>
<p>sanction lawyers whose petitions have been rejected, could be discussed in the future in the 
</p>
<p>context of judicial reform.  
</p>
<p>51. The High Commissioner is also concerned that the critical situation faced by the 
National Public Defender Service (SEPDEP). Over the past five years,39 the State has not 
</p>
<p>significantly increased the budget of this institution; yet, according to the latest figures 
</p>
<p>available,40 it only has 68 public defenders in urban areas and 15 in rural areas. Of these, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 36 According to the Council of the Judiciary, 44 sanctions were imposed on various civil servants: one 
</p>
<p>Appeal Court judge, 16 judges, 19 Court clerks and 8 support staff.  
</p>
<p> 37 According to the Council of the Judiciary, in 2013, 78 per cent (132,515) of the proceedings begun at 
</p>
<p>the instruction level were carried over to the next year, and the rate of pretrial detention is 82.09 per 
</p>
<p>cent. 
</p>
<p> 38 Political Constitution of the State (2009), arts. 178 and 241. 
</p>
<p> 39 In 2014, the budget assigned by the State to SEPDEP was Bs. 6.9 million. The budget was increased 
</p>
<p>to Bs. 14.2 million, with temporary funds from international partners (Swiss Agency for Development 
</p>
<p>and Cooperation, and Danish International Development Agency).  
</p>
<p> 40 SEPDEP, 2014. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b> 13 
</b></p>
<p>29 posts are financed by international cooperation partners. The Service estimates that it 
</p>
<p>would need another 10 defenders to manage its caseload.41 
</p>
<p><b>4. Legal pluralism 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Supreme Court of Justice has begun drafting and validating a policy and 
protocol for coordinating the ordinary and the indigenous justice systems. The Vice-
</p>
<p>Ministry of Indigenous Justice drafted the public policy for the consolidation of indigenous 
</p>
<p>justice. Both instruments will strengthen coordination between ordinary justice and rural 
</p>
<p>native indigenous systems. 
</p>
<p>53. The High Commissioner welcomes the initiative of the Constitutional Court to 
create departmental and national bodies to coordinate with the rural indigenous, peoples 
</p>
<p>and nations.42 He commends the Vice-Ministry of Indigenous Justice on its support to 
</p>
<p>indigenous authorities in the resolution of emblematic cases, and in gaining access to 
</p>
<p>constitutional justice.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Emblematic cases 
</b></p>
<p>54. OHCHR-Bolivia continued to monitor certain emblematic cases, revealing 
considerable delays in the delivery of justice, which result in impunity. 
</p>
<p><b>1. The El Porvenir massacre case  
</b></p>
<p>55. On 11 September 2008, the passage of a group of indigenous people and rural 
workers headed for the city of Cobija was blocked at El Porvenir, Pando, by anti-
</p>
<p>government officials from the Pando Prefecture. This resulted in violence, leading to the 
</p>
<p>deaths of 11 people,43 with some 50 more injured.   
</p>
<p>56. In relation to this incident, criminal proceedings were initiated against the former 
Pando governor (Prefect), Leopoldo Fern&#225;ndez, several civil servants from the Prefecture 
</p>
<p>and other followers.  The case is at the oral hearings stage, with only five of the accused 
</p>
<p>present. In 2014, witness statements, as well as documentary and material evidence, were 
</p>
<p>presented, and the final defence statements and verdicts were expected. With more than six 
</p>
<p>years having elapsed since the start of the investigation, the High Commissioner urges the 
</p>
<p>judicial authorities to bring the case to a close. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Case of the alleged terrorist group dismantled in Santa Cruz 
</b></p>
<p>57. In April 2009, following a police operation at a hotel in Santa Cruz, three foreigners 
were killed and two detained. The case has been at the oral hearings stage since May 2012. 
</p>
<p>Thirty-nine people have been indicted, but 17 of them are fugitives. 
</p>
<p>58. In September, the mother of an Irish citizen, Michael Dwyer, who was killed in the  
raid, visited the Plurinational State of Bolivia, where she met the Vice-Minister for Foreign 
</p>
<p>Affairs and other authorities to request an investigation into the circumstances surrounding 
</p>
<p>her son&#8217;s death, which she claimed constituted an extrajudicial execution. In her 2010 
report, the former High Commissioner for Human Rights urged that the allegations of 
</p>

</p>
<p> 41 From January to November 2014 the National Public Defender Service dealt with 17,406 cases. 
</p>
<p> 42 Act of inter-jurisdictional coordination between authorities of the indigenous original rural native 
</p>
<p>justice system and the Plurinational Constitutional Court, 23 October 2014. 
</p>
<p> 43 Nine of the victims were indigenous peasants and students, while two others were followers of the 
</p>
<p>Prefecture. </p>

</b></p>
<p>excessive use of force by the security forces be fully investigated in order to determine 
</p>
<p>whether the level of force used was necessary, reasonable and proportionate.44  
</p>
<p>59. The Hungarian accused, El&#246;d To&#225;so, once again requested an end to his pretrial 
detention. His request included a certified copy of opinion 63/2011 of the Working Group 
</p>
<p>on Arbitrary Detention,45 finding that his detention was arbitrary. On 23 July 2014, the 
</p>
<p>tribunal again turned down his request, declining to comment on the Working Group&#8217;s 
opinion. The appeals court confirmed this decision.  
</p>
<p>60. Among other issues, the High Commissioner is concerned at the slow pace of the 
trial. Even though there are many defendants and the subject matter is complex, it is 
</p>
<p>important to remember that the right to due process includes the right to be tried within a 
</p>
<p>reasonable time.   
</p>
<p><b>3. The case of the extortion network 
</b></p>
<p>61. In November 2012, the Government publicly announced the existence of an 
extortion network involving staff of the Ministry of Government, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office and the judiciary. They were alleged to have taken advantage of the arrest of a  
</p>
<p>United States citizen, Jacob Ostreicher, on charges related to money laundering, by selling 
</p>
<p>thousands of tons of rice that had been legally confiscated from him. Several people are 
</p>
<p>currently in detention in relation to this case.  
</p>
<p>62. The High Commissioner is concerned about claims by the accused that, in the early 
morning of 10 April 2014, hooded men in civilian clothes entered their cells, threatened 
</p>
<p>them, beat them up and destroyed documents. The General Director of Prisons stated that 
</p>
<p>this was part of a routine search by the prison authorities. The High Commissioner points 
</p>
<p>out that only police with proper identification may carry out searches. The following day, 
</p>
<p>the detainees filed a habeas corpus action with the review court, which found that the 
</p>
<p>search had been illegal.  
</p>
<p><b>4. Case of the violent racist events of May 2008 in Sucre 
</b></p>
<p>63. On 24 May 2008, around 60 indigenous people were subjected to violent attacks and 
humiliating and racist treatment in Sucre by some members of the opposition to the 
</p>
<p>Government. The oral hearings in this case are currently under way in Padilla, 
</p>
<p>160 kilometres from Sucre, and are only being held twice a week. By 2013, the accused had 
</p>
<p>filed 180 procedural motions, and hearings had been repeatedly suspended, causing further 
</p>
<p>delays. In November 2014, the defence for the accused began presenting its evidence. The 
</p>
<p>victims are frustrated by the long delays and resulting impunity. The High Commissioner  
</p>
<p>is concerned that these long delays have so far prevented the victims from enjoying their 
</p>
<p>right to justice, truth and reparation.  
</p>
<p><b>5. Case against the former President, Gonzalo S&#225;nchez de Lozada for the  tragic 
events of October 2003 
</b></p>
<p>64. In 2011, two members of former President S&#225;nchez de Lozada&#8217;s government and 
five members of his high command were sentenced for their responsibility for the events of  
</p>
<p>October 2003 which left more than 60 dead and over 400 injured. After the events the 
</p>
<p>former President fled to the United States of America with some members of his 
</p>
<p>government. In July, the Plurinational State of Bolivia sent new extradition requests to the 
</p>
<p>United States Department of State. The High Commissioner encourages the authorities to 
</p>
<p>continue taking  the necessary measures to conclude these proceedings.   
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 44 A/HRC/13/26/Add.2, para. 113. 
</p>
<p> 45 A/HRC/WGAD/2011/63. Adopted on 22 November 2011. It was certified by the group&#8217;s Secretary 
</p>
<p>on 17 January 2014. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b> 15 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Right to life and physical integrity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Deaths in custody 
</b></p>
<p>65. OHCHR-Bolivia received reports of at least six alleged suicides in detention centres 
and police stations in La Paz. It followed up on the investigations into several of these cases 
</p>
<p>in which the authorities did not act with due diligence and where there were no satisfactory 
</p>
<p>results. The High Commissioner reiterates his concern that these deaths, all allegedly by 
</p>
<p>hanging, were not prevented. It is important to point out that, in one case, the victim&#8217;s 
hands were tied behind his back and, in another, the presumed suicide took place in a cell, 
</p>
<p>in the presence of other detainees and within a few metres of the security guard.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Lynchings 
</b></p>
<p>66. OHCHR-Bolivia continued to record reports of lynchings. Between 1 January and 
30 November 2014,46 OHCHR registered 20 cases reported by police and media sources, in 
</p>
<p>which 10 people, including 1 woman, died. This is a slight decrease from the previous year. 
</p>
<p>However, the High Commissioner is concerned that lack of preventive measures, an 
</p>
<p>insufficient police response and failure to investigate crimes, added to public demands for 
</p>
<p>security, result in violent reactions which mostly go unpunished. The High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>hopes that the initiative of the Vice-Ministry of Indigenous Justice to design a public policy 
</p>
<p>to prevent and combat this phenomenon will be implemented in 2015.  
</p>
<p><b>  H. Right to personal liberty, and the prison system 
</b></p>
<p>67. The High Commissioner is concerned that the rate of pretrial detention has not 
declined, despite governmental initiatives.47 According to official data, 82.09 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>over 14,570 people deprived of liberty have yet to be tried.48 In addition to raising concerns 
</p>
<p>about overcrowding, this situation does not allow for effective State monitoring and control 
</p>
<p>of prisons; and as there are relatively few guards, detainees can create power groups among 
</p>
<p>themselves.  
</p>
<p>68. In September 2014, violent incidents in El Abra prison in Cochabamba resulted in 
the deaths of four detainees, with 10 persons injured. This took place in the context of a 
</p>
<p>struggle for internal control of the prison by the inmates, and extortion.49 Investigations 
</p>
<p>revealed that the prison director had allowed alcohol within the prison. He was dismissed 
</p>
<p>from his post,  and detained on charges of abuse and extortion committed in conjunction 
</p>
<p>with one of the detainees who died during the disturbance. 
</p>
<p>69. In connection with the violent incidents of August 2013 in Palmasola prison&#8212;when 
a group of inmates attacked another group, also causing a fire in which 35 people died and 
</p>
<p>more than 50 were injured&#8212;following brief trials, three inmates were sentenced to 30 
years&#8217; imprisonment after pleading guilty to the charges. However, there has not been 
significant progress in the investigation of the role of the prison police and the persons in 
</p>
<p>charge of security at the prison. 
</p>
<p>70. OHCHR-Bolivia followed up on the situation of three non-commissioned officers of 
the armed forces detained in military installations since July 2014, following protests over 
</p>
<p>changes to the Organic Law of the Armed Forces. They are being prosecuted for rebellion,  
</p>
<p>sedition and mutiny. Following reports that their conditions of detention were substandard, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 46 In 2013, between 1 January and 30 September, there were 37 cases. 
</p>
<p> 47 Such as the adoption of amnesty laws.  
</p>
<p> 48 General Director of Prisons, Technical Report DGRP/UP/15/2014, 12 September 2014. 
</p>
<p> 49 In the 2014 report, OHCHR had expressed its concern that inmates exercised control of prisons 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/19/Add.2, para. 77).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16  
</b></p>
<p>OHCHR noted that conditions had improved compared with how they were in the early 
</p>
<p>days of the officers&#8217; incarceration. The High Commissioner reiterates that military courts 
must respect guarantees of due process when applying military justice. The State should 
</p>
<p>continue promoting the comprehensive reform of the Organic Law in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Constitution and international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>71. At the end of 2013, the Plurinational State of Bolivia promulgated Law474, 
establishing the Service for the Prevention of Torture. In 2014, an executive decree was 
</p>
<p>issued outlining its structure, in compliance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner notes that, although this legislation meets the international 
</p>
<p>commitments of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, especially with regard to 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the Committee against Torture, the Service for the Prevention of 
</p>
<p>Torture is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice rather than being autonomous, as 
</p>
<p>required under the Convention.  
</p>
<p><b> I. The rights of victims of unconstitutional regimes  
</b></p>
<p>72. In December 2013, the Senate approved a draft law establishing a truth commission, 
and sent it to the Chamber of Deputies. In order to allow for more extensive consultations 
</p>
<p>with civil society, the Chamber decided not to approve the text. The High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>urges the authorities to continue consulting with civil-society and victims&#8217; organizations, 
with a view to adopting a law that provides for the investigation of all violations committed 
</p>
<p>under the unconstitutional regimes from 1964 to 1982, and to comply with the right to 
</p>
<p>truth, justice, reparation and non-recurrence. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Human rights defenders and freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>73. The High Commissioner is concerned about certain developments and situations 
affecting human rights defenders and human rights organizations. Personnel of the Institute 
</p>
<p>of Therapy and Investigation into the After-effects of Torture and State Violence reported 
</p>
<p>being subjected to intimidation and telephone threats and being followed by unknown 
</p>
<p>individuals. The ongoing judicial investigation has not yet established the circumstances of 
</p>
<p>the events, which occurred between November 2013 and January 2014. The Government 
</p>
<p>stated that the victim had not presented any information statement.  
</p>
<p>74. In February 2014, tents belonging to the Platform of Social Combatants against 
Impunity, for Justice and for the Historical Memory of the Bolivian People, which were 
</p>
<p>installed two years ago in a central area of La Paz as part of a protest, were destroyed by a 
</p>
<p>fire. A fire brigade report attributed the fire to short-circuited wiring. The organization&#8217;s 
leaders alleged that it was a criminal act aimed at stifling their protests. 
</p>
<p>75. With regard to the application of Supreme Decree No. 1597 regulating Law No. 351 
on the granting of legal status, OHCHR-Bolivia has received reports from some non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations about administrative slowness and delays in the accreditation 
</p>
<p>process. This has generated a climate of uncertainty within many of these organizations. 
</p>
<p>76. Regarding freedom of information and the press, OHCHR-Bolivia followed up on a 
State report to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office denouncing a journalist of a national 
newspaper on charges of espionage and revealing State secrets, and against the newspaper&#8217;s 
director for alleged complicity. The article was said to contain confidential information on a 
</p>
<p>highly important State issue. A criminal court judge ordered the author to reveal the source 
</p>
<p>of the information contained in the article. The Departmental Court of La Paz ordered that 
</p>
<p>the case be sent to a special tribunal with jurisdiction over cases concerning the press and 
</p>
<p>revoked the judicial order demanding that the source be revealed.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b> 17 
</b></p>
<p><b> K. Rights of children and adolescents 
</b></p>
<p>77. In January 2014, the Government issued Supreme Decree No. 1875, lowering the 
minimum age for compulsory military service from 18 to 17. This contradicts the  
</p>
<p>declaration made by Bolivia upon acceding to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, in which it stated 
</p>
<p>that the minimum age for compulsory military service is 18. Under the Optional Protocol, 
</p>
<p>17-year-old children cannot perform compulsory military service.  
</p>
<p>78. On 17 July, Law No. 548, the Children and Adolescents Code was adopted. This 
new principle of law is better adapted to the principle of comprehensive protection than the 
</p>
<p>previous legislation. For example, it strengthens the prioritization of the adoption process, 
</p>
<p>among  other things. 
</p>
<p>79. The death in November 2014 of an eight-month-old baby who had not received 
timely medical care in a public shelter in La Paz shocked Bolivian society. The baby died 
</p>
<p>from lacerations and internal bleeding, after a presumed act of sexual abuse. To date it is 
</p>
<p>not known where or by whom the violence was carried out. The event highlighted failures 
</p>
<p>in the child-protection system and the poor performance of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
in investigating the facts. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main activities of the office  
</b></p>
<p>80. In coordination with civil-society organizations, OHCHR-Bolivia held an 
international seminar on the &#8220;Impact of Constitutional Decision 0206/2014 in the area of 
sexual and reproductive rights&#8221;, to analyse practical challenges and opportunities facing the 
health, justice and police sectors in relation to legal abortion.  
</p>
<p>81. OHCHR-Bolivia took part in a technical working group to revise the proposed 
protocol and road map for the care of victims of gender-based violence in the context of 
</p>
<p>Law 348, with the aim of producing a comprehensive implementation document covering 
</p>
<p>the strategic areas of care of victims, prosecution, sanctions, and reparation for the criminal 
</p>
<p>acts proscribed by this Law. 
</p>
<p>82. Together with the International Labour Organization and the Guaran&#237; Indigenous 
University, OHCHR-Bolivia organized a course on human rights and cultural expertise. In 
</p>
<p>all, 26 Guaran&#237; leaders received 600 hours of face-to-face training and received diplomas as 
</p>
<p>cultural experts.  
</p>
<p>83. OHCHR-Bolivia carried out and published three participatory studies on decision-
making systems among the Guaran&#237; peoples of the Alto Parapet&#237; territory, the Jach&#8217;a 
Karangas nation and the Moset&#233;n people.  
</p>
<p>84. It also carried out 24 monitoring missions over 66 days to follow up on illustrative 
cases, the prison situation, human rights defenders, indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and the  
course of the October elections. In addition, eight training activities were held for 
</p>
<p>representatives of indigenous groups and civil society. 
</p>
<p>85. OHCHR-Bolivia provided technical assistance for the proposed system for 
monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan against Racism. It also provided 
</p>
<p>technical assistance to the National Committee against Racism and all Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>86. OHCHR-Bolivia and UN-Women introduced the Latin American Model Protocol 
for the Investigation of Gender-motivated Violent Deaths of Women (femicide).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/3/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18  
</b></p>
<p>87. Under the project &#8220;Strengthening and increasing the independence of the judicial 
system in Bolivia&#8221;, financed by the European Commission, OHCHR-Bolivia provided 
technical assistance to the Judicial Council to draft the Judicial Service Rules.50 The Rules 
</p>
<p>cover the selection, evaluation and training of judges, as well as the monitoring of the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the disciplinary regime for judges.  
</p>
<p>88. In coordination with other United Nations agencies, OHCHR-Bolivia assisted the 
schools for judges and prosecutors in incorporating human rights into the initial training 
</p>
<p>curriculum for new judges and prosecutors.  
</p>
<p>89. OHCHR-Bolivia helped the Committee of Female Magistrates from the judicial 
body and the Constitutional Court to develop a draft policy on gender equality in judicial 
</p>
<p>institutions and a plan of action for its implementation. 
</p>
<p>90. OHCHR-Bolivia  assisted the Supreme Court of Justice in drafting and validating a 
policy and protocol for coordination with the indigenous jurisdiction. This included the 
</p>
<p>development of guidelines for managing casework and systematizing jurisprudence. It also 
</p>
<p>assisted the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in drafting a communications policy and the 
Constitutional Court in carrying out its second meeting with indigenous organizations.  
</p>
<p>91. Under the project financed by the European Commission, OHCHR-Bolivia 
organized 36 human rights training events, in which 2,721 justice officials from throughout 
</p>
<p>the country participated. It also held 79 technical assistance workshops for justice 
</p>
<p>institutions on the independence of the judiciary, access to justice, legal pluralism and 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards, in which 2,268 persons participated. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>While reiterating previous recommendations, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights makes the following recommendations:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) That the institutions of the justice sector, in coordination with all other 
</b></p>
