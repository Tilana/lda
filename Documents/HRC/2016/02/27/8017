<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, 
undertook an official visit to the World Bank Group from 26 October to 1 November 2010. 
She wishes to express again her gratitude to the World Bank Group for the invitation, the 
constructive dialogue and the support of the World Bank&#8223;s staff throughout the visit.  
</p>
<p>2. In January 2011 the Special Rapporteur presented a preliminary note on her mission 
to the World Bank Group (A/HRC/16/42/Add.4). The preliminary note provided an 
overview of the relation between the policies and projects supported by the World Bank 
Group and the right to adequate housing. She would like to express her appreciation for the 
World Bank&#8223;s comments on the preliminary note, in which several points were raised 
</p>
<p>requiring further research. 
</p>
<p>3. On 21 December 2011 the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the World Bank 
requesting additional information in the context of the preparation of her report. She regrets 
that the World Bank did not continue the positive exchange previously established and did 
not reply to the letter or provide the additional information requested.  
</p>
<p>4. In the absence of this additional necessary information, and in the light of the World 
Bank&#8223;s current two-year consultative process to review and update its environmental and 
social safeguard policies, the Special Rapporteur decided to focus her final report on the 
World Bank&#8223;s safeguards, the most pressing of the issues she explored during her mission.  
</p>
<p>5. The present report highlights the importance of incorporating human rights 
standards and obligations into the safeguards framework of the Bank. The report elaborates 
on particular aspects of the policies and operations of the International Development 
Association and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (referred to 
collectively as &#8220;the World Bank&#8221;) in terms of their implications for the right to adequate 
housing. The Special Rapporteur urges the World Bank to consider the observations and 
recommendations made in the present report in the current review process. She welcomes 
the commitment by the World Bank President Kim at the October 2012 Annual General 
Meeting in Tokyo not to dilute the Bank&#8223;s safeguard policies and she recommends that the 
</p>
<p>World Bank utilize the current review process to bring its safeguard policies into line with 
international human rights standards and strengthen its capacity to ensure effective 
implementation.   
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur underscores the importance of the World Bank&#8223;s 
Operational Policy and Bank Procedures on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12 and BP 
4.12) in encouraging respect for and the realization of the right to adequate housing for 
people resettled in connection with World Bank-financed projects. She highlights, however, 
a number of ways in which current policy and practice could be improved. She urges the 
Bank to build upon and strengthen the current policy and procedures on involuntary 
resettlement, taking due account of the experiences of the past decade, in the forthcoming 
revision.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Bank&#8223;s commitment to examine &#8220;emerging 
areas&#8221;, including land tenure, as a part of the safeguards review. Security of tenure is 
recognized as an essential element of the right to adequate housing1 and requires particular

</p>
<p>adequate housing, para. 8. See also Special Rapporteur&#8223;s annual report, A/HRC/22/46. The Special

</p>
<p>attention in the context of urban and rural development programmes. She recommends the 
adoption of new policy requirements to secure and protect the tenure rights of vulnerable 
groups during the implementation and as a result of Bank-financed operations. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur also notes that current Bank operations include financing 
not only projects but also broader State reforms, such as development policy operations and 
Program-for-Results financing, which can have adverse implications for the right to 
adequate housing but are not subject to the Bank&#8223;s current safeguards policy framework or 
equivalent requirements to prevent harms. Additionally, for certain types of investment 
lending operations that involve programmatic or sector-wide lending, she observes that 
safeguard policies as currently formulated are often ill-suited to address the impacts on the 
right to adequate housing of the different groups affected.2 She recommends that the Bank 
conduct, support or require from the borrower that it conduct human rights due diligence of 
all of its operations and ensure that the risks of violations of the right to adequate housing 
are avoided or mitigated through robust risk management, genuine participation and 
accountability systems.  
</p>
<p><b> II. </b>The World Bank&#8217;s obligation to respect and promote <b>human 
rights  
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur makes these recommendations in the light of the World 
Bank&#8223;s status as a specialized agency of the United Nations, by agreement entered into with 
</p>
<p>the Economic and Social Council in accordance with Articles 57 and 63 of the Charter of 
the United Nations. As a specialized agency, and as subject to international law, the World 
Bank is required at a minimum to respect the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter, 
including the &#8220;universal respect for, and observance of, human rights&#8221;.3 Moreover, she 
emphasizes that the obligations of States parties to the international human rights treaties 
should be understood as extending to their membership of the World Bank and their role as 
Executive Directors, including decisions to support the adoption of operational policies and 
to approve lending, credit and grant proposals. These obligations include the duty of States 
parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to respect the 
rights recognized in the Covenant and to take steps through international assistance and 
cooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, with a view to achieving 
progressively the full realization of these rights.4 
</p>
<p>10. Due to its far-reaching large-scale development assistance and cooperation, as well 
as its important role in providing technical assistance and setting the reform agenda in 
several Government policies, including housing, the Special Rapporteur believes that the 
World Bank is also uniquely placed to support Governments around the world in meeting

<p>their international human rights obligations during the process of development and, in 
particular, to progressively realize economic and social rights in their countries.  
</p>
<p>11. The World Bank should adopt safeguards policies aligned with the international 
human rights obligations of its member States and clients. Incorporating human rights 
protections will help member States fulfil their human rights obligations and improve 
development outcomes by ensuring respect for the rights of those the Bank seeks to benefit.  
</p>
<p>12. States are increasingly recognizing that the responsibility to respect human rights 
goes beyond States and includes international organizations, businesses and other non-State 
actors. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls on the World Bank to incorporate the 
principles outlined in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing 
the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework (A/HRC/17/31, annex), 
adopted in 2011 by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4, and to ensure that the 
safeguard policies are aligned with the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The World Bank and involuntary resettlement  
</b></p>
<p>13. Forced evictions and the displacement of people from their homes, lands, livelihood 
sources and communities because of private and public development projects have had 
grave implications worldwide for the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing. Some 
development projects have pursued important general welfare objectives, such as the 
improvement of people&#8223;s access to basic services and facilities through the construction or 
</p>
<p>renovation of infrastructure. These projects have contributed to the realization of the right 
to adequate housing and other human rights for some segments of the population. Other 
projects have either had questionable general welfare benefits or primarily served corporate 
interests. In all of these situations, the costs of &#8220;development&#8221; have often been borne most 
heavily by the families and communities evicted to make these projects possible.   
</p>
<p>14. The World Bank has long recognized the severe impact that development-induced 
evictions and displacements can have on certain people; it was the first development agency 
to adopt guidelines on involuntary resettlement more than thirty years ago. The Bank has 
made important contributions since that time to the overall understanding of the risks of 
evictions and mitigation measures that can be put into place to prevent the risks from 
materializing into harms.5 The Bank&#8223;s involuntary resettlement policy, which has 
undergone several changes over the past three decades, has been reflected in varying forms 
by several major public and private financial institutions, as well as a significant number of 
corporations, highlighting the extremely influential role the Bank has played in setting 
global standards.   
</p>
<p>15. World Bank-supported projects continue to cause substantial numbers of forced 
evictions, displacements and involuntary resettlements. The Bank&#8223;s Independent Evaluation 
</p>
<p>Group (IEG) estimates that &#8220;since the resettlement process lasts several years &#8230; at any 
given time involuntary resettlement affects over 1 million people, two-fifths of which are 
likely to be physically displaced and three-fifths economically affected by active Bank-
financed projects&#8221;.6 This estimate, derived from the documentation of the Bank&#8223;s projects, 
includes only people that the Bank determines to be directly affected by its projects, which 
may be a significantly smaller group than the overall number of those displaced physically 
and economically as a result of Bank-financed projects worldwide.   
</p>
<p>  
 5  See M.M. Cernea, &#8220;The Risks and Reconstruction Model for Resettling Displaced Populations&#8221;,

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.3 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>16. As a part of the World Bank&#8223;s duty to respect human rights, it must take measures to 
ensure that any resettlement that occurs in connection with the projects financed by the 
Bank does not result in the violation of the human rights of affected people. Involuntary 
resettlement amounts to a forced eviction when it occurs without the provision of, and 
access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection.7 Forced evictions are amongst the 
most disempowering violations of human rights and one of the most supreme injustices any 
individual, family, household or community can face. Forced evictions constitute a gross 
violation of a range of internationally recognized human rights, in particular the right to 
adequate housing.8 The vulnerable situation in which victims of forced evictions are placed 
often results from structural discrimination and the lack of participation of those affected in 
project design and implementation. Evictions can also result in violations of the human 
rights to food, water, health, education, work, life, security of the person, security of the 
home, freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, freedom of movement and 
equality. Thus, requiring legal and other protections is essential to prevent grave breaches 
of human rights and, in some cases, irreparable harms to victims. 
</p>
<p>17. The World Bank&#8223;s policy and procedures on involuntary resettlement provide a 
number of important protections for people physically and/or economically displaced by 
Bank-financed projects.  The Bank&#8223;s adoption of the policy can be seen as an essential 
measure in satisfying its duty to respect human rights. The policy and procedures together 
establish a number of critical mandatory processes and entitlements to achieve the 
objectives of avoiding and minimizing displacement; executing resettlement as a 
sustainable development programme; and assisting displaced persons in their efforts to 
improve or at least restore their livelihoods and living standards.9 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur makes the following recommendations for strengthening the 
policy in order to better ensure that evictions and displacements connected to Bank-
financed projects fully respect the right to adequate housing and contribute to its 
progressive realization for affected people who did not previously enjoy this basic human 
right. She believes that these recommendations are consistent with the Bank&#8223;s objectives of 
</p>
<p>creating a new generation of safeguard policies that can &#8220;help the Bank support measurable 
development outcomes or &#8222;doing good,&#8223; in addition to maintaining the &#8222;do no harm&#8223; 
principles of the current safeguard policies&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Review of the involuntary resettlement policy  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prohibition of forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>19. As a gross violation of human rights, forced evictions should be explicitly prohibited 
in the policy. The Special Rapporteur recommends that, in the introductory paragraphs of 
the revised policy, it is made clear that the Bank will not finance or otherwise provide 
assistance to any project or programme that causes or contributes to forced evictions. She 
further suggests the use of the definition of &#8220;forced evictions&#8221; adopted in the basic

<p>principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement: &#8220;acts/ and or 
omissions involving the coerced or involuntary displacement of individuals, groups and 
communities from homes and/or lands and common property resources that were occupied 
or depended upon, thus eliminating or limiting the ability of an individual, group or 
community to reside or work in a particular dwelling, residence or location, without the 
provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection&#8221; (A/HRC/4/18, 
annex I, para. 4). All mandatory protections to prevent forced evictions should be included 
as policy requirements. Some of these essential protections are detailed in the present 
report. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Exceptional circumstances and project alternatives 
</b></p>
<p>20. The current policy objective to avoid where feasible, or minimize, involuntary 
resettlement, exploring all viable alternative project designs, reflects the World Bank&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>recognition that involuntary resettlement can give rise to severe hardships to displaced 
persons. There is an unusually high level of economic, social, cultural and environmental 
risk associated with involuntary resettlement. Measures necessary to mitigate these risks are 
complex, resource-intensive and, in practice, often imperfect. In recognition of these risks 
and mitigation challenges, and given the potential for violations of many internationally 
recognized human rights, international law standards authorize evictions only in 
exceptional circumstances and in accordance with the general principles of international 
law.11 
</p>
<p>21. In order to reinforce the current policy objective of avoidance and minimization, and 
harmonize with international human rights standards, the revised policy should be explicit 
in permitting involuntary resettlement in connection with Bank-financed projects only in 
exceptional circumstances, namely the promotion of the general welfare consistent with the 
State&#8223;s international human rights obligations.12   
</p>
<p>22. The revised policy should include a requirement for the borrower Government to 
provide the Bank &#8211; as a part of its project proposal &#8211; with a detailed account of the general 
welfare value of the project, particularly for those to be evicted or displaced and other poor 
or vulnerable groups, consistent with its international obligations to respect, protect and/or 
fulfil human rights. Based on public consultations, the account should reflect the 
development priorities of the project&#8223;s expected beneficiaries. The policy should also 
require that the account of the general welfare value of the project be made publicly 
available in an accessible form and language. In cases in which the borrower Government is 
unable to justify the need for evictions or displacements based on an exceptional 
circumstance, the Bank should not agree to provide assistance until a feasible alternative is 
agreed upon that will not result in forced evictions or displacements.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the Bank&#8223;s consolidated investment 
lending policy does not contain the same robust requirements to explore alternative project 
designs during economic analysis as Operational Procedure (OP) 10.04 on Economic 
Evaluation of Investment Operations, which it will replace.13 This requirement was 
described in OP 10.04 as &#8220;one of the most important features of proper project analysis

</p>
<p>throughout the project cycle&#8221;.14 For projects which will result in displacement, the 
consideration of feasible alternatives is not only a critical feature of comprehensive cost-
benefit analysis but also an international law obligation.15  
</p>
<p>24. The revised policy on involuntary resettlement should thus maintain the current 
objective of avoiding and minimizing displacement and the requirement in BP 4.12 for the 
Bank&#8223;s task team and borrower staff to explore all viable alternative project designs to 
avoid and minimize displacement.16 In order to strengthen implementation of this 
requirement, the new policy should place a procedural requirement on the borrower 
Government to provide to the Bank &#8211; as a part of its project proposal &#8211; a detailed account of 
alternative project designs considered to achieve the development and general welfare 
objectives, including the result of consultations about potential alternatives with persons 
expected to be displaced.  
</p>
<p>25. The value of exploring alternatives to the project design is illustrated by a road 
project in the Philippines financed by the International Financial Corporation (IFC). The 
Cavite Coastal Road &#8211; R1 Expressway Extension project originally involved the 
construction of a viaduct that required resettling some 600 families. The community 
resisted eviction after they discovered that their livelihoods would be severely impacted by 
the relocation, there was no clear plan to restore their income and basic services were not in 
place at the resettlement site. Resettlement activities were suspended after IFC made clear 
that the project would not receive IFC financing if the resettlement did not meet World 
Bank Group standards. The delays to the project caused by this suspension and the high 
cost of resettling people in compliance with the Bank&#8223;s resettlement policy pushed the IFC 
client to search for technically feasible alternatives. The company&#8223;s engineers found a way 
</p>
<p>of realigning the road so that it did not require any relocation. The alternative project design 
avoided a complex, costly and contentious resettlement process, while respecting the rights 
of the affected people.17 
</p>
<p><b> C. Protections to uphold the right to adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p>26. Upon rigorous application of the recommended requirements set forth above, 
involuntary resettlement in connection with Bank projects should only occur in exceptional 
circumstances and be minimized to the extent possible through project design. However, 
there will be some projects for which displacement will be unavoidable. Displaced persons 
must be afforded due legal and other protections throughout the resettlement process.  
</p>
<p>27. Current policy protections, while generally compatible with human rights standards, 
fall short of guaranteeing that the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate 
housing, will be upheld for displaced persons. The Special Rapporteur makes a number of 
recommendations below to strengthen the policy so that it provides necessary protections to 
displaced persons to ensure that their human rights are not infringed.

<p><b> D. Right to the continuous improvement of living standards 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the revised policy explicitly recognize the 
right to the continuous improvement of living standards,18 and require that measures are 
taken to ensure that resources and opportunities available to affected persons to enhance 
their own standards of living are in no way diminished or restricted as a result of 
resettlement.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Control over the resettlement process 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Bank&#8223;s recognition of the importance of access to information, participation and 
consultation in inclusive and sustainable development is reflected in the policy objective 
that displaced persons should be &#8220;meaningfully consulted&#8221; and &#8220;have opportunities to 
</p>
<p>participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs&#8221;.19 The policy requires 
borrower Governments to include in their resettlement planning instruments &#8220;measures to 
ensure displaced persons are (i) informed about their options and rights pertaining to 
resettlement; (ii) consulted on, offered choices among, and provided with &#8230; resettlement 
alternatives&#8221;.20 The policy also requires that displaced persons and their communities, and 
any host communities, be &#8220;offered opportunities to participate in planning, implementing, 
</p>
<p>and monitoring the resettlement&#8221;.21 When meaningfully applied, these requirements 
constitute important protections against forced eviction, consistent with international 
obligations.  
</p>
<p>30. However, in practice, the dissemination of information and consultation on both 
project alternatives and resettlement options are often not done in a comprehensive and 
meaningful manner. Women, children and persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged 
households are often marginalized from consultation processes, resulting in the disregard of 
their opinions, choices and particular interests. In some cases, the communication of 
information and methods of consultation are not appropriate for ethnic or linguistic 
minorities or illiterate groups. In the worst cases, threats, intimidation or violence are used 
to coerce people into accepting resettlement terms. For example, in the case of &#8220;Ghana: 
Second Urban Environmental Sanitation Project&#8221;, the World Bank&#8223;s Inspection Panel found 
that, given the context of a tense and hostile atmosphere, meaningful consultations did not 
take place with those living nearest to the proposed landfill and that the project failed to 
provide relevant information to the community.22 
</p>
<p>31. Noting once again the Bank&#8223;s duty to respect human rights and its shared 
responsibility to ensure accountability in this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Bank play a greater role in ensuring appropriate and effective dissemination of 
information to affected people about their entitlements under the policy. The Bank should 
support, through appropriate local organizations, the provision of legal advice and technical 
assistance to affected people from the earliest stages of the project and throughout the 
project cycle.

</p>
<p>32. Moreover, the degree of upheaval to affected people&#8223;s lives brought about by 
involuntary resettlement calls for a higher level of empowerment in resettlement decision-
making than that stipulated in the current policy. The policy rightly acknowledges that 
&#8220;resettlement activities should be conceived and executed as sustainable development 
programs&#8221; enabling displaced persons to share in project benefits.23 Experience shows that 
the empowerment of project beneficiaries is key to the effectiveness and sustainability of 
any development project. The Special Rapporteur thus recommends that the revised policy 
require that affected persons be provided not only with opportunities to participate in 
planning, implementing and monitoring resettlement, but with all necessary support and 
resources to enable them, or their freely chosen representatives, to actively participate in 
resettlement decision-making. 
</p>
<p>33. With the support of independent technical assistance funded as part of the project, 
affected persons should be given the opportunity to propose alternatives in order to avoid 
and minimize resettlement and, if resettlement is necessary, to choose, inter alia, (a) 
resettlement site(s) from a range of options, including sites that they themselves identify, 
(b) whether to receive full cash compensation to replace their housing and other assets or 
instead alternative housing and other replacement assets at the site (or a mix of both), (c) 
the type and form of basic services and facilities to be made available at the site, (d) site 
planning, such as the placement of houses, amenities and access roads as relevant, and (e) 
the forms of income restoration support most beneficial and suitable to them. The affected 
persons should also be given the opportunity to participate in decisions about the means by 
which they will receive information and community discussions and planning will be 
conducted during the process, as well as the timing of the resettlement process. Affected 
persons and communities must be guaranteed the right to full and prior informed consent 
regarding the terms of the resettlement.24 They should also be afforded the opportunity to 
participate in the monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement process and its outcomes in 
terms of restoration and improvement of living standards. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Resettlement and the right to adequate housing, and all of its 
</b></p>
<p><b>components 
</b></p>
<p>34. The policy requires that the resettlement plan &#8220;include measures to ensure that 
displaced persons are provided prompt and effective compensation at full replacement cost 
for losses of assets &#8230; assistance (such as moving allowances) during relocation; and &#8230; 
residential housing, or housing sites, or, as required, agricultural sites for which a 
combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors is at least 
equivalent to the advantages of the old site&#8221;.25 The policy allows for the cost of alternative 
residential housing, housing sites, business premises, and agricultural sites provided to be 
set off against the compensation payable for the corresponding lost asset.26 In addition to 
the above, other assistance is to be provided during the transition period, &#8220;based on a 
</p>
<p>reasonable estimate of the time likely to be needed to restore their livelihood and standards 
of living&#8221;.27 The policy requires that resettlement sites be equipped with infrastructure and 
public services &#8220;as necessary to improve, restore, or maintain accessibility and levels of 
</p>
<p>service for the displaced persons and host communities&#8221;.28 Alternative or similar resources

<p>are provided to compensate for the loss of access to community resources (such as fishing 
areas, grazing areas, fuel, or fodder).29 The policy requires &#8220;adequate tenure arrangements&#8221; 
for alternative land, housing or business premises provided. These provisions constitute 
important protections against regressions in displaced peoples&#8223; access to adequate housing 
and an adequate standard of living.  
</p>
<p>35. However these provisions fall short of minimum human rights obligations because 
their application could result in the resettlement of people into inadequate shelter 
conditions, without access to the minimum levels necessary of essential services and 
facilities and without secure, fully recognized tenure. This is particularly the case for people 
who, prior to resettlement, lived in inadequate housing conditions and for whom the mere 
replacement of lost assets will prevent them from securing adequate housing after 
resettlement. A recent resettlement experience in Cambodia demonstrates this point. The 
Asian Development Bank is financing the rehabilitation of the Cambodian railway system, 
which requires the resettlement of several thousand families. In accordance with the 
resettlement plan, households were provided with compensation for their structures and 
assets on the basis of replacement cost. According to monitoring reports of local non-
governmental organizations, resettled families who lived in severely inadequate shelter 
conditions prior to resettlement were unable to afford to reconstruct basic adequate housing 
at resettlement sites without incurring debt.30  
</p>
<p>36. States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
have undertaken to take steps, individually and through international assistance and 
cooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, with a view to achieving 
progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant. As a specialized 
agency of the United Nations with a mandate to reduce global poverty, the Bank&#8223;s policy 
</p>
<p>should be revised to ensure that resettlement does not merely prevent the regression of 
living standards, but is treated as an opportunity to provide resources to borrower 
Governments to realize the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to 
adequate housing, for resettled households previously living in inadequate conditions. This 
revision would give effect to the current policy objective of conceiving and executing 
resettlement as a sustainable development programme. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the current policy requirements be 
supplemented with a requirement on borrower Governments to put in place measures to 
ensure secure adequate housing, including all of its components, immediately and as a 
component of the project itself. Persons who are physically displaced, regardless of their 
previous situations and without discrimination, should be ensured access to secure, 
affordable, habitable housing that is culturally appropriate. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur recalls the international human rights law requirements for relocation sites, 
affirmed in the basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and 
displacement. These include:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;(a) Security of tenure; (b) services, materials, facilities and infrastructure such as 
potable water, energy for cooking, heating and lighting, sanitation and washing 
facilities, means of food storage, refuse disposal, site drainage and emergency 
services, and to natural and common resources, where appropriate; (c) affordable 
housing; (d) habitable housing providing inhabitants with adequate space, protection 
from cold, damp, heat, rain, wind or other threats to health, structural hazards and 
disease vectors, and ensuring the physical safety of occupants; (e) accessibility for

<p>disadvantaged groups; (f) access to employment options, health-care services, 
schools, childcare centers and other social facilities, whether in urban or rural areas; 
and (g) culturally appropriate housing. In order to ensure security of the home, 
adequate housing should also include the following essential elements: privacy and 
security; participation in decision-making; freedom from violence; and access to 
remedies for any violations suffered.&#8221;31 
</p>
<p>38. Resettlement planning should be based on a comprehensive eviction impact 
assessment in order to ensure that anything &#8211; tangible and intangible &#8211; lost by displaced 
persons is restored.32  
</p>
<p><b> G. Eligibility for protections and entitlements  
</b></p>
<p>39. One of the key strengths of the current policy is the provision of protections and 
entitlements to affected persons who have &#8220;no recognizable legal right or claim to the land 
they are occupying&#8221;.33 This policy provision reflects the need to protect the vast numbers of 
persons that fall into this category from forced evictions, homelessness and deeper 
impoverishment. It also reflects the impracticability of attempting to remove residents who 
have no formally registered bond or claim to the land they are occupying from sources of 
livelihoods, particularly in the context of urban development, given the evidence that 
affected persons without alternatives are likely to resettle on other lands to which they do 
not have a legal claim. This provision is particularly important in countries in which there 
are plural systems of land tenure or legal ambiguities with respect to tenure or land rights. 
For all of these reasons, and consistent with the Bank&#8223;s President&#8223;s commitment to non-
dilution, the Special Rapporteur is confident that the Bank will maintain the current 
requirement to protect the right to resettlement and other assistance to displaced persons 
whose rights to the land they are occupying have not been legally recognized by the 
Government.   
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the current policy stipulates that people 
who encroach on the area after a designated cut-off date are not entitled to compensation or 
any other form of resettlement assistance. While acknowledging the legitimate need to 
discourage rent-seeking behaviour, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the 
application of this exclusion could have the effect of leaving persons completely destitute 
and without basic shelter. She therefore recommends the following modifications to the 
policy.  
</p>
<p>41. First, greater emphasis should be placed on the due process requirements for 
effective public availability of information on the area delineated for the project, and 
subsequent systematic and continuous provision and dissemination of the information. 
Currently this requirement is relegated to a footnote in the policy and only applies to cases 
in which the cut-off is the date the project area is delineated, rather than the later date on 
which the census begins. Effective ongoing dissemination of notice that new settlers in a 
clearly delineated area required for the project will not be eligible for resettlement 
assistance is both a due process right and an important practical measure to prevent 
encroachment and should thus be made a policy requirement. In the absence of effective 
notice, persons who settled in the area after the cut-off date should not be disqualified from

</b></p>
<p>receiving assistance. The borrower Government should be required to show evidence of 
both effective and continuous notice of the cut-off date, after which the disqualified 
person(s) settled in the area, before barring assistance entitlements.  
</p>
<p>42. Second, vulnerable persons who settled in the area after the cut-off date despite the 
provision of effective and continuous notice, if it transpires through an independent 
assessment that they are effectively and genuinely lacking housing, should receive 
protection and cannot simply remain homeless. The Special Rapporteur believes that these 
modifications to the policy would strike an appropriate balance between the need to avoid 
incentives for rent-seeking behaviour and the duty to protect the human right to adequate 
housing. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Procedural requirements during evictions 
</b></p>
<p>43. A notable gap in OP 4.12 is the lack of procedural requirements for carrying out 
evictions. The new policy should contain requirements, consistent with international law 
and the basic principles and guidelines on development based evictions and displacement, 
to be followed if affected persons do not agree to the compensation and resettlement 
package, even after the provision of all legal and other protections described above. 
Adequate notice prior to the pending eviction must be provided. During an eviction, 
safeguard requirements should include: (a) the mandatory presence of Government officials 
or their representatives, who must identify themselves to the persons being evicted and 
present legal authorization for the eviction action; (b) granting access to neutral observers, 
including international observers, upon request; (c) ensuring that evictions are not carried 
out in a manner that violates the dignity and human rights of to life and security of affected 
people, including by taking steps to ensure that women are not subject to gender-based 
violence and discrimination in the course of evictions, and that the human rights of children 
are protected; (d) ensuring that any legal use of force respects the principles of 
reasonableness and proportionality; (e) ensuring that evictions do not take place in bad 
weather, at night, during festivals or religious holidays, prior to elections or during or just 
prior to school examinations; (f) taking steps to ensure that no one is subject to direct or 
indiscriminate attacks or violence, especially against women and children, or arbitrarily 
deprived of property or possessions as a result of the eviction; (g) allowing affected persons 
to demolish their own dwellings or other structures, but never requiring or forcing them to 
so.34 
</p>
<p>44. In addition, the Special Rapporteur recommends maintaining the current provision in 
BP 4.12 to place compensation entitlements in an escrow account that the affected 
household can access. It should also be specified that a plot at the resettlement site will be 
reserved, if relevant. The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the Bank considers 
including in BP 4.12 reference to the option of return to the area of habitual residence, 
when return is possible, and the obligation to provide assistance to the affected 
communities in the return process.

<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> V. Extending the scope of the safeguards framework: land 
tenure  
</b></p>
<p>45. Security of tenure is an essential element of the right to adequate housing.35 The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights defines tenure security as a legal 
guarantee against forced eviction, harassment and other threats and notes that tenure takes a 
variety of forms and is not limited to ownership. It places an obligation on States to &#8220;take 
immediate measures aimed at conferring legal security of tenure upon those persons and 
households currently lacking such protection, in genuine consultation with affected persons 
and groups&#8221;.36 The duty upon States to confer and solidify legal security of tenure becomes 
most pertinent when particular groups will otherwise be put at risk by development 
projects.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Bank&#8223;s commitment to examine new areas not 
currently covered by its safeguards framework, including land tenure, as a part of the 
review process. She recommends that the new safeguard policy framework contain 
provisions to ensure that tenure rights are not weakened or infringed as a result of Bank-
financed operations (particularly land and agricultural sector development programmes). 
Particular attention must be paid to potentially vulnerable groups whose tenure bonds are 
not individual registered freehold, such as renters; people with plural, hybrid and informal 
tenure rights; those with secondary use and access rights; and those subject to communal, 
collective and customary tenure arrangements. In addition, women&#8223;s rights should be 
</p>
<p>promoted, with concerted efforts to reverse discriminatory gender patterns in tenure 
systems.37  
</p>
<p>47. Land sector programmes that seek to formalize land rights can have unintended 
adverse consequences on some groups by weakening their pre-existing tenure status and 
thereby increasing their vulnerability to forced eviction. For example, in the Cambodia 
Land Management and Administration Project, which was the subject of a World Bank 
Inspection Panel investigation, &#8220;design flaws in the Project led to the arbitrary exclusion of 
lands from the titling process and that this denied residents, especially the poor and 
vulnerable, the opportunity to claim and formalize their pre-existing rights through the 
adjudication process under [the Project]&#8221;.38 Furthermore, by exclusively focusing on 
registering title deeds, the project design failed to address the insecure tenure situation of 
those with other claims to ownership, who are most vulnerable to eviction. The Panel found 
that these design flaws &#8220;made it difficult &#8230; to achieve the stated objectives of the Project 
related to poverty reduction and providing tenure security for the poor&#8221;.39 The Special 
Rapporteur considers this case a clear illustration of the urgent need for the Bank to adopt a 
human rights approach to its land sector development operations. Such an approach would 
emphasize improving security of tenure for all, in particular those most insecure, and 
include measures to safeguard against exclusionary treatment of vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>48. Agricultural development programmes that promote large-scale commercial farming 
could also put at risk rural households with tenure arrangements that are not fully

<p>recognized and protected by law or in practice.40 The danger is particularly acute when 
there is intense competition over land and natural resources and multiple tenure systems. 
Heightened commercial interest and speculative investments in land (more common since 
the 2008 rise in food prices) pose substantial risks for households and communities with 
informal, secondary, communal, collective or customary tenure rights. In such contexts, 
safeguarding against increased vulnerability of these groups during the implementation and 
as a result of agricultural development programmes is vital. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur notes the Bank&#8223;s support of the Voluntary Guidelines on the 
Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of 
National Food Security, endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security in May 2012, 
and recommends that the Bank incorporate relevant aspects of the Guidelines into the new 
safeguard policy framework.41 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Bank&#8223;s assurance that it &#8220;does not support 
speculative land investments or acquisitions which take advantage of weak institutions in 
developing countries or which disregard principles of responsible agricultural investment&#8221;42 
and recommends that this commitment also be incorporated into policy. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Safeguards implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country systems and ownership 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur notes the Bank&#8223;s desire to move towards a safeguards model 
that enhances the use of country systems. The World Bank defines a country system as &#8220;a 
country&#8223;s legal and institutional framework, consisting of its national, subnational, or 
sectoral implementing institutions and applicable laws, regulations, rules and procedures&#8221;.43 
The Special Rapporteur supports the notion of placing greater emphasis on strengthening 
capacities of country institutions to identify, assess and manage social and environmental 
risks associated with development. She recognizes the need to strengthen country systems 
to sustainably improve the human rights situation in countries beyond what is done through 
individual World Bank-financed projects. However, she underscores the continuing 
importance of the application and enforcement of the Bank&#8223;s safeguard system (especially 
</p>
<p>the involuntary resettlement safeguard) unless and until country systems are equipped to 
guarantee human rights protections for people affected by development projects.  
</p>
<p>52. The necessary conditions to guarantee protections are not present in many countries 
in which the World Bank operates. In many cases, legal and regulatory frameworks 
governing land acquisition, eviction and resettlement are incomplete or fall far short of both 
Bank policy and international law; institutional capacity to plan and implement resettlement 
is weak; and judicial and administrative accountability and review systems are unable to 
protect the rights of affected people owing to corruption, political interference or low 
capacity. Several countries in which the Bank operates have poor track records on evictions 
and weak implementation practices on resettlement in the context of development. Placing 
greater emphasis on the discretion of Governments of countries lacking the necessary

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>conditions to guarantee protections heightens the risk of forced evictions and other 
violations of the right to adequate housing caused by Bank-financed projects.  
</p>
<p>53. Therefore, while encouraging greater support for strengthening country systems and 
institutions, the Special Rapporteur cautions against the reliance on incomplete and 
inadequate country systems. Until the preconditions have been achieved, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the Bank to ensure, through the enforcement of the safeguard system, 
that affected communities are protected from the negative impacts of projects, programmes 
and policies supported by the Bank. She also highlights possible negative effects on the 
World Bank&#8223;s reputation in cases when the Bank has actual or constructive knowledge of 
serious risks or of actual violations of human rights and takes no mitigating, remedial or 
other actions. In such cases, the Bank may be conceived as being complicit in human rights 
violations, despite the delegation of responsibility to the State borrower through the country 
system. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur also notes the Bank&#8223;s related decision to move away from a 
compliance-based supervision approach to a greater emphasis on implementation support 
and managing for results.44 She appreciates the need for greater support of implementation 
to achieve positive outcomes, not least with regard to safeguard policies, through, for 
example, capacity-building and technical assistance. However, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that the recently adopted OP 10.00 on Investment Project Financing limits the 
Bank&#8223;s role in ensuring that the borrower is using project funds only for the purposes for 
which the financing was granted and in compliance with covenanted safeguard policy 
requirements.   
</p>
<p>55. Revisions to the Bank&#8223;s policies on project appraisal and supervision through the 
adoption of OP 10.00 have eliminated some robust process requirements that were critical 
to the successful implementation of the Bank&#8223;s safeguards framework, such as those 
</p>
<p>relating to project appraisal and especially social and cultural aspects;45 consideration of 
alternatives;46 risk assessment during appraisal and implementation phases;47 risk 
management strategies;48 supervision and monitoring planning;49 the clear delegation of 
supervision responsibilities;50 and the identification and resolution of problems as they 
arise.51 Although recognizing that the elimination of these requirements has the intention of 
reducing bank costs and long bureaucratic procedures, OP 10.00 appears to create an 
overreliance by the Bank on self-monitoring by the borrower of its progress and compliance 
with contractual obligations. The Bank&#8223;s implementation support role appears to be limited 
</p>
<p>to reviewing the borrower&#8223;s own monitoring of performance, compliance, results, risks and 
</p>
<p>implementation status, rather than validating the credibility, accuracy and degree of 
candour of the borrower&#8223;s self-assessment through independent investigations.52 This 
apparent diminution of the Bank&#8223;s due diligence responsibilities could have adverse 
implications for the right to adequate housing and is of serious concern to the Special 
Rapporteur. She seeks clarification from the Bank on these concerns.

<p>56. She recommends that requirements to ensure (a) comprehensive social and 
environmental risk assessment, mitigation and management; and (b) robust implementation 
support, supervision and monitoring by the Bank to ensure that project funds are used in a 
manner consistent with project objectives, without arbitrary or discriminatory exclusions 
from project benefits, and in full compliance with safeguard policies, be incorporated into 
the consolidated safeguards framework and/or inserted through amendment to OP 10.00.53 
It is essential that such requirements are subject to compliance review by the Inspection 
Panel to guarantee accountability of the Bank to people affected by its investment lending 
operations.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Applying the safeguards to new financing instruments  
</b></p>
<p>57. The past decade has seen a shift towards greater use of new financing instruments by 
the Bank in response to changing contexts and client demand, such as Development Policy 
Loans (DPLs) (2004) and Program-for-Results Loans (2012).54 While traditional 
investment lending remains at the core of Bank operations,55 the use of different 
instruments and modalities to which safeguard policies do not apply has raised serious 
concerns about how the Bank ensures robust social and environmental risk management 
and accountability in this growing share of its portfolio. The Special Rapporteur has 
particular concerns about the potential adverse implications of the use of these instruments 
on the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>58. She appreciates that proposed activities that are likely to have &#8220;significant adverse 
impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented on the environment and/or affected 
people&#8221; are not eligible for Program-for-Results Financing,56 but nonetheless the 
assessment of those impacts requires specific operational policies from the Bank.  
</p>
<p>59. With regard to DPLs, OP 8.60 on Development Policy Lending does not put in place 
a sufficiently robust risk management system for all instances and contexts in which the

</p>
<p>[poverty and social] effects&#8221;, requiring only that the Bank describe in programme 
documentation how any shortcomings identified in the borrower&#8223;s system would be 
addressed.57 The Special Rapporteur is not aware of any set criteria or methodology by 
which the Bank must determine &#8220;whether specific country policies supported by the 
</p>
<p>operation are likely to have significant poverty and social consequences&#8221; or assess the 
ability of borrower systems to address those consequences.58 
</p>
<p>60. Of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur are DPLs that promote policy and 
institutional reforms in the provision of housing, water, land governance, urban 
management and infrastructure, which can impact upon several of the elements of the right 
to adequate housing, such as affordability, location, tenure security and the availability of 
services, among others. For example, a series of development-based loans and a structural

<p>adjustment loan to reform the housing sector in Mexico59 have contributed to the 
implementation of a housing policy based on subsidized credit for the purchase of housing 
units built by the private sector. This housing policy proved inadequate for the poorest 
segments of society (i.e., the population with earnings less than four minimum wages &#8211; 500 
USD). Moreover, the housing offered by private developers was mostly located in distant 
city outskirts and lacking access to basic social services, such as education and health 
services and transportation, commercial or cultural activities or employment 
opportunities.60 These policy reforms had a detrimental impact on several aspects of the 
right to adequate housing, especially the habitability, location, affordability and access to 
services.  
</p>
<p>61. Although OP 8.60 does not mandate the use of any particular analytical approach, it 
refers Bank staff to guidance on poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA).61 Yet, 
according to the <i>2009</i> <i>Development Policy Lending Retrospective</i>, over a third of prior 
actions identified as likely to have significant negative effects on poor and vulnerable 
groups were not underpinned by any form of PSIA.62 PSIA is defined by the Bank as 
&#8220;analysis of distributional impact of policy reforms on the well-being of different 
stakeholder groups, with particular focus on the poor and vulnerable&#8221;.63 Analysis of this 
kind should inform the design and content of all Bank operations. IEG has found, however, 
that PSIAs have generally had a moderate effect on Bank operations for several reasons, 
including ambiguity of the PSIA concept and insufficient buy-in from country directors and 
operational staff.64 This highlights the need for a detailed and overarching human rights due 
diligence assessment of DPLs policy reforms.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur notes that, in its recent retrospective of DPLs, the Bank 
identified the need to assess more consistently the poverty and social impacts of prior 
actions and improve linkages between analysis and design of operations.65 She urges the 
Bank to systematically conduct both <i>ex ante</i> and <i>ex</i> <i>post</i> impact assessments of all DPLs as 
a part of its due diligence, particularly with regard to projects or activities that involve a 
higher degree of social risk. While cognizant of the need to maintain a level of flexibility in 
formulating the appropriate modes of analysis for each operation, she recommends that OP 
8.60 be amended to mandate impact assessments of proposed reforms as a prerequisite to 
accurately determining the breadth and depth of poverty and social consequences. Measures 
to address gaps or shortcomings in country systems should be clearly and logically linked 
to determinative factors identified in the assessment. 
</p>
<p>63. The Bank should explicitly take into account the assessment tools that are based on 
the normative framework of international human rights law, to which borrower 
Governments are bound. Human rights impact assessments explore the legal, institutional, 
social and political economy factors that impede or facilitate transparent and accountable

<p>decision-making and administration; participation and empowerment of stakeholders; 
equality, inclusiveness and effectiveness of both process and outcomes and the right to an 
effective remedy.  
</p>
<p>64. The circumstances of groups subjected to discrimination or exclusion, and who thus 
may suffer from policy reform, should be analysed with particular emphasis (for example, 
in the context of the obligation for free prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples 
and the prohibition of direct and indirect discrimination). In the context of housing policy 
reforms, an assessment based on the right to adequate housing framework provides the 
tools to analyse the possible impact of reforms on the various components of the right to 
adequate housing (i.e., habitability, affordability, accessibility, location, availability of 
services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, security of tenure, cultural adequacy and 
the principle of equality and non-discrimination) of the affected communities.  
</p>
<p>65. The exploration of such factors and circumstances and their projected interplay with 
proposed policy and institutional reforms and alternatives can result in enhanced 
programme design and results, and assist the World Bank in mitigating the risk of 
complicity in human rights violations and minimizing its reputational risk. Analyses of the 
likely regressive and progressive impacts on a range of interrelated human rights, as 
defined in international law instruments, can help refine reform programmes to reverse 
(predicted) negative effects or discriminatory outcomes for particular groups and ensure the 
maximum flow of appropriate types of benefits to the most vulnerable groups. The adoption 
of mitigation measures, such as a national resettlement policy to accompany a land reform 
programme, should be included as prior actions where risks of adverse impacts on human 
rights are identified. Immitigable weak governance or political economy factors that are 
likely to thwart successful implementation of the safeguard measures should preclude the 
approval of a DPL.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur notes that DPLs, and especially single-tranche operations, 
drastically limit the opportunity of affected persons to access the Inspection Panel to seek 
accountability for alleged harms. Pursuant to BP 17.55 on Inspection Panel Resolution, a 
request for inspection is ineligible if it is filed after the closing date of the loan or after at 
least 95 per cent of the loan has been disbursed.66 DPLs can be approved, disbursed and 
closed within a very short time period, sometimes in just a few days. In conjunction with 
the inadequate risk management system for DPLs, this situation creates an alarming 
accountability deficit that should be promptly rectified. Bank policy should be amended to 
extend the time period for which the Inspection Panel can accept requests for inspection 
from people claiming they have suffered in connection with DPLs. Requests should be 
accepted at least for the duration of the period covered by the DPL Performance 
Assessment Framework (approximately two-three years).67 
</p>
<p>67. In addition, certain types of investment lending operations, such as sector-wide and 
programmatic lending, while subject to safeguard policies, raise difficulties in their 
application that need to be addressed.68 For example, a request for inspection was submitted 
to the Inspection Panel in September 2012 in relation to the Ethiopia Protection of Basic 
Services Project. The Request claims that, despite the commendable objectives of the 
Project, Bank funds are being used by the Government of Ethiopia to carry out a forced 
villagization programme in the Gambella region.69 The request states that under the 
villagization programme, Anuak indigenous peoples have been forcibly displaced from

</p>
<p>their ancestral lands and subjected to arrest, beatings, torture, killing and inhuman 
conditions at the new villages.70 In the light of the seriousness of these allegations and 
given the resulting risk that Bank funds disbursed for the Project may be contributing to 
these grave human rights abuses and placing the Bank in a position where it is complicit in 
those violations, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by the decision of the Bank not to 
trigger its safeguard policies for the third phase of the Project. 
</p>
<p>68. While officially an investment lending operation, the Project is designed to provide 
direct budget support to the federal and subnational Governments of Ethiopia to achieve a 
set of specific development results in five sectors. In effect, this design vests in the 
borrower a comparative amount of discretion with respect to project implementation and 
places a similar level of trust in country systems as development policy operations. As 
such, the Bank faces similar challenges in assessing distributional impacts and social risk 
and applying safeguard policies as it does with DPLs. In such circumstances, a thorough 
human rights due diligence process is critical in order to analyse, for instance, how the 
project will interplay with prevailing ethnic, religious or political cleavages, entrenched 
discrimination and social and economic inequities. Such an assessment would have 
identified the risk that Bank funds may contribute to the forced displacement of 
marginalized groups and other human rights violations. When such risks are identified, 
Bank projects should be modified to apply relevant safeguard policies, enhance 
distributional benefits and improve accountability to disadvantaged groups.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the new Bank safeguards framework be 
formulated so that it is better suited to apply to the various types of financing instruments 
employed by the Bank. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Ensuring effective implementation of the safeguards framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Bank incentive structure 
</b></p>
<p>70. From the information gathered during the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s visit, it appears that 
there is resistance among Bank staff to the current framework of safeguard policies. 
Safeguard policies are often perceived by Bank&#8223;s staff as substantially limiting the Bank&#8223;s 
ability to &#8220;attract&#8221; State clients and compete with other regional and international financial 
</p>
<p>institutions.71 
</p>
<p>71. As Bank&#8223;s staff performance is measured according to loan approval rates rather 
than the effectiveness of the project or compatibility with safeguards policies, there seems 
to be little structural incentive for staff to adhere to safeguard policies. Cases coming before 
the Inspection Panel point to the existence of &#8220;paper compliance&#8221; phenomena &#8211; i.e., 
projects in which the Bank follows safeguard procedures on the face of documentation, but 
below the surface, the project reports are inadequate for policy compliance and procedures 
required may have been followed superficially or not at all.72 The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the current review process examine alternative staff performance and 
incentive structures in order to ensure greater adherence to the safeguards in all project 
phases.

<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Implementation, monitoring and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>72. Although almost all safeguards include supervision requirement, supervision after 
project approval remains a major weakness in the World Bank&#8223;s safeguard policy 
</p>
<p>framework.73 The Special Rapporteur is concerned about a deepening gap between the 
safeguards rhetoric and the implementation of the policy framework. IEG found that more 
than one third of Bank projects had &#8220;inadequate environmental and social supervision, 
manifested mainly in unrealistic safeguards ratings and poor or absent monitoring and 
evaluation&#8221;.74 These weaknesses can be attributed to a lack of specificity of monitoring 
indicators, underinvestment in client&#8223;s monitoring capacity and poor follow-up during 
supervision.75 IEG further noted that &#8220;too often, safeguards activities are considered an add-
on, and left to environmental and social specialists who are underresourced and not well 
integrated into supervision teams&#8221;.76  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Bank to systematically integrate clear indicators 
of social performance and explicit standards for compliance with the safeguard framework 
during project supervision. She also calls on the Bank to budget the cost of evaluation and 
monitoring in the project planning and recommends that the Bank expand the use of 
independent and community participation in the project supervision and evaluation. The 
Special Rapporteur also stresses the need to increase State accountability vis-&#224;-vis the Bank 
in the implementation stages.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Concluding comments 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the opportunity to provide comments and 
recommendations to the World Bank during its review of its safeguard policies. She 
</b></p>
<p><b>would welcome further opportunities to discuss in more detail any of the points raised 
</b></p>
<p><b>in this report and, generally, how to better ensure that the World Bank, as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>specialized United Nations agency and subject to international law, can fulfil its 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation to respect the right to adequate housing and progress the enjoyment of this 
</b></p>
<p><b>right by those groups most deprived. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Bank to seize the opportunity of the safeguard 
review process to commit to human rights standards in all its activities. This will ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the Bank can effectively champion and help fulfil human rights, and maintain its 
</b></p>
<p><b>position as a central player in the effort to combat social exclusion, empower 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities as actors for their own development and eliminate poverty at its roots. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the World Bank commit to 
undertake (and require borrowers to undertake) human rights due diligence in all of 
</b></p>
<p><b>its activities, including investment lending, development policy lending and the newly 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopted Program-for-Results. The Bank should also ensure that effective mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>are in place to implement these policies and identify, prevent, mitigate and account for 
</b></p>
<p><b>how to address actual and potential adverse human rights impacts.
