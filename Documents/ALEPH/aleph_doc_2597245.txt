<P align=justify><B>Re: Private Placement of Subscription Receipts </B></P>
<P align=justify>GMP Securities L.P. (&#147;<B>GMP</B>&#148;), BMO Nesbitt Burns
Inc.
(&#147;<B>BMO</B>&#148; and, together with GMP, the &#147;<B>Co-Lead

Canaccord Genuity Corp., Clarus Securities Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc., M

Securities (Canada) Inc., National Bank Financial Inc., Paradigm Capital Inc.,
PI Financial Corp., Rodman &amp; Renshaw a unit of H.C. Wainwright &amp; Co, LLC
and Haywood Securities Inc., (collectively, with the Co-Lead Underwriters, the
&#147;<B>Underwriters</B>&#148; and each individually, an 
&#147;<B>Underwriter</B>&#148;),
understand that Klondex Mines Ltd. (the &#147;<B>Corporation</B>&#148;) proposes
to issue
and sell to the Underwriters, or to the Substituted Purchasers (as defined
below), 22,900,000 subscription receipts (the &#147;<B>Initial</B> 
<B>Subscription
Receipts</B>&#148;) at a price of $5.00 per Subscription Receipt (the 
&#147;<B>Issue
Price</B>&#148;) for aggregate gross proceeds of $114,500,000 (the
&#147;<B>Offering</B>&#148;). </P>
<P align=justify>In addition, the Corporation hereby grants to the Underwriters
an option (the &#147;<B>Underwriters&#146; Option</B>&#148;) to purchase, 
severally and not
jointly, in the respective percentages set forth in Section 14(a), up to an
additional 3,000,000 Subscription Receipts (the &#147;<B>Additional Subscription
Receipts</B>&#148; and together with the Initial Subscription Receipts, the
&#147;<B>Subscription Receipts</B>&#148;) at the Issue Price per Additional 
Subscription
Receipt. The Underwriters&#146; Option may be exercised in whole or in part at 
any
time up to 48 hours prior to the Closing Date (as defined below) by written
notice from GMP, on behalf of the Underwriters, to the Corporation setting forth
the aggregate number of Additional Subscription Receipts to be purchased. </P>
<P align=justify>Although the offer to purchase the Initial Subscription
Receipts is being made by the Underwriters as Purchaser (as defined below), the
Underwriters will endeavour to arrange for substituted purchasers (collectively,
the &#147;<B>Substituted Purchasers&#148;</B>) for the Initial Subscription 
Receipts (and
any Additional Subscription Receipts) in the Qualifying Jurisdictions (as
defined below) with the effect that such Substituted Purchasers will be the
initial Purchasers of the Subscription Receipts. To the extent that Substituted
Purchasers purchase Subscription Receipts at the Closing (as defined below), the
Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase the Subscription Receipts so
purchased by such Substituted Purchasers.</P>
<P align=justify>The Subscription Receipts will be created pursuant to a
subscription receipt agreement (the &#147;<B>Subscription Receipt 
Agreement</B>&#148;)
among the Corporation, the Co-Lead Underwriters, on their own behalf and on
behalf of the other Underwriters, and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as
subscription receipt agent (the &#147;<B>Subscription Receipt Agent</B>&#148;), 
to be
dated as of the Closing Date. Each Subscription Receipt will entitle the holder
to receive, upon satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined
below) and without payment of additional consideration or further action on the
part of the holders of the Subscription Receipts, one special warrant (a
&#147;<b>Special Warrant</b>&#148;). </P>

<P align=justify>The Special Warrants shall be issued pursuant to, and governed
by, a special warrant indenture (the &#147;<B>Special Warrant 
Indenture</B>&#148;) to be
entered into effective on the Closing Date between the Corporation and
Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as special warrant agent for the
Corporation (the &#147;<B>Special Warrant Agent</B>&#148;). Subject to the 
conditions
described in this Agreement (as defined below), each Special Warrant will
entitle the holder to receive upon exercise or deemed exercise, without payment
of any additional consideration, one Common Share (as defined below) (each, an
&#147;<B>Underlying Share</B>&#148;). The Special Warrants not already exercised
will be
deemed exercised at the earlier of: (i) the date that is the third Business Day
(as defined below) after the date of a receipt for a final short-form prospectus
of the Corporation qualifying the distribution of the Underlying Shares in the
Qualifying Jurisdictions (as defined below) (the &#147;<B>Qualification 
Date</B>&#148;);
and (ii) 4:59 p.m. (Toronto time) on the date that is four months and one day
following the Closing Date. </P>
<P align=justify>The gross proceeds from the Offering, less an amount
representing the Underwriters&#146; expenses and out-of-pocket costs and legal
expenses and 50 percent of the Commission (as defined below) (the 
&#147;<B>Escrowed
Proceeds</B>&#148;), will be deposited at the Closing Time (as defined below) in
escrow with the Subscription Receipt Agent and invested in interest-bearing
trust accounts maintained by the Subscription Receipt Agent or otherwise
invested in such manner as is acceptable to the Corporation and the
Underwriters, pending satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions. Provided
that the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto
time) on the date which is 90 days following the Closing Date (as defined below)
(the &#147;<B>Escrow Release Deadline</B>&#148;), the Subscription Receipt Agent
will: (i)
release an amount representing 50% of the Commission plus any interest accrued
and actually earned thereon to or at the direction of the Co-Lead Underwriters,
and (ii) release all of the remaining Escrow Funds (as such term is defined in
the Subscription Receipt Agreement) to or at the direction of the Corporation.
Each Subscription Receipt will be automatically exchanged for one Special
Warrant without payment of additional consideration and without any further
action by the holder. If (i) the Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied
prior to the Escrow Release Deadline; or (ii) prior to the Escrow Release
Deadline the Corporation advises the Underwriters or announces to the public
that it does not intend to satisfy any of the Escrow Release Conditions (each
such event, a &#147;<B>Termination Event</B>&#148;), the Subscription Receipt 
Agent will
return to each holder of Subscription Receipts, within three Business Days
following the Termination Event, an amount equal to the aggregate Offering Price
of the Subscription Receipts held by such holder and their <I>pro rata</I>
portion of interest and other income earned (if any) on the Escrowed Proceeds
and their <I>pro rata</I> portion of interest and other income that would
otherwise have been earned on 50 percent of the Commission and the expenses and
out-of-pocket costs and legal expenses of the Underwriters, as if such amounts
had been held in escrow as part of the Escrowed Proceeds and not paid to the
Underwriters on the Closing Date (less applicable withholding tax, if any) and
the Subscription Receipts shall be canceled. </P>

<P align=justify>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Underwriters may offer and sell the Subscription Receipts on a private placement
basis in the Selling Jurisdictions (as defined below), to purchasers in Canada,
through their U.S. Affiliates (as defined below) to purchasers in the United
States (as defined below) that are U.S. Accredited Investors (as defined below),
in transactions that are exempt from or not subject to the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act (as defined below) and applicable state
securities law, and to purchasers in certain jurisdictions agreed to by the
Corporation and the Underwriters, all in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement, including Schedule A hereto, which forms a part of this Agreement.
</P>
<P align=justify>The Corporation agrees that the Underwriters shall be permitted
to appoint, at their sole expense, other registered dealers or other dealers
duly qualified in their respective jurisdictions, as their Underwriters, to
assist in the Offering in the Selling Jurisdictions and that the Underwriters
may determine, and shall be solely responsible for, the remuneration payable to
such other dealers appointed by them. </P>
<P align=justify>In consideration of the Underwriters&#146; services to be 
rendered
in connection with the Offering, including assisting in preparing documentation
relating to the Subscription Receipts and distributing the Subscription
Receipts, directly and through other investment dealers and brokers, the
Corporation shall pay to the Underwriters a cash fee (the
&#147;<B>Commission</B>&#148;)
equal to the sum of: (i) 5.0% of the aggregate purchase price of Subscription
Receipts sold under the Offering to Subscribers that are not on the 
President&#146;s
List (as described below); and (ii) 2.5% of the aggregate purchase price of
Subscription Receipts sold under the Offering to Subscribers on the 
President&#146;s
List that are designated by the Corporation and Co-Lead Underwriters as being
associated with a fee payable to the Underwriters (the &#147;<B>Designated
Purchasers</B>&#148;). For the avoidance of doubt, the Commission will not 
include
any amount in respect of Subscription Receipts sold under the Offering to
Subscribers on the President&#146;s List who are not Designated Purchasers. </P>

      CDS in non-certificated form through the non-certificated inventory system
      of CDS will be evidenced by a book position on the register of holders to
      be maintained by the Subscription Receipt Agent in accordance with Section

      a Subscription Receipt Certificate and, if so represented, such
      Subscription Receipt Certificate shall be delivered to CDS, or its

      pursuant to a Written Direction of the Corporation, without any further
      act of or formality on the part of the Corporation and without the
      Subscription Receipt Agent receiving any consideration therefor. The
      Corporation shall direct the Subscription Receipt Agent to proceed by way
      of a non- certificated issue with respect to the Subscription Receipts to
      be issued to purchasers other than purchasers to whom Subscription Receipt
      Certificates are issued. Such Subscription Receipts will be registered in 
the
      name of and deposited with CDS or its nominee in the BEO System. U.S. 
Purchasers
      shall receive Restricted Global Subscription Receipts, other than 
President's

___________________ (the "<B>holder</B>") is the registered holder of the number

Klondex Mines Ltd. (the "<B>Corporation</B>") and is thereby entitled, without
payment of any additional consideration, to receive Special Warrants (as defined
in the Subscription Receipt Agreement hereinafter referred to) of the
Corporation after the Release Date (as defined in the Subscription Receipt
Agreement hereinafter referred to) on the basis of one Special Warrant for each
Subscription Receipt. </P>
<P align=justify>This Subscription Receipt Certificate represents Subscription
Receipts of the Corporation issued under the provisions of a subscription
receipt agreement (which agreement, together with all instruments supplemental
or ancillary thereto, is herein referred to as the "<B>Subscription Receipt
Agreement</B>") dated as of August 18, 2016 between the Corporation, GMP
Securities L.P. ("<B>GMP</B>"), BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. ("<B>BMO</B>" and,
together with GMP, the "<B>Lead Underwriters</B>") and Computershare Trust
Company of Canada (the "<B>Subscription Receipt Agent</B>"). Reference is hereby
made for particulars of the rights of the holders of the Subscription Receipts,
the Corporation and the Subscription Receipt Agent in respect thereof and of the
terms and conditions upon which the Subscription Receipts are issued and held,
all to the same effect as if the provisions of the Subscription Receipt
Agreement were herein set forth in full, to all of which the holder, by
acceptance hereof, assents. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this Subscription Receipt Certificate and the Subscription Receipt Agreement,
the terms of the Subscription Receipt Agreement shall govern. The Corporation
will furnish to the holder, on request, a copy of the Subscription Receipt
Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein, words and terms with the initial
letter or letters thereof capitalized shall have the meanings given to such
words and terms in the Subscription Receipt Agreement. </P>
<P align=justify>The Subscription Receipts represented by this Subscription
Receipt Certificate will be automatically converted by the Subscription Receipt
Agent for and on behalf of the holder immediately upon receipt by the 
Subscription Receipt Agent of a
Release Notice executed by the Corporation and the Lead Underwriters and the
holder will be deemed to have subscribed for the Special Warrants issuable on
the conversion of such Subscription Receipts without the taking of any action by
the holder, including the surrender of this Subscription Receipt Certificate and
the payment of additional consideration, which will thereupon be cancelled by
the Subscription Receipt Agent. As soon as practicable, following the
satisfaction of all of the Escrow Release Conditions, the Corporation will
deliver to the Lead Underwriters a Release Notice duly executed by the
Corporation. Upon receipt of the Release Notice from the Corporation, the Lead
Underwriters will review the Release Notice and, unless the Lead Underwriters in
good faith contest any of the statements contained therein, the Lead
Underwriters will, as soon as practicable (i) execute the Release Notice in
acknowledgement thereof; and (ii) deliver the Release Notice, jointly executed
by the Corporation and the Lead Underwriters, to the Subscription Receipt Agent.
For greater certainty, the Subscription Receipts represented by this certificate
may not be converted by the holder and may only be converted pursuant to the
foregoing automatic conversion. </P>

<P align=justify>The Corporation will not be obligated after the aggregation of
the number of Special Warrants to be issued to a holder of Subscription Receipts
to issue any fraction of a Special Warrant on the conversion of Subscription
Receipts. A holder of Subscription Receipts shall not be entitled to receive a
cash payment or any other compensation in respect of any such fraction of a
Special Warrant. </P>
<P align=justify>No Special Warrants will be issued pursuant to the conversion

the number of Special Warrants to be issued upon exchange in certain events
therein set forth.</P>

upon compliance with such reasonable requirements as the Subscription Receipt
Agent may prescribe. The transfer register shall be closed at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto

<P align=justify>The Company has agreed that in the event that a holder of
Special Warrants who acquires Underlying Securities is or becomes entitled under
applicable Securities Laws to the remedy of rescission by reason of the
Prospectus and any amendment thereto containing a misrepresentation, such holder
shall, subject to available defences and any limitation period under applicable
Securities Laws, be entitled to rescission not only of the holder's exercise or
deemed exercise of its Special Warrants but also of the private placement
transaction pursuant to which the Special Warrants were initially acquired
(being the Private Placement), and shall be entitled in connection with such
rescission to a full refund from the Company of the aggregate purchase price
paid on the acquisition of the Subscription Receipts that converted into the
Special Warrants by the holder of the Special Warrants. In the event such holder
is a permitted assignee of the interest of the original purchaser of the
Subscription Receipts or the Special Warrants, such permitted assignee shall be
permitted to exercise the rights of rescission and refund granted hereunder as
if such permitted assignee was such original purchaser. The provisions of this
Section are a direct contractual right extended by the Company to holders of
Special Warrants, permitted assignees of such holders and holders of the
Underlying Securities acquired by such holders upon exercise or deemed exercise
of the Special Warrants and are in addition to any other right or remedy
available to a holder of a Purchased Security under section 130(1) of the
<I>Securities Act</I> (Ontario) or equivalent provisions of applicable
Securities Laws, or otherwise at law. The foregoing contractual rights of action
for rescission shall be subject to the defences described under section 130(1)
of the <I>Securities Act</I> (Ontario) which is incorporated herein by reference
and any other defence or defences available to the Company under applicable
laws. </P>
<P align=justify>Should a holder of Special Warrants exercise any legal,
statutory, contractual or other right of withdrawal or rescission that may be
available to it, the Special Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for ensuring
the exercise is cancelled and a refund is paid back to the holder. In such
cases, the holder shall seek a refund directly from the Company and
subsequently, the Company, upon surrender to the Company or the Special Warrant
Agent of any Underlying Securities that may have been issued, or such other
procedure as agreed to by the parties hereto, shall instruct the Special Warrant
Agent in writing, to cancel the exercise transaction and to cause the
cancellation of any such Underlying Securities on the appropriate registers,
which may have already been issued upon the Special Warrant exercise. The
Special Warrant Agent shall not be under any duty or obligation to take any
steps to ensure or enforce that the funds are returned pursuant to this Section,
nor shall the Special Warrant Agent be in any other way responsible in the event
that any payment is not delivered or received pursuant to this Section.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company provides the refund
to the Special Warrant Agent for distribution to the holder, the Special Warrant
Agent shall return such funds to the holder as soon as reasonably practicable,
and in so doing, the Special Warrant Agent shall incur no liability with respect
to the delivery or non-delivery of any such funds. </P>

instructions contained in Appendix 4 attached hereto. Any such exercise, at a
time when the Company has not received the Receipt for the Prospectus from the
Securities Commissions or the Prospectus has not been delivered to the Special
Warrantholder, is subject to compliance with, and may be restricted by,
Applicable Legislation. If, at the time of the exercise of the Special Warrants,

price of the securities issuable hereunder upon the occurrence of certain events
including any subdivision, consolidation, or reclassification of the shares,
payment of stock dividends, or amalgamation of the Company. </P>
<P align=justify>The holding of the Special Warrants evidenced by this Special
Warrant Certificate does not constitute the Special Warrantholder a shareholder
of the Company or entitle such holder to any right or interest in respect
thereof except as expressly provided herein and in the Indenture. </P>

Warrantholder (or its legal representatives or its attorney duly appointed), on

applicable laws and upon compliance with the conditions set out in the
Indenture, by delivering to the Special Warrant Agent's Toronto office a duly
executed Form of Transfer attached as Appendix 2 and complying with such other
reasonable requirements as the Company and the Special Warrant Agent may
prescribe and such transfer shall be duly noted on the register by the Special

<P align=justify>The holder understands and acknowledges that the Special
Warrants and Underlying Securities issuable hereunder upon exercise of the
Special Warrants (together, the "<B>Securities</B>") have not been and, except
as set forth below, will not be registered under the United States Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "<B>1933 Act</B>"), or under the securities laws of
any state of the United States, and that Special Warrants originally issued in
the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, a person in the
United States are, and any Securities issued upon exercise of such Special
Warrants will be, "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3)
under the 1933 Act. "United States" has the meaning assigned in Regulation S
("<B>Regulation S</B>") under the 1933 Act. The Company has agreed to file a
resale registration statement related to the Underlying Securities issuable upon
exercise or deemed exercise of the Special Warrants purchased in the United
States. </P>
<P align=justify>The holder understands that the Special Warrants represented
hereby may not be exercised within the United States or by or for the account or
benefit of a person in the United States, and the Securities issuable upon
exercise of such Special Warrants may not be delivered within the United States,
unless such Securities are registered under the 1933 Act and the securities laws
of any state in which the holder is resident, or unless an exemption from such
registration requirements is available. </P>
<P align=justify>The holder understands that, until such time as the same is no
longer required under applicable requirements of the 1933 Act or applicable
state securities laws, certificates representing Securities which are 
"restricted securities", and all
certificates issued in exchange therefor or in substitution thereof, will bear a
U.S. restrictive legend substantially in the form prescribed by section 5.9 of
the Indenture; provided that if the Special Warrants are being sold outside the
United States in compliance with the requirements of Rule 904 of Regulation S,
such legend may be removed by providing an executed declaration to the Special
Warrant Agent or, with respect to Common Shares, the Company's registrar and
transfer agent, in substantially the form set forth as Appendix 3 attached to
this Special Warrant Certificate (or in such other form as the Company may
prescribe from time to time) and, if requested by the Company, the Special
Warrant Agent or the transfer agent (as the case may be), an opinion of counsel
of recognized standing in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, the
Special Warrant Agent and the transfer agent (as applicable) to the effect that
such sale is being made in compliance with Rule 904 of Regulation S; and
provided, further, that, if any Securities are being sold otherwise than in
accordance with Regulation S and other than to the Company, the legend may be
removed by delivery to the Company and the transfer agent of an opinion of
counsel of recognized standing in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, the Special Warrant Agent and the transfer agent (as applicable),
to the effect that such legend is no longer required under applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act or state securities laws; and further provided that
such legend may be removed from certificates representing any Special Warrants
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the indenture governing
the Special Warrants. </P>
