The Unconventional Fairway
EnCana has assembled a vast 
land position across North America’s
unconventional fairway, home to the
company’s 10 key resource plays.
North America’s interior, the north-south expanse of the plains
and grasslands running from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic,
was not always a vast dry prairie or high plateau. Illustrated by
the light green in the map at the right, a massive seaway once
bisected the continent. Over a 25-million-year period during
the Cretaceous Period and ending about 65 million years ago,
rivers and rainwater washed sediments downstream from the
western highlands – today’s Rocky Mountains – to settle in a
series of enormous sedimentary basins. With time and climate
changes, shorelines migrated across this shallow sea, rivers 
cut new courses and enormous tectonic events deposited rocks,
silt and sand rich with the plants, sea life and vegetation that
formed a storehouse of deeply buried organic material. Layer
upon layer of overburden generated massive pressures. In
combination with geothermal heat extending over millions 
of years, these forces created hydrocarbons, the natural gas 
and oil that now fuel the Earth. Over more than three decades
of operations, EnCana and its predecessor companies have
assembled a vast land position across this unconventional
fairway, home to the company’s 10 key resource plays.
From northeast British Columbia to east Texas, EnCana 
is profitably tapping and unlocking huge deposits of natural 
gas and bitumen on these resource play lands through 
the application of innovative technology, manufacturing
methodology and unconventional thinking.

Our Strategy
Disciplined investment in developing our extensive
inventory of resource plays to deliver predictable and
profitable sales and reserves growth and increase
the net asset value of every EnCana share.
Randy Eresman 
President & 
Chief Executive Officer
Delivering On Our Potential
It is a privilege to write my inaugural letter to shareholders
shortly after assuming my new role as President & Chief
Executive Officer and in the wake of such a dynamic and vibrant
year for our industry and EnCana. The theme of our 2005
annual report is Delivering On Our Potential, and EnCana’s
resource potential is enormous – proved reserves of 11.8 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas and 1.1 billion barrels of oil, plus
unbooked resource potential estimated at 24 trillion cubic feet 
of gas equivalent. It is upon this resource foundation that we
plan to grow annual sales at an average of 10 percent per share
for years ahead. In this report, we discuss our achievements,
explain EnCana’s potential, and describe how we plan to deliver
industry-leading performance and execution excellence 
in our natural gas and in-situ oilsands businesses. As always,
our overarching goal is clear – building the net asset value 
of every EnCana share.
A Year of Contrasting Extremes 
The year 2005 was filled with contrasting extremes –
tremendous prices and one of the toughest operating
environments ever. Robust world economic growth drove
natural gas and oil prices to record levels. Demand for oilfield
equipment and services skyrocketed, stoking industry inflation
by as much as 30 percent. Devastating North American weather
– a pair of massive hurricanes and record rainfall in Western
Canada – took out Gulf of Mexico production and halted
Canadian drilling crews in their tracks, further choking off
supply and again driving up prices for gas, oil, compressors,
steel, drill pipe, rigs, workers and construction. The prices we
benefited from also fuelled inflation in our own industry.
Everything energy cost more.
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   3
Sustained Performance During Turbulent Times
Through all the operational challenges, the strength and
stability of our resource play strategy endured as EnCana
achieved strong organic growth in 2005. Our natural gas 
sales increased 8 percent. Oil and natural gas liquids sales
decreased 13 percent following the sales of some conventional
production. In recent years, we have been shifting our oil focus
towards growing our in-situ oilsands production, which
increased more than 40 percent from the start of 2005. Total
gas and liquids sales grew more than 6 percent per share.
In the past three years, annual sales per share have increased
an average of 13 percent. In 2005, our proved reserves grew
18 percent to 18.5 trillion cubic feet equivalent, generating 
a production replacement of 271 percent. These reserves were
added at a very competitive finding and development cost 
of $1.29 per thousand cubic feet equivalent. With our 2005
netbacks averaging about $5.21 per thousand cubic feet
equivalent, we achieved a recycle ratio of more than 4 times.
Through the year, we continued to sharpen our focus on gas
and oil resource plays through divestitures of conventional
assets, such as Ecuador, the Gulf of Mexico, Western Canada
conventional oil production, a high-impact oil discovery
offshore Brazil and our natural gas liquids business. Since our
creation in 2002, EnCana has divested more than $11 billion 
in non-resource play assets, and we expect to complete the 
sale of another $1.8 billion of assets in the first half of this year.
Enormous Oilsands Potential
Our vast oilsands are at an early stage of development and 
we believe they hold enormous value that has yet to be realized.
Late in 2005, we announced that we have the potential to
increase in-situ oilsands production tenfold over the next
decade, to 500,000 barrels per day by 2015. With development
rights to 1.2 million acres capable of delivering bitumen from
steam-assisted gravity drainage projects, EnCana is one of
the largest holders of oilsands lands. Engineering evaluations
indicate our recoverable resources are estimated at between 
5 billion and 10 billion barrels of bitumen, and our lands
contain an estimated 40 billion barrels of oil in place. As part
of our expansion plans, EnCana is advancing discussions with
a variety of oil companies – including major multinationals,
integrated producers and national oil companies – for a
potential partnership to upgrade, refine and market the
company’s bitumen production. This market integration
initiative is expected to enable EnCana to participate in low-
cost market development solutions that could expand the
company’s business beyond being a pure bitumen producer.
Our in-situ oilsands lands were producing more than
50,000 barrels per day at the end of 2005, and current
expansion work is expected to take productive capacity 
to about 70,000 barrels per day by year-end 2006.
Through all of the operational
challenges, the strength and stability
of our resource play strategy endured
as EnCana achieved strong organic
growth in 2005.
4 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Strong Financial Performance 
Robust pricing and our healthy sales growth generated strong
financial performance in 2005. Cash flow per share increased
57 percent, operating earnings per share rose 73 percent and
net earnings per share were up 3 percent. Return on capital
employed was 17 percent and the company reinvested
$3.1 billion from asset sales to lower debt and reduce shares
outstanding by 4.5 percent under our Normal Course Issuer
Bid. In May, EnCana shares split two-for-one and, in June,
EnCana’s annual dividend was increased by 50 percent to
30 cents per share, on a post-split basis. During 2005, EnCana
shareholders received a total shareholder return of 55 percent.
Over the past three years, total shareholder return was more
than 120 percent for Canadian dollar shares and close to
200 percent for U.S. dollar shares, which is comparatively
higher due to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar.
Tackling the Challenges  
As I mentioned, last year was one of the toughest operating
environments we have faced. Record activity levels and bad
weather combined to create a stretched service sector, high
inflation, significant delays and inefficiency in execution.
In other years when rain temporarily sidetracked our operations,
we were able to make up for lost time. But last year, given the
tightness of resources in the service sector, there was little
capacity to ramp up when the skies cleared. Weather delays 
and a shortage of field services left our field crews idle for up
to three months, which meant that we drilled about 80 percent
of our planned gas wells. Consequently, our natural gas sales
levels in 2005 ran slightly lower than expected. This production
is not lost; it is simply delayed. The tight oilfield service market
fuelled inflation at EnCana of about 15 percent, prompting 
a rise in capital spending and operating costs. While we faced
higher costs, we also benefited from higher prices.
Adding Rigs, Managing Costs
Moving into 2006 and beyond, EnCana is taking many steps 
to manage costs and build capacity for continued growth. One
of our largest initiatives is the negotiation of long-term drilling
contracts that will see about 50 to 60 new fit-for-purpose rigs
added to our operations. These high-efficiency rigs are safer
and drill faster, saving money and bringing production on-stream
quicker. By the end of 2006, we expect to be operating about
half of our drilling fleet under long-term contracts. The fleet
averages about 120 rigs throughout the year. Across our
operations, we have negotiated volume discounts with a variety
of suppliers, buying in bulk such items as drill pipe, nitrogen,
fuel, wellheads and completion and fracturing services. Through
several long-term procurement contracts, EnCana expects to
continue bringing efficiencies to its supply chain and capturing
tens of millions of dollars in savings each year. With inflationary
pressures expected to continue at a high level again this year,
we decided to reduce 2006 drilling in areas where costs have
increased the most. We trimmed our planned 2006 upstream
capital investment by about $300 million, or 5 percent. With
the anticipated proceeds from planned asset sales, we expect
net capital investment of about $2.8 billion. Given the
continued high activity levels for 2006, we expect our drilling
and natural gas sales growth to be about the same as in 2005,
about 4,700 wells and about 8 percent respectively. To help
assure strong financial performance, we have about 93 percent
of our 2006 forecast natural gas sales hedged with a combination
of put options and fixed prices at an average floor price 
of NYMEX $7.30 per thousand cubic feet.
Resource Play Advantage – Unconventional Potential
Despite the dramatic and comparatively short-term events that
impacted 2005, our focus remains on long-term value creation.
With 17 million net acres of undeveloped land concentrated in
the prime sedimentary basins flanking North America’s Rocky
Mountains, from the foothills of northeast British Columbia to
the plains of Texas, EnCana is well positioned for the long term
to continue supplying the most attractive energy market in the
world – North America. Four fundamental characteristics help
illustrate why our confidence in our resource play potential 
is stronger than ever.
• Extensive drilling inventory. On our current lands,
we have identified about 37,000 well locations sitting over
top of known gas and oil resources. At an annual drilling
rate of approximately 5,000 wells per year, our inventory 
of development drilling is more than seven years.
• High production and reserves growth. We believe that 
our assets are capable of delivering annual sales growth
averaging 10 percent per share. This forecast is based on 
two fundamental assets, our 18.5 trillion cubic feet of gas
equivalent of proved reserves and our unbooked resource
potential. An annual estimate of EnCana’s unbooked
resource potential is published in the second quarter 
of each year. The most recent, in April 2005, put the
estimate at 19 trillion cubic feet of gas and 900 million
barrels of oil and natural gas liquids, which is the equivalent
of 24 trillion cubic feet of gas – a tremendous base for
building long-term production and reserves growth.
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   5
• Strong project returns. Our focus on capital discipline
means that, before we invest, development projects must 
be capable of delivering at least a 20 percent internal, risk-
adjusted, after-tax rate of return, while our oilsands and
exploration projects must return at least 15 percent. Many
of our key resource plays are well above that. With strong
prices in 2005, the average return on our upstream portfolio
was more than 30 percent.
• Huge value upside. We believe that EnCana has huge
value upside on a number of fronts, which of course
includes our oilsands and our emerging natural gas resource
plays. In addition, there is anticipated upside in our option-
value exploration. By applying our core competencies to
exploration and evaluation in select international locations,
we are able to generate significant pre-development cash
value. For example, in 2005, we made a significant oil
discovery offshore Brazil, which we agreed to sell to an
experienced offshore operator for $350 million, and we
expect to record a gain of about $200 million. We also
believe we have significant value creation potential through
portfolio high-grading – a core competency we have
repeatedly demonstrated over the last number of years.
This is reflected in our reserve replacement cost, which 
was 91 cents per thousand cubic feet equivalent in 2005 
and averaged $1.22 per thousand cubic feet equivalent 
over the past three years.
Youthful Potential
I encourage you to read pages 12 to 16 which explain the
advantages of unconventional resources, how we define our
enormous unbooked resource potential and how we have
sharpened our focus on North America. Page 16 illustrates the
resource play life cycle, which typically extends more than a
quarter of a century. Our oldest play, shallow gas at Suffield,
has operated since 1976 and, after 30 years, it is producing at
record levels. Yet, by comparison, most of our key resource
plays are just in the early stages of development. They each
have many years of profitable growth ahead, forming the
foundation for EnCana’s promising future.
Long-term Value Creation Extends Beyond the Bottom Line
At EnCana, we know that our long-term success is dependent
upon more than simply earning strong returns. Our long-term
value creation is founded in the principles established in our
Corporate Constitution. These principles guide all that we do –
how we work with landowners and other external stakeholders,
how we manage our environmental footprint, how we make
community investments, and how we strive to make EnCana
an employer of choice. Building and enhancing relationships
helps us earn the social license to operate, a key to sustaining
our financial success. In order to provide more comprehensive
information on EnCana’s corporate responsibility performance
and in response to increasing interest in how we operate,
Our overarching goal is clear
– building the net asset value
of every EnCana share.
6 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
we are expanding our corporate responsibility reporting by
publishing a stand-alone report, which will complement the
extensive corporate responsibility information we maintain 
on our website at encana.com. I invite you to read our new
Corporate Responsibility Report planned for publication in June.
Vision: Reliable, Accountable, Consistent
As always, our fundamental vision is rock solid: pursuit 
of industry leadership in capturing, developing and growing
natural gas and in-situ oilsands resource plays, unlocking and
delivering on our vast potential, growing the net asset value 
of every share, and reinforcing our reputation as reliable,
accountable and consistent in all regards. EnCana is building
upon all we have achieved to date, and continuing to create an
industry-leading company in which people have confidence.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to express my
appreciation to our employees who have put EnCana on 
a path that is well on the way to achieving this vision.
And of course, much of the creation and articulation of
all that EnCana is and promises to be has resulted from the
remarkable career of founding President & Chief Executive
Officer Gwyn Morgan. Let me simply join the other voices in
recognizing Gwyn’s extraordinary company-building efforts.
His inspirational vision, discipline, innovative competitiveness
and independent initiative are leadership hallmarks for the
energy business and beyond. On page 8 you will meet EnCana’s
new executive team, an experienced and talented team leading
EnCana in the continuation of the company’s tradition of
long-term value creation.
Randy Eresman
President & Chief Executive Officer
March 6, 2006
Note from EnCana’s founding 
Chief Executive Officer
Three decades ago, I joined one of EnCana’s two
founding companies and during the past four years
have had the privilege of serving as the company’s
founding CEO. On January 1, 2006, a natural executive
succession took place when Randy Eresman took office
as EnCana’s President & Chief Executive Officer.
Randy has worked at EnCana and one of its
predecessor companies – Alberta Energy Company 
– for the past 25 years, which includes the past decade
as a key member of our leadership team. He has 
been the architect of EnCana’s industry-leading 
position in North American natural gas and in-situ
oilsands resource plays. Throughout his career, he 
has demonstrated an extraordinary track record 
of value creation for shareholders.
In this my last year as an executive officer of EnCana, 
I want to acknowledge the contribution of two long-time
members of our executive team. John Watson and I
have worked together since we joined Alberta Energy at
start-up in 1975 and he retires as one of Canada’s most
distinguished chief financial officers. Drude Rimell retires
from Executive Vice-President, Corporate Services,
where her knowledge, dedication and wise counsel
were invaluable to me.
A key strength of EnCana is demonstrated by the fact
that each of us is handing over our leadership roles to
proven, capable people who have been very significant
contributors to our company. It is with great pride that I
express complete confidence that Randy and his team
will build upon EnCana’s clear competitive advantage,
highly ethical reputation and history of success.

Resource Play Advantage
30 years experience developing unconventional
reservoirs • unparalleled onshore North American
land position of 26 million net acres – including 
17 million net undeveloped • significant unbooked
resource potential.
EnCana’s Competitive Advantage
EnCana’s geographic focus is North America, which has among
the highest known concentrations of unconventional natural gas
and oilsands resources in the world. Compared to conventional
plays, these long-life reservoirs typically have lower than average
long-term decline rates and lower geological and commercial
development risk. EnCana’s people have the skills, expertise and
technology to maximize the value from its 26 million net acres
of North American onshore lands, 17 million of which are
undeveloped. EnCana has currently identified 37,000 future
drilling locations and more than 24 trillion cubic feet of gas
equivalent of unbooked resource potential. This is why EnCana
has the confidence to forecast continued profitable sales growth
averaging 10 percent per share per year.
Conventional versus Unconventional Thinking
EnCana’s geological focus is on resource plays. These are large
continuous accumulations of hydrocarbons that are capable 
of delivering profitable production for decades through the
application of advanced technology and large manufacturing-
like development programs that capture economies of scale. The
diagram to the right compares the potential of a conventional
gas reservoir to that of an unconventional reservoir. Original
assessment of recoverable reserves from conventional reservoirs
typically identifies the majority of the resource in place, with
very limited upside potential. These reservoirs are typically
produced over a five- to 10-year lifespan.
On the other hand, original assessments of unconventional 
gas reservoirs often show only a small percentage of what is
ultimately recoverable. Unconventional development involves
drilling numerous wells in a repeatable manner that captures
economies of scale. These reservoirs are produced over 30 years
or more. As a result, the company can take advantage of
operational efficiencies and new technologies, developed over
12 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
time, to reduce costs and increase recoveries. For example, at
EnCana’s Jonah resource play in Wyoming, the original estimate
of gas in place, completed in 2000, was about 200 billion 
cubic feet per square mile. Five years later, improvements in
technology and recovery methods have increased the estimate
of gas in place to be between 350 to 400 billion cubic feet per
square mile, almost double the original estimate. With this 
and similar experiences in its suite of resource plays, EnCana
has confidence that it will be able to grow reserves, production
and the net asset value of every share.

Defining Unbooked Resource Potential
EnCana defines unbooked resource potential (URP) as quantities
of oil and natural gas on existing landholdings that are not yet
classified as proved reserves, but which EnCana believes may be
moved into the proved reserves category and produced in the
future. EnCana employs a probability-weighted approach in the
calculation of these quantities, including statistical distributions
of resource play performance and areal extent. Consequently,
EnCana’s unbooked resource potential necessarily includes
quantities of probable and possible reserves and contingent
resources, as these terms are defined in the Canadian Oil and
Gas Evaluation Handbook.
The diagram to the right is an example of a resource play map
illustrating both proved reserves and URP. Resource plays
typically cover large contiguous tracts of land with similar
geological and reservoir characteristics. After identifying a
resource play, EnCana captures the lands it believes contain the
contiguous geological formations. Early in the development, a
multidisciplinary team evaluates the size of the play by drilling
wells at the outer edges of the play, and works to define its
economic limit.
Independent qualified reserves evaluators provide proved
reserves estimates at December 31 of each year in compliance
with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory
requirements and practices. Lands assigned proved reserves
appear in green on the diagram.
Drilling, well test and production performance results, coupled
with EnCana’s knowledge and experience often indicate that
additional resources exist beyond the lands assigned proved
reserves. These additional hydrocarbon resources, residing
within the tested boundaries of the play that meet the company’s
technical and economic criteria, are classified as URP – natural
gas and crude oil that the company’s engineers believe may 
be moved into proved reserves and produced in the future.
On the accompanying diagram, lands to which URP is
attributed are coloured grey. As EnCana develops 
the resource play, the play size often expands while acquired
knowledge and experience lead to improved operational
efficiencies and the potential to increase the URP estimates.

Resource plays cover large contiguous blocks of land
with an expectation of similar geology throughout.

Cash In Captures Value; Cash Out Creates Value
EnCana’s disciplined capital program manages four core
components: cash flow from operations, proceeds from
divestitures, drill-bit capital investment, and investments in
asset acquisitions. Over the past three years, EnCana’s cash 
in (cash flow from operations and proceeds from divestitures) 
has exceeded its cash out (drill bit capital investment and
investments in asset acquisitions). This resulted in a significant
surplus of about $5.2 billion – value that was largely returned 
to investors.

In 2005, the Board of Directors approved a 50 percent 
increase in EnCana’s quarterly dividend to 7.5 cents per share.
As well, EnCana purchased about 55.2 million of its shares 
for $1.9 billion. Since 2002, the company has purchased and
cancelled approximately 143 million shares, reducing shares
outstanding by 11 percent to approximately 855 million shares
at the end of 2005. Fewer shares outstanding means that each
share represents a greater piece of the company. In October 2005,
EnCana renewed its Normal Course Issuer Bid, allowing the
company to purchase an additional 10 percent of the public
float of its common shares.
EnCana returns value
directly to shareholders
through dividends 
and share purchases.
Unconventionally Focused in North America
Since inception in April 2002, EnCana has steadily transitioned
its asset base by selling conventional properties in North America
and several international basins, while strategically adding to 
an already strong base of unconventional properties in North
America. EnCana sold assets where it did not possess a strong
competitive advantage or the expertise in development, such 
as offshore oil properties in the North Sea and the Gulf of
Mexico. Instead it focused on acquiring properties where it
could bring its expertise and technology to bear. This included
the Tom Brown, Inc. acquisition in 2004, which expanded its
land base in the Piceance and East Texas basins. To the end 
of 2005, sales of non-core international and North American
conventional assets have generated more than $9.6 billion,
while $5.3 billion has been invested in companies and
properties that complement EnCana’s North American
unconventional focus. In 2005, the sharpened focus on the
unconventional continued with the addition of several key
assets, including approximately 330,000 total net acres in
the west Texas shales and approximately 220,000 total net 
acres in the multi-layered formations of central Alberta.
EnCana’s overall land position forms the platform from which
the company can continue to grow for years to come.

Shallow Gas – Setting the Standard
Discovered 30 years ago, the shallow gas field at Suffield typifies
the evolution of a resource play. When first assessed, Suffield’s
original gas in place was estimated at more than 1.5 trillion
cubic feet. After three decades of relatively steady growth,
production is only now hitting a plateau, with the field having
delivered more than 2 trillion cubic feet, well in excess of the
original estimate. EnCana has been able to profitably grow this
play by applying new technologies, such as fit-for-purpose
drilling rigs and more efficient fracturing and pipelining
techniques. These initiatives minimized costs and improved
field economics.

Barnett Shale play in north Texas,
EnCana is currently one of the
largest producers in the Fort Worth
Basin. This resource play is a great
example of how EnCana applies
technology to unlock the potential
of a complex reservoir. Through
improved reservoir knowledge,
EnCana has refined the application
of horizontal drilling and multi-
stage fracturing and has leveraged
these efficiencies across the
company’s drilling program.
2005 Highlights
• Grew land position in the play
to 205,000 net acres.
• Extended commercially proven
play area to Parker, Hood and
southern Johnson counties.

East Texas
Acquired in 2004, EnCana’s East
Texas play targets a combination of
tight gas, multi-zone plays, including
the Bossier, Deep Bossier and Cotton
Valley geological formations. The
gas is located at depths ranging 
from 10,000 feet to 25,000 feet

to 60,000 bbls/d by year-end 2006.
• Continue to improve technology
with a focus on reducing operating
costs and enhancing recovery.
Outlook
• Continue application of
technology. Waterflood and
polymer injection are expected 
to increase recovery rates 
to as high as 20% of original 
oil in place.
• Expect to reach project payout in
2006, triggering royalty increase
from 1% to 21% – project will
continue to deliver strong returns.

Foster Creek
Started in 2001, Foster Creek is the
industry’s first commercial in-situ
oilsands operation to use steam-
assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)
technology. The bitumen is produced
from the McMurray formation 
of the Athabasca oilsands, located 
in northeast Alberta. Foster Creek
represents the foundation for future
in-situ development. From Foster
Creek, Christina Lake and the
recently announced Borealis project,
EnCana is planning to expand
production to 500,000 bbls/d of
bitumen over the next 10 years.
Foster Creek is expected to produce
150,000 bbls/d of this total.
2005 Highlights
• Completed the first phase
of current expansion, adding
10,000 bbls/d of production.
• Exited 2005 producing
approximately 40,000 bbls/d.
• Drilled 39 horizontal well pairs.
• Improved technology and costs
10
Pelican Lake
At Pelican Lake, heavy oil is produced
from the Wabasca formation. This
development in northeast Alberta 
has operated for about 10 years.
The field is estimated to contain
about 1.2 billion barrels of original
oil in place.
2005 Highlights
• Waterflood continued to perform
well with recovery rates expected
to reach 12% of original oil 
in place.
• Continued polymer flood injection
pilot project, potentially extending
the play’s expected life.
• Grew proved reserves to
100 million barrels.

An Evolution in Corporate Responsibility Reporting
Corporate reporting in all its forms
is evolving because the company
recognizes that it is measured by
more than its financial success.
Previously, EnCana reported on corporate responsibility
primarily in the annual report and on its corporate website.
In order to provide a more comprehensive report on the
company’s corporate responsibility performance and in response
to stakeholder feedback, a stand-alone Corporate Responsibility
Report will be produced this year in addition to continued
coverage on the external website. EnCana believes this evolution
will provide easier access to information for external audiences,
and greater efficiency in communicating with its stakeholders.
The stand-alone report, which EnCana intends to publish 
in June 2006, will demonstrate how a strong commitment 
to corporate responsibility enables the company to address
challenges and achieve operational excellence.
Corporate Responsibility Management 
Through the Corporate Responsibility Policy adopted in 2003,
EnCana has committed to conducting its business ethically,
legally and in a manner that is fiscally, environmentally 
and socially responsible, while delivering sustainable value 
and strong financial performance. This commitment to
corporate responsibility applies to everything EnCana does,
and everywhere it operates. To ensure that EnCana lives 
up to its commitments, the Board of Directors established 
a committee in 2003 to oversee corporate responsibility issues.
EnCana goes beyond simply having a policy commitment 
to corporate responsibility by developing and implementing
management systems and associated programs that ensure its
performance continues to improve. Corporate responsibility 
is integrated into EnCana’s day-to-day operations – through 
a consistent approach to stakeholder engagement, a focus on
implementing best environmental, health and safety practices,
and fair treatment of employees and business partners.
Achieving Progress
In 2005, EnCana made progress on each of the corporate
responsibility objectives outlined in its 2004 annual report.
Highlights of this progress are outlined below, with further detail
provided in the upcoming Corporate Responsibility Report.
Engaging Stakeholders and Working with Local Communities
• A Stakeholder Engagement Guide and training module was
developed and introduced to key practitioners to facilitate 
a consistent approach to consultation and communication
with individuals and communities affected by or involved
with the company’s operations.
• In 2005, EnCana contributed more than C$20 million to 
the communities in which it operates by supporting local
economic development, investing in community facilities
and providing donations to important community projects.
• EnCana also continued to actively support competitive
Aboriginal businesses and partnerships in 2005, spending 
in excess of C$140 million on direct services, including
environmental, drilling, seismic and catering services.
24 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Building and enhancing relationships helps
EnCana earn the social licence to operate, 
a key to sustaining our financial success.
Environmental Stewardship
• In Wyoming, EnCana adopted a “hub and spoke” drilling
configuration that minimizes surface disturbances by more
than 30 percent.
• In northeast British Columbia, the company is using
wooden mats to protect sensitive muskeg environments
during drilling.
• At EnCana’s steam-assisted gravity drainage projects in
northeast Alberta, steam use is among the industry’s lowest.
Consequently, less energy is used to extract a barrel of oil.
• At Foster Creek, EnCana’s drilling waste management
system recycles drilling waste into useful products, while
reducing drilling and construction costs.
Enhancing Corporate Responsibility 
Reporting to Key Stakeholders
• EnCana has used the Global Reporting Initiative’s
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to help determine
which performance indicators to report. The company 
has engaged employees and investors, and considered
guidance from the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers to identify other indicators that are meaningful 
to its business and stakeholders. EnCana’s upcoming
Corporate Responsibility Report will provide information 
on a substantially expanded number of corporate
responsibility performance indicators, including:
Environmental
• Greenhouse gases 
• Air emissions 
• Flaring and venting 
• Energy and water use 
• Spills
Social 
• Employment creation and employee turnover 
• Injury rates 
• Adherence to the code of conduct
Economic 
• Financial performance
• Community investments
• Cost of goods, materials and services
• Payroll and benefits 
• Taxes

of the 2005 Corporate Responsibility Report, to be published 
in June, or email your request to requestcrreport@encana.com.
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   25
We are committed to
progressing and adapting
our governance practices 
to address an ever-changing
business environment.
David P. O’Brien 
Chairman of the Board
Despite the dynamic nature of 2005, EnCana’s commitment to
strong corporate governance remained steadfast. During times
of substantial change, your company’s experienced leadership
and sound corporate governance practices guided EnCana
effectively through transitional events.
Drude Rimell, Executive Vice-President, Corporate Services,
also retired last year. Her replacement, Hayward Walls, has been
leading our high-performance Information Services team since
EnCana’s inception in 2002. Drude will continue as an advisor
to the CEO and Executive Team through 2006.
Succession Planning
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring processes are
in place for succession planning of EnCana’s senior management,
including the appointment, training and monitoring of new
management for the continued success of the company. For
several years, the Board laid the groundwork for the appointment
in 2005 of three of the most senior roles in the company.
By the time Gwyn Morgan, the company’s President & Chief
Executive Officer, announced his retirement after 30 years of
company service, the Board had already invested several years
in succession planning to ensure the most appropriate and
capable leader assumed the CEO position. Randy Eresman,
EnCana’s Chief Operating Officer for three years and a 25-year
veteran of the company, took over the role with the confidence
of the Board, Executive Team and industry. As part of the
transition, Gwyn, in his capacity as Executive Vice-Chairman,
will be available as an advisor to the CEO.
Another valued member of EnCana’s Executive Team, John
Watson, Executive Vice-President & Chief Financial Officer,
announced his retirement effective February 28, 2006. John,
with 30 years of service, will be replaced by Brian Ferguson,
who has been with the company for 21 years most recently as
Executive Vice-President, Corporate Development. He is highly
competent and well known in the financial community. John
also remains with EnCana through 2006 in an advisory role.
The seamless appointment of internal candidates to three 
of the most senior EnCana positions demonstrates the Board’s
dedication to succession planning. The Board will continue 
to emphasize the importance of succession planning to 
ensure the continued success of the company. The Board 
has every confidence in the ability and dedication of these 
individuals in their new roles.
Integrity
EnCana prides itself on being a high-performance, principled
corporation. During 2005, the company implemented an
Integrity Hotline which provides a way in which stakeholders
can, confidentially or anonymously, report matters with respect
to how EnCana conducts its business. Quarterly Hotline
reporting is provided to the Board and the company plans 
to publish statistical information on Integrity Hotline activity 
in its first Corporate Responsibility Report due to be released
in June of 2006.
Director Compensation
Last year, EnCana continued to review and make changes 
to director compensation to more closely align director
compensation with shareholder returns. In 2005, EnCana
terminated the Directors’ Stock Option Plan (DSOP). As far
back as October 2003, EnCana discontinued DSOP grants. In
2002, EnCana implemented a Deferred Share Unit Plan (DSU)
for Directors, and as of April 2005 annual DSU grants were
26 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
reduced from 7,000 to 5,000 for each director. Deferred Share
Unit grants are not paid to a director until after retirement
from the Board, which further ties the value of long-term
incentives to total shareholder return.
Recognition
Canadian Business Magazine identifies the top 25 boards in
Canada and publishes an annual governance ranking. Out of
the top 25 companies identified – from a total of 228 companies
reviewed – EnCana was ranked 6th with a score of 95 out of a
possible 100, moving up five places from 11th last year. While
we are proud of this tribute, we recognize that high standards
of corporate governance are not static. We are committed to
progressing and adapting our governance practices to address
an ever-changing business environment.
Corporate Governance Compliance
EnCana continues to fully comply with the applicable corporate
governance requirements, including the best practice guidelines
published by the Canadian Securities Regulatory authorities, the
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and the rules
adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We are
also in compliance with all applicable New York Stock Exchange
requirements. We are committed to the high standards of
transparent reporting and accountability that these requirements
represent. Additional information about EnCana’s commitment
to corporate governance is contained in the company’s
Information Circular available at encana.com.
In Recognition
Putting things plainly, it is unlikely there would be an
EnCana today without the vision, character and tenacity
of Gwyn Morgan.
Gwyn would readily say he did not build EnCana alone, yet
he has been fundamental to its success. Thirty years, from
an inaugural engineer at Alberta Energy Company (AEC) 
to chief executive of Canada’s largest natural gas and oil
company, his career has been remarkable.
Gwyn conceived merging AEC and PanCanadian Energy
Corporation and drove it to conclusion. He then sharpened its
strategic focus, formulating unconventional thinking for energy
in North America.
At his core, Gwyn is characterized by his manifesto on ethics,
EnCana’s Corporate Constitution. Published in 2003, it sets
out the values foundation for employees and contractors to
work by, behaviours necessary to sustain a high-performance
and principled corporation.
Resilience and Confidence
I would like to thank Bill Fatt, who is not standing for re-election,
for his participation on the Board. Bill has served on the Board
for 11 years and has contributed greatly to the company’s
success. He served on the Audit Committee since the merger 
in 2002 and on several other committees in previous years.
I would also like to welcome Randy Eresman to the Board.
Randy’s extensive experience, leadership abilities, technical
expertise and long-term vision will serve him well in his role as
President & Chief Executive Officer and as a director of EnCana.
Many will remember 2005 as a year of significant change but
also as one marked by significant success. We have become 
a leading North American natural gas company focused on
unconventional reservoirs. We are in the process of divesting the
last of our major non-core conventional assets and we continue
to execute our resource play strategy in the disciplined pursuit
of increasing net asset value per share. Your company’s success
to date and its promise for the future are the product of your
continued shareholder support and the dedication, knowledge
and hard work of EnCana’s employees and Board of Directors.
On behalf of the Board of Directors,
David P. O’Brien
Chairman of the Board
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I thank Gwyn for his
years of leadership and service. I commend him for his
relentless pursuit of great achievements, his passion for
excellence, and his disciplined approach to execution.
And I salute him for his profound legacy – a successful
and growing company with sustainable values that guide
its success.
Gwyn Morgan looked beyond the ordinary and pursued
the extraordinary, with character and style. We wish him
and his family all the very best.
On behalf of the Board of Directors,
David P. O’Brien

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   29
Business Environment
NATURAL GAS
In 2005, prices increased with concern over North America’s
ability to grow gas supply despite high drilling levels. A warm
summer across North America and a cold December in the
U.S. Northeast increased demand for power and two successive
hurricanes damaged gas supply infrastructure in the U.S. Gulf
Coast. Combined with high oil prices these factors caused 
the NYMEX gas price to average $8.62/MMBtu in 2005,
a 40 percent increase from 2004.
Higher average AECO gas prices in 2005 compared with 2004
can be attributed to increased NYMEX prices partially offset by
increased AECO/NYMEX basis differentials in 2005 compared
to 2004.

CRUDE OIL
Global demand for oil is now pushing world refining capacity
limits, resulting in more frequent crude oil product price spikes
and historically high refining margins. An active hurricane
season resulted in substantial interruptions to U.S. Gulf Coast
production and refineries, which added to the world-wide
tightness in refining capacity. The hurricane damage to
production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico required the 
release of strategic reserves of crude oil in the United States
and Europe to prevent prices from increasing to even 
higher levels.

Year-over-year Canadian heavy oil differentials were 53 percent
wider in absolute dollar terms mainly due to the higher price
for West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”). The Bow River Blend
average sales price for 2005 was 65 percent of WTI, compared
to 69 percent of WTI in 2004, primarily due to very wide
differentials in the early part of 2005. Bitumen field prices are
normally at their weakest level each year in the fourth quarter
due to seasonal fluctuations in asphalt and condensate prices.
In December 2004 condensate prices were particularly high
and the differential between WTI and heavy oil prices was
wide, leading to very low field prices. In 2005, higher WTI and
lower condensate premiums considerably strengthened the
year-end field price.

30 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
U.S./CANADIAN DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES
The impacts of currency fluctuations on EnCana’s results
should be considered when analyzing the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The value of the Canadian dollar
increased by 7.4 percent or $0.057 to an average of US$0.825 
in 2005 from an average of US$0.768 in 2004 which was
approximately 7.3 percent or $0.052 higher than the 2003
average value. As a result, EnCana reported an additional 
$5.70 of costs for every hundred Canadian dollars spent 
on capital projects, operating expenses and administrative
expenses in 2005. However, revenues were relatively unaffected
by fluctuations in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate
because the commodity prices received by EnCana are largely
based in U.S. dollars or in Canadian dollars at prices which 
are closely tied to the value of the U.S. dollar.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
In keeping with EnCana’s North American resource play
strategy, the Company completed the following significant
divestitures in 2005:
• The sale of its natural gas liquids processing business on
December 13 for approximately $625 million subject to 
post-closing adjustments;
• The sale of certain non-core Canadian conventional oil and
gas assets on June 30 which were producing approximately
6,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOE/d”) for
approximately $321 million; and
• The sale of its Gulf of Mexico assets on May 26 for
approximately $2.1 billion in cash. The net proceeds were
approximately $1.5 billion after-tax and other adjustments.
These assets were in the development and appraisal stage
and accordingly there was no production.
Proceeds from these divestitures were directed primarily to 
a combination of debt reduction and the purchase of shares
under EnCana’s NCIB.

On November 21, 2005 EnCana announced that it had reached
an agreement to sell its 50 percent interest in the Chinook heavy
oil discovery offshore Brazil for approximately $350 million.
The sale is subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals
and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.
On September 13, 2005 EnCana announced that it had reached
an agreement in principle to sell all of its shares in subsidiaries
with oil and pipeline interests in Ecuador for approximately
$1.42 billion. The sale will have an effective date of July 1, 2005
and is subject to other closing conditions and regulatory
approvals. The sale, originally expected to close in 2005,
is now expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.
EnCana is in the process of divesting of its natural gas storage
business and expects to close the transaction in the second
quarter of 2006.
During 2005 EnCana spent approximately $420 million to
acquire undeveloped landholdings and minor amounts of
natural gas production in the Fort Worth and East Texas key
resource play areas in the United States.

of cash flow is disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
32 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
2005 vs 2004
EnCana’s total 2005 cash flow was $7,426 million, an increase
of $2,446 million or 49 percent from 2004. This increase
reflects higher commodity prices in 2005 partially reduced by
increased costs. EnCana’s discontinued operations contributed
$464 million to cash flow compared with $478 million in 2004.
EnCana’s 2005 cash flow from continuing operations was
$6,962 million, an increase of $2,460 million or 55 percent
from 2004.
The increase resulted from:
• Average North American natural gas prices, excluding
financial hedges, increased 36 percent to $7.46 per Mcf
in 2005 compared to $5.47 per Mcf for 2004;
• North American natural gas sales volumes increased
9 percent to 3,227 MMcf/d; and
• Average North American liquids prices, excluding financial
hedges, increased 26 percent to $36.17 per bbl in 2005
compared to $28.77 per bbl in 2004.
The increase in cash flow was partially reduced by:
• Operating expenses which increased 31 percent to
$1,438 million in 2005 compared with $1,099 million 
in 2004;
• Interest expense which increased $126 million to $524 million
in 2005. Almost all of this increase represents the cost to
redeem certain notes in 2005; and
2004 vs 2003
EnCana’s total 2004 cash flow was $4,980 million, an increase
of $521 million or 12 percent from 2003. This increase reflects
the net impact of higher prices and growth in sales volumes
reduced by realized financial hedge losses and increased costs.
EnCana’s discontinued operations contributed $478 million 
to cash flow compared with $357 million in 2003.
EnCana’s 2004 cash flow from continuing operations was 
$4,502 million, an increase of $400 million or 10 percent 
from 2003.
The increase resulted from:
• Average North American natural gas prices, excluding
financial hedges, increased 12 percent to $5.47 per Mcf
in 2004 compared to $4.87 per Mcf in 2003;
• North American natural gas sales volumes increased
16 percent to 2,968 MMcf/d; and
• Average North American liquids prices, excluding financial
hedges, increased 27 percent to $28.77 per bbl in 2004
compared to $22.72 per bbl in 2003.
The increase in cash flow was partially reduced by:
• Realized financial commodity hedge losses which increased
$234 million to $430 million after-tax in 2004 from 
$196 million after-tax in 2003;
• Operating expenses which increased 14 percent to
$1,099 million in 2004 compared with $965 million in 2003;
• The current tax provision, excluding income tax on the sale
of assets, increased $67 million to $626 million compared
with $559 million in 2004.
• Interest expense which increased $114 million to $398 million
in 2004 as a result of increased long-term debt primarily as
a result of the acquisition of Tom Brown, Inc. (“TBI”); and
Realized financial commodities hedge losses were $441 million
after-tax in 2005, relatively unchanged from $430 million after-
tax in 2004.
• The current income tax provision which increased
by $678 million to $559 million compared with a recovery
of $119 million in 2003.

EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   33
NET EARNINGS
2005 vs 2004
EnCana’s 2005 total net earnings were $3,426 million compared
with $3,513 million in 2004. Net earnings from discontinued
operations decreased $823 million to $597 million; most of this
decrease results from the 2005 after-tax gain of $370 million on
the sale of substantially all of EnCana’s natural gas processing
business being less than the 2004 after-tax gain on the sale 
of EnCana’s U.K. operations.
EnCana’s 2005 net earnings from continuing operations were
$2,829 million, an increase of $736 million or 35 percent
compared with 2004. In addition to the items affecting cash flow
as detailed previously, significant items affecting earnings were:
• An increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization
(“DD&A”) of $390 million as a result of the higher value 
of the Canadian dollar, higher DD&A rates and increased
sales volumes;
• Unrealized mark-to-market losses of $311 million after-tax
in 2005 compared with losses of $117 million in 2004; and
• A $92 million after-tax unrealized foreign exchange gain
on Canadian issued U.S. dollar debt in 2005 compared with
a $229 million gain in 2004.
2004 vs 2003
EnCana’s total 2004 net earnings were $3,513 million
compared with $2,360 million in 2003. Discontinued
operations contributed $1,420 million to net earnings 
in 2004, including an after-tax gain of $1,364 million 
on the sale of EnCana’s U.K. operations.
EnCana’s 2004 net earnings from continuing operations 
were $2,093 million, a decrease of $45 million or 2 percent
compared with 2003. In addition to the items affecting cash flow
as detailed previously, significant items affecting earnings were:
• An increase in DD&A of $412 million as a result of the
higher value of the Canadian dollar, higher DD&A rates 
and increased sales volumes;
• Unrealized mark-to-market losses of $117 million after-tax
in 2004, the first year when unrealized mark-to-market
amounts were recognized in net earnings;
• A $229 million after-tax unrealized foreign exchange gain
on Canadian issued U.S. dollar debt in 2004 compared 
with a $433 million after-tax gain in 2003; and
• Future tax recoveries due to a tax rate reduction of
$109 million in 2004 compared with $359 million in 2003.
OPERATING EARNINGS
Operating Earnings and Operating Earnings from Continuing
Operations are non-GAAP measures that adjust net earnings
and net earnings from continuing operations by non-operating
items that Management believes reduce the comparability
of the Company’s underlying financial performance between
periods. The following reconciliation of Operating Earnings
and Operating Earnings from Continuing Operations has 
been prepared to provide investors with information that 
is more comparable between years.

(1) The majority of the unrealized gains or losses that relate to U.S. dollar debt issued in Canada are for debt with maturity dates in excess of five years.
(2) Operating Earnings is a non-GAAP measure that shows net earnings excluding the after-tax gain or loss from the disposition of discontinued operations, the after-tax effects 
of unrealized mark-to-market accounting for derivative instruments, the after-tax gain or loss on translation of U.S. dollar denominated debt issued in Canada and the effect 
of the changes in statutory income tax rates.
(3) Operating Earnings from Continuing Operations is a non-GAAP measure that shows net earnings from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effects of unrealized
mark-to-market accounting for derivative instruments, the after-tax gain or loss on translation of U.S. dollar denominated debt issued in Canada and the effect of the changes 
in statutory income tax rates.
(4) Unrealized gains or losses have no impact on cash flow.

The increase in sales prices accounts for approximately 
82 percent of the increase in revenues, net of royalties,
in 2005 compared with 2004. The balance of the increase 
in revenues results from an increase in sales volumes.
The increase in produced gas volumes in the U.S. resulted 
from the Tom Brown, Inc. (“TBI”) acquisition in May 2004 
and drilling success at Jonah, Piceance, Fort Worth and 
East Texas.
The increase in produced gas volumes in Canada in 2005 was
mainly due to drilling success in the key resource plays of
Cutbank Ridge in northeast British Columbia and Shallow Gas
and Coalbed Methane (“CBM”) in central and southern Alberta.
Dispositions of mature conventional producing assets during the
first and third quarters of 2004 and natural production declines
reduced the impact of these increases on total volumes.
The dispositions of mature Canadian conventional producing
assets during the first and third quarters of 2004 and in 
June 2005 and natural production declines resulted in crude 
oil and NGLs volume reductions. These volume reductions
were mitigated by increased production from the Pelican Lake
heavy oil project.

Sales volumes from continuing operations increased in 2005 
by 5 percent or 197 MMcfe/d for the following reasons:
• Production from EnCana’s key resource plays increased
approximately 18 percent for natural gas and 15 percent 
for crude oil;
• Drilling success in the key resource gas plays of Cutbank
Ridge, Shallow Gas, CBM, Jonah, Piceance, Fort Worth 
and East Texas;
• Successful waterflood response at the Pelican Lake heavy
oil project;
• Greater Sierra volumes have decreased in 2005 compared 
to 2004 due to the timing and pace of development drilling
as well as delays in well tie-ins caused by weather issues 
in the earlier part of 2005; and
• Significant Canadian property dispositions in the first and
third quarters of 2004 and June 2005 were offset somewhat
by the full year impact of the TBI acquisition in May 2004.
As a result, the net impact of acquisition and disposition
activity in 2005 only reduced sales volumes by
approximately 11 MMcfe/d.

2005 vs 2004
EnCana’s realized natural gas prices for 2005 were $7.46 per Mcf,
an increase of 36 percent compared with 2004. North American
realized financial commodity hedging losses on natural gas 
for 2005 were approximately $377 million or $0.32 per Mcf
compared to losses of approximately $238 million or 
$0.22 per Mcf in 2004.
Natural gas per unit production and mineral taxes in the U.S.
increased $0.16 per Mcf or 25 percent in 2005 compared to
2004 as a result of higher natural gas prices.
Natural gas per unit transportation and selling costs for the
U.S. increased 48 percent or $0.15 per Mcf for 2005 compared
to 2004 primarily as a result of marketing TBI and Fort Worth
gas volumes downstream of the wellhead in 2005.
Canadian natural gas per unit operating expenses for 2005
were 29 percent or $0.15 per Mcf higher compared to 2004 
as a result of increased industry activity, the higher value of
the Canadian dollar, higher repairs and maintenance and long-
term compensation expenses. Natural gas per unit operating
expenses in the U.S. increased 43 percent or $0.16 per Mcf for
2005 compared to 2004 mainly as a result of increased staffing
levels attributable to growth, higher long-term compensation
expenses, increased industry activity and higher workovers.
2004 vs 2003
EnCana’s realized natural gas prices for 2004 were $5.47 per Mcf,
an increase of 12 percent compared with 2003. North American
realized financial commodity hedging losses on natural gas 
for 2004 were approximately $238 million or $0.22 per Mcf
compared to losses of approximately $91 million or $0.10 per
Mcf in 2003. Certain of the 2004 hedges were put in place to
secure the economics of the TBI acquisition and will expire 
in December 2006.
Natural gas per unit production and mineral taxes in the 
U.S. increased 38 percent or $0.18 per Mcf in 2004 due to 
a combination of higher gas prices and a higher effective 
tax rate on the significant production growth in Colorado.
Natural gas per unit transportation and selling costs for the
U.S. decreased 23 percent or $0.09 per Mcf in 2004 compared
to 2003 primarily as a result of the TBI acquisition where a
majority of the production was sold at the wellhead and did
not incur transportation charges.
Canadian natural gas per unit operating expenses for 2004
were 8 percent or $0.04 per Mcf higher compared to 2003
primarily due to the higher value of the Canadian dollar. The
increase in the U.S. natural gas per unit operating expenses of
32 percent or $0.09 per Mcf in 2004 compared to 2003 was a
result of higher operating costs at properties acquired as part
of the TBI acquisition, incremental operating costs associated
with waste water disposal in Colorado and other non-recurring
charges related to 2003.

2005 vs 2004
The increase in the average crude oil price in 2005, excluding
the impact of financial hedges, reflects the 37 percent increase
in the benchmark WTI in 2005. This increase was partially
offset by the increased WTI/Bow River crude oil price
differential (up approximately 53 percent). North American
realized financial commodity hedging losses on crude oil 
were approximately $295 million or $5.18 per bbl of liquids 
in 2005 compared to losses of approximately $431 million 
or $7.08 per bbl of liquids in 2004.
2004 vs 2003
The increase in the average crude oil price in 2004, excluding
the impact of financial hedges, reflects the 34 percent increase
in the benchmark WTI in 2004. This increase was partially
offset by the increased WTI/Bow River crude oil price
differential (up approximately 60 percent). North American
realized financial commodity hedging losses on crude oil 
were approximately $431 million or $7.08 per bbl of liquids 
in 2004 compared to losses of approximately $206 million 
or $3.41 per bbl of liquids in 2003.
Heavy oil sales in 2005 increased to 64 percent of total oil 
sales from 60 percent in 2004. This increase was mainly due 
to an increase in heavy oil production from the Pelican Lake
property combined with dispositions of non-core conventional
assets in 2004 and 2005 producing light/medium oil.
Heavy oil sales in 2004 decreased to 60 percent of total oil sales
from 62 percent in 2003. This decrease was mostly due to the
sale of Petrovera and other non-core conventional assets in
2004 reduced slightly by higher heavy oil production from
Foster Creek and Pelican Lake.
North American crude oil per unit production and mineral
taxes increased by 41 percent or $0.17 per bbl in 2005
compared to 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher prices.
The 2005 crude oil per unit transportation and selling expenses
in North America increased 13 percent or $0.14 per bbl mainly
due to the higher value of the Canadian dollar and increased
tariff rates as of July 2005.
North American crude oil per unit operating costs for 2005
increased 16 percent or $0.91 per bbl compared to 2004 
mainly due to the higher value of the Canadian dollar,
workovers, repairs and maintenance, fuel costs and long-term
compensation expenses. In addition, the increased proportion
of crude oil volumes from SAGD projects, which have higher
operating costs compared to EnCana’s other properties
increased the overall crude oil per unit operating costs.
North American crude oil per unit production and mineral
taxes in 2004 increased 356 percent or $0.32 per bbl compared
to 2003 primarily as a result of mineral tax amendments related
to prior years that were recorded in the third quarter of 2003.
In addition, there were higher prices and increased production
from southern Alberta and Saskatchewan properties which are
subject to the Alberta freehold mineral tax and Saskatchewan
resource tax.
The 2004 crude oil per unit transportation and selling expenses
in North America decreased 19 percent or $0.25 per bbl mainly
due to an adjustment in oil transportation rates.
North American crude oil per unit operating costs for 2004
decreased 5 percent or $0.27 per bbl from 2003 mainly due to
the sale of Petrovera, which had higher operating costs than
other properties. This reduction was partially offset by the
effect of the higher value of the Canadian dollar and higher
fuel gas costs for the SAGD projects.

The increase in NGLs realized prices in 2005 generally
correlates with strong WTI oil prices.
U.S. NGLs per unit production and mineral taxes for 2005
increased by 27 percent or $1.04 per bbl compared to 2004 
as a result of the increase in NGLs prices.

40 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
2005 vs 2004
Revenues and purchased product expenses increased in 2005
compared to 2004 as a result of increases in commodity prices
while third party optimization volumes remained relatively flat
year over year.
In December, EnCana and Valero Energy Corporation
completed their previously announced study of the conversion
of Valero’s Lima, Ohio refinery to refine Canadian heavy oil
and decided not to proceed with the project. During 2005,
EnCana expensed approximately $6 million of conversion
study expenses.
2004 vs 2003
Revenues and purchased product expenses increased 
in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of increases 
in commodity prices.
In 2004, a $35 million writedown in the values of EnCana’s
equity investment interest in the Trasandino Pipeline in
Argentina and Chile increased DD&A expenses.

EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   41
2005 vs 2004
DD&A includes provisions for corporate assets such as computer
equipment, office furniture and leasehold improvements.
Administrative expenses increased $71 million compared to
2004. The increase results from higher long-term compensation
expenses that are tied to EnCana’s common share price and the
change in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate. Administrative
costs in 2005 were $0.18 per Mcfe compared with $0.14 per Mcfe
in 2004.
Interest expense in 2005 increased as a result of a $121 million
($79 million after-tax) charge to retire certain medium term
notes. EnCana’s total long-term debt decreased by $1,154 million
to $6,776 million at December 31, 2005 compared with 
$7,930 million at December 31, 2004. EnCana’s 2005 weighted
average interest rate on outstanding debt was 5.3 percent, up
from an average of approximately 4.9 percent in 2004 as a
result of increased interest rates in the marketplace.
The foreign exchange gain of $24 million in 2005 includes 
$113 million ($92 million after-tax) resulting from the change
in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate applied to U.S. dollar
denominated debt issued from Canada. Under Canadian
GAAP, EnCana is required to translate long-term debt issued
from Canada and denominated in U.S. dollars into Canadian
dollars at the period-end exchange rate. Resulting unrealized
foreign exchange gains or losses are recorded in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Other foreign exchange
gains and losses result from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and the translation of EnCana’s monetary assets
and liabilities.
Income Tax
2005 vs 2004
The effective tax rate for 2005 was 30.8 percent compared with
23.2 percent in 2004. The 2005 income tax provision has been
reduced by the net benefit of tax basis retained on dispositions
of $68 million compared to $169 million in 2004. The 2004
effective tax rate included a reduction of $109 million in future
income taxes resulting from the reduction in the Alberta tax
rate from 12.5 percent to 11.5 percent.
Current tax expense was $1,204 million in 2005 compared to
$559 million in 2004; $578 million of this increase relates to
the sale of Gulf of Mexico assets and has been shown as cash
outflow from investing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.
The balance of $626 million has been included in cash flow.
2004 vs 2003
The increase in DD&A expense in 2004 is the result of higher
capital spending in prior periods on corporate capital items
and the impact of the change in the U.S./Canadian dollar
exchange rate.
Administrative expenses increased $24 million in 2004. The
increase results from the change in the U.S./Canadian dollar
exchange rate and increased long-term compensation expenses.
Administrative costs were $0.14 per Mcfe in 2004 compared 
to $0.13 per Mcfe in 2003.
The higher interest expense resulted primarily from the higher
average outstanding debt level during the year arising from the
TBI acquisition in the second quarter of 2004. EnCana’s weighted
average interest rate on outstanding debt was marginally lower
in 2004 than it was in 2003 which partially mitigated the effect
of increased debt.
The majority of the foreign exchange gain of $412 million 
in 2004 resulted from the change in the U.S./Canadian dollar
exchange rate in 2004 applied to U.S. dollar denominated debt
issued in Canada.
During 2004, EnCana recorded gains of $59 million on the sale
of certain corporate investments.
2004 vs 2003
The effective tax rate for 2004 was 23.2 percent compared 
to 14.1 percent for 2003.
In 2003, future income taxes were reduced by $359 million 
as a result of reductions in the Canadian federal and Alberta
corporate income tax rates and related changes to the
Canadian federal resource allowance deduction.
42 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
Further information regarding EnCana’s effective tax rate can
be found in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
EnCana’s effective rate in any year is a function of the
relationship between the amount of net earnings before
income taxes for the year and the magnitude of the items
representing “permanent differences” that are excluded from
the earnings which are subject to tax, either current or future.
There are a variety of items of this type, including:
• The effects of asset dispositions where the tax values 
of the assets sold differ from their accounting values;
• Adjustments for the impact of legislative tax changes which
have a prospective impact on future income tax obligations;
• The non-taxable half of Canadian capital gains or losses; and
• Items such as resource allowance and non-deductible
Crown payments where the income tax treatment is
different from the accounting treatment.
EnCana’s operations are complex and related tax
interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various
jurisdictions in which the Company and its subsidiaries
operate in are continually changing. As a result, there are
usually some tax matters under review. The Company 
believes that the provision for taxes is adequate.

UPSTREAM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
2005 vs 2004
Capital spending during 2005 was primarily focused on North
American resource play land capture, drilling programs and
facility expansion. Natural gas capital expenditures were focused
on continued development of the Company’s key resource plays
in Greater Sierra, Cutbank Ridge, Coalbed Methane and Shallow
Gas in Canada, and Piceance, Jonah, East Texas and Fort Worth
in the United States. Crude oil capital spending in 2005 was
concentrated on expansion of the Company’s SAGD projects
located at Foster Creek and Christina Lake, the waterflood
program at Pelican Lake in Alberta and Weyburn in
Saskatchewan. In addition, capital was directed at identifying
and developing new resource plays at Bighorn and Borealis.
The $1.9 billion increase in Upstream core capital expenditures
in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to:
• Canadian core capital expenditures increased approximately
$1.1 billion to $4.2 billion. This includes approximately
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   43
$219 million related to the change in the U.S./Canadian
dollar exchange rate as well as the following factors:
• Crown land sales and other land costs in 2005 were 
$281 million higher than the prior year mainly due 
to significantly higher land prices;
• Drilling and completion costs increased $731 million in
2005 due to service cost increases as a result of industry
activity levels;
• Facility costs increased $189 million in 2005 mainly due
to the Foster Creek expansion which was completed in
the fourth quarter of 2005;
• In Canada, the Company drilled 4,038 net wells in 2005
compared to 4,385 net wells in 2004. This decrease of
8 percent relates mainly to decreased drilling of shallow
gas wells in southern and west-central Alberta due to
weather related delays during the summer and service
sector shortages as a result of record levels of activity 
in the industry.
• U.S. core capital expenditures increased $0.7 billion in 2005
to $2.0 billion primarily due to increases in drilling and
completion costs. In the U.S. the Company drilled 617 net
wells in 2005 compared to 534 net wells in 2004, an increase
of 16 percent. Drilling was focused on continued development
of the four key resource plays of Jonah, Piceance, Fort Worth,
and East Texas.
2004 vs 2003
Capital spending during 2004 was primarily focused 
on North American resource play properties. Natural gas
capital expenditures were primarily focused on continued
development of the Company’s key resource plays in Greater
Sierra, Cutbank Ridge and Shallow Gas in Canada, and
Piceance, Jonah, East Texas and Fort Worth in the United
States. Crude oil capital spending in 2004 was concentrated 
at Foster Creek, Pelican Lake and Suffield in Alberta and
Weyburn in Saskatchewan.
The increase in Upstream capital expenditures in 2004
compared to 2003 reflects increased drilling and development
activities in the U.S. The impact of the increased average
U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate resulted in an increase 
to Canadian dollar denominated core capital expenditures 
of approximately $230 million.
EnCana drilled 4,923 net wells in 2004 compared 
to 5,581 net wells in 2003.
Canadian East Coast EnCana continues to examine the
economic viability of the Deep Panuke project. In 2005,
EnCana participated in one offshore exploration well at Grand
Pre and a sidetrack well in the Grand Pre licence in an attempt
to extend the northeast boundary of the Deep Panuke field.
Both wells were abandoned in January 2006. Negotiations
continue with the Government of Nova Scotia regarding the
terms of development for Deep Panuke.

resulted in the identification of a viable field. In November
2005 an agreement was reached to dispose of the Company’s
50 percent interest in the field for approximately $350 million.
In the October 2005 bid round, EnCana acquired a working
interest in two non-operated blocks, which were officially
awarded in January 2006. As of December 31, 2005 the
Company had invested approximately $106 million in Brazil.

Each year, EnCana engages independent qualified reserve
evaluators to prepare reports on 100 percent of the
Corporation’s oil and natural gas reserves. The Company has 
a Reserves Committee of independent board members which
reviews the qualifications and appointment of the independent
qualified reserve evaluators. The Committee also reviews the
procedure for providing information to the evaluators.
EnCana’s disclosure of reserves data is covered by NI 51-101 
as amended by a Mutual Reliance Review System Decision
Document dated December 16, 2003 permitting the adoption
of U.S. reporting standards, including compliance with the
practices and procedures of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) and Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) reserve reporting requirements. These
standards require that reserves be estimated employing the
single day field price of the commodity at the effective date 
of the valuation – in this case December 31, 2005.

Natural Gas
Crude Oil and NGLs
EnCana’s proved natural gas reserves as at December 31, 2005, on
an SEC constant price basis, totalled 11,784 Bcf. Approximately
213 percent of 2005 production was replaced by reserves
additions during 2005. Extensions and discoveries resulting from
successful exploration and development capital programs
amounted to 2,541 Bcf. Downward revisions of 58 Bcf were less
than 1 percent of natural gas reserves at the beginning of 2005.
In Canada, positive revisions of 202 Bcf (or 3.5 percent of the
opening balance) were largely associated with coalbed methane.
Downward revisions in the United States amounted to 260 Bcf
(or 5.6 percent of reserves at the beginning of 2005), the majority
of which were the result of reduced reserve estimates per well in
the southern Rockies. Acquisitions in the U.S. mid-continent
essentially offset divestitures of non-core properties in the Gulf
of Mexico and Canadian Plains.
The Company’s proved crude oil and natural gas liquids
reserves as at December 31, 2005, on an SEC constant price
basis, totalled 1,120.6 MMbbls. Reserve additions replaced over
400 percent of production. Extensions and discoveries resulting
from successful exploration and development capital programs
amounted to 167.2 MMbbls while revisions amounted to 
227.0 MMbbls. Foster Creek accounted for the majority of these
reserves additions. In addition, prices at December 31, 2005
allowed the reinstatement of 362.7 million barrels of bitumen
that were recorded as a downward revision at year-end 2004
due to anomalously low bitumen prices on December 31, 2004.
The sale of non core properties in the Gulf of Mexico and
Canadian Plains accounted for the majority of the 54.1 million
barrels of divestitures.

In accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles, DD&A expense for Ecuador has not been 
recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 
for discontinued operations.
On September 13, 2005 EnCana announced it had reached 
an agreement in principle to sell all its interests in Ecuador
operations for $1.42 billion which is approximately equivalent
to the asset’s net book value at July 1, 2005, the referenced
effective date of the transaction. All economic benefits
occurring after the July 1, 2005 effective date accrue to the
purchaser. A provision of $234 million has been recorded
against the net book value to recognize management’s best
estimate of the difference between the selling price and the
December 31, 2005 underlying accounting value of the related
investments at the sales date, as required under Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles.
Contingency information regarding certain disputed items with
the Ecuadorian government relating to value-added tax (“VAT”),
ownership of Block 15 and deductibility of interest is included

2005 vs 2004
Production volumes in 2005 averaged 72,916 bbls/d; down 
5 percent from 2004. Sales volumes in 2005 decreased 9 percent
to average 71,065 bbls/d due to declining production in Tarapoa
and Block 15 as well as the shift to an underlift position at
December 31, 2005 from an overlift position at the end of 2004.
Production and mineral taxes were $70 million higher in 2005
compared to 2004 as a result of higher realized prices on the
Tarapoa block sales volumes partially offset by lower Tarapoa
sales volumes. EnCana is required to pay a percentage of
revenue from this block to the Ecuador government based 
on realized prices over a base price.
2004 vs 2003
Production volumes for 2004 averaged 76,872 bbls/d;
up 50 percent from 2003. Sales volumes in 2004 increased 
68 percent to average 77,993 bbls/d. The higher sales volumes
are primarily due to the combination of available capacity on
the OCP pipeline in Ecuador, which commenced shipments 
in September 2003, and increased production from Block 15.
Production and mineral taxes were $36 million higher in 2004
compared to 2003 as a result of higher realized prices and sales
volumes from the Tarapoa block.

2005 vs 2004
On December 13, 2005 EnCana sold substantially all 
of its natural gas liquids processing business for proceeds of
approximately $625 million subject to post closing adjustments.
EnCana continues with plans to divest its natural gas storage
operations which include the AECO storage facility as well 
as storage facilities in the United States.
Net earnings in 2005 for the discontinued Midstream businesses
were $431 million, an increase of $313 million over 2004.
Included in 2005 net earnings is a $370 million gain on the sale
of the natural gas liquids processing business. 2005 net earnings
have been reduced by $30 million as a result of agreements
by WD Energy Services Inc., one of EnCana’s indirect
subsidiaries, to settle certain California and New York lawsuits,
as further described in this MD&A under the heading
“Contractual Obligations and Contingencies.”
2004 vs 2003
2004 net earnings of $118 million were $55 million lower 
than 2003.
In 2003 EnCana closed the previously announced sales of its
crude oil pipeline business resulting in a $169 million after-tax
gain on the sales.

Cash flow from continuing operations was $6,962 million, an
increase of $2,460 million from 2004. The increase in cash flow
in 2005 was primarily due to increased revenues driven by
higher commodity prices and sales volumes partially reduced
by increased expenses. Cash flow from continuing operations
comprises most of EnCana’s cash provided by operating activities.
Investing Activities
Net cash of $4,520 million was used for investing activities in
2005, an increase of $261 million compared to 2004. Capital
expenditures, including property acquisitions, increased 
$2,162 million in 2005. This increase occurred as a result of:
• The increased value of the Canadian dollar;
• Increased Crown land purchase prices and other land costs;
• Higher drilling and completion costs;
• Increased facility costs as a result of the Foster Creek
expansion; and
• Entrega Pipeline construction costs.
EnCana’s 2004 activities included the $2,335 million TBI
acquisition. EnCana did not undertake any business
combinations in 2005.
EnCana’s divestments of the Gulf of Mexico assets, certain
mature conventional properties and the natural gas liquids
processing facilities generated $3.1 billion less tax of $578 million
in 2005. In 2004, EnCana’s divestments of the U.K. operations,
certain mature conventional properties, Petrovera Resources
and its interest in the Alberta Ethane Gathering System
generated proceeds of $3.6 billion.

The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number 
of Common Shares, an unlimited number of First Preferred
Shares and an unlimited number of Second Preferred Shares.
There were no Preferred Shares outstanding.
EnCana’s shareholders approved a split of the Company’s
outstanding Common Shares on a two-for-one basis at its
Annual and Special Meeting held on April 27, 2005. Each
shareholder received one additional Common Share for each
Common Share held on the record date of May 12, 2005.
Employees and directors have been granted options to purchase
Common Shares under various plans. On October 26, 2005
EnCana terminated the directors stock option plan. At
December 31, 2005, 20.7 million options, without Tandem
Share Appreciation Rights attached, were outstanding 
of which 16.8 million are exercisable.
Long-term incentives granted to EnCana employees include 
a reduced level of stock option grants that is supplemented 
by grants of Performance Share Units (“PSUs”). PSUs will 
not result in the issue of new Common Shares by the Company.
Shares purchased for the PSUs plan are held in a Trust for
future vesting. Stock options granted in 2004 and 2005 have 
an associated Tandem Share Appreciation Right (“TSAR”) 
and employees may elect to exercise either the stock option 
or the associated TSAR. TSAR exercises will result in either
cash payments by the Company or issuance of Common Shares
based upon the employee’s choice at the time of exercise.
EnCana has obtained regulatory approval under Canadian
securities laws to purchase Common Shares under four
consecutive NCIBs which commenced in October 2002 and 
may continue until October 30, 2006. Between October 2002
and December 31, 2005 EnCana has purchased 142.8 million
shares for cancellation under these Bids for a total cost of
$3,796 million. EnCana is entitled to purchase for cancellation
up to approximately 85.6 million Common Shares under 
the renewed NCIB which commenced on October 31, 2005 
and will terminate not later than October 30, 2006. As of
January 31, 2006 EnCana has purchased 6.8 million shares
under this NCIB. Under the prior NCIB which commenced
October 29, 2004 and expired October 28, 2005, EnCana
purchased approximately 84.2 million Common Shares.
Shareholders may obtain a copy of the NCIB documents
without charge at www.sedar.com or by contacting
investor.relations@encana.com.
EnCana pays quarterly dividends to shareholders at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. These dividends totaled
$238 million in 2005, $183 million in 2004 and $139 million 
in 2003. These dividends are funded by cash flow. At 
December 31, 2005 the quarterly dividend paid to shareholders
was $0.075 per Common Share (2004: $0.050; 2003: C$0.050).

agreements, capital commitments and marketing agreements.
Included in EnCana’s total long-term debt commitments 
of $6,712 million at December 31, 2005 are $1,425 million 
in commitments related to Banker’s Acceptances and
Commercial Paper. These amounts are fully supported and
management expects that they will continue to be supported
by revolving credit and term loan facilities that have no
repayment requirements within the next year. Further 
details regarding EnCana’s long-term debt are described 
in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
As at December 31, 2005, EnCana remained a party to long-
term, fixed price, physical contracts with a current delivery 
of approximately 48 MMcf/d with varying terms and volumes
through 2017. The total volume to be delivered within the
terms of these contracts is 149 Bcf at a weighted average price
of $3.85 per Mcf. At December 31, 2005, these transactions 
had an unrealized loss of $464 million.
Contingency information regarding certain disputed items
with the Ecuadorian government relating to VAT, ownership 
of Block 15 and deductibility of interest is included in Note 4
to EnCana’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
EnCana does not have any off-balance sheet financing
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have an
effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
Leases
As a normal course of business, EnCana leases office 
space for personnel who support field operations and 
for corporate purposes.
Legal Proceedings
EnCana is involved in various legal claims associated with the
normal course of operations and believes it has made adequate
provision for such legal claims.
Discontinued Merchant Energy Operations
California
As disclosed previously, in July 2003, the Company’s indirect
wholly owned U.S. marketing subsidiary, WD Energy Services
Inc. (“WD”), concluded a settlement with the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) of a previously disclosed
CFTC investigation whereby WD agreed to pay a civil monetary
penalty in the amount of $20 million without admitting 
or denying the findings in the CFTC’s order.
EnCana Corporation and WD are defendants in a lawsuit filed
by E. & J. Gallo Winery in the United States District Court in
California, further described below. The Gallo lawsuit claims
damages in excess of $30 million. California law allows for the
possibility that the amount of damages assessed could be tripled.
Along with other energy companies, EnCana Corporation and
WD are defendants in several other lawsuits relating to sales of
natural gas in California from 1999 to 2002 (some of which are
class actions and some of which are brought by individual parties
on their own behalf). As is customary, these lawsuits do not
specify the precise amount of damages claimed. The Gallo and
other California lawsuits contain allegations that the defendants
engaged in a conspiracy with unnamed competitors in the
natural gas and derivatives market in California in violation 
of U.S. and California anti-trust and unfair competition laws.
In all but one of the class actions in the United States 
District Court and in the Gallo action, decisions dealing 
with the issue of whether the scope of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission’s exclusive jurisdiction over natural
gas prices precludes the plaintiffs from maintaining their
claims are on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit.
Without admitting any liability in the lawsuits, in November
2005, WD has agreed to pay $20.5 million to settle the class
action lawsuits that were consolidated in San Diego Superior
Court subject to final documentation and approval by the 
San Diego Superior Court. The individual parties who had
brought their own actions are not parties to this settlement.
New York
WD is also a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit
filed in the United States District Court in New York. The
consolidated New York lawsuit claims that the defendants’
alleged manipulation of natural gas price indices affected
natural gas futures and option contracts traded on the NYMEX
from 2000 to 2002. EnCana Corporation was dismissed from
the New York lawsuit, leaving WD and several other companies
unrelated to EnCana Corporation as the remaining defendants.
Without admitting any liability in the lawsuit, WD has agreed
to pay a maximum of $9.1 million to settle the New York class
action lawsuit subject to final documentation and approval 
by the New York District Court.
Based on the aforementioned settlements, during the fourth
quarter of 2005 a total of $30 million has been recorded in
Administrative expenses in Net Earnings from Discontinued
Operations. EnCana Corporation and WD intend to vigorously
defend against the remaining outstanding claims; however, the
Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or
any future proceedings against the Company, whether these
proceedings would lead to monetary damages which could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, or whether there will be other proceedings arising 
out of these allegations.

Accounting Policies and Estimates
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
No changes in accounting principles were adopted in 2005.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Management is assessing the following new and revised
accounting pronouncements that have been issued and 
are not yet effective:
• In the quarter ending March 31, 2006 EnCana will adopt
Section 3831 “Non-Monetary Transactions” issued by the
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) 
in June 2005. Under the new standard, a commercial
substance test replaces the culmination of earnings test 
as the criteria for fair value measurement. In addition, fair
value measurement is clarified. The Company does not
expect application of this new standard to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements.
• In the year ending December 31, 2007 EnCana will be
required to adopt Section 1530 “Comprehensive Income”,
Section 3251 “Equity”, Section 3855 “Financial Instruments –
Recognition and Measurement” and Section 3865 “Hedges”
issued by the CICA in January 2005. Under the new
standards: a new financial statement, Comprehensive 
Income has been introduced that will provide for certain
gains and losses, including foreign currency translation
adjustment and other amounts arising from changes in 
fair value to be temporarily recorded outside the income
statement. In addition, all financial instruments, including
derivatives are to be included on EnCana’s balance sheet 
and measured at fair values in most cases. Requirements 
for hedge accounting have been further clarified. Although
the Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of
these standards, it does not expect the Financial Instruments 
and Hedges standards to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements as it currently uses mark-
to-market accounting for derivative instruments that 
do not qualify or are not designated as hedges.
• Over the next five years the CICA will adopt its new
strategic plan for the direction of accounting standards 
in Canada ratified in January 2006. As part of that plan,
accounting standards in Canada for public companies will
converge with International Financial Report Standards
(“IFRS”) over the next five years. EnCana continues to
monitor and assess the impact of the planned convergence
of Canadian GAAP with IFRS.
Management is required to make judgments, assumptions and
estimates in the application of generally accepted accounting
principles that have a significant impact on the financial 
results of the Company. A summary of EnCana’s significant
accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The following discussion outlines the
accounting policies and practices involving the use of estimates
that are critical to determining EnCana’s financial results.
Full Cost Accounting
EnCana follows the CICA guideline on full cost accounting in the
oil and gas industry to account for oil and gas properties. Under
this method, all costs directly associated with the acquisition 
of, exploration for, and development of natural gas and crude
oil reserves are capitalized on a country-by-country cost centre
basis and costs associated with production are expensed. The
capitalized costs are depreciated, depleted and amortized using
the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved
reserves. Reserve estimates can have a significant impact on
earnings, as they are a key component in the calculation of
DD&A. A downward revision in a reserve estimate could result in
a higher DD&A charge to earnings. In addition, if net capitalized
costs are determined to be in excess of the calculated ceiling,
which is based largely on reserve estimates (see asset impairment
discussion below), the excess must be written off as an expense
charged against earnings. In the event of a property disposition,
proceeds are normally deducted from the full cost pool without
recognition of a gain or loss unless there is a change in the
DD&A rate of 20 percent or greater.
Oil and Gas Reserves
All of EnCana’s oil and gas reserves are evaluated and reported
on by independent qualified reserve evaluators. The estimation
of reserves is a subjective process. Forecasts are based on
engineering data, projected future rates of production,
estimated commodity price forecasts and the timing of future
expenditures, all of which are subject to numerous uncertainties
and various interpretations. Reserve estimates can be revised
upward or downward based on the results of future drilling,
testing, production levels and economics of recovery based 
on cash flow forecasts.
Asset Impairments
Under full cost accounting, a ceiling test is performed to ensure
that unamortized capitalized costs in each cost centre do not
exceed their fair value. An impairment loss is recognized in net
earnings when the carrying amount of a cost centre is not
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   53
recoverable and the carrying amount of the cost centre exceeds
its fair value. The carrying amount of the cost centre is not
recoverable if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows from proved reserves. If the sum of
the cash flows is less than the carrying amount, the impairment
loss is limited to an amount by which the carrying amount
exceeds the sum of:
i) the fair value of proved and probable reserves; and
ii) the costs of unproved properties that have been subject
to a separate impairment test.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations is
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when identified
and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Asset
retirement obligations include those legal obligations where 
the Company will be required to retire tangible long-lived assets
such as producing well sites, offshore production platforms 
and natural gas processing plants. These obligations also include
items for which the Company has made promissory estoppel.
The asset retirement cost, equal to the initially estimated fair
value of the asset retirement obligation, is capitalized as part 
of the cost of the related long-lived asset. Increases in the asset
retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time are
recorded as accretion of asset retirement obligation in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Amounts recorded for
asset retirement obligations are based on estimates of reserves
and on retirement costs which will not be incurred for several
years. Actual payments to settle the obligations may differ 
from estimated amounts.
Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over
fair value of net assets acquired in the merger with Alberta
Energy Company and the acquisition of TBI, is assessed by
EnCana for impairment at least annually. Goodwill was
allocated to the business segments at the time of the above
transactions based on their respective book values compared 
to fair values. If it is determined that the fair value of the assets
and liabilities of the business segment is less than the book
value of the business segment at the time of assessment, an
impairment amount is determined by deducting the fair value
from the book value and applying it against the book balance
of goodwill. The offset is charged to the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings as additional DD&A.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used by EnCana to
manage its exposure to market risks relating to commodity
prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Company’s policy is to not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes.
The Company enters into financial transactions to help reduce
its exposure to price fluctuations with respect to a portion of its
oil and gas production to help achieve returns on new projects,
targeted returns on new investments and steady funding of
growth projects or to mitigate market price risk associated 
with cash flows expected to be generated from budgeted capital
programs. These transactions generally are swaps, collars or
options and are generally entered into with major financial
institutions or commodities trading institutions.
EnCana may also use derivative financial instruments such as
interest rate swap agreements to manage the fixed and floating
interest rate mix of its total debt portfolio and related overall
cost of borrowing. The interest rate swap agreements involve
the periodic exchange of payments, without the exchange of
the normal principal amount upon which the payments are
based, and are recorded as an adjustment of interest expense
on the hedged debt instrument.
EnCana may enter into hedges of its foreign currency
exposures on foreign currency denominated long-term debt 
by entering into offsetting forward exchange contracts. Foreign
exchange translation gains and losses on these instruments 
are accrued under other current, or non-current, assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and recognized in foreign
exchange in the period to which they relate, offsetting the
respective translation losses and gains recognized on the
underlying foreign currency long-term debt. Premiums or
discounts on these forward instruments are amortized as an
adjustment of interest expense over the term of the contract.
EnCana also purchases foreign exchange forward contracts 
to hedge anticipated sales to customers in the United States.
Foreign exchange translation gains and losses on these
instruments are recognized as an adjustment of the revenues
when the sale is recorded.
Derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges, or are not
designated as hedges, are recorded using the mark-to-market
method of accounting whereby instruments are recorded in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability with
changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. Realized gains
or losses from financial derivatives are recognized in natural
54 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
gas and crude oil revenues as the related production occurs.
Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in revenues at the
end of each respective reporting period. The estimate of fair
value of all derivative instruments is based on quoted market
prices or, in their absence, third party market indicators. In
2004 and 2005, the Company elected not to designate any 
of its current price risk management activities as accounting
hedges and accordingly, accounts for all derivatives using 
the mark-to-market accounting method.
Pensions and Other Post Retirement Benefits
EnCana accrues for its obligations under its employee benefit
plans and the related costs, net of plan assets.
The cost of pensions and other retirement benefits is
actuarially determined using the projected benefit method
based on length of service, and reflects Management’s best
estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary
escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected future
health care costs. The expected return on plan assets is based
on the fair value of those assets. The obligation is discounted
using a market interest rate at the beginning of the year on
high quality corporate debt instruments.
Risk Management
Pension expense includes the cost of pension benefits earned
during the current year, the interest cost on pension obligations,
the expected return on pension plan assets, the amortization of
the net transitional obligation, the amortization of adjustments
arising from pension plan amendments and the amortization
of the excess of the net actuarial gain or loss over 10 percent 
of the greater of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan
assets. The amortization period covers the expected average
remaining service lives of employees covered by the plans.
Pension expense for the defined contribution pension plans is
recorded as the benefits are earned by the employees covered
by the plan.
Pension costs are a component of compensation costs.
Performance Share Units (“PSUs”)
The PSU plans provide for a range of payouts, based on
EnCana’s performance relative to certain peers.
EnCana expenses the cost of PSUs based on expected payouts,
however, the amounts to be paid, if any, may vary from the
current estimate.
EnCana’s results are affected by:
• financial risks (including commodity price, foreign
exchange, interest rate and credit risks)
• operational risks
• environmental, health, safety and security risks
• reputational risks

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   55
EnCana partially mitigates its exposure to financial risks
through the use of various financial instruments and physical
contracts. The use of derivative instruments is governed under
formal policies and is subject to limits established by the Board
of Directors. As a means of mitigating exposure to commodity
price risk, the Company has entered into various financial
instrument agreements. EnCana does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative purposes. The details 
of these instruments, including any unrealized gains or losses,
as of December 31, 2005, are disclosed in Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
EnCana has in place policies and procedures with respect 
to the required documentation and approvals for the use 
of derivative financial instruments and specifically ties their
use, in the case of commodities, to the mitigation of price risk
associated with cash flows expected to be generated from
budgeted capital programs and in other cases to the mitigation
of price risks for specific assets and obligations.
With respect to transactions involving proprietary production
or assets, the financial instruments generally used by EnCana
are swaps, collars or options which are entered into with major
financial institutions, integrated energy companies or
commodities trading institutions.
COMMODITY PRICE
To partially mitigate the natural gas commodity price risk, the
Company entered into swaps which fix the AECO and NYMEX
prices and collars and put options which fix the range of AECO
and NYMEX prices. To help protect against widening natural
gas price differentials in various production areas, EnCana 
has entered into swaps to fix the AECO and Rockies price
differential from the NYMEX price. Physical contracts relating
to these activities had an unrecognized gain of $71 million.
EnCana has also entered into contracts to purchase and sell
natural gas as part of its daily ongoing operations of the
Company’s proprietary production management. Physical
contracts associated with this activity had an unrecognized
gain of $70 million.
For crude oil price risk, the Company has partially mitigated 
its exposure to the WTI NYMEX price for a portion of its oil
production with fixed price swaps, purchased call options 
to allow participation at higher WTI levels, three-way put
spreads and put options.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
As a means of mitigating the exposure to fluctuations in the
U.S. to Canadian exchange rate, EnCana may enter into foreign
exchange contracts. The Company also enters into foreign
exchange contracts in conjunction with crude oil marketing
transactions. Gains or losses on these contracts are recognized
when the difference between the average month spot rate and
the rate on the date of settlement is determined.
EnCana also maintains a mix of both U.S. dollar and Canadian
dollar debt which helps to offset the exposure to the fluctuations
in the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate. In addition to direct
issuance of U.S. dollar denominated debt, the Company has
entered into cross currency swaps on a portion of its debt 
as a means of managing the U.S./Canadian dollar debt mix.
INTEREST RATES
The Company partially mitigates its exposure to interest rate
changes by maintaining a mix of both fixed and floating rate
debt. EnCana has entered into interest rate swap transactions
from time to time as a means of managing the fixed/floating
rate debt portfolio mix.
CREDIT RISK
EnCana is exposed to credit related losses in the event of
default by counterparties. This credit exposure is mitigated
through the use of Board-approved credit policies governing
the Company’s credit portfolio and with credit practices 
that limit transactions to counterparties of investment grade
credit quality and transactions that are fully collateralized.
A substantial portion of EnCana’s accounts receivable 
is with customers in the oil and gas industry.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
EnCana mitigates operational risk through a number of policies
and processes. As part of the capital approval process, the
Company’s projects are evaluated on a fully risked basis,
including geological risk and engineering risk. In addition, the
asset teams undertake a process called Lookback and Learning.
In this process, each asset team undertakes a thorough review 
of their previous capital program to identify key learnings, which
often includes operational issues that positively and negatively
impacted the project’s results. Mitigation plans are developed for
the operational issues which had a negative impact on results.
These mitigation plans are then incorporated into the current
year plan for the project. On an annual basis, these Lookback
results are analyzed for EnCana’s capital program with the
results and identified learnings shared across the Company.
56 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
Projects include a Business Risk Burden that is intended 
to account for the unforeseen risks. The amount of Business 
Risk Burden that is used on a particular project depends 
on the project’s history of Lookback results and the type 
of expenditure. A peer review process is used to ensure that
capital projects are appropriately risked and that knowledge 
is shared across the Company. Peer reviews are undertaken
primarily for exploration projects and early stage resource
plays, although they may occur for any type of project.
EnCana also partially mitigates operational risks by
maintaining a comprehensive insurance program.
ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, SAFETY AND SECURITY RISKS
These risks are managed by executing policies and standards that
are designed to comply with or exceed government regulations
and industry standards. In addition, EnCana maintains a system
that identifies, assesses and controls safety and environmental
risk and requires regular reporting to senior management 
and the Board of Directors. The Corporate Responsibility,
Environment, Health & Safety Committee of EnCana’s Board 
of Directors recommends approval of environmental policy 
and oversees compliance with government laws and regulations.
Monitoring and reporting programs for environmental, health
and safety performance in day-to-day operations, as well 
as inspections and assessments, are designed to provide
assurance that environmental and regulatory standards are
met. Contingency plans are in place for a timely response 
to an environmental event and remediation/reclamation
strategies are utilized to restore the environment.
Security risks are managed through a Security Program
designed to protect EnCana’s personnel and assets. EnCana has
established an Investigations Committee with the mandate to
address potential violations of Company policies and practices
and an Integrity Hotline that can be used to raise any concerns
regarding EnCana’s operations.
Climate Change
The Kyoto protocol, ratified by the Canadian Federal Government
in December 2002, came into force on February 16, 2005.
The protocol commits Canada to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions to 6 percent below 1990 levels over the period 
2008 – 2012. There is currently no clear direction post 2012.
The previous Federal Government released a framework
outlining its Climate Change action plan on April 13, 2005.
The plan as released contains few technical details regarding
the implementation of the Government’s greenhouse gas
reduction strategy.
Prior to the recent change in the Federal Government, the
implementation of the Climate Change plan had yet to be
finalized, therefore EnCana is unable to predict the total
impact of the potential regulations upon its business. However,
a July 16, 2005 Canada Gazette notice partially addressed 
the uncertainty associated with a greenhouse gas regulation 
for existing facilities by providing the oil and gas sector with
limits on cost (a price assurance mechanism of $15/tonne 
for compliance) and emission reductions targets that will 
not exceed 12 percent lower than business as usual levels 
of total covered emissions for a given sector. It also made 
a commitment to targets based on the “best technology
economically achievable” for new facilities. Based on 
these commitments and EnCana’s activity on geological
sequestration of CO2, we do not anticipate that the cost
implications of government climate change plans will have 
a material impact on operations or future growth plans.
The ultimate impact of Canada’s implementation plan,
however, remains subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
including the outcome of discussions between the recently
elected Federal Government, provincial governments, the
resulting legislation, the emission reduction target obligations
among economic sectors, and other administrative details.
The Climate Change Working Group of the Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers will continue to work with
the Federal and Alberta Governments to develop an approach
for implementing targets and enabling greenhouse gas control
legislation which protects the industry’s competitiveness, limits
the cost and administrative burden of compliance and supports
continued investment in the sector.
EnCana is committed to transparency with its stakeholders 
and will keep them apprised of how these issues affect
operations. Additional detail on EnCana’s greenhouse gas
emissions will be available in the Corporate Responsibility
Report that will be published in the second quarter of 2006.
The Report will be available on www.encana.com.
REPUTATIONAL RISKS
EnCana takes a pro-active approach to the identification and
management of issues that affect the Company’s reputation
and has established consistent and clear procedures, guidelines
and responsibility for identifying and managing these issues.
Issues affecting or with the potential to affect EnCana’s
reputation are generally either emerging issues that can be
identified early and then managed or unforeseen issues that
arise unexpectedly and must be managed on an urgent basis.

Natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2005 were higher
than the same period in 2004. A cold December in the U.S.
Northeast combined with continued supply losses from
hurricane damage and high crude oil prices caused NYMEX
gas prices to remain high through the fourth quarter.
The WTI crude oil price was 24 percent higher in the fourth
quarter of 2005 than the same period in 2004. An active
hurricane season resulted in substantial interruptions to the U.S.
Gulf Coast production and refineries. The hurricane damage
prompted the United States and Europe to release emergency
supplies into the market, which prevented prices from increasing
to even higher levels. Fourth quarter Canadian heavy oil
differentials were wider in dollar terms relative to the fourth
quarter of 2004, primarily due to the higher price for WTI.
EnCana’s net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2005 were
$2,366 million, down $214 million from 2004. Net earnings
from discontinued operations decreased $1,028 million to 
$497 million; most of this decrease results from the 2005 after-
tax gain on the sale of substantially all of EnCana’s natural gas
processing business being less than the 2004 after-tax gain on
the sale of EnCana’s U.K. operations.
EnCana’s net earnings from continuing operations in the
fourth quarter of 2005 increased $814 million or 77 percent 
to $1,869 million compared with the same period in 2004.
The increase resulted from:
• Average North American natural gas prices, excluding
financial hedges, increased 69 percent to $10.29 per Mcf,
compared to $6.08 per Mcf in 2004;
• Average North American liquids prices, excluding financial
hedges, increased 23 percent to $37.16 per bbl in 2005
compared to $30.20 in 2004;
• Natural gas sales volumes increased 8 percent from the
comparable period in 2004 to 3,326 MMcf/d; and
• Unrealized financial commodity hedging gains of $661 million
after-tax in 2005 compared with $411 million after-tax in 2004.
58 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
The increase in net earnings from continuing operations was
reduced by:
• Realized financial commodity hedging losses of $229 million
after-tax compared with $145 million after-tax in 2004;
• Operating expenses increased 46 percent to $452 million 
in 2005 compared with $309 million in 2004. The increase
in the average U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate in 2005,
increased workovers, repairs and maintenance, higher
electrical costs and rising costs as a result of increased industry
activity were significant reasons for this increase; and
• A $21 million after-tax foreign exchange loss on Canadian
issued U.S. dollar debt in 2005 compared to a $131 million
after-tax unrealized foreign exchange gain in 2004; this reflects
the quarter-end decrease in the value of the Canadian 
dollar in 2005 compared to a quarter-end increase in the 
same period in 2004.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, EnCana:
• Sold substantially all of the natural gas liquids processing
business on December 13, 2005 for proceeds of approximately
$625 million subject to post-closing adjustments;
• Announced an agreement on November 21, 2005 to sell 
the 50 percent interest in the Chinook heavy oil discovery
offshore Brazil for approximately $350 million;
• Repaid long-term debt of $145 million; and
• Received regulatory approval to renew its Normal
Course Issuer Bid. EnCana did not purchase any shares 
to December 31, 2005 under this renewed Bid.

Outlook
EnCana plans to continue to focus principally on growing
natural gas production from unconventional resource plays 
in North America.
EnCana will also continue to develop its high quality in-situ
oilsands resources and will continue to evaluate marketing
options that will help expand their development.
Volatility in crude oil prices is expected to continue throughout
2006 as a result of market uncertainties over supply and
refining disruptions on the U.S. Gulf Coast, continued demand
growth in China, OPEC actions, demand destruction from high
energy prices and the overall state of the world economies.
Natural gas prices are primarily driven by North American
supply and demand, with weather being the key factor in the
short term. North American conventional gas supply has
peaked in the past two years and EnCana believes that
unconventional resource plays can offset conventional gas
production declines. The industry’s ability to respond to the
gas supply constrained situation in North America remains
challenged by land access and regulatory issues.
The Company expects its 2006 core capital investment
program to be funded from cash flow.
Proceeds from the sales of non-core properties are expected 
to be used to reduce debt and for purchases under the
Company’s NCIB program.
EnCana’s results are affected by external market factors,
such as fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas,
as well as movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

Advisories
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
In the interest of providing EnCana shareholders and potential
investors with information regarding the Company and its
subsidiaries, including management’s assessment of EnCana’s and
its subsidiaries’ future plans and operations, certain statements
contained in this Annual Report constitute forward-looking
statements or information (collectively referred to herein as

projections relating to the volatility of crude oil prices in 2006
and beyond and the reasons therefor; the Company’s projected
capital investment levels for 2006 and the source of funding
therefor; the effect of the Company’s risk management program,
including the impact of derivative financial instruments; the
Company’s execution of share purchases under its Normal
Course Issuer Bid; the Company’s defence of lawsuits; the
impact of the Kyoto Accord on operating costs; the adequacy 
of the Company’s provision for taxes; the impact of changes 
in accounting principles on future consolidated financial
statements; the Company’s plans to divest of its natural gas
storage business and Ecuador operations, and projections
relating to the use of proceeds therefrom, including debt
repayment and purchases under its Normal Course Issuer Bid.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-
looking statements, as there can be no assurance that the plans,
intentions or expectations upon which they are based will occur.
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous
assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties, both
general and specific, that contribute to the possibility that the
predictions, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking
statements will not occur, which may cause the Company’s
actual performance and financial results in future periods to
differ materially from any estimates or projections of future
performance or results expressed or implied by such forward-
looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include,
among other things: volatility of and assumptions regarding 
oil and gas prices; assumptions based upon EnCana’s current
guidance; fluctuations in currency and interest rates; product
supply and demand; market competition; risks inherent in the
Company’s and its subsidiaries’ marketing operations, including
credit risks; imprecision of reserve estimates and estimates 
of recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and liquids from
resource plays and other sources not currently classified as
60 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (prepared in US$)
proved; the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to replace
and expand oil and gas reserves; risks associated with technology;
the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations to meet its current and future obligations; the
Company’s ability to access external sources of debt and 
equity capital; the timing and the costs of well and pipeline
construction; the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to secure
adequate product transportation; changes in environmental and
other regulations or the interpretations of such regulations;
political and economic conditions in the countries in which the
Company and its subsidiaries operate, including Ecuador; the risk
of international war, hostilities, civil insurrection and instability
affecting countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries
operate and terrorist threats; risks associated with existing and
potential future lawsuits and regulatory actions made against the
Company and its subsidiaries; and other risks and uncertainties
described from time to time in the reports and filings made with
securities regulatory authorities by EnCana. Statements relating
to “reserves” or “resources” or “resource potential” are deemed 
to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied
assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions that the
resources and reserves described exist in the quantities predicted
or estimated, and can be profitably produced in the future.
Although EnCana believes that the expectations represented 
by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can
be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of important
factors is not exhaustive. Furthermore, the forward-looking
statements contained in this Annual Report are made as of the
date of this Annual Report, and EnCana does not undertake
any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the
included forward-looking statements, whether as a result 
of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-
looking statements contained in this Annual Report are
expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.
OIL AND GAS INFORMATION
EnCana’s disclosure of reserves data and other oil and gas
information is made in reliance on an exemption granted to
EnCana by Canadian securities regulatory authorities which
permits it to provide such disclosure in accordance with U.S.
disclosure requirements. The information provided by EnCana
may differ from the corresponding information prepared in
accordance with Canadian disclosure standards under National
Instrument 51-101 (“NI 51-101”). The reserves quantities
disclosed by EnCana represent net proved reserves calculated
using the standards contained in Regulation S-X of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Further information about
the differences between the U.S. requirements and the NI 51-101
requirements is set forth under the heading “Note Regarding
Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information” in EnCana’s
Annual Information Form.
Crude Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Conversions
In this Annual Report, certain crude oil and natural gas liquids
(“NGLs”) volumes have been converted to millions of cubic 
feet equivalent (“MMcfe”) or thousands of cubic feet equivalent
(“Mcfe”) on the basis of one barrel (“bbl”) to six thousand
cubic feet (“Mcf”). Also, certain natural gas volumes have been
converted to barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”), thousands of BOE
(“MBOE”) or millions of BOE (“MMBOE”) on the same basis.
MMcfe, Mcfe, BOE, MBOE and MMBOE may be misleading,
particularly if used in isolation. A conversion ratio of one bbl
to six Mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion
method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not
necessarily represent value equivalency at the wellhead.
Resource Play, Estimated Ultimate Recovery, Unbooked
Resource Potential, Total Resource Portfolio and Total
Resource Life
EnCana uses the terms resource play, estimated ultimate recovery,
unbooked resource potential, total resource portfolio and total
resource life. Resource play is a term used by EnCana to describe
an accumulation of hydrocarbons known to exist over a large
areal expanse and/or thick vertical section, which when compared
to a conventional play, typically has a lower geological and/or
commercial development risk and lower average decline rate.
As used by EnCana, estimated ultimate recovery (“EUR”) has
the meaning set out jointly by the Society of Petroleum Engineers
and World Petroleum Congress in the year 2000, being those
quantities of petroleum which are estimated, on a given date,
to be potentially recoverable from an accumulation, plus 
those quantities already produced therefrom. EnCana defines
unbooked resource potential as quantities of oil and gas on
existing landholdings that are not yet classified as proved reserves,
but which EnCana believes may be moved into the proved
reserves category and produced in the future. EnCana employs 
a probability-weighted approach in the calculation of these
quantities, including statistical distributions of resource play
performance and areal extent. Consequently, EnCana’s unbooked
resource potential necessarily includes quantities of probable
and possible reserves and contingent resources, as these terms
are defined in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook.

CURRENCY AND NON-GAAP MEASURES
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
All information included in this Annual Report and 
the Consolidated Financial Statements and comparative
information is shown on a U.S. dollar, after-royalties basis
unless otherwise noted. Sales forecasts reflect the mid-point 
of current public guidance on an after royalties basis. Current
Corporate Guidance assumes a U.S. dollar exchange rate 
of $0.85 for every Canadian dollar.
Non-GAAP Measures
Certain measures in this Annual Report do not have any
standardized meaning as prescribed by Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles (“Canadian GAAP”) such as Cash
Flow from Continuing Operations, Cash Flow, Cash Flow per
share-diluted, Operating Earnings and Operating Earnings per
share-diluted, Operating Earnings from Continuing Operations
and EBITDA and therefore are considered non-GAAP measures.
Therefore, these measures may not be comparable to similar
measures presented by other issuers. These measures have been
described and presented in this Annual Report in order to
provide shareholders and potential investors with additional
information regarding the Company’s liquidity and its ability
to generate funds to finance its operations. Management’s use
of these measures has been disclosed further in this Annual
Report as these measures are discussed and presented.
Further information regarding EnCana Corporation 
can be accessed under the Company’s public filings found 
at www.sedar.com and on the Company’s website at

DIFFERENCES IN ENCANA’S CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE PRACTICES COMPARED TO NYSE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STANDARDS
As a Canadian company listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”), EnCana is not required to comply with most of
the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards and instead may
comply with Canadian Corporate Governance Practices.
EnCana is, however, required to disclose the significant
differences between its corporate governance practices and 
the requirements applicable to U.S. companies listed on the
NYSE under NYSE corporate governance standards. A summary
of these significant differences is available on EnCana’s website
(www.encana.com). Except as described in this summary,
EnCana is in compliance with the NYSE corporate governance
standards in all significant respects.

Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   67
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Prepared using Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
All amounts in US$ millions, unless otherwise indicated.
For the year ended December 31, 2005
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
In these Consolidated Financial Statements, unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States (U.S.)
dollars. EnCana has adopted the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency since most of its revenue is closely tied to the U.S. dollar and
to facilitate a more direct comparison to other North American upstream exploration and development companies. All references 
to US$ or to $ are to United States dollars and references to C$ are to Canadian dollars.
EnCana is in the business of exploration for, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids, as well 
as natural gas storage, natural gas liquids processing and power generation operations.
A) Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of EnCana Corporation and its subsidiaries (“EnCana” or the
“Company”), and are presented in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. Information prepared 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States is included in Note 19.
Investments in jointly controlled partnerships and unincorporated joint ventures carry on EnCana’s exploration and production
business and are accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method, whereby EnCana’s proportionate share of revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities are included in the accounts.
Investments in companies and partnerships in which EnCana does not have direct or joint control over the strategic operating,
investing and financing decisions, but does have significant influence on them, are accounted for using the equity method.
B) Foreign Currency Translation
The accounts of self-sustaining operations are translated using the current rate method, whereby assets and liabilities are translated
at period-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated using average rates over the period. Translation gains and
losses relating to the self-sustaining operations are included as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities of the Company that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into its functional currency
at the rates of exchange in effect at the period end date. Any gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
C) Measurement Uncertainty
The timely preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles requires that Management make estimates and assumptions and use judgment regarding the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events 
as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future
confirming events occur.
68 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
Amounts recorded for depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset retirement costs and obligations and amounts used for ceiling
test and impairment calculations are based on estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves and future costs required to develop those
reserves. By their nature, these estimates of reserves, including the estimates of future prices and costs, and the related future cash flows
are subject to measurement uncertainty, and the impact in the consolidated financial statements of future periods could be material.
The values of pension assets and obligations and the amount of pension costs charged to net earnings depend on certain actuarial
and economic assumptions which by their nature are subject to measurement uncertainty.
The amount of compensation expense accrued for long-term performance based compensation arrangements are subject to
Management’s best estimate of whether or not the performance criteria will be met and what the ultimate payout will be.
D) Revenue Recognition
Revenues associated with the sales of EnCana’s natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) are recognized when title
passes from the Company to its customer. Natural gas and crude oil produced and sold by EnCana below or above its working
interest share in the related resource properties results in production underliftings or overliftings. Underliftings are recorded as
inventory and overliftings are recorded as deferred revenue. Realized gains and losses from the Company’s commodity price risk
management activities are recorded in revenue when the product is sold.
Market optimization revenues and purchased product are recorded on a gross basis when EnCana takes title to product and has
risks and rewards of ownership. Revenues associated with the services provided where EnCana acts as agent are recorded as the
services are provided. Revenues associated with the sale of natural gas storage services are recognized when the services are
provided. Sales of electric power are recognized when power is provided to the customer.
Unrealized gains and losses from the Company’s commodity price risk management activities are recorded as revenue based on the
related mark-to-market calculations at the end of the respective period.
E) Production and Mineral Taxes
Costs paid by EnCana to non-mineral interest owners based on production of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs are recognized when
the product is produced.
F) Transportation and Selling Costs
Costs paid by EnCana for the transportation and selling of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs are recognized when the product is
delivered and the services provided.
G) Employee Benefit Plans
EnCana accrues for its obligations under its employee benefit plans and the related costs, net of plan assets.
The cost of pensions and other retirement and post-employment benefits is actuarially determined using the projected benefit
method based on length of service, and reflects Management’s best estimate of expected plan investment performance, salary
escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected future health care costs. The expected return on plan assets is based on the fair
value of those assets. The obligation is discounted using a market interest rate at the beginning of the year on high quality corporate
debt instruments.
Pension expense for the defined benefit pension plan includes the cost of pension benefits earned during the current year, the
interest cost on pension obligations, the expected return on pension plan assets, the amortization of the net transitional obligation,
the amortization of adjustments arising from pension plan amendments and the amortization of the excess of the net actuarial gain
or loss over 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The amortization period covers the
expected average remaining service lives of employees covered by the plans.
Pension expense for the defined contribution pension plans is recorded as the benefits are earned by the employees covered by the plans.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   69
H) Income Taxes
EnCana follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, future income taxes are recorded for the
effect of any difference between the accounting and income tax basis of an asset or liability, using the substantively enacted income
tax rates. Accumulated future income tax balances are adjusted to reflect changes in income tax rates that are substantively enacted
with the adjustment being recognized in earnings in the period that the change occurs. Investment tax credits are recorded as an
offset to the related expenditures.
I) Earnings Per Share Amounts
Basic net earnings per common share is computed by dividing the net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential dilution that
would occur if stock options without tandem share appreciation rights attached were exercised or other contracts to issue common
shares were exercised or converted to common shares. The treasury stock method is used to determine the dilutive effect of stock
options without tandem share appreciation rights attached and other dilutive instruments. The treasury stock method assumes that
proceeds received from the exercise of in-the-money stock options without tandem share appreciation rights attached are used to
repurchase common shares at the average market price.
J) Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments, such as money market deposits or similar type instruments, with 
a maturity of three months or less when purchased.
K) Inventories
Product inventories are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Materials and
supplies are valued at cost.
L) Property, Plant and Equipment
Upstream
EnCana accounts for natural gas and crude oil properties in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants’
guideline on full cost accounting in the oil and gas industry. Under this method, all costs, including internal costs and asset
retirement costs, directly associated with the acquisition of, exploration for and the development of, natural gas and crude oil
reserves, are capitalized on a country-by-country cost centre basis.
Costs accumulated within each cost centre are depreciated, depleted and amortized using the unit-of-production method based on
estimated proved reserves determined using estimated future prices and costs. For purposes of this calculation, oil is converted to
gas on an energy equivalent basis. Capitalized costs subject to depletion include estimated future costs to be incurred in developing
proved reserves. Proceeds from the disposal of properties are normally deducted from the full cost pool without recognition of gain
or loss unless that deduction would result in a change to the rate of depreciation, depletion and amortization of 20 percent or greater
in which case a gain or loss is recorded. Costs of major development projects and costs of acquiring and evaluating significant
unproved properties are excluded, on a cost centre basis, from costs subject to depletion until it is determined whether or not proved
reserves are attributable to the properties, or impairment has occurred. Costs that have been impaired are included in the costs
subject to depreciation, depletion and amortization.
An impairment loss is recognized in net earnings when the carrying amount of a cost centre is not recoverable and the carrying
amount of the cost centre exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the cost centre is not recoverable if the carrying amount
exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows from proved reserves. If the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying amount,
the impairment loss is limited to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the sum of:
the fair value of proved and probable reserves; and
i.
ii. the costs of unproved properties that have been subject to a separate impairment test.
70 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
Midstream and Market Optimization
Midstream facilities, including natural gas storage facilities, natural gas liquids extraction plant facilities and power generation
facilities, are carried at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the assets, which range from
20 to 25 years. Capital assets related to pipelines are carried at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method
over their economic lives, which range from 20 to 35 years.
Corporate
Costs associated with office furniture, fixtures, leasehold improvements, information technology and aircraft are carried at cost and
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 25 years. Land is carried at cost.
M) Capitalization of Costs
Expenditures related to renewals or betterments that improve the productive capacity or extend the life of an asset are capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Interest is capitalized during the construction phase of large capital projects.
N) Amortization of Other Assets
Amortization of deferred items included in Investments and Other Assets is provided for, where applicable, on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
O) Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired, is assessed for impairment at least
annually. Goodwill and all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to business levels, within the Company’s segments, referred
to as reporting units. To assess impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of
the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, then a second test is performed to determine
the amount of the impairment. The amount of the impairment is determined by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit’s
assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and comparing that
amount to the book value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Any excess of the book value of goodwill over the implied fair value 
of goodwill is the impairment amount.
P) Asset Retirement Obligation
The fair value of estimated asset retirement obligations is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when identified and 
a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Asset retirement obligations include those legal obligations where the Company
will be required to retire tangible long-lived assets such as producing well sites, offshore production platforms and natural gas
processing plants. These obligations also include items for which the Company has made promissory estoppel. The asset retirement
cost, equal to the initially estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation, is capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-
lived asset. Changes in the estimated obligation resulting from revisions to estimated timing or amount of undiscounted cash flows
are recognized as a change in the asset retirement obligation and the related asset retirement cost.
Asset retirement costs for natural gas and crude oil assets are amortized using the unit-of-production method. Amortization of asset
retirement costs are included in depreciation, depletion and amortization in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Increases 
in the asset retirement obligation resulting from the passage of time are recorded as accretion of asset retirement obligation in the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
Actual expenditures incurred are charged against the accumulated obligation.
Q) Stock-based Compensation
EnCana records compensation expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements for stock options that do not have tandem share
appreciation rights attached to them granted to employees and directors using the fair value method. Fair values are determined
using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period.
Obligations for payments, cash or common shares, under the Company’s share appreciation rights, options with tandem share
appreciation rights, deferred share units and performance share units plans are accrued as compensation expense over the vesting period.
Fluctuations in the price of EnCana’s common shares change the accrued compensation expense and are recognized when they occur.

EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   71
R) Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges, or are not designated as hedges, are recorded using the mark-to-market
method of accounting whereby instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability with
changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. Realized gains or losses from financial derivatives related to commodity prices are
recognized in natural gas and crude oil revenues as the related sales occur. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in revenues at
the end of each respective reporting period. The estimated fair value of all derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices
or, in their absence, third party market indications and forecasts.
Derivative financial instruments are used by EnCana to manage economic exposure to market risks relating to commodity prices,
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company’s policy is not to utilize derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
EnCana has in place policies and procedures with respect to the required documentation and approvals for the use of derivative
financial instruments and specifically ties their use, in the case of commodities, to the mitigation of market price risk associated with
cash flows expected to be generated from budgeted capital programs, and in other cases to the mitigation of market price risks for
specific assets and obligations. When applicable, the Company identifies relationships between financial instruments and anticipated
transactions, as well as its risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the economic hedge transaction. Where specific
financial instruments are executed, the Company assesses, both at the time of purchase and on an ongoing basis, whether the financial
instrument used in the particular transaction is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the transaction.
S) Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has assessed new and revised accounting pronouncements that have been issued that are not yet effective and
determined that the following may have a significant impact on the Company:
• Beginning with the year ending December 31, 2007 the Company will be required to adopt the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants (“CICA”) Section 1530 “Comprehensive Income”, Section 3251 “Equity”, Section 3855 “Financial Instruments –
Recognition and Measurement”, and Section 3865 “Hedges”, which were issued in January 2005. Under the new standards a new
financial statement, Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, has been introduced that will provide for certain
gains and losses, including foreign currency translation adjustment and other amounts arising from changes in fair value to be
temporarily recorded outside the income statement. In addition, all financial instruments, including derivatives are to be included
in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and measured, in most cases, at fair values, and requirements for hedge accounting
have been further clarified. Although EnCana is in the process of evaluating the impact of these standards, the Company does not
expect the Financial Instruments and Hedges standards to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements as
EnCana currently uses mark-to-market accounting for derivative instruments that do not qualify or are not designated as hedges.
• Beginning with the first quarter of 2006, the Company will adopt CICA Section 3831 “Non-Monetary Transactions”. Under the
new standard, a commercial substance test replaces the culmination of earnings test as the criteria for fair value measurement. In
addition, fair value measurement is clarified. EnCana does not expect application of this new standard to have a material impact
on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
• For the next five years CICA will adopt its new strategic plan for the direction of accounting standards in Canada, which
was ratified in January 2006. As part of that plan, accounting standards in Canada for public companies will converge with
International Financial Report Standards (“IFRS”) over the next five years. The Company continues to monitor and assess 
the impact of convergence of Canadian GAAP with IFRS.
T) Reclassification
Certain information provided for prior years has been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in 2005.

The Company has defined its continuing operations into the following segments:
• Upstream includes the Company’s exploration for, and development and production of, natural gas, crude oil and natural gas
liquids and other related activities. The majority of the Company’s Upstream operations are located in Canada and the United
States. Frontier and international new venture exploration is mainly focused on opportunities in Chad, Brazil, the Middle East 
and Greenland.
• Market Optimization is conducted by the Midstream & Marketing division. The Marketing groups’ primary responsibility
is the sale of the Company’s proprietary production. The results are included in the Upstream segment. Correspondingly, the
Marketing groups’ also undertake market optimization activities which comprise third party purchases and sales of product 
that provide operational flexibility for transportation commitments, product type, delivery points and customer diversification.
These activities are reflected in the Market Optimization segment.
• Corporate includes unrealized gains or losses recorded on derivative instruments. Once amounts are settled, the realized gains
and losses are recorded in the operating segment to which the derivative instrument relates.
Market Optimization purchases substantially all of the Company’s North American Upstream production for sale to third party
customers. Transactions between business segments are based on market values and eliminated on consolidation. The tables in this
note present financial information on an after eliminations basis.
Operations that have been discontinued are disclosed in Note 4.

On December 17, 2004, EnCana acquired certain natural gas and crude oil properties in Texas for approximately $251 million. The
purchase was facilitated by an unrelated party, Brown Ranger LLC, which held the assets in trust for the Company. Pursuant to the
agreement with Brown Ranger LLC, EnCana operated the properties, received all the revenue and paid all of the expenses associated
with the properties. EnCana determined that the relationship with Brown Ranger LLC represented an interest in a variable interest
entity (“VIE”) and that EnCana was the primary beneficiary of the VIE. EnCana consolidated Brown Ranger LLC from the date of
acquisition to the date the properties were transferred to EnCana in 2005.

(2004 – $1,747 million; 2003 – $1,484 million).
Major Customers
In connection with the marketing and sale of EnCana’s own and purchased natural gas and crude oil, for the year ended 
December 31, 2005, the Company had one customer (2004 – one) which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of its
consolidated revenues, net of royalties. Sales to this customer, a major international integrated energy company with a high quality
investment grade credit rating, were approximately $2,056 million (2004 – $1,709 million).
4. Discontinued Operations
2005
Midstream
On December 13, 2005 EnCana completed the sale of its Midstream natural gas liquids processing operations for total proceeds 
of $625 million (C$720 million). The natural gas liquids processing operations included various interests in a number of processing
and related facilities as well as a marketing entity. A gain on sale of approximately $370 million, after-tax, was recorded.
During the fourth quarter of 2005, EnCana decided to divest of its natural gas storage operations. EnCana’s natural gas storage
operations include the 100 percent interest in the AECO storage facility as well as facilities in the United States.
2004
Upstream
On December 1, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its 100 percent interest in EnCana (U.K.) Limited for net cash consideration
of approximately $2.1 billion. EnCana’s U.K. operations included crude oil and natural gas interests in the U.K. central North Sea
including the Buzzard, Scott and Telford oilfields, as well as other satellite discoveries and exploration licenses. A gain on sale 
of approximately $1.4 billion was recorded.
At December 31, 2004, EnCana decided to divest of its Ecuador operations and such operations have been accounted for as discontinued
operations. On September 13, 2005, EnCana announced it had reached an agreement in principle to sell all its interest in its Ecuador
properties for $1.42 billion, which is approximately equivalent to the asset’s net book value at July 1, 2005, the referenced effective
date of the transaction.
Included in net earnings for the year is a provision of $234 million which has been recorded against the net book value to recognize
management’s best estimate of the difference between the selling price and the December 31, 2005 underlying accounting value 
of the related investments, as required under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.
76 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
EnCana’s Ecuador operations include the 100 percent working interest in the Tarapoa Block, majority operating interest in Blocks
14, 17 and Shiripuno, the non-operated economic interest in relation to Block 15 and the 36.3 percent indirect equity investment in
Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados (OCP) Ltd. (“OCP”), which is the owner of a crude oil pipeline in Ecuador that ships crude oil from
the producing areas of Ecuador to an export marine terminal. The Company is a shipper on the OCP Pipeline and pays commercial
rates for tariffs. The majority of the Company’s crude oil produced in Ecuador is sold to a single marketing company. Payments are
secured by letters of credit from a major financial institution which has a high quality investment grade credit rating.
2003
Upstream
In 2003, in two separate transactions, the Company completed the sale of its 13.75 percent working interest and a gross overriding
royalty in the Syncrude Joint Venture (“Syncrude”) for net cash consideration of $999 million.
Midstream
In January 2003, EnCana closed the previously announced sales of its crude oil pipeline business resulting in an after-tax gain 
on sale of $169 million.

In Ecuador, a subsidiary of EnCana has a 40 percent non-operated economic interest in relation to Block 15 pursuant to a contract
with a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. In its 2004 filings with Securities regulatory authorities, Occidental
Petroleum Corporation indicated that its subsidiary had received formal notification from Petroecuador, the state oil company of
Ecuador, initiating proceedings to determine if the subsidiary had violated the Hydrocarbons Law and its Participation Contract for
Block 15 with Petroecuador and whether such violations constitute grounds for terminating the Participation Contract.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   79
In its filings, Occidental Petroleum Corporation indicated that it believes that it has complied with all material obligations under the
Participation Contract and that any termination of the Participation Contract by Ecuador based upon these stated allegations would
be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation under international treaties. The subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum
Corporation has delivered, to the Government of Ecuador, its written defense to the allegations. Upon review the Government of
Ecuador may decide whether there are grounds for termination of the Participation Contract.
In addition to the above, the Company is proceeding with its arbitration related to value-added tax (“VAT”) owed to subsidiaries 
of EnCana ($169 million at December 31, 2005; 2004 – $139 million). EnCana is also in discussions related to certain income tax
matters related to the deductibility of interest expense and foreign currency losses in Ecuador.

The costs excluded from depletable costs in Other Countries represents costs related to unproved properties incurred in cost centres
that are considered to be in the pre-production stage. Currently, there are no proved reserves in these cost centres. All costs, net of
any associated revenues, in these cost centres have been capitalized. Ultimate recoverability of these costs will be dependent upon
the finding of proved oil and natural gas reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company completed its impairment
review of pre-production cost centres and determined that $7 million of costs should be charged to the Consolidated Statement 
of Earnings (2004 – $23 million; 2003 – $85 million).

At December 31, 2005, EnCana Corporation had in place a revolving credit facility for $4.5 billion Canadian dollars or its
equivalent amount in U.S. dollars ($3.9 billion). The facility is fully revolving for a period of five years from the date of the
agreement, October 2005. The facility is extendible from time to time, but not more than once per year, for a period not longer 
than five years from the extension date, at the option of the lenders and upon notice from EnCana. The facility is unsecured 
and bears interest at the lenders’ rates for Canadian prime, U.S. base rate, Bankers’ Acceptances rates plus applicable margins,
or at LIBOR plus applicable margins.
At December 31, 2005, one of EnCana’s subsidiaries had in place a credit facility totaling $600 million. The facility is guaranteed 
by EnCana Corporation and fully revolving for five years from the date of the Agreement, December, 2005. The facility is extendible
from time to time, but not more than once per year, for a period not longer than five years from the extension date, at the option 
of the lenders and upon notice from the subsidiary. This facility bears interest at either the lenders’ U.S. base rate or at LIBOR plus
applicable margins.
Revolving credit and term loan borrowings include Bankers’ Acceptances and Commercial Paper of $1,425 million (2004 – 
$1,559 million) maturing at various dates with a weighted average interest rate of 3.52% (2004 – 2.83%). There were no LIBOR
loans outstanding at December 31, 2005 (2004 – $355 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.98%). These amounts are
fully supported and Management expects that they will continue to be supported by revolving credit and term loan facilities that
have no repayment requirements within the next year.
Standby fees paid in 2005 relating to revolving credit and term loan agreements were approximately $4 million (2004 – $5 million;
2003 – $3 million).

Unsecured Notes and Debentures
Unsecured notes and debentures include medium term notes and senior notes that are issued from time to time under trust indentures.
The Company’s current C$1 billion medium term note program was renewed in 2005 with C$500 million ($429 million) unutilized
at December 31, 2005. The current shelf prospectus expires in 2007. The notes issued under this program may be denominated in
Canadian dollars or in foreign currencies.
EnCana has in place a shelf prospectus for U.S. Unsecured Notes in the amount of $2 billion under the Multijurisdictional
Disclosure System. The shelf prospectus provides that debt securities in U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies may be issued from
time to time in one or more series. Terms of the notes, including interest at either fixed or floating rates and expiry dates are
determined by reference to market conditions at the date of issue. At December 31, 2005, $2 billion of the shelf prospectus, which
expires in 2006, remains unutilized.
EnCana has an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, EnCana Holdings Finance Corp., which has in place a shelf prospectus in the
amount of $2 billion under the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System. The shelf prospectus provides that debt securities in U.S. dollars
or other foreign currencies may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Terms of the notes, including interest at either fixed
or floating rates and expiry dates are determined by reference to market conditions at the date of issue. The debt securities issued
under this shelf prospectus are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by EnCana Corporation. EnCana has also obtained certain
exemption orders from Canadian securities regulatory authorities that allow the filing of certain financial and other information 
of EnCana to satisfy certain continuous disclosure obligations of EnCana Holdings Finance Corp. At December 31, 2005, $1 billion
of the shelf prospectus, which expires in 2006, remains unutilized.

EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   87
Normal Course Issuer Bid
In 2005, the Company purchased 60,757,198 Common Shares for total consideration of $2,114 million. Of the amount paid,
$462 million was charged to Share capital, $10 million was charged to Paid in surplus and $1,642 million was charged to Retained
earnings. Included in the above are 5.5 million Common Shares which have been purchased by an EnCana Employee Benefit Plan
Trust and are held for issuance upon vesting of units under EnCana’s Performance Share Unit Plan (see Note 15).
EnCana has received regulatory approval each year under Canadian securities laws to purchase Common Shares under four
consecutive Normal Course Issuer Bids (“Bids”) which commenced in October 2002 and may continue up to October 30, 2006.
EnCana is entitled to purchase, for cancellation, up to approximately 85.6 million Common Shares under the current Bid. During
January 2006, EnCana purchased approximately 6.8 million Common Shares under the Bid for total consideration of $314 million.
Under the prior Bid, which ran from October 29, 2004 until October 28, 2005, EnCana purchased approximately 84.2 million
Common Shares.
Stock Options
EnCana has stock-based compensation plans that allow employees and directors to purchase Common Shares of the Company. Option
exercise prices approximate the market price for the Common Shares on the date the options were issued. Options granted under the
plans are generally fully exercisable after three years and expire five years after the date granted. Options granted under predecessor
and/or related company replacement plans expire up to ten years from the date the options were granted. All options issued subsequent
to December 31, 2003 have an associated Tandem Share Appreciation Right (“TSAR”) attached to them (see Note 15).
In conjunction with the business combination transaction with Alberta Energy Company Ltd. (“AEC”) in 2002, options to 
purchase AEC common shares were replaced with options to purchase Common Shares of EnCana (“AEC replacement plan”) in a
manner consistent with the provisions of the AEC stock option plan. Options granted under the AEC plan prior to April 21, 1999
expire after seven years and options granted after April 20, 1999 expire after five years. The business combination resulted in these
replacement options, along with all options then outstanding under the EnCana plan, becoming exercisable after the close of
business on April 5, 2002.
EnCana Plan
Pursuant to the terms of a stock option plan, options may be granted to certain key employees to purchase EnCana Common
Shares. Options granted prior to February 27, 1997, are exercisable at half the number of options granted after two years and are
fully exercisable after three years. The options expire ten years after the date granted. Options granted on or after November 4, 1999,
are exercisable at 30 percent of the number granted after one year, an additional 30 percent of the number granted after two years,
are fully exercisable after three years and expire five years after the date granted.
Canadian Pacific Limited Replacement Plan
As part of the 2001 reorganization of Canadian Pacific Limited (“CPL”), EnCana’s former parent company, CPL stock options were
replaced with stock options granted by the Company in a manner that was consistent with the provisions of the CPL stock option
plan. Under CPL’s stock option plan, options were granted to certain key employees to purchase common shares of CPL at a price
not less than the market value of the shares at the grant date. The options expire ten years after the grant date and are all exercisable.
Directors’ Plan
Effective April 5, 2002, the Company amended the director stock option plan. Under the terms of the plan, new non-employee
directors were given an initial grant of 15,000 options to purchase common shares of the Company. Thereafter, there was an 
annual grant of 7,500 options to each non-employee director. Options, which expire five years after the grant date, are 100 percent
exercisable on the earlier of the next annual general meeting following the grant date and the first anniversary of the grant date.
On October 23, 2003, issuances of stock options under this plan were discontinued and on October 25, 2005 the Corporation
terminated the plan.

At December 31, 2005, there were 29.3 million common shares reserved for issuance under stock option plans (2004 – 16.0 million;
2003 – 15.6 million).
EnCana has recorded stock-based compensation expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings for stock options granted to
employees and directors in 2003 using the fair value method. Stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 2003 have an
associated TSAR attached. Compensation expense has not been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings related to stock
options granted prior to 2003. If the Company had applied the fair value method to options granted prior to 2003, pro forma Net
Earnings and Net Earnings per Common Share in 2005 would have been unchanged (2004 – $3,476 million; $3.77 per common
share – basic; $3.71 per common share – diluted).
The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with
weighted average assumptions for grants as follows:

The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for each asset class in the plan
investment portfolio. The objective of the asset allocation policy is to manage the funded status of the plan at an appropriate level
of risk, giving consideration to the security of the assets and the potential volatility of market returns and the resulting effect on
both contribution requirements and pension expense. The long-term return is expected to achieve or exceed the return from a
composite benchmark comprised of passive investments in appropriate market indices. The Supplemental Pension Plan is funded
through a retirement compensation arrangement and is subject to the applicable Canada Revenue Agency regulations.
The asset allocation structure is subject to diversification requirements and constraints which reduce risk by limiting exposure to
individual equity investments, credit rating categories and foreign currency exposure.
Management expects to contribute $10 million to the plans in 2006. Contributions by the participants to the pension and other
benefits plans were $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 (2004 – $1 million; 2003 – $1 million).

E) Performance Share Units
EnCana has in place a program whereby employees may be granted Performance Share Units (“PSU’s”) which entitle the employee
to receive, upon vesting, either a common share of EnCana or a cash payment equal to the value of one common share of EnCana
depending upon the terms of the PSU granted. PSU’s vest at the end of a three year period. Their ultimate value will depend upon
EnCana’s performance measured over three calendar years. Performance will be measured by total shareholder return relative to a
fixed North American oil and gas comparison group. If EnCana’s performance is below the specified level compared to the comparison
group, the units awarded will be forfeited. If EnCana’s performance is at or above the specified level compared to the comparison
group, the value of the PSU’s shall be determined by EnCana’s relative ranking, with payments ranging from one to two times for
PSU’s granted for the 2003 grant and one half to two times the PSU’s granted for the 2004 and 2005 grant.
PSU’s granted subsequent to 2003 are to be paid in common shares (2003 – paid in cash).

Amounts Recognized on Transition
Upon initial adoption of the current accounting policy for risk management instruments on January 1, 2004, the fair value of all
outstanding financial instruments that were not considered accounting hedges was recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with
an offsetting net deferred loss amount (the “transition amount”). The transition amount is recognized into net earnings over the
life of the related contracts. Changes in fair value after that time are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with the associated
unrealized gain or loss recorded in net earnings.

D) Credit Risk
A substantial portion of the Company’s accounts receivable are with customers in the oil and gas industry and are subject to
normal industry credit risks. The Board of Directors has approved a credit policy governing the Company’s credit portfolio and
procedures are in place to ensure adherence to this policy.
With respect to counterparties to financial instruments, the Company partially mitigates associated credit risk by limiting
transactions to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings and net settlements where appropriate. At December 31, 2005,
EnCana has three counterparties whose net settlement position individually account for more than 10 percent of the fair value of
the outstanding in-the-money net financial instrument contracts by counterparty.
All foreign currency agreements are with major financial institutions in Canada and the United States or with counterparties having
investment grade credit ratings.

Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in various legal claims associated with the normal course of operations. The Company believes it has
made adequate provision for such legal claims.
Discontinued Merchant Energy Operations
California
As disclosed previously, in July 2003, the Company’s indirect wholly owned U.S. marketing subsidiary, WD Energy Services Inc.
(“WD”), concluded a settlement with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) of a previously disclosed CFTC
investigation whereby WD agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $20 million without admitting or denying 
the findings in the CFTC’s order.
EnCana Corporation and WD are defendants in a lawsuit filed by E. & J. Gallo Winery in the United States District Court in
California, further described below. The Gallo lawsuit claims damages in excess of $30 million. California law allows for the
possibility that the amount of damages assessed could be tripled.
Along with other energy companies, EnCana Corporation and WD are defendants in several other lawsuits relating to sales of
natural gas in California from 1999 to 2002 (some of which are class actions and some of which are brought by individual parties
on their own behalf). As is customary, these lawsuits do not specify the precise amount of damages claimed. The Gallo and other
California lawsuits contain allegations that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy with unnamed competitors in the natural gas
and derivatives market in California in violation of U.S. and California anti-trust and unfair competition laws.
In all but one of the class actions in the United States District Court and in the Gallo action, decisions dealing with the issue 
of whether the scope of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s exclusive jurisdiction over natural gas prices precludes 
the plaintiffs from maintaining their claims are on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Without admitting any liability in the lawsuits, in November 2005, WD has agreed to pay $20.5 million to settle the class action
lawsuits that were consolidated in San Diego Superior Court, subject to final documentation and approval by the San Diego
Superior Court. The individual parties who had brought their own actions are not parties to this settlement.
New York
WD is also a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court in New York. The consolidated
New York lawsuit claims that the defendants’ alleged manipulation of natural gas price indices affected natural gas futures and
option contracts traded on the NYMEX from 2000 to 2002. EnCana Corporation was dismissed from the New York lawsuit, leaving
WD and several other companies unrelated to EnCana Corporation as the remaining defendants. Without admitting any liability 
in the lawsuit, WD has agreed to pay a maximum of $9.1 million to settle the New York class action lawsuit, subject to final
documentation and approval by the New York District Court.
100 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
Based on the aforementioned settlements, during the fourth quarter of 2005 a total of $30 million was recorded, which amount has
been included in Administrative costs in the Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations. EnCana Corporation and WD intend to
vigorously defend against the remaining outstanding claims; however, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings
or any future proceedings against the Company, whether these proceedings would lead to monetary damages which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, or whether there will be other proceedings arising out of these allegations.
Asset Retirement
The Company is responsible for the retirement of long-lived assets related to its oil and gas properties and Midstream facilities at
the end of their useful lives. The Company has recognized a liability of $816 million based on current legislation and estimated
costs. Actual costs may differ from those estimated due to changes in legislation and changes in costs.
Income Tax Matters
The operations of the Company are complex, and related tax interpretations, regulations and legislation in the various jurisdictions
that the Company operates in are continually changing. As a result, there are usually some tax matters under review. The Company
believes that the provision for taxes is adequate.
19. United States Accounting Principles and Reporting
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada
(“Canadian GAAP”) which, in most respects, conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.
GAAP”). The significant differences between Canadian GAAP and U.S. GAAP are described in this note.

The full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas operations under Canadian GAAP and U.S. GAAP differ in the
following respects. Under U.S. GAAP, a ceiling test is applied to ensure the unamortized capitalized costs in each cost centre do not
exceed the sum of the present value, discounted at 10 percent, of the estimated unescalated future net operating revenue from
proved reserves plus unimpaired unproved property costs less future development costs, related production costs and applicable
taxes. Under Canadian GAAP, a similar ceiling test calculation is performed with the exception that cash flows from proved reserves
are undiscounted and utilize forecast pricing to determine whether impairment exists. Any impairment amount is measured using
the fair value of proved and probable reserves.
In computing its consolidated net earnings for U.S. GAAP purposes, the Company recorded additional depletion in 2001 and
certain years prior to 2001 as a result of the application of the ceiling test. These charges were not required under the Canadian
GAAP ceiling tests. As a result, the depletion base of unamortized capitalized costs is less for U.S. GAAP purposes.
Effective January 1, 2004, the Canadian Accounting Standard’s Board amended the Full Cost Accounting Guideline. Under
Canadian GAAP, depletion charges are calculated by reference to proved reserves estimated using estimated future prices and costs.
Under U.S. GAAP, depletion charges are calculated by reference to proved reserves estimated using constant prices.
B) Derivative Instruments and Hedging
On January 1, 2004, the Company implemented under Canadian GAAP, EIC 128 “Accounting For Trading, Speculative or Non-
Hedging Derivative Financial Instruments” which requires derivatives not designated as hedges to be recorded in the balance sheet
as either assets or liabilities at their fair value. Changes in the derivative’s fair value are recognized in current period earnings. Under
the transitional rules any gain or loss at the implementation date is deferred and recognized into revenue once realized. Currently,
Management has not designated any of the financial instruments as hedges.
104 EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
The adoption of EIC 128 at January 1, 2004 resulted in the recognition of a $235 million deferred loss which will be recognized into
earnings when realized. As at December 31, 2005, under Canadian GAAP a $40 million deferred gain remains.
For U.S. GAAP, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 133 effective January 1, 2001. SFAS 133
requires that all derivatives be recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at their fair value. Changes in the derivative’s
fair value are recognized in current period earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Management has currently
not designated any of the financial instruments as hedges for U.S. GAAP purposes under SFAS 133.

As at December 31, 2005, it is estimated that over the following 12 months, $0.08 million ($0.05 million, net of tax) will be
reclassified into net earnings from other comprehensive income.
C) Stock-Based Compensation – CPL Reorganization
Under Canadian GAAP, compensation costs have been recognized in the financial statements for stock options granted to employees
and directors in 2003. For the effect of stock-based compensation on the Canadian GAAP financial statements, which would be the
same adjustment under U.S. GAAP, see Note 15.
Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 44 “Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation”, compensation expense must be recorded if the intrinsic value of the stock options is not exactly the same
immediately before and after an equity restructuring. As part of the corporate reorganization of Canadian Pacific Ltd.(“CPL”), an
equity restructuring occurred which resulted in CPL stock options being replaced with stock options granted by EnCana as described
in Note 15. This resulted in the replacement options having a different intrinsic value after the restructuring than prior to the
restructuring. Canadian GAAP does not require revaluation of these options.
D) Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments
U.S. GAAP requires gains or losses arising from the translation of self-sustaining operations to be included in other comprehensive
income. Canadian GAAP requires these amounts to be recorded in Shareholders’ Equity.
E) Future Income Taxes
Under U.S. GAAP, enacted tax rates are used to calculate future taxes, whereas Canadian GAAP uses substantively enacted tax rates.
The future income tax adjustments included in the Reconciliation of Net Earnings under Canadian GAAP to U.S. GAAP and 
the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet include the effect of such rate differences, if any, as well as the tax effect of the other
reconciling items noted.

U.S. GAAP requires the disclosure, as other comprehensive income, of changes in equity during the period from transaction and
other events from non-owner sources. Canadian GAAP does not require similar disclosure. Other comprehensive income arose
from the transition adjustment resulting from the January 1, 2001 adoption of SFAS 133. At December 31, 2005, accumulated other
comprehensive income related to these items was a loss of $4.8 million, net of tax.
G) Asset Retirement Obligation
In 2003, the Company early adopted the Canadian accounting standard for asset retirement obligations, as outlined in the CICA
handbook section 3110. This standard is equivalent to U.S. SFAS 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”, which was effective
for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2003. Early adopting the Canadian standard eliminated a U.S. GAAP reconciling item
in respect to accounting for the obligation, however a difference is created in how the transition amounts are disclosed.
U.S. GAAP requires the cumulative impact of a change in an accounting policy be presented in the current year Consolidated
Statement of Earnings and prior periods not be restated.

In the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company adopted, for U.S. GAAP purposes, FIN 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations” in order to address the diverse accounting practices which have developed with regard to the timing 
of recognition for asset retirement obligations. This interpretation did not have a material impact on its financial statements.
The Company has assessed new and revised accounting pronouncements that have been issued that are not yet effective and
determined that the following may have a significant impact on the Company:
• Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company will be required to adopt, for U.S. GAAP purposes, revised
SFAS 123 “Share-Based Payment”. This amended statement eliminates the alternative to use Accounting Principles Board (“APB”)
Opinion No. 25’s intrinsic value method of accounting, as was provided in the originally issued Statement 123. As a result, public
entities are required to use the grant-date fair value of the award in measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange
for an equity award of equity instruments. Compensation cost is required to be recognized over the requisite service period. For
liability awards, entities are required to re-measure the fair value of the award at each reporting date up until the settlement date.
Changes in fair value of liability awards during the requisite service period are required to be recognized as compensation cost
over the vesting period. Compensation cost is not recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the
requisite service. Although the Company is in the process of assessing the impact of this amendment, the Company does not
expect the amendments to have a material impact on its consolidated statements.
• As of January 1, 2006, the Company will be required to adopt, for U.S. GAAP purposes, SFAS 154 “Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No.20 and SFAS 3”. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application of voluntary
changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material
impact on its financial statements.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (prepared in US$)
EnCana Corporation 2005 Annual Report   107
Supplementary Oil and Gas Information — SFAS 69 (unaudited)
The tables in this section set forth oil and gas information prepared by EnCana in accordance with U.S. disclosure standards,
including Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Number 69 (“SFAS 69”).
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein
In calculating the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, year-end constant prices and cost assumptions were
applied to EnCana’s annual future production from proved reserves to determine cash inflows. Future production and development
costs are based on constant price assumptions and assume the continuation of existing economic, operating and regulatory
conditions. Future income taxes are calculated by applying statutory income tax rates to future pre-tax cash flows after provision for
the tax cost of the oil and natural gas properties based upon existing laws and regulations. The discount was computed by
application of a 10 percent discount factor to the future net cash flows. The calculation of the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows is based upon the discounted future net cash flows prepared by EnCana’s independent qualified reserves
evaluators in relation to the reserves they respectively evaluated, and adjusted by EnCana to account for management’s estimates of
price risk management activities, asset retirement obligations and future income taxes.
EnCana cautions that the discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves are an indication of neither the
fair market value of EnCana’s oil and gas properties, nor of the future net cash flows expected to be generated from such properties.
The discounted future net cash flows do not include the fair market value of exploratory properties and probable or possible oil and
gas reserves, nor is consideration given to the effect of anticipated future changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, development,
asset retirement and production costs and possible changes to tax and royalty regulations. The prescribed discount rate of 10
percent may not appropriately reflect future interest rates. The computation also excludes values attributable to EnCana’s Syncrude
interest (disposed of in 2003) and Midstream interests.

“Net” reserves are the remaining reserves of EnCana, after deduction of estimated royalties and including royalty interests.
“Proved” reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made.
“Proved Developed” reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
“Proved Undeveloped” reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure 
is required for recompletion.
(2) EnCana does not file any estimates of total net proved crude oil or natural gas reserves with any U.S. federal authority or agency other than the SEC.
(3) Removal of the Corporation’s Foster Creek proved bitumen reserves as a result of low bitumen prices on December 31, 2004. This included approximately 5.4 million barrels that were
included under revisions and improved recovery and approximately 70.4 million barrels that were included under extensions and discoveries in 2004.
(4) Reinstatement, as a result of year-end 2005 prices, of the Corporation’s Foster Creek proved bitumen reserves that were deducted as a revision due to bitumen price at year-end 2004.
(5) Proved crude oil and NGLs reserves at December 31, 2005 include 657.4 million barrels of bitumen, the vast majority of which are located at Foster Creek. Changes to bitumen reserves
during 2005 included revisions of 174.6 million barrels and extensions and discoveries of 134.0 million barrels.
(6) The Corporation expects to complete the disposition of its Ecuadorian operations in 2006. Accordingly, Ecuador is reported as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes.
