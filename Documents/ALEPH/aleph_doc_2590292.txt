Exhibit 99.1
SemGroup Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2016 Results
Tulsa, OK - August 4, 2016 - SemGroup® Corporation (NYSE: SEMG) today announced its
second quarter 2016 financial results.
SemGroup reported second quarter 2016 revenues of $287.4 million with net income attributable
to SemGroup of $8.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. This compares with first quarter 2016
revenues of $314.9 million with a net loss attributable to SemGroup of $(15.3) million, or $(0.35)
per diluted share. Second quarter 2015 revenues totaled $377.2 million with net income
attributable to SemGroup of $23.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share.
SemGroup's second quarter 2016 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) was $67.6 million, down approximately 13% from $77.7 million
in first quarter 2016 and 16% from $80.0 million in second quarter 2015. Adjusted EBITDA is a
non-GAAP measure and is reconciled to net income below.
"SemGroup’s second quarter reflected anticipated volume declines in several of our segments
and the loss of distributions from our sale of a non-core investment. Despite the continued
weakness in commodity prices, our business model continues to endure as we reposition for
future growth," said Carlin Conner, president and chief executive officer of SemGroup. "As part of
this growth strategy, we completed a significant equity offering in the second quarter and
advanced our pending acquisition of Rose Rock Midstream. Additionally, we now have our key
construction permits on our largest investment, the Maurepas Pipeline, a fully contracted project
to serve investment-grade refining operations on the Gulf Coast for decades to come."
    
Recent Developments
In July, SemGroup received key permits needed for constructing the Maurepas Pipeline in
Louisiana. Construction on the pipeline has begun on all fronts. However, due to delays in
receiving these key permits, the project's completion has been extended into early 2017.
In June, SemGroup completed a common stock equity offering consisting of 8.6 million shares of
its Class A common stock at an offering price of $27.00 per share. The company expects this
raise in equity will further strengthen its balance sheet and provide more capital to pursue
strategic growth plans, including organic projects as well as potential strategic acquisitions.
In May, the company announced an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common units of
its MLP, Rose Rock Midstream L.P., in an all stock-for-unit transaction. In connection with the
transaction, SemGroup filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on July 14. It is expected to close later this year. The transaction is
designed to simplify SemGroup's corporate capital structure and deliver several important
benefits to shareholders including an enhanced credit profile, dividend coverage and future
dividend growth rate beyond 2016.
Second Quarter 2016 Dividend
The SemGroup board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of
$0.45 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend of $1.80 per share. This represents an
increase of approximately 7% over the dividend of $0.42 per share with respect to the second
quarter of 2015. The dividend will be paid on August 25, 2016 to all common shareholders of
record on August 15, 2016.
2016 Guidance
Exhibit 99.1
SemGroup reaffirms 2016 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $270 and $320
million. Due primarily to the company's recent sale of NGL Energy limited partner units, the
company expects to come in below the midpoint of its guidance range. SemGroup is also on
track to deploy approximately $455 million in capital investments in 2016. The company expects
to maintain its current dividend of $0.45 per share until the closing of the previously mentioned
Rose Rock Midstream merger transaction.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
SemGroup’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA, is not a GAAP measure and is not intended
to be used in lieu of GAAP presentation of net income (loss), which is the most closely
associated GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, adjusted for selected items that SemGroup believes impact the
comparability of financial results between reporting periods. Although SemGroup presents
selected items that it considers in evaluating its performance, you should also be aware that the
items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between the periods
presented. Variations in SemGroup’s operating results are also caused by changes in volumes,
prices, exchange rates, mechanical interruptions and numerous other factors. These types of
variances are not separately identified in this presentation.
This measure may be used periodically by management when discussing our financial results
with investors and analysts and is presented as management believes it provides additional
information and metrics relative to the performance of our businesses. This non-GAAP financial
measure has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all,
items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider
non-GAAP measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under
GAAP. Management compensates for the limitations of our non-GAAP measures as analytical
tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the
non-GAAP measure and the most comparable GAAP measure and incorporating this knowledge
into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the
same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results. Because
all companies do not use
Exhibit 99.1
identical calculations, our presentations of non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly
titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.
