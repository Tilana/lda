</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes</i> the readiness of the Sudan to improve the human rights situation in

</p>
<p> 4. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the High-Level Mission (A/HRC/4/80); 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Expresses its deep concern</i> regarding the seriousness of the ongoing  violations of

African Union the decisions and recommendations adopted by the former Commission on 
Human Rights as well as by the Human Rights Council and by other relevant United Nations 
human rights bodies and institutions, to ensure their consistency and their current relevance or 
need to be updated and to recommend to the Council a workable package of measures following 
therefrom, and resorting, if need be, to a phased approach;
