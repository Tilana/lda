<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, 
visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 15 to 21 April 2007 at the invitation of the 
Government. He would like to thank the Government for its cooperation, and the United Nations 
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) for the very valuable 
assistance that he received. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur and his team visited Kinshasa, Bukavu in Sud-Kivu, Goma in 
Nord-Kivu, and Bunia in Ituri. The Special Rapporteur met the Prime Minister, several of his 
ministers, provincial authorities, judges and prosecutors from various levels of courts, both 
civilian and military, the heads of several bar associations, lawyers, judges&#8217; and lawyers&#8217; 
associations, members of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), members of the various 
sections of MONUC and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the 
principal donors to the justice sector. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>3. Having emerged from a decade of deadly conflict and a three-year transition period, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo has managed, with the support of the international 
community, to adopt a new constitution and hold its first democratic elections in 2006. Now that 
it has a democratically elected Government and an appropriate institutional framework, the 
Republic faces two major challenges: to establish the rule of law and a democracy based on an 
effective separation of powers, and to face up to the aftermath of past crimes. The judiciary, 
which has a key role in meeting these challenges, must be truly independent and effective, as 
required under the Constitution, so that it can play its role as a pillar of democracy and guarantor 
of the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s final report, containing his conclusions and recommendations on 
his visit, will be presented to the Human Rights Council of the United Nations in a few months; 
this preliminary note offers some conclusions and recommendations. During his visit, the Special 
Rapporteur noted that the judicial system is in an alarming state, especially in view of the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; There are far too few judicial personnel, both in the prosecution service and in the 
judiciary, and courts in the country. Judges do not have the logistic and physical 
facilities they need to perform their duties in a dignified and professional manner. They 
lack appropriate premises such as courtrooms, vehicles in which to reach places of 
investigation, basic computer equipment, and the financial resources to cover the 
running costs of the judicial system. Furthermore, they are not adequately paid. Their 
lack of financial independence has a direct impact on the lack of independence of both 
civilian and military justice and encourages almost systematic corruption among judges 
and court officials; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/25/Add.3 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Interference by the executive authorities and the army remains very common despite the 
express prohibition in article 151 of the Constitution. The structural and financial 
weakness of the judicial authorities is exacerbated by institutional shortcomings, such as 
the lack of any oversight by an independent, functioning higher council of the judiciary, 
which makes judges more vulnerable to interference; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Gaining access to justice is very difficult for the majority of the population because of 
corruption, a lack of financial resources, the geographical remoteness of the courts and 
transport problems, and a lack of awareness of appeal mechanisms. Judges and lawyers 
also have difficulty in gaining access to legislative texts and case law; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; In most cases where it is possible to conclude a trial, the courts&#8217; decisions are not 
enforced. The very high rate of non-enforcement is mainly due to an inability to deploy 
the officers responsible, corruption among these officers, poverty among the 
beneficiaries of judicial decisions, who are expected to contribute to enforcement costs, 
and a preference in some communities for friendly settlements in accordance with 
custom. The number of prison escapes is also high, owing in part to the badly 
dilapidated state of the prisons, which is extremely worrying. This undermines the work 
of the judicial system and allows crime to go unpunished; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Very alarmingly, most human rights violations are committed by the armed forces and 
the police and fall, under domestic legislation, within the jurisdiction of the military 
tribunals. International human rights standards require that cases of human rights 
violations by members of the armed forces, like trials of civilians, should be heard by 
civilian, not military courts. This is all the more important because the lack of 
independence particularly affects the military judicial system, which remains dependent 
on the military hierarchy. Military justice continues to be tarnished by a very high 
incidence of military and political interference in the form of refusals by senior officers 
to bring their men before military tribunals, and pressure and obstacles during the trial 
process; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Preventive detention is the rule rather than the exception. It is used in connection with 
far too many offences, and often the sole aim is to extract money in return for the 
release of the detainee. It is especially worrying that uniformed men, such as soldiers 
and officers of the National Intelligence Agency (ANR), often carry out arbitrary arrests 
and detentions - which is beyond their authority - and often for activities that do not 
constitute a crime. Given the slowness of the judicial system, and in some cases the 
absence of any trial, suspects can often be held in preventive detention for months or 
even years without being found guilty by a court of law. 
</p>
<p>5. In view of these shortcomings, it has to be said that the judicial system is rarely effective 
and that human rights violations, the most frequent and serious of which are rapes, summary 
executions, arbitrary detention, and looting and destruction of property, generally go unpunished. 
Since a democratic State cannot function without a strong and independent judiciary, it is 
regrettable that the judicial system is still the poor relation of the country&#8217;s democratic 
institutions. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.3

</p>
<p>6. In this context, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by the integrated 
United Nations Human Rights Office in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and various civil 
society organizations to combat impunity - supporting judges in their work, for example, and 
providing them with the means to conduct investigations and conclude trials. These isolated 
efforts, however, cannot offset the systematic shortcomings of the judicial system. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>7. <b>In view of these observations, the Special Rapporteur makes the following 
preliminary recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The development of a strong, effective and independent judicial system should 
be a priority of the Government and of international bodies active in the field of justice and 
human rights. Without urgent and substantial reinforcement of the judicial system, the 
rule of law and the consolidation of the democratic reforms in which the Congolese people 
and the international community have invested so much over recent years will not 
materialize. Meeting this objective will require, in particular: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The allocation of a considerably higher percentage of the national 
budget to the judicial system, bearing in mind that the budget of the 
judicial system usually accounts for between 2 and 6 per cent of 
national budgets. These resources should make it possible to improve 
judges&#8217; pay, recruit new judges, give them the premises and 
operational capacity (transport, information technology, etc.) they 
need to perform their duties, and establish new courts, especially 
magistrates&#8217; courts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) The development and implementation by the Justice Ministry, in close 
cooperation with donors, of a plan for rebuilding the judicial system. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur supports the work of the Joint 
Committee to Monitor the Justice Framework Programme in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, which brings the Justice Ministry 
together with donors. On the basis of the results of the organizational 
audit of the Congolese judicial system conducted, by agreement with 
the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 2004 by 
the European Commission in partnership with Belgian and French 
development cooperation institutions, the United Kingdom 
Department for International Development (DFID), UNDP, MONUC 
and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, the Committee intends to draft a plan of action to give effect 
to the justice framework programme. The Special Rapporteur is 
convinced that this Committee&#8217;s work is critical to strengthening the 
country&#8217;s judicial system. Having noted delays in the drafting of the 
plan, however, he encourages Committee members to press on with 
their work so that the plan can be adopted as soon as possible. The 
implementation of specific measures to rebuild and support the 
judicial system should begin in 2007; </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/25/Add.3 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p><b>(iii) Recovery by the country&#8217;s authorities of control over its natural 
resources. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is an extremely rich 
country, but thus far, exploitation of its natural resources has not 
benefited its population. On the contrary, unplanned or illegal 
exploitation continues to be a significant source of conflict and human 
rights violations, leading to looting and other abuses. Despite this, no 
one has been held to account for this illicit exploitation. It would be 
helpful to train specialist judges in this field. Regaining control of 
natural resources would allow the country to obtain the resources it 
needs to strengthen its institutions, in particular the judicial system, 
and to ensure that the population benefits from the country&#8217;s wealth. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To give effect to the constitutional framework and ensure that judicial 
independence does not remain a dead letter, a number of laws must be adopted as a matter 
of urgency: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) A law on the organization of the Higher Council of the Judiciary, a 
key body that will be responsible for appointing, promoting and 
disciplining judges, thereby safeguarding their independence while at 
the same time providing adequate supervision of their conduct, and 
for drawing up the judicial system&#8217;s budget, which is the key to its 
independence and effectiveness; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) A law providing for the application of the Rome Statute, which will 
transfer jurisdiction over international crimes from military tribunals 
to the civilian judicial system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Laws establishing the Court of Cassation, the Constitutional Court 
and the Conseil d&#8217;&#201;tat. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The training of judges, especially in ethics, professional conduct and 
international human rights standards, and the training of auxiliary staff should be 
considerably strengthened. There is no body offering training to judges and judicial 
auxiliary staff before they assume office. A college for the judiciary and a college for the 
professional training of judicial auxiliary staff should be established as soon as possible. 
 (d) In order to guarantee the right to a defence, a right recognized in the 
Constitution, the State should establish a system for paying duty lawyers, for example, 
through bar associations, to ensure that poor people can have a high quality defence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The reconstruction of the judicial system should be based on a strengthened 
civilian judicial system, which should have sole jurisdiction to judge civilians and cases of 
human rights violations committed by the armed forces or the police. The jurisdiction of 
the military tribunals should be gradually limited to offences of a purely military nature. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/25/Add.3 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p><b> (f) The use of preventive detention must be strictly limited. This will also prevent 
prison overcrowding. A maximum period of preventive detention should be established by 
law, especially for offences for which the prison sentence is under five years. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) A system for monitoring the enforcement of judgements should be established, 
as should a mechanism to ensure that the legal costs of poor people are met by the State. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) In order to provide a solid foundation for democracy, the Congolese judiciary 
and the international community should cooperate in prosecuting grave violations of 
human rights and humanitarian law committed during the war, drawing on the experience 
of judicial cooperation in the area of transitional justice that has produced good results in 
other countries. The establishment of joint benches comprising national and international 
judges sitting in national courts might be an appropriate solution.  
</b>8.<b> In talks with the Special Rapporteur, the Government recognized that an 
independent and effective judiciary is the backbone of the rule of law and the country&#8217;s 
development. It also recognized that the judicial system is in a critical state, and urgently 
needs to be strengthened. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that it is vital for the new 
Government to make the reconstruction and strengthening of the judicial system a priority 
in its programme for the democratic consolidation of the country, and he encourages the 
Government in its intended endeavours.
