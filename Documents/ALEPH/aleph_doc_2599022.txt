2016 SECOND QUARTER REPORT
MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS
Kelt  Exploration  Ltd.  (“Kelt”  or  the  “Company”)  reports  its  financial  and  operating  results  to  shareholders  for  the 
second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016.
Average  production  for  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2016  was  20,208  BOE  per  day,  up  4%  compared  to 
average  production  of  19,473  BOE  per  day  during  the  second  quarter  of  2015.  Daily  average  production  in  the 
second quarter of 2016 was 13% lower than average production of 23,295 BOE per day in the first quarter of 2016, 
primarily  due  to  a  planned  two  week  facility  turnaround  operation  in  Progress,  Alberta.  Production  was  also 
temporarily shut-in as a precautionary measure due to forest fires near gas processing facilities in the Stoddart area 
of British Columbia. Production downtime resulted in shut-ins of approximately 1,700 BOE per day average during the 
second quarter of 2016.
Kelt’s realized average oil price was $49.76 per barrel, up 46% from $34.01 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 and 
down 16% from $59.02 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015. The realized average NGLs price during the second 
quarter of 2016 was $18.21 per barrel, up 28% from $14.24 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 and down 28% from 
$25.43  per  barrel  in  the  corresponding  period  of  2015.  The  realized  average  gas  price  was  $1.97  per  MCF,  down 
15% from $2.33 per MCF in the first quarter of 2016 and down 31% from the realized average gas price of $2.85 per 
MCF in the second quarter of the previous year.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, revenue was $40.7 million and funds from operations was $11.7 million 
($0.07 per share, diluted), compared to revenue of $52.1 million and funds from operations of $14.7 million ($0.09 per 
share, diluted) in the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2016, bank debt, net of working capital was $139.1 million, 
down  45%  from  $251.9  million  at  June  30,  2015.  Production  expenses  of  $8.87  per  BOE  continue  to  improve  and 
were 36% lower compared to $13.95 per BOE in the second quarter of 2015.
Net  capital expenditures incurred  during  the  three  months  ended  June 30,  2016  were  $25.9 million,  of  which  $18.9 
million  was  for  a  property  acquisition  in  Kelt’s  core  operating  area  at  Progress,  Alberta.  The  balance  of  capital 
spending during the second quarter of 2016 was primarily for land acquisition and infrastructure construction.
During the second quarter of 2016, Kelt took measures to improve financial liquidity. On April 7, 2016, the Company 
closed a private placement of 4.7 million common shares on a “CDE flow-through” basis at a price of $4.70 per share, 
resulting in net proceeds of $22.0 million. On May 3, 2016, Kelt closed the issuance of $90.0 million principal amount 
of 5.0% convertible unsecured subordinated debentures, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $86.4 million.
Kelt has revised its 2016 outlook and guidance to reflect changes to forecasted commodity prices as follows:
  Average production of 21,500 BOE per day, unchanged from previous guidance;


2016 production mix is expected to be weighted 37% to oil & NGLs and 63% to gas;
2016 operating income is expected to be derived 82% from oil & NGLs and 18% from gas;
  Average WTI price of US$41.85 per barrel, down 3% from previous forecast;
  Average AECO gas price of $2.10 per GJ, up 11% from previous forecast;
  Capital expenditures, including acquisitions, of $87.0 million, up 5% from previous guidance;

Funds from operations of $54.0 million ($0.31 per share, diluted), up 8% from previous guidance; and
  Bank  debt,  net  of  working  capital  of  $137.0  million  (2.5  x  trailing  funds  from  operations),  unchanged  from
previous guidance.
In  July  2016,  the  Government  of  Alberta  released  further  details  with  respect  to  the  Alberta  Modernized  Royalty 
Framework (“MRF”), now providing companies with the ability to apply for early adoption by drilling wells in 2016 and 
still qualifying for royalties under MRF. Kelt expects to take advantage of this early adoption on certain wells and has 
increased its capital spending plans in Alberta for 2016 and reallocated funds within the budget.
After delineating four of its Montney oil plays in Alberta, Kelt is now in a position to commence full development on 
two of these plays and at the same time, taking advantage of both the early adoption of MRF, as well as the current 
low cost service sector environment. As a result, Kelt expects to commence pad drilling at Pouce Coupe and Karr in 
the  second  half  of  2016.  The  Company  plans  to  drill  two  wells  at  Pouce  Coupe  and  two  wells  at  Karr,  with  further
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.

2016 SECOND QUARTER REPORT
plans to drill additional wells from the same pads in both areas in early 2017. Completions of these wells are planned 
prior to spring break-up in 2017.
At  Inga,  British  Columbia,  Kelt  put  on  production  two  wells  that  were  recently  drilled  and completed  on  the  eastern 
part of its contiguous Montney land block. Both these wells were completed in the Upper Montney. The well located 
at 07-12-088-23W6 flowed high volumes of field condensate with an IP30 rate (gross sales) of 648 BOE per day of 
which condensate and liquids was 379 barrels per day (58%). The well located at 05-07-088-22W6 had an IP30 rate 
(gross sales) of 1,130 BOE per day of which condensate and liquids was 592 barrels per day (52%). The Company is 
excited with these results as it extends the Montney resource play further to the east significantly adding to its future 
drilling inventory.
In the Inga/Fireweed/Stoddart area, Kelt will defer drilling and completing a previously planned Upper Montney well to 
2017, leaving two wells to be drilled in the second half of 2016. The Company expects to drill and complete a Middle 
Montney well in the central part of its land block at Inga and to drill an Upper Montney well in the northeast part of its 
land block at Fireweed. Kelt expects to complete this well in early 2017 and to drill and complete the deferred Upper 
Montney well, also in early 2017. At this stage, the Company will have obtained sufficient information from delineation 
drilling  and  expects  to  commence  full  development  in  the  Upper  Montney  in  British  Columbia  by  switching  to  pad 
drilling which should result in significant savings in per well capital expenditures, as well as lower per unit  operating 
expenses when the wells are brought on production.
In  light  of  the  current  energy  business  environment  with  much  lower  oil  and  gas  prices  year-to-date  in  2016, 
compared to 2015, Kelt is optimistic that it can continue to take advantage of the current downturn with its strategy of 
low-cost  land  accumulation  in  its  core  operating  areas,  during  the  remainder  of  2016.  In  July,  Kelt  completed  an 
acquisition  of  18  sections  of  land  in  British  Columbia,  which  brings  the  Company’s  Montney  land  holdings  in  the 
Inga/Fireweed/Stoddart  area  to  180  contiguous net  sections.  The  Upper  Montney  well  that  was  deferred from  2016 
capital spending plans is now expected to be drilled on these newly acquired lands during the first quarter of 2017. 
Kelt believes that these lands will be prospective in both the Upper and Middle Montney formations.
Management looks forward to updating shareholders with 2016 third quarter results on or about November 10, 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
Kelt Exploration Ltd. (“Kelt” or the “Company”) is an oil and gas company based in Calgary, Alberta, focused 
on  the  exploration,  development  and  production  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  resources,  primarily  in  west 
central  Alberta  and  northeastern  British  Columbia.  The  Company’s  common  shares  and  5%  convertible 
debentures  are  listed  on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange  (“TSX”)  under  the  symbol  “KEL”  and  “KEL.DB”, 
respectively. The head office of Kelt is located at Suite 300, 311 - 6th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2P 3H2.
The  Company  was  incorporated  under  the  Business  Corporations  Act  (Alberta)  on  October  11,  2012  as  1705972 
Alberta  Ltd.  and  was  inactive  until  February  26,  2013.  On  October  19,  2012,  Articles  of  Amendment  were  filed  to 
change the name of the Company to Kelt Exploration Ltd.
On April 16, 2015, the Company  completed the acquisition of Artek Exploration Ltd. (“Artek”) by acquiring all of the 
issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  of  Artek  pursuant  to  a  statutory  plan  of  arrangement  under  the  Business 
Corporations  Act  (Alberta)  (the  “Artek  Acquisition”).  Pursuant  to  the  arrangement,  Artek  common  shares  were 
delisted  from  the  TSX  and  Artek  became  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Kelt.  Immediately  following  the  Artek 
Acquisition,  Articles  of  Amendment  were  filed  to  change  the  name  of  Artek  to  Kelt  Exploration  (LNG)  Ltd.  (“Kelt 
LNG”). Kelt has transferred all of its British Columbia (“BC”) assets to Kelt LNG and at the same time, Kelt LNG has 
transferred  all  of  its  Alberta  assets  to  Kelt.  Kelt  LNG  operates  in  BC  as  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Kelt, 
headquartered in Calgary, Alberta.
Additional information relating to Kelt can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
This  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (“MD&A”)  is  dated  August  9,  2016  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction 
with the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes as at and for 
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and its audited consolidated annual financial statements and MD&A 
as  at  and  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2015.  The  accompanying  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in 
accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (“GAAP”)  as  set  out  in  the  CPA  Canada 
Handbook  -  Accounting  (“CPA  Handbook”).  The  CPA  Handbook  incorporates  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards  (“IFRS”) and  publicly  accountable  enterprises,  including  Kelt,  are  required  to  apply  such  standards.  The 
Company’s Board of Directors approved and authorized the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for 
issue on August 9, 2016.
ADVISORY REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This  MD&A  contains  forward-looking  statements  and  forward-looking  information  within  the  meaning  of  applicable 
securities  laws.  The  use  of  any  of  the  words  “expect”,  “anticipate”,  “continue”,  “estimate”,  “objective”,  “ongoing”, 
“may”, “will”, “project”, “should”, “believe”, “plans”, “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-
looking  information  or  statements.  In  particular,  this  MD&A  contains  forward-looking  statements  pertaining  to  the 
following:  the  anticipated  continued  reduction  in  production  and  transportation  expenses  resulting  from  operational 
initiatives  and  expenditures  on  infrastructure;  the  expectation  that  firm  service  gas  transportation  contracts  will 
continue  to  alleviate  production  disruptions  and  discounted  realized  gas  prices;  the  potential  impact  of  the 
Modernized Royalty Framework (“MRF”) on the Company’s Alberta oil and gas assets and the expectation that Kelt 
will  early  adopt  the  MRF  for  certain  wells  drilled  during  the  second  half  of  2016;  the  Company’s  ability  to  continue 
accumulating land at a low-cost in its core operating areas; and the Company's expected future financial position and 
operating results, as well as the amount and timing of future development capital expenditures. Statements relating to 
"reserves"  or  “resources”  are  deemed  to  be  forward  looking  statements,  as  they  involve  the  implied  assessment, 
based  on  certain  estimates  and  assumptions,  that  the  reserves  described  exist  in  the  quantities  predicted  or 
estimated and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future.
Although Kelt believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are 
reasonable,  undue  reliance  should  not  be  placed  on  the  forward-looking  statements  because  Kelt  cannot  give  any 
assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, 
by  their  very  nature  they  involve  inherent  risks  and  uncertainties.  Actual  results  could  differ  materially  from  those 
currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, the risks associated
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or 
changes  in  plans  with  respect  to  exploration  or  development  projects  or  capital  expenditures;  the  uncertainty  of 
reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses; failure to 
obtain  necessary  regulatory  approvals  for  planned  operations;  health,  safety  and  environmental  risks;  uncertainties 
resulting  from  potential  delays  or  changes  in  plans  with  respect  to  exploration  or  development  projects  or  capital 
expenditures;  volatility  of  commodity  prices,  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations;  imprecision  of  reserve  estimates; 
and competition from other explorers) as well as general economic conditions, stock market volatility; and the ability 
to access sufficient capital. We caution that the foregoing list of risks and uncertainties is not exhaustive.
In  addition,  the  reader  is  cautioned  that  historical  results  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  future  performance.  The 
forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not  intend, and 
does  not  assume  any  obligation,  to  update  or  revise  any  forward-looking  statements,  whether  as  a  result  of  new 
information, future events or otherwise unless expressly required by applicable securities laws.
Certain information set out herein may be considered as “financial outlook” within the meaning of applicable securities 
laws.  The  purpose  of  this  financial  outlook  is  to  provide  readers  with  disclosure  regarding  Kelt’s  reasonable 
expectations  as  to  the  anticipated  results  of  its  proposed  business  activities  for  the  periods  indicated.  Readers  are 
cautioned that the financial outlook may not be appropriate for other purposes.
GROWTH STRATEGY
The business plan of Kelt is to create sustainable and profitable growth as a participant in the oil and gas industry in 
Canada.  Kelt  seeks  to  identify  and  acquire  strategic  oil  and  gas  properties  where  it  believes  further  exploitation, 
development  and  exploration  opportunities  exist.  From  time  to  time,  Kelt  may  acquire  a  corporate  entity  in  order  to 
accomplish its oil and gas property acquisition strategy. In addition, Kelt implements a full cycle exploration program, 
resulting in exploration and development drilling based on opportunities generated internally.
Kelt is opportunity driven and is confident that it can grow its production base by building on its current inventory of 
development projects and by adding new exploration prospects. Kelt will endeavor to maintain a high quality product 
stream that on a historical basis receives a superior price with reasonably low production and transportation costs. In 
addition, the Company will focus its exploration efforts in areas of multi-zone hydrocarbon potential, primarily in west 
central Alberta and northeastern British Columbia. Kelt will continue to seek optimization of its asset base by building 
on its core properties and monetizing non-core assets.
SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS
  Kelt reported average production of 20,208 BOE per day for the three month period ended June 30, 2016, up 4% 
from  19,473  BOE  per  day  in  the  same  period  of  2015.  Average  production  during  the  second  quarter  of  2016 
was impacted by approximately 1,700 BOE per day of  downtime for planned facility  turnaround operations  and 
production disruptions due to forest fires near Fort St. John, BC.

The  Company  generated  funds  from  operations  of  $11.7  million  ($0.07  per  common  share,  diluted)  during  the 
second quarter of 2016, down 21% from $14.7 million ($0.10 per common share, diluted) in the second quarter 
of 2015, reflecting significantly lower realized oil and gas prices.
  Corporate  royalty  rates  averaged  7.5%  of  revenue  during  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  down  from  9.8%  in  the
second quarter of 2015.
  Production expenses averaged $8.87 per BOE during the three months ended June 30, 2016,  down 36% from
$13.95 per BOE in the second quarter of 2015 reflecting the Company’s operational initiatives.
  Kelt  continues  to  incur  below  industry  average  general  and  administrative  (“G&A”)  expenses,  which  averaged 
$0.86 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016 in comparison to $0.94 per BOE for the same quarter of 2015. G&A 
expense is reported net of standard overhead recoveries. Kelt does not capitalize any direct G&A expenses.

The  Company  incurred  capital  expenditures,  before  acquisitions,  of  $7.0 million  during  the  quarter  ended  June 
30, 2016, down 63% from $19.1 million in the same quarter 2015. Kelt did not drill any wells through spring break 
up during the second quarter and capital expenditures were incurred primarily on land and infrastructure.
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
  On April 28, 2016, the Company completed a strategic acquisition of assets in its core area at Progress, Alberta, 
for  cash  consideration  of  $18.9  million,  after  closing  adjustments.  The  acquisition  includes  approximately  600 
BOE per day of current production (60% light oil), 4,135 net acres of land, and infrastructure that is an integral 
part of Kelt’s existing light oil play at Progress.
  During  the  second  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  Kelt  reduced  its  bank  debt,  net  of  working  capital,  by  $91.2 
million  and  strengthened  its  liquidity  and  financial  position  through  the  completion  of  strategic  financing 
transactions:
o  On  April  7,  2016,  the  Company  closed  a  private  placement  of  4.7  million  common  shares  for  gross 
proceeds  of  $22.1  million.  The  common  shares  were  issued  on  a  “flow-through”  basis  in  respect  of 
Canadian development expenses at a price of $4.70 per share.
o  On  May  3,  2016,  the  Company  issued  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  5%  convertible  unsecured
subordinated debentures with a maturity date of May 31, 2021.
  As at June 30, 2016, the Company had drawn $127.0 million on its $185.0 million bank credit facility. Kelt is well 
positioned  to  execute  on  its  capital  expenditure  program  during  the  second  half  of  2016  and  has  sufficient 
financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

The Company reported average production of 21,751 BOE per day for the six months ended June 30, 2016, up 23% 
from 17,749 BOE for the first six months of 2015. The increase in average daily production reflects the Company’s 
successful drilling program and strategic acquisitions, partly offset by corporate declines. The Artek Acquisition, which 
closed  on  April  16,  2015,  added  approximately  5,400  BOE  per  day  of  production  at  the  time  of  the  acquisition  and 
contributed to the significant increase in NGLs production.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Average  production  of  20,208  BOE  per  day  reported  for  the  second  quarter  of  2016  declined  13%  compared  to 
record  production  of  23,295  BOE  per  day  achieved  during  the  first  quarter  of  2016.  The  decrease  reflects  planned 
turnaround  maintenance  at  the  Progress  Gas  Plant  completed  over  a  two  week  period  in  June,  along  with  the 
temporary  shut-in  of  the West  Stoddart  Gas  Plant  and  other  intermittent production disruptions  as  a  result  of  forest 
fires in the vicinity of Fort St. John, BC, during April and May. Kelt was able to mitigate certain production losses by 
diverting  approximately  50%  of  its  BC  gas  production  to  the  McMahon  Gas  Plant.  The  Company  estimates  that 
downtime reduced production by approximately 1,700 BOE per day, on average, during the second quarter of 2016.
The Company earned revenue before royalties and financial instruments of $40.7 million and $81.1 million during the 
three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Despite an increase in production volumes, revenues 
are  down  by  22%  and  11%,  respectively,  relative  to  the  corresponding  three and  six  month  periods  of  2015  due to 
significantly lower commodity prices in 2016 compared to 2015.
During  the  second  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  Kelt’s  combined  average  realized  price  was  $22.14  per  BOE,  up 
16% from $19.06 per BOE during the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The increase is due to improved realized oil 
and NGLs pricing, which more than offset lower realized gas prices.

Kelt realized an average price of $49.76 per barrel  for oil sales during the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, up 
46% from $34.01 per barrel during the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, 
Kelt’s realized oil price decreased by  16% from $59.02 per barrel. The variance in Kelt’s realized oil price  generally 
reflects the change in benchmark oil prices, which fell significantly from 2015 as global crude oil supplies surpassed 
demand. In addition, the Company’s realized oil price is discounted to benchmark oil prices as the base price paid by 
purchasers is adjusted for quality and is net of all applicable fees and deductions, including pipeline tariffs or location 
differentials. These tariffs and differentials vary depending on the delivery point, but do not fluctuate with oil prices.
The average discount of Kelt’s realized oil price  relative to the CLS reference price was $5.25 per barrel during the 
second quarter of 2016, compared to a discount of $7.21 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 and $9.86 per barrel in 
the  second  quarter  of  2015.  The  decrease  in  discount  during  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016  reflects  an 
improvement in contract pricing for the Company’s oil production at Karr, Alberta. In addition, Kelt’s realized price on 
its  BC  oil  production  improved  due  to  lower  pipeline  tariffs.  As  a  result  of  capacity  constraints  on  the  BC  Light 
pipeline,  Kelt  trucked  a  portion  of  its  BC production  volumes  to  terminals  in  Alberta  with  significantly  lower  pipeline 
tariffs.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
During the first six months of 2016, oil royalties averaged 12.9% of oil revenue, down from 14.8% of oil revenue in the 
same period of 2015. The decrease in Kelt’s average oil royalty rate is primarily due to lower oil prices.

(2) Source: Sproule Associates Limited.
(3) Average of Edmonton NGL prices during the period (2), weighted based on Kelt’s actual NGL sales volumes in each respective period.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company realized an average price for NGL sales of $18.21 per barrel, 
down 28% from $25.43 per barrel in the corresponding quarter of 2015. Kelt’s realized price for NGL sales is reported 
net  of  deductions,  primarily  transportation  and  fractionation  charges,  which  are  generally  a  fixed  dollar  amount  per 
unit under the NGLs purchase contracts, depending on the point of delivery. As these charges do not fluctuate with 
NGL prices, the impact of lower benchmark prices for NGLs on Kelt’s average realized price is more pervasive.
Kelt’s NGL sales volumes were weighted 27% pentane, 26% butane, 30% propane and 18% ethane for the second 
quarter  of  2016.  By  comparison,  NGL  sales  volumes  were  weighted  34%  pentane,  32% butane,  28%  propane  and 
5%  ethane  during  the  same  period  in  2015.  The  change  in  NGLs  product  mix  is  primarily  attributable  to  a  new 
marketing  arrangement  that  came  into  effect  in  November  2015,  resulting  in  higher  total  NGL  recoveries  on 
Company’s production originating from the West Stoddart Gas Plant in northeastern BC. The arrangement results in 
a  higher  shrink  of  its  BC  gas  production,  however,  the  price  realized  on  additional  NGL  barrels  extracted  is  at  a 
premium to the Station 2 gas price.
NGL royalties averaged 2.5% during the six months ended June 30, 2016, down from 10.6% during the same period 
of  2015.  NGL  royalties  are  reduced  by  the  pro-rata  amount  of  gas  cost  allowance  credits  allocated  to  NGLs 
production, which do not fluctuate with NGL prices.

calculated based on monthly average US$ price and the monthly average CA$/US$ exchange rate. Comparative information is not presented as the 
relevant contracts came into effect December 1, 2015.
The Company realized an average gas sales price of $1.97 per MCF during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, down 
31% from $2.85 per MCF during the quarter ended June 30, 2015. By comparison, the AECO 5A gas index price fell 
by  47%  over  the  same  period,  and  averaged  $1.33  per  GJ  during  the  second  quarter  of  2016.  Kelt  receives  a 
premium  to  the  AECO  5A  gas  index  price  due  to  the  higher  heat  content  of  its  gas  production,  and  has  marketing 
arrangements  in  place  whereby  the  Company  receives  Chicago  City-Gates  pricing  on  a  portion  of  its  gas  sales 
volumes.
Effective December 1, 2015, Kelt entered into gas sales agreements in BC and Alberta with 22,803 MMBTU per day 
of firm transportation on the Alliance pipeline, pursuant to which, Kelt receives Chicago City-Gates pricing (additional 
information is provided under the heading of “Contractual Obligations”). The Canadian dollar equivalent Chicago City-
Gates price averaged $2.75 per MMBTU for the first six months of 2016, representing a significant premium to AECO 
5A and Station 2 prices. Approximately two-thirds of the Company’s gas production from its Inga-Fireweed-Stoddart 
assets was sold under these contracts during the first half of 2016, resulting in stronger realized prices compared to 
previous periods in which the majority of Kelt’s BC gas production was sold at Station 2 or CREC prices. The impact 
of  the  higher  realized  gas  price  on  Kelt’s  funds  from  operations  is  partially  offset  by  higher  tolls  on  the  Alliance 
pipeline, which are included in transportation expenses.
Gas  royalties  were  nominal  for  the  second  quarter  ended  of  2016  compared  to  5.8%  during  the  previous  quarter 
ended June 30, 2015. Lower gas royalties reflect the significant decrease in gas reference prices as well as gas cost 
allowance credits which do not fluctuate with gas prices.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Kelt  achieved  a  36%  reduction  in  per  unit  production  expenses  of  $8.87  per  BOE  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016, 
compared to $13.95 per BOE for the second quarter of 2015. Production expenses during the second quarter ended 
June 30, 2015 were impacted by high initial integration costs associated with the Artek Acquisition. The decrease in 
total  and  per  unit  production  expenses  reflects  Kelt’s  operational  initiatives  and  previous  expenditures  to  construct 
and acquire strategic infrastructure.

(1) The presentation of comparative information has been revised. Details regarding the reclassification are set-forth under the heading of “Change in 
Classification of Certain Production and Transportation Expenses” in this MD&A.
The  Company’s  per  unit  transportation  expenses  averaged  $2.89  per  BOE  in  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  up  17% 
from $2.48 per BOE in the same quarter of the previous year. Higher gas transportation costs more than offset lower 
oil transportation expenses.
Kelt has invested in infrastructure in its core areas and entered into oil marketing and transportation arrangements to 
pipeline  connect  the  majority  of  the  Company’s  oil  production,  reducing  reliance  on  trucking.  This  has  resulted  in 
significant  savings,  as  oil  trucking  has  historically  been  unpredictable  and  expensive  due  to  long  wait  times.  The 
Company’s  oil  transportation expenses  averaged  $2.00  per  barrel  for  the  quarter  ended June 30,  2016, down  56% 
from $4.51 per barrel during the  quarter ended June 30, 2015. Average oil transportation expenses increased  16% 
from  $1.73  per  barrel  reported  for  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  as  the  Company  was  temporarily  required  to  truck  a 
portion of its BC oil production due to capacity constraints on the BC Light pipeline during the second quarter of 2016. 
The  impact  of  higher  oil  trucking  expenses  on  operating  netbacks  was  relatively  neutral  as  Kelt  realized  higher  oil 
prices due to lower pipeline tariffs.
The Company’s firm commitments for gas transportation on the Alliance pipeline came into effect December 1, 2015. 
Kelt  incurs  higher  transportation  expenses  on  these  volumes,  however,  the  tolls  are  more  than  offset  by  higher 
realized  gas  prices  as  Kelt  receives  Chicago  City-Gates  pricing,  providing  a  premium  to  the  gas  price  previously 
realized at CREC and Station 2.

(1)  Interest  expense  used  in  the  calculation  of  “Interest  expense  per  BOE”  includes  interest  and  fees  on  bank  debt  and  accrued  cash  interest  on 
convertible debentures.
The  Company’s  financing  expenses  increased  due  to  higher  total  debt  levels  in  2016,  partly  attributed  to  the 
assumption  of  corporate  indebtedness  on  the  Artek  Acquisition,  compounded  by  the  rapid  decline  in  commodity 
prices.
During  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  Kelt  reduced  borrowings  under  its  revolving  bank  credit  facility  using  the  net 
proceeds  of  the  offering  of  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  convertible  unsecured  subordinated  debentures  (the
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
“Debentures”).  The  Debentures  mature  on  May  31,  2021  and  bear  interest  at  5.0%  per  annum,  payable  semi-
annually on May 31st and November 30th, commencing November 30, 2016. Financing expense for the quarter ended 
June  30,  2016  includes  $0.7  million  of  accrued  cash  interest  and  $0.5  million  of  non-cash  accretion  expense.  The 
carrying  value  allocated  to  the  liability  component  of  the  Debentures  is  accreted  to  its  principal  amount  of  $90.0 
million over the five year term to maturity, using the effective interest rate method.
The  Company  has  a  revolving  committed  term  credit  facility  (the  “Credit  Facility”)  with  a  syndicate  of  financial 
intuitions. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, amounts drawn under the Credit Facility were primarily in the 
form  of  bankers’  acceptances  (“BAs”).  Kelt’s  average  interest  rate  on  outstanding  bank  indebtedness  increased  in 
2016 as higher stamping fees on BAs more than offset the decrease in the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”) 
compared to 2015. Under the Credit Facility, BA stamping fees fluctuate based on a pricing grid and range from 2.0% 
to  3.5%,  depending  upon  the  Company’s  debt  to  cash  flow  ratio  of  between  less  than  one  and  one  tenth  times  to 
greater than three times. Fees on bank debt include commitment fees and standby charges on the undrawn facility.
Additional  information  regarding  the  Credit  Facility  and  Debentures  is  provided  under  the  heading  of  “Capital 
Resources and Liquidity”.
Accretion  expense  on  decommissioning  obligations  is  a  measure  of  the  increase  in  the  present  value  of  the 
decommissioning obligation due to the passage of time. The increase in accretion expense  for the six month period 
ended  June  30,  2016  relative  to  the  same  period  of  2015,  is  primarily  due  to  the  increase  in  the  carrying  value  of 
decommissioning obligations related to the Artek Acquisition.

The Company incurred total G&A expenses, before recoveries, of $5.2 million during the first six months of 2016, up 
20% from the same period of 2015, in conjunction with the Company’s significant growth.  On a per unit basis, gross 
G&A  expenses  are  relatively  unchanged  at  $1.32  per  BOE  (before  recoveries)  due  to  management’s  continued 
efforts to maintain a low cost structure.
G&A expenses are reported net of overhead recoveries, however, Kelt does not capitalize any direct G&A expenses. 
On a per unit basis, net G&A expense was $0.86 per BOE for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, down 9% from the 
second  quarter  of  2015  as  a  result  of  higher  operating  overhead  recoveries.  Kelt  earned  lower  capital  overhead 
recoveries  in  the  current  year  due  to  significantly  lower  capital  expenditures  resulting  in  an  increase  in  net  G&A 
expenses per BOE during the six month period ended June 30, 2016.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Total  SBC  expense  decreased  in  the  three  and  six  month  periods  ended  June  30,  2016,  as  the  fair  value  of  new 
stock options and RSUs granted is lower than previous periods. The significant decrease in SBC expense on a per 
unit basis reflects management’s objective to provide long term incentives to employees and grow production, while 
minimizing the dilutive impact to shareholders. As at June 30, 2016, stock options and RSUs outstanding  represent 
5.1% of total shares outstanding (4.7% of total shares outstanding at December 31, 2015).

Exploration and evaluation expenses relate to the expiry of non-core land holdings as the Company focuses on the 
development of its core areas. The majority of the mineral leases expired during the six months ended June 30, 2016, 
were acquired through corporate acquisitions.

The  Company  calculates  depletion  of  development  and  production  (“D&P”)  assets  based  on  production  relative  to 
total  proved  reserves,  for  each  depletion  unit.  The  increase  in  the  absolute  level  of  depletion  expense  for  the  six 
months ended June 30, 2016 is due to an increase in the carrying value of assets subject to depletion, resulting from 
capital expenditures and acquisitions, in particular, the Artek Acquisition on April 16, 2015. The decrease in depletion 
expense  per  BOE  is  attributed  an  impairment  of  PP&E  at  December  31,  2015  which  reduced  the  carrying  value  of 
D&P assets subject to depletion by $64.1 million. The impairment was a result of lower commodity prices, however, 
Kelt’s total proved reserves volumes increased year over year.
GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS
On  March  31,  2016,  the  Company  completed  a  disposition  of  certain  non-core  assets  located  at  Boundary  Lake  in 
northwestern Alberta, for cash consideration of $1.1 million (before closing adjustments) and reported a gain of $2.1 
million.  The  carrying  amount  of  decommissioning  obligations  disposed  was  $2.4  million,  which  exceeded  the  $1.4 
million combined carrying amount of the E&E and D&P assets. At the time of disposition, production from the assets 
was approximately 16 BOE per day.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company may, from time to time, enter into fixed price contracts and derivative financial instruments with respect 
to oil and gas sales, currency exchange and interest rates in order to secure a certain amount of cash flow to protect 
a  desired  level  of  capital  spending.  Fair  value  accounting  for  derivative  financial  instruments  may  cause  significant 
fluctuations  in  the  reported  amounts  of  derivative  financial  instrument  assets  and  liabilities  as  at  the  Statement  of 
Financial Position date and the resultant magnitude of unrealized gains and losses.

The Company has an interest rate swap fixing the CDOR rate at 0.925% on a notional $100.0 million per month from 
July 2015 to June 2017. The CDOR rate averaged 0.918% during the second quarter of 2016, resulting in a nominal 
realized loss in the period.

If  the  CDOR rate  increases  (decreases)  by  10  basis  points,  the  fair market  value  of  the  interest  rate  swap contract 
would increase (decrease) by approximately $0.1 million.
Natural gas contracts
During  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  entered  into  a  financial  derivative  contract  to  fix  the  basis 
differential  between  the  Chicago  Monthly  Index  and  AECO  7A  at  US$0.96  per  MMBTU  on  a  notional  of  10,000 
MMBTU per day for the period from June to October 2016. The actual differential was US$0.91 per MMBTU for the 
June contract month, which resulted in a nominal realized loss recognized in the second quarter of 2016.

If  the  NYMEX-AECO  5A  basis  differential  increased  (decreased)  by  $0.10/MMBTU,  the  fair  market  value  of

Foreign exchange contracts
Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company entered a forward foreign exchange swaption contract 
whereby  the  counterparty  has  the  right,  if  exercised  on  December  30,  2016,  to  enter  a  series  of  forward  foreign 
exchange  transactions  fixing  the  exchange  rate  at  CA$/US$1.33  from  January  to  December  2017,  on  a  notional 
amount  of  US$1.0  million  per  month.  In  consideration  for  the  swaption,  Kelt  received  a  cash  premium  of  $0.255 
million at the time of entering into the contract.

INCOME TAXES
Kelt was not required to pay income taxes  in the current or prior periods as the Company had sufficient income tax 
deductions  available  to  shelter  taxable  income.  Tax  deductions  available  as  of  June  30,  2016  are  estimated  to  be 
approximately $994.3 million (December 31, 2015 - $958.0 million).

The  consolidated  combined  federal  and  provincial  statutory  tax  rate  averaged  26.6%  during  the  first  six  months  of 
2016,  up  from  26.0%  during  the  six  month  ended  June  30,  2015.  Effective  July  1,  2015,  the  Alberta  government 
increased  the  general  corporate  tax  rate  from  10%  to  12%.  The  impact  of  the  increase  in  future  tax  rates  was 
recognized during the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, resulting in a $4.5 million reduction in the deferred tax 
recovery, partly contributing to the low effective tax recovery rate in the comparative periods. A  detailed analysis of 
the provision for deferred income taxes is included in note 13 of the consolidated interim financial statements, which 
includes  a  reconciliation  of  the  difference  between  the  deferred  income  tax  recovery  reported  relative  to  expected 
recovery calculated based on the statutory tax rate.
PROFIT (LOSS) AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
Kelt reported a loss of $20.4 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016. By comparison, Kelt reported a loss 
of  $10.0  million  in  the  corresponding  period  of  2015,  which  includes  a  $15.9  million  gain  on  acquisition  and  $2.3 
million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Artek in April of 2015.

(1) The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of stock options and RSUs. Under this method, only “in-the-money” 
dilutive instruments impact the calculation  of diluted  profit  per common share.  In  computing the  diluted loss  per  common share for the  three  and six 
month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company excluded the effect of stock options and RSUs as they were anti-dilutive. Therefore, the 
diluted weighted average is equal to the basic weighted average shares outstanding.
(2)  The  common  shares  potentially  issuable  on  conversion  of  the  Debentures  are  excluded  from  the  calculation  of  diluted  weighted  average  shares 
outstanding as they were anti-dilutive for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS
The Company generated funds from operations of $11.7 million ($0.07 per common share, diluted) during the second 
quarter  of  2016,  down  from  $14.7  million  ($0.09  per  common  share,  diluted)  in  the  same  quarter  of  2015.  The 
significant decline in commodity prices resulted in lower revenues during the three and six month periods ended June 
30, 2016. However, Kelt’s realized prices for oil and gas strengthened, on a relative basis, compared to the CLS and 
AECO  reference  prices  in  the  period.  The  Company  mitigated  the  continued  weakness  in  commodity  prices  with  a 
$5.08 per BOE reduction in production expenses, reflecting the Company’s ongoing cost savings initiatives, and also 
benefited from a $1.26 per BOE reduction in royalties.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Kelt  is  committed  to  future  growth  through  its  strategy  to  implement  a  full-cycle  exploration  and  development 
program.  In  addition,  Kelt  seeks  to  identify  and  acquire  strategic  oil  and  gas  properties  where  it  believes  further 
exploitation, development and exploration opportunities exist.

The  Company  incurred  capital  expenditures,  before  A&D,  of  $7.0  million  during  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016, 
down 63% from $19.1 million in the same quarter 2015. Kelt did not drill any wells through spring break up during the 
second  quarter  and  capital  expenditures  were  allocated  primarily  to  land  and  infrastructure.  Capital  expenditures 
include costs for the scheduled turnaround of the non-operated Progress Gas Plant, as well as the expansion of the 
Company’s  facilities  at  Karr,  including  natural  gas  refrigeration  and  construction  of  a  fuel  gas  supply  line  to  a  third 
party  power  generation  plant  in  the  Karr  area.  The  Company  continues  to  be  active  at  land  sales  and  spent  $1.2 
million on Crown lease acquisitions during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Property acquisitions
On April 28, 2016, the Company closed an acquisition of oil and gas assets in its core area at Progress, Alberta, for 
cash consideration of $18.9 million,  after closing adjustments.  The  acquisition  includes approximately  600  BOE  per 
day  of current production  (60%  light oil),  4,135  net  acres  of  land, and  infrastructure  that is an integral  part  of  Kelt’s 
existing  light  oil  play  at  Progress.  Further  information  on  the  Progress  acquisition  is  contained  in  note  5  to  the 
condensed interim financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2016.
Acquisition of Artek Exploration Ltd.
On  April  16,  2015,  the  Company  closed  the  acquisition  of  Artek  by  acquiring  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding 
common shares of Artek on the basis of 0.34 of a Kelt common share for each Artek common share, resulting in the 
issuance  of  26,900,375  common  shares  of  Kelt  to  the  former  shareholders  of  Artek.  The  Artek  Acquisition  was 
completed  by  way  of  a  statutory  plan  of  arrangement  under  the  Business  Corporations  Act  (Alberta),  pursuant  to 
which,  Artek  common  shares  were  delisted  from  the  TSX  and  Artek  became  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Kelt. 
Immediately following the Arrangement, a name change was effected to change the name of Artek to Kelt Exploration 
(LNG)  Ltd.  The  acquisition  of  Artek  consolidated  the  majority  of  Kelt’s  land  acreage  in  its  Inga-Fireweed-Stoddart,

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
British  Columbia core  area  to  100%  working  interest  and  is  consistent  with  the  Company’s  strategy  to  operate  and 
control all of its major core exploration and development prospects. In addition, Kelt’s acquisition of Artek resulted in 
100% ownership by Kelt in key infrastructure including compression facilities and pipelines in northeastern BC.
The Artek Acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, 
whereby  the  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  were  recorded  at  the  fair  value  on  the  acquisition  date  of 
April  16,  2015.  Certain  comparative  information  within  this  MD&A,  including  the  gain  on  acquisition,  loss  and 
comprehensive loss, total capital expenditures, total assets, working capital deficiency, and shareholders’  equity, has 
been revised to reflect all purchase price adjustments made within the measurement period as if  the information was 
known as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair value of the consideration

(1) Pursuant to IFRS 3, the fair value of common share consideration is measured based on the share price on the closing date of the acquisition. The 
share  exchange  ratio  of  0.34  was  negotiated  based  on  the  volume  weighted  average  trading  price  of  Kelt  common  shares  that  traded  on  the  TSX 
during  the  five  day  period  ended  February  20,  2015  of  $8.10  per  share.  If  the  negotiated  price  of  $8.10  per  share  was  used,  the  common  share 
consideration would be valued at $217.9 million.
(2) Artek and Kelt were partners in joint operations. The settlement of the pre-existing relationship relates to $6.6 million of accounts payable by Kelt to 
Artek, net of $1.9 million of accounts receivable by Kelt from Artek, which were extinguished upon completion of the arrangement.
(3) The net working capital deficit includes $7.0 million of accounts receivable and accrued revenue, $0.4 million of deposits, $12.8 million of accounts 
payable  and  accrued  liabilities  (includes  $0.9  million  of  additional  royalties  payable  resulting  from  the  BC  Royalty  Audit)  and  $13.7  million  of  bank 
overdraft.  Pursuant  to  the  change  in  control  provisions  in  Artek’s  credit  agreement,  Artek’s  demand  loan  credit  facility,  on  which  $82.1  million  was 
outstanding as of the closing date, was repaid and terminated by Kelt at closing using borrowings available under Kelt’s Credit Facility.
(4) The Company recognized a gain on the acquisition of Artek as the total fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration 
paid  for  Artek’s  shares  by  $15.9  million.  The  gain  has  been  revised  from  $16.8  million  previously  reported  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  annual 
financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of the BC Royalty Audit.
In March 2016, the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mining (“BC Ministry”) completed a petroleum and natural 
gas  by-products  royalty  audit,  focused  on  NGLs  and  Sulphur  Crown  royalties,  for  the  years  2011  to  2014  (the  “BC 
Royalty  Audit”).  As  a  result  of  the  BC  Royalty  Audit,  it  was  determined  that  Artek’s  share  of  Crown  royalties  were 
miscalculated and underpaid by Artek for the years 2011 to 2014, resulting in a net settlement of approximately $0.9 
million  payable  to  the  BC  Ministry.  If  known  at  the  time  of  acquisition,  the  additional  royalties  payable  to  the  BC 
Ministry would have resulted in the recognition of additional liabilities as at April 16, 2015 and a reduction in the gain 
recorded on acquisition of Artek by approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, 
comparative  period  amounts  previously  reported  for  the  Artek  Acquisition  were  revised  in  the  consolidated  interim 
financial  statements  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2016  to  reflect  the  final  allocation  of  the  purchase  price  as  at 
April 16, 2015.

Kelt’s capital management objective is to maintain a flexible capital structure to allow the Company to execute on its 
capital  investment  program  and  strategic  growth  plan,  which  may  include  opportunistic  acquisitions  if  significant 
upside  potential  exists.  The  Company  strives  to  actively  manage  its  capital  structure  in  response  to  changes  in 
economic  conditions  and  the  risk  characteristics  of  its  underlying  oil  and  natural  gas  assets.  As  at  June  30,  2016, 
Kelt’s  capital  structure  was  comprised  of  shareholders’  capital,  convertible  debentures,  bank  debt  and  working 
capital.
The Board of Directors approves an annual capital expenditures budget which is regularly monitored and updated as 
necessary  in  response  to  changing  capital  requirements.  Kelt  actively  manages  the  pace  of  its  capital  spending 
program by monitoring forecasted production and commodity prices and resulting cash flows. The Company’s capital 
expenditures in the first six months of 2016 were funded by cash provided by operating activities, the net proceeds of 
an  equity  private  placement,  and  bank  debt.  Future  capital  expenditures  are  expected  to  be  funded  through  a 
combination of cash flow from operations and bank debt, supplemented with new equity or debt offerings if required.
The  Company  monitors  its  capital  structure  and  short-term  financing  requirements  using  a  net  bank  debt  to  trailing 
funds from operations ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(1) The current portion of bank debt of $10.0 million is included in “Bank debt” and excluded from the “Working capital deficiency”,
(2) Comparative information for the year ended December 31, 2015 has been revised. Details regarding the revision are provided under the heading of 
“Capital Expenditures”. Kelt previously reported a debt to trailing funds from operation ratio of 4.7 times as at December 31, 2015.
(3) Funds from operations is a non-GAAP measure which is calculated as cash provided by operating activities, before transaction costs, provisions for 
potential credit losses, settlement of decommissioning obligations and changes in non-cash operating working capital.
(4) Trailing funds from operations is annualized based on the most recent quarter’s funds from operations.
Kelt targets a net bank debt to trailing funds from operations ratio of less than 2.0 times, however, during periods of 
low  commodity  prices,  the  Company  may  exceed  this  target.  Despite  the  continued  weakness  in  commodity  prices 
through the first half of 2016, Kelt reduced its net bank debt to trailing funds from operations ratio  from 4.8 times at 
December  31,  2015  to  3.0  times  as  at  June  30,  2016.  The  reduction  in  net  bank  debt  was  achieved  through  the 
completion of strategic financing transactions including the issuance of $90.0 million principal amount of  convertible 
unsecured subordinated debentures with a maturity date of May 31, 2021. In addition,  the Company closed a private 
placement of 4.7 million common shares for gross proceeds of $22.1 million on April 7, 2016. The common shares 
were issued on a “flow-through” basis in respect of Canadian development expenses at a price of $4.70 per share.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
In  response  to  the  current  business  environment  of  low  commodity  prices,  Kelt  has  taken  action  to  preserve  its 
balance sheet and maintain liquidity over the long-term. In particular, the Company has moderated the pace of capital 
spending  and  short-term  growth  trajectory  (compared  to  historical  levels).  Kelt’s  management  and  employees 
continue to focus on cost saving initiatives, both corporately and at the field level. The Company expects its net bank 
debt to trailing funds from operations ratio will decrease  to 2.5 times at December 31, 2016 (assumes $54 million of 
funds  from  operations  for  2016  and  net  bank  debt  of  $137  million  at  December  31,  2016).  Refer  to  additional 
information under the heading of “Outlook and Guidance” and to advisories regarding forward-looking statements.
The capital intensive nature of Kelt’s operations may create a working capital deficiency position during periods with 
high  levels  of capital investment.  However,  during  such  periods,  the  Company  strives  to  maintain sufficient  unused 
bank  credit  lines  to  satisfy  such  working  capital  deficiencies.  As  at  June  30,  2016,  the  Company’s  working  capital 
deficit,  excluding  current  bank  debt,  of  $12.1  million  combined  with  outstanding  bank  debt  of  $127.0  million, 
represented 75% of the authorized borrowing amount available under the Credit Facility of $185.0 million.
Credit Facility
At June 30, 2016, the Company has a revolving committed term credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. 
As at June 30, 2016, the authorized borrowing amount available under the Credit Facility was $185.0  million. As part 
of the semi-annual borrowing base review completed on May 31, 2016, all of the lenders, other than a single lender 
representing $10.0 million of the total commitment amount (the “Term Lender”), agreed to extend the revolving period 
to April 29, 2017. The Company is obligated to pay out the Term Lender in full on April 28, 2017. The Credit Facility is 
available for a revolving period of 364 days, maturing on  April 29, 2017, and may be extended for an additional 364 
days at the discretion of the lenders, with a term-out to April 27, 2018 if not renewed.
The Credit Facility is subject to semi-annual borrowing base reviews, occurring approximately in April and November 
of  each  year. In  the  event  that  the  lenders  reduced the  borrowing  base  below  the  amount  drawn  at  the time  of the 
redetermination, the Company would have 60 days to eliminate any borrowing base shortfall by repaying the amount 
drawn  in  excess  of  the  re-determined  borrowing  base  or  by  providing  additional  security  or  other  consideration 
satisfactory to the lenders. Repayments of principal are not required provided that the borrowings under the facility do 
not exceed the authorized borrowing amount and the Company is in compliance with all covenants, representations 
and warranties.
There  are  no  financial  covenants  under  the  Credit  Facility  and  Kelt  is  in  compliance  with  all  other  covenants. 
Covenants  include  industry  standard  positive  and  negative  covenants  including  reporting  requirements,  permitted 
indebtedness, permitted dispositions (to a maximum in each calendar year which are in the aggregate not more than 
5%  of  the  borrowing  base  then  in  effect),  permitted  risk management  activities,  permitted  encumbrances  and other 
standard business operating covenants. Security is provided for by a first fixed and floating charge debenture over all 
assets in the amount of $800.0 million and general assignment of book debts.
Convertible debentures
On  May  3,  2016,  the  Company  issued  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  convertible  unsecured  subordinated 
debentures  (the  “Debentures”)  for  net  proceeds  of  $86.4  million.  The  Debentures  mature  on  May  31,  2021  (the 
“Maturity  Date”)  and  bear  interest  at  5.0%  per  annum  payable  semi-annually  on  May  31st  and  November  30th, 
commencing November 30, 2016. At the holder’s option, the Debentures may be converted into common shares of 
the Company at any time prior to the close of business on the earlier of the business day immediately preceding (i) 
the  Maturity  Date,  (ii)  if  called  for  redemption,  the  date  fixed  for  redemption  by  the  Company,  or  (iii)  if  called  for 
repurchase  in  the  event  of  a  change  of  control,  the  payment  date,  at  a  conversion  price  of  $5.50  per  share  (the 
“Conversion Price”), being a conversion rate of approximately 181.8182 common shares per $1,000 principal amount 
of Debentures, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The Debentures are redeemable by the Company after May 31, 2019 and prior to May 31, 2020, in whole or in part, 
from time to time, on not more than 60 days and not less than 40 days prior notice at a redemption price equal to their 
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the date set for redemption, provided 
that  the  volume  weighted  average  trading  price  of  the  common  shares  on  the  TSX  for  the  20  consecutive  trading 
days ending five trading days (the “Current Market Price”) prior to the date on which notice of redemption is provided 
is  at  least  125% of  the  Conversion  Price.  On  or after  May  31,  2020  and  prior  to the  Maturity  Date,  the  Debentures 
may be redeemed by the Company, in whole or in part, from time to time, on not more than 60 days and not less than
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
40 days prior notice at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up 
to but excluding the date set for redemption.
The Company may, at its option, elect to satisfy its obligation to repay all or any portion of the principal amount of the 
Debentures upon redemption or due at maturity, by issuing common shares instead of cash (subject to the receipt of 
any  required  regulatory  approvals  and  provided  that  no  event  of  default  has  occurred).  The  number  of  common 
shares to be issued would obtained by dividing the principal amount of the Debentures by 95% of the Current Market 
Price on the date fixed for redemption or maturity, as applicable.
The liability component of the Debentures was recognized initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not 
have  an  equity  conversion  option,  which  was  calculated  based  on  a  market  interest  rate  of  10.5%.  The  difference 
between  the  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  the  Debentures  and  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  component  was 
recognized in shareholders’ equity, net of deferred income taxes. Transaction costs directly attributable to the offering 
of  $3.6  million  were  allocated  to  the  liability  and  equity  components  of  the  Debentures  proportionately  at  $2.8  and 
$0.7 million, respectively. The liability component of the Debentures is measured at amortized cost using the effective 
interest method and is accreted each period, such that the carrying value will equal the principal amount outstanding 
on  the  Maturity  Date.  The  equity  component  is  not  re-measured  subsequent  to  initial  recognition.  The  carrying 
amounts  of  the  liability  and  equity  components  of  the  Debentures  are  reclassified  to  shareholders’  capital  on 
conversion to common shares.
The Debentures trade on the TSX under the symbol “KEL.DB”.
Shareholder’s capital
The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares and an unlimited number of preferred 
shares. As at June 30, 2016 there were 174.2 million common shares issued and outstanding (as at August 9, 2016, 
there are 174.2 million common shares outstanding). There are no preferred shares issued or outstanding.
As at June 30, 2016, officers, directors, and employees have been granted options to purchase  8.2 million common 
shares  of the  Company  at  an  average  exercise  price  of  $6.64  per common  share.  In  addition,  there  are  0.7 million 
RSUs  outstanding.  Options  and  RSUs  outstanding  at  June  30,  2016  represented  5.1%  of  total  common  shares 
issued and outstanding. Additional information regarding the Company’s stock options and RSUs is included in  note 
12 of the consolidated interim financial statements.
The Company’s common shares trade on the TSX under the symbol “KEL”.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Over  the  past  two  years,  the  Company  has  increased  its  production  through  the  efficient  execution  of  its  capital 
program as well as by completing strategic acquisitions in its core areas, including the Artek Acquisition on April 16, 
2015. In addition to cash provided by operating activities, the Company’s capital expenditures were funded primarily 
through equity financings, and supplemented by bank debt. The fourth quarter of 2014 marked the beginning of the 
rapid, industry wide decline in commodity prices. The effect of which is clearly reflected in the Company’s operating 
results and financial position in subsequent quarters. Notably, the loss reported in the fourth quarter of 2015 includes 
an impairment of PP&E of $64.1 million and an impairment of goodwill of $18.2 million, which were both triggered by 
the significant decrease in forecast commodity prices as at December 31, 2015. Refer to the “Results of Operations” 
section of this MD&A for further discussion. Additional information relating to Kelt, including the Company’s MD&A for 
previous quarters, is filed on SEDAR and can be viewed at www.sedar.com.
NON-GAAP MEASURES
This document contains certain financial measures, as described below, which  do not have standardized meanings 
prescribed by GAAP. As these measures are commonly used in the oil and gas industry, the Company believes that 
their inclusion is useful to investors. The reader is cautioned that these amounts may not be directly comparable to 
measures for other companies where similar terminology is used.
“Operating  income”  is  calculated  by  deducting  royalties,  production  expenses  and  transportation  expenses  from  oil 
and gas revenue, after realized gains or losses on associated financial instruments. The Company refers to operating 
income expressed per unit of production as an “Operating netback”. “Funds from operations” is calculated by adding 
back transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions, provisions for potential credit losses, settlement 
of decommissioning obligations and the change in non-cash operating working capital to cash provided by operating 
activities. Funds from operations per common share is calculated on a consistent basis with profit (loss) per common 
share,  using  basic  and  diluted  weighted  average  common  shares  as  determined  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Funds 
from  operations  and  operating  income  or  netbacks  are  used  by  Kelt  as  key  measures  of  performance  and  are  not 
intended  to  represent  operating  profits  nor  should  they  be  viewed  as  an  alternative  to  cash  provided  by  operating 
activities, profit or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
“Production  per  common share”  is  calculated  by dividing  total  production  by  the  basic  weighted  average  number  of 
common shares outstanding, as determined in accordance with GAAP.
Throughout  this  MD&A,  the  term  “net  bank  debt”  is  used  synonymously  with,  and  is  equal  to,  “bank  debt,  net  of 
working  capital”.  “Net  bank  debt”  is  calculated  by  adding  the  working  capital  deficiency  to  bank  debt.  The  working 
capital deficiency  is  equal to  total current  assets  net  of  total  current  liabilities,  excluding  the  current portion  of  bank 
debt.  The  Company  uses  a  “net  bank  debt  to  trailing  funds  from  operations  ratio”  as  a  benchmark  on  which 
management monitors the Company’s capital structure and short-term financing requirements. Management believes 
that  this  ratio,  which  is  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure,  provides  investors  with  information  to  understand  the 
Company’s  liquidity  risk.  The “net  bank  debt  to  trailing  funds  from  operations  ratio” is also  indicative  of  the  “debt  to 
cash  flow”  calculation  used  to  determine  the  applicable  margin  for  a  quarter  under  the  Company’s  Credit  Facility 
agreement (though the calculation may not always be a precise match, it is representative).
OTHER MEASUREMENTS
All  dollar  amounts  are  referenced  in  thousands  of  Canadian  dollars,  except  when  noted  otherwise.  This  MD&A 
contains  various  references  to  the  abbreviation  BOE  which  means  barrels  of  oil  equivalent.  Where  amounts  are 
expressed on a BOE basis, natural gas volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at six thousand cubic feet 
per  barrel  and  sulphur  volumes  have  been  converted  to  oil  equivalence  at  0.6  long  tons  per  barrel.  The  term  BOE 
may  be  misleading,  particularly  if  used  in  isolation.  A  BOE  conversion  ratio  of  six  thousand  cubic  feet  per  barrel  is 
based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a 
value equivalency at the wellhead and is significantly different than the value ratio based on the current price of crude 
oil and natural gas. This conversion factor is an industry accepted norm and is not based on either energy content or 
current  prices.  References  to  oil  in  this  MD&A  include  crude  oil  and  field  condensate.  References  to  natural  gas 
liquids (“NGLs”) include pentane, butane, propane, and ethane. References to gas in this discussion include natural 
gas and sulphur. Such abbreviation may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.
SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The  timely  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amount  of  assets,  liabilities,  income 
and expenses. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
Estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are 
recognized  in  the  period  in  which  the  estimates  are  reviewed  and  for  any  future  years  affected.  The  significant 
judgments, estimates and assumptions made by management in the interim financial statements are outlined in note 
2  of  the  December  31,  2015 annual  financial  statements.  Except  as  outlined  below,  there  have  been  no  significant 
changes in the Company’s judgments and estimates applied during the interim period ended  June 30, 2016 relative 
to those described in the most recent annual financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Acquisition of Artek Exploration Ltd.
In  March  of  2016,  the  British  Columbia  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mining  (“BC  Ministry”)  completed  a  petroleum  and 
natural gas by-products royalty audit which resulted in Kelt recording a revision to previously reported amounts for the 
Artek  Acquisition.  Refer  to  the  “Capital  Expenditures”  section  of  this  MD&A  for  additional  information  regarding  the 
revision recognized during the previous quarter ended March 31, 2016.
Convertible debentures
During  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  issued  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  convertible 
debentures  that  bear  interest  at  a  fixed  rate  of  5%  per  annum  (refer  to  additional  information  regarding  the 
Debentures  under  the  heading  of  “Capital  Resources  and  Liquidity”).  Calculation  of  the  fair  value  of  the  liability 
component  of  the  Debentures  requires  significant  judgement  with  respect  to  the  determination  of  a  market  interest 
rate for similar debt instruments without a conversion option. A change in the market rate of interest would impact the 
fair  value  allocated  to  the  liability  and  equity  components  on  initial  recognition,  deferred  income  taxes,  and 
subsequent  finance  expense  related  to  the  accretion  of  the  liability  component  recorded  in  profit  or  loss.  The 
Company’s  calculation  of  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  component  assumes  a  market  interest  rate  of  10.5%.  If  the 
estimated market interest rate increased (decreased) by 0.5% the fair value of the liability component would decrease
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.
23
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
(increase)  by  approximately  $1.5  million  and  the  fair  value  of  the  equity  component,  net  of  deferred  taxes,  would 
increase (decrease) by approximately $1.1 million.
CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES
During the previous year ended December 31, 2015, the Company reclassified certain charges that were previously 
presented as transportation expenses to production expenses. The Company concluded that a portion of the charges 
being  incurred  pursuant  to  a  firm  transportation  contract  and  gas  sales  agreement  related  to  upstream  services, 
primarily gas gathering and processing fees, which are more appropriately presented as a production expense rather 
than  transportation  expense.  The  adjustment,  which  was  recognized  in  the  Company’s  financial  statements  during 
the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  resulted  in  a  total  reclassification  of  production  and  transportation  expenses  previously 
reported  by  $1.8  million  for  the  nine  month  period  ended  September  30,  2015.  The  reclassification  has  a  net  nil 
impact on cash flow provided by operating activities and profit (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) reported for 
the periods.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
BUSINESS RISKS
The  business of  exploration, development,  production  and acquisition  of  oil  and  gas  reserves  involves  a number of 
uncertainties. As a result, the Company is exposed to certain business risks inherent in the oil and gas industry which 
may  impact  the  Company’s  operations  or  financial  results.  A  discussion  of  the  significant  risk  factors  affecting  the 
Company  is  included  in  Kelt’s  Annual  Information  Form  dated  March  11,  2016  which  can  be  found  at 
www.sedar.com.
BUSINESS OUTLOOK
ADVISORY REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain  information  with  respect  to  Kelt  contained  herein,  including  management’s  assessment  of  future  plans  and 
operations,  contains  forward-looking  statements.  These  forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  assumptions  and 
are  subject  to  numerous  risks  and  uncertainties,  certain  of  which  are  beyond  Kelt’s  control,  including  the  impact  of 
general economic conditions, industry conditions, volatility of commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuations, 
imprecision  of  reserve  estimates,  environmental  risks,  competition  from  other  explorers,  stock  market  volatility  and 
ability to access sufficient capital. As a result, Kelt’s actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially 
from  those  expressed  in,  or  implied  by,  these  forward-looking  statements  and,  accordingly,  no  assurance  can  be

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Alberta Modernized Royalty Framework
On April 21, 2016, the Government of Alberta released further details of the Alberta Modernized Royalty Framework 
(the “MRF”) previously announced in the Royalty Review Advisory Panel Report dated January 29, 2016. The MRF 
will  apply  to  wells  drilled  on  or  after  January  1,  2017.  Existing  wells  will  continue  to be  governed  by  current  royalty 
system  for  ten  (10)  years,  after  which  time,  the  MRF  will  apply.  The  MRF  will  apply  different  royalty  rates  in  three 
stages  of  the  life  cycle  of  a  well,  Pre-C*,  Post-C*,  and  Post-C*  Mature.  Note  that  C*  is  the  revised  Drilling  and 
Completion Cost Allowance which is based on industry average drilling and completion costs to be used as a proxy 
for well costs. Initially, a company will pay a flat 5% royalty on production until total revenue from the well equals C*. 
Once the C* threshold has been achieved the royalty rate will fluctuate with market pricing to a maximum of 40% on 
oil  production  and  36%  on  natural  gas  production,  until  monthly  production  from  the  well  is  below  194  m3e  for  oil 
wells  or  345.5  e3m3e  for  gas  wells  (the  “Maturity  Threshold”),  where  a  quantity  adjustment  is  introduced  tying  the 
royalty rate to reduced production levels.
The intended outcome under the MRF is to provide industry with similar or better returns for wells under high and low 
prices and as good or better returns for Albertans. As royalty rates will not be tied to production until the well reaches 
the Maturity Threshold, highly productive wells will benefit. The full extent of the impact of the MRF on the Company’s 
future  financial  condition  and  performance  is  still  being  evaluated,  however,  high  productivity  deep  oil  plays  are 
expected  to  realize  the  most  significant  benefit  under  the  new  regime.  Kelt  is  exposed  to  such  plays  in  its  core 
Montney  oil  development  areas  at  Pouce  Coupe,  Progress,  La  Glace  and  Karr.  The  Company’s  gas  prospects 
appear to be value neutral under the MRF using current strip pricing.
On July 12, 2016, the government announced that new wells spud before January 1, 2017 may elect to opt-in early to 
the MRF, if they meet certain criteria. Kelt expects to take advantage of this early adoption on certain wells and has 
increased its capital spending plans in Alberta for 2016 and reallocated funds within the budget.
CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
The  current  economic  environment  in  the  energy  industry  continues  to  be  volatile  and  uncertain.  Global  crude  oil 
supplies and increasing inventories continue to exceed global demand and as a result, crude oil prices continue to be 
negatively affected. North American winter demand for natural gas relating to heating was lower this past winter due 
to  milder  than  normal  winter  conditions  caused  by  the  weather  pattern  “El  Nino”  resulting  in  excess  amounts  of 
natural gas storage at the end of the winter. In addition, natural gas infrastructure and capacity constraints continue to 
impact  commodity  prices  being  realized  in  domestic  markets  relative  to  world  markets.  In  addition,  uncertainties
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
facing  debt  markets  around  the  world  could  lead  to  tighter  credit  markets  in  the  future.  In  this  environment,  Kelt 
continues  to  focus  on  maintaining  a  strong  balance  sheet,  giving  the  Company  the  ability  to  take  advantage  of 
opportunities  as  they  arise.  The  Company’s  capital  expenditure  program  is  also  flexible,  with  the  ability  to  defer 
expenditures into the future if the current economic environment deteriorates.
OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE
Oil and gas prices have bounced back from the lows experienced earlier in 2016, however,  our industry continues to 
operate  in  a  challenging commodity  price  environment.  Due  to  market  instability  and  volatile commodity  prices  that 
have trended lower over the past two years, many oil and gas companies have reduced their capital spending plans. 
Ultimately, lower capital investment in oil and gas drilling can be expected to balance the supply and demand ratio. 
Kelt continues to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for oil and gas commodity prices.
Kelt believes that the current business environment creates opportunities to add value at a reasonable cost. The cost 
to acquire land at Crown sales in the Company’s core operating areas has dropped significantly and service related 
costs to drill and complete wells have also declined substantially. In order to capitalize on opportunities in the current 
energy business environment, Kelt expects to remain active at Crown land sales. The Company is opportunity driven 
and  is  confident  that  it  can  continue  to  build  on  its  current  inventory  of  development  projects  by  adding  new 
exploration  prospects.  As  a  result,  the  Company’s  Board  of  Directors,  have  increased  Kelt’s  2016  capital 
expenditures budget to $87.0 million, up 5% from its previous budget of $83.0 million.
The  table  below  outlines  the  Company’s  forecasted  financial  and  operating  guidance  for  2016,  updated  from

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Forecast average production of 21,500 BOE per day in 2016 represents a 16% increase from average production of 
18,577 BOE per day in 2015 and is estimated to be weighted 37% to oil and NGLs and 63% to gas. However, based 
on the Company’s forecasted commodity prices for 2016, 82% of forecasted operating income in 2016 is expected to 
be generated from oil and NGLs versus 18% from gas.
During 2016, the Company is forecasting oil and gas prices to average WTI US$41.85 per barrel and AECO $2.10 
per GJ, respectively. Sensitivities to changes in these prices are as follows: a 10% increase in the average WTI oil 
price forecast would increase funds from operations by $7.0 million or 13%; a 10% decrease in the average WTI oil 
price forecast would decrease funds from operations by $7.6 million or 14%; a 10% increase in the average AECO 
gas price forecast would increase funds from operations by $7.5 million or 14%; and a 10% decrease in the average 
AECO  gas  price  forecast  would  decrease  funds  from  operations  by  $7.8  million  or  14%.  The  Company  reviews  its 
commodity price forecasts periodically and retains the flexibility to adjust its capital expenditure plans accordingly.
Royalties are expected to average 8.4% of oil and gas sales in 2016 (previously, 9.3%). During 2016, production and 
transportation expense (combined) is estimated to be $12.62 per BOE (previously, $12.74 per BOE), G&A expense is 
estimated to be $0.89 per BOE (unchanged from previous guidance) and interest expense is forecasted at $1.31 per 
BOE (unchanged from previous guidance).
After  giving  effect  to  the  aforementioned  production  estimates,  commodity  price  assumptions  and  estimated 
expenses:  funds  from  operations  for  2016  is  forecasted  to  be  approximately  $54.0  million  or  $0.31  per  common 
share,  diluted.  Kelt  estimates  that  the  Company’s  bank  debt,  net  of  working  capital,  will  be  approximately  $137.0 
million as at December 31, 2016.
Changes  in  forecasted  commodity  prices  and  variances  in  production  estimates  can  have  a  significant  impact  on 
estimated funds from operations and profit. Please refer to the  advisories regarding forward-looking statements and 
to the cautionary statement below.
The information set out herein is “financial outlook” within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The purpose of 
this  financial  outlook  is  to  provide  readers  with  disclosure  regarding  Kelt’s  reasonable  expectations  as  to  the 
anticipated results of its proposed business activities for 2016. Readers are cautioned that this financial outlook may 
not be appropriate for other purposes.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AS AT AND FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 
[Unaudited] 
 
(All tabular amounts in thousands of Canadian dollars, except as otherwise indicated)
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Kelt Exploration Ltd. (“Kelt” or the “Company”) is an oil and gas company based in Calgary, Alberta, focused on the 
exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas resources, primarily in west central Alberta and 
northeastern  British  Columbia.  The  Company  was  incorporated  under  the  Business  Corporations  Act  (Alberta)  on 
October 11, 2012 as 1705972 Alberta Ltd. and was inactive until February 26, 2013. On October 19, 2012, Articles of 
Amendment were filed to change the name of the Company to Kelt Exploration Ltd. The Company’s common shares 
and  5%  convertible  debentures  are  listed  on  the  Toronto  Stock  Exchange  (“TSX”)  under  the  symbol  “KEL”  and 
“KEL.DB”, respectively.
On April 16, 2015, the Company  completed the acquisition of Artek Exploration Ltd. (“Artek”) by acquiring all of the 
issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  of  Artek  pursuant  to  a  statutory  plan  of  arrangement  under  the  Business 
Corporations  Act  (Alberta)  (the  “Artek  Acquisition”).  Pursuant  to  the  arrangement,  Artek  common  shares  were 
delisted  from  the  TSX  and  Artek  became  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Kelt.  Immediately  following  the  Artek 
Acquisition,  Articles  of  Amendment  were  filed  to  change  the  name  of  Artek  to  Kelt  Exploration  (LNG)  Ltd.  (“Kelt 
LNG”). Kelt has transferred all of its British Columbia (“BC”) assets to Kelt LNG and at the same time, Kelt LNG has 
transferred all of its Alberta assets to Kelt. Kelt LNG operates in BC as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kelt.
The  head  office  of  Kelt  and  Kelt  LNG  is  located  at  Suite  300,  311  -  6th  Avenue  S.W.,  Calgary,  Alberta  T2P  3H2. 
Additional information relating to Kelt can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  were  approved  and  authorized  for  issue  by  the 
Company’s Board of Directors on August 9, 2016.
a) Statement of compliance
The  Company  prepares  its  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  Canadian  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles  (“GAAP”)  as  set  out  in  the  CPA  Canada  Handbook  -  Accounting.  These  condensed  consolidated  interim 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as 
issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”),  applicable  to  the  preparation  of  interim  financial 
statements,  including  IAS  34  Interim  Financial  Reporting.  Certain  disclosures  included  in  the  notes  to  the  annual 
financial  statements  have  been  condensed  in  the  following  note  disclosures  or  have  been  disclosed  on  an  annual 
basis only. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with 
the audited consolidated annual financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
b) Basis of measurement
All references to dollar amounts in these financial statements and related notes are  thousands of  Canadian dollars, 
unless otherwise indicated.
These  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  historical  cost  basis,  except  for  certain  financial  instruments 
which are recorded at fair value. The methods used to measure fair values are described in note 14 of these financial 
statements.
c) Significant judgments and estimates
The  timely  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  judgments,  estimates  and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amount  of  assets,  liabilities,  income 
and expenses. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.
32
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are 
recognized in the period in which the estimates are reviewed and for any future years affected. Significant judgments, 
estimates  and  assumptions  made  by  management  in  these  financial  statements  are  outlined  in  note  2  of  the 
December  31,  2015  consolidated  annual  financial  statements.  Except  as  outlined  below,  there  have  been  no 
significant  changes  in  the  Company’s  judgments  and  estimates  applied  during  the  interim  period  ended  June  30, 
2016  relative  to  those  described  in  the  most  recent  annual  financial  statements  as  at  and  for  the  year  ended 
December 31, 2015.
Acquisition of Artek Exploration Ltd.
In  March  of  2016,  the  British  Columbia  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mining  (“BC  Ministry”)  completed  a  petroleum  and 
natural gas by-products royalty audit which resulted in Kelt recording a revision to previously reported amounts for the 
Artek  Acquisition.  Refer  to  note  4  for  additional  information  regarding  the  revision  recognized  during  the  previous 
quarter ended March 31, 2016.
Convertible debentures
During  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  issued  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  5%  convertible 
unsecured subordinated debentures (the “Debentures”). Calculation of the fair value of the liability component of the 
Debentures requires significant judgement with respect to the determination of a market interest rate for similar debt 
instruments without a conversion option. A change in the market rate of interest would impact the fair value allocated 
to the liability and equity components on initial recognition, deferred income taxes, and subsequent finance expense 
related  to  the  accretion  of  the  liability  component  recorded  in  profit  or  loss.  Further  details  on  the  Debentures  are 
contained in note 10.
The Company’s calculation of the fair value of the liability component assumes a market interest rate of 10.5%. If the 
estimated market interest rate increased (decreased) by 0.5% the fair value of the liability component would decrease 
(increase) by approximately $1.5 million and the value of the equity component, net of deferred taxes, would increase 
(decrease) by approximately $1.1 million.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The  significant  accounting  policies  applied  by  the  Company  are  described  in  note  3  of  the  December  31,  2015 
consolidated annual financial statements.  Except  as  outlined  below,  these condensed  consolidated interim  financial 
statements  have  been  prepared  following  the  same  accounting  policies  and  methods  of  computation  as  the  most 
recent consolidated annual financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Income tax expense for an interim period is based on an estimated average annual effective income tax rate.
The Debentures are a non-derivative financial instrument that creates a financial liability of the entity and grants an 
option to the holder of the instrument to convert it into common shares of the Company. The liability component of the 
Debentures is initially recorded at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have a conversion option. The equity 
component  is  recognized  initially,  net  of  deferred  income  taxes,  as  the  difference  between  gross  proceeds  and  the 
fair  value  of  the  liability  component.  Transaction  costs  are  allocated  to  the  liability  and  equity  components  in 
proportion to the allocation of proceeds. Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of the Debentures is 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method and is accreted each period, such that the carrying 
value will equal the principal amount outstanding at maturity. The equity component is not re-measured. The carrying 
amounts  of  the  liability  and  equity  components  of  the  Debentures  are  reclassified  to  shareholders’  capital  on 
conversion to common shares.
The IASB has issued accounting standards that are not yet effective, including: IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers; IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; and IFRS 16 Leases. Details of the foregoing are outlined in note 3 of the 
December 31, 2015 consolidated annual financial statements. There have been no changes as of the date of these 
condensed  interim  financial  statements.  The  evaluation  of  all  potential  measurement  and  disclosure  impacts  is 
ongoing.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4. CORPORATE ACQUISITION
Acquisition of Artek Exploration Ltd.
On April 16, 2015, the Company closed the Artek Acquisition by acquiring all of the issued and outstanding common 
shares of Artek on the basis of 0.34 of a Kelt common share for each Artek common share, resulting in  the issuance 
of 26,900,375 common shares of Kelt to the former shareholders of Artek. The acquisition of Artek consolidated the 
majority of Kelt’s land acreage in its Inga-Fireweed-Stoddart, BC core area to 100% working interest and resulted in 
100% ownership by Kelt in key infrastructure including compression facilities and pipelines in northeastern BC.
The Artek Acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, 
whereby  the  assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  were  recorded  at  the  fair  value  on  the  acquisition  date  of 
April 16, 2015. The following table summarizes the acquisition date fair value of the consideration paid and the  final 
allocation of the purchase price:
Number of Kelt common shares issued (thousands) 
Fair value of Kelt common shares ($/share)(1) 
Fair value of common share consideration(1) 
Settlement of pre-existing relationship(2)
Net consideration
Bank debt, net of working capital(3)
Exploration and evaluation assets
Property, plant and equipment
Decommissioning obligations
Deferred income tax liability
Fair value of net assets acquired

(11,966)
(31,412)
253,791

(1) Pursuant to IFRS 3, the fair value of common share consideration is measured based on the share price on the closing date of the acquisition. The 
share  exchange  ratio  of  0.34  was  negotiated  based  on  the  volume  weighted  average  trading  price  of  Kelt  common  shares  that  traded  on  the  TSX 
during  the  five  day  period  ended  February  20,  2015  of  $8.10  per  share.  If  the  negotiated  price  of  $8.10  per  share  was  used,  the  common  share 
consideration would be valued at $217.9 million.
(2) Artek and Kelt were partners in joint operations. The settlement of the pre-existing relationship relates to $6.6 million of accounts payable by Kelt to 
Artek, net of $1.9 million of accounts receivable by Kelt from Artek, which were extinguished upon completion of the arrangement.
(3) The net working capital deficit includes $7.0 million of accounts receivable and accrued revenue, $0.4 million of deposits, $12.8 million of accounts 
payable  and  accrued  liabilities  (includes  $0.9  million  of  additional  royalties  payable  resulting  from  the  BC  Royalty  Audit)  and  $13.7  million  of  bank 
overdraft.  Pursuant  to  the  change  in  control  provisions  in  Artek’s  credit  agreement,  Artek’s  demand  loan  credit  facility,  on  which  $82.1  million  was 
outstanding as of the closing date, was repaid and terminated by Kelt at closing using borrowings available under Kelt’s Credit Facility.
(4) The Company recognized a gain on the acquisition of Artek as the total fair value of net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration 
paid  for  Artek’s  shares  by  $15.9  million  The  gain  has  been  revised  from  $16.8  million  previously  reported  in  the  Company’s  consolidated  annual 
financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of the BC Royalty Audit.
In March 2016, the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mining (“BC Ministry”) completed a petroleum and natural 
gas  by-products  royalty  audit,  focused  on  natural  gas  liquids  (“NGLs”)  and  Sulphur  Crown  royalties,  for  the  years 
2011  to  2014  (the  “BC  Royalty  Audit”).  As  a result  of  the  BC Royalty  Audit, it  was  determined  that  Artek’s  share  of 
Crown royalties were miscalculated and underpaid by Artek for the years 2011 to 2014, resulting in a net settlement 
of approximately $0.9 million payable to the BC Ministry. If known at the time of acquisition, the additional royalties 
payable to  the  BC Ministry  would have  resulted in  the  recognition  of  additional  liabilities as  at  April  16,  2015  and  a 
reduction in the gain recorded on acquisition of Artek by approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 
2015.  Accordingly,  comparative  period  amounts  previously  reported  for  the  Artek  Acquisition  were  revised  in  the 
consolidated  interim  financial  statements  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2016  to  reflect  the  final  allocation  of  the 
purchase price as at April 16, 2015.

Comparative  figures  have  been  revised  to  reflect  all  measurement  period  adjustments  as  at  the  acquisition  date  of 
April 16, 2015. Accordingly, the gain on acquisition previously reported for the three and six months ended June 30, 
2015 has been reduced by $2.6 million of cumulative adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price.
Transaction costs of approximately $2.4 million were recognized as an expense during the year ended December 31, 
2015. In addition, $0.2 million of transaction costs directly attributable to the issuance of common share consideration 
were charged to equity, net of deferred taxes.
5. PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS
The  following  table  summarizes  the  aggregate  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  pursuant  to  property  acquisitions 
completed during the interim period ended June 30, 2016 and the previous year ended December 31, 2015:

(1)  The  fair  values  allocated  to  the  net  assets  acquired  were  estimated  based  on  information  available  at  the  time  of  preparation  of  these  interim 
financial statements. The amount of cash consideration, after closing adjustments, was estimated based on an interim statement of adjustments. The 
actual amounts ultimately recognized by the Company upon finalizing the accounting for the property acquisition may differ from these estimates.
On April 28, 2016, the Company closed the acquisition of oil and gas assets in its core area at Progress, Alberta, for 
cash  consideration  of  $18.9  million,  after  closing  adjustments.  The  purchase  price  was  adjusted  for  the  results  of 
operations  between  the  effective  date  of  January  1,  2016  and  closing  of  the  transaction. The  transaction  has  been 
accounted  for  as  a  business  combination  using  the  acquisition  method  whereby  the  net  assets  acquired  and  the 
liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value.

6. PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS
On March 31, 2016, Kelt completed a minor disposition of certain non-core assets located in northwestern Alberta for 
cash proceeds of $1.1 million, before closing adjustments, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $2.1 million.
The  carrying  value  of  assets  and  associated  decommissioning  obligations  disposed  during  the  six  month  period 
ended June 30, 2016 and previous year ended December 31, 2015, are summarized below.

statements.  In  particular,  closing  adjustments  were  estimated  based  on  an  interim  statement  of  adjustments.  The  actual  gain  on  sale  of  assets 
ultimately recognized by the Company upon determination of final closing adjustments may differ from this estimate.
7. EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS
Exploration  and  evaluation  (“E&E”)  assets consist  of  the  Company’s  undeveloped land, geological  and  geophysical 
assets, and exploratory drilling costs for projects in which the technical feasibility or commercial viability has yet to be 
determined.  At  the  time  sufficient  information  becomes  available  to  determine  whether  the  project  is  technically 
feasible or commercially viable, which is generally the point at which proved reserves are discovered, the costs are 
either transferred to property, plant, and equipment or charged to exploration and evaluation expense.

The  Company  reviewed  its  E&E  assets  for  indicators  of  potential  impairment  as  at  June  30,  2016.  Except  for  $2.8 
million of costs associated with  the expiry of mineral leases which have been recognized as an expense during the 
six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company concluded that there are no indicators of potential impairment of its 
E&E assets at June 30, 2016.

There were no borrowing costs capitalized in the current or prior  year, as the Company did not have any qualifying 
assets. Future capital costs required to develop proved reserves in the amount of $545.1 million (December 31, 2015 
- $531.2 million) are included in the depletion calculation for development and production assets.
As a result of the significant decrease in forecast oil and natural gas prices during the previous year, the Company 
completed  an  impairment  test  for  all  cash  generating  units  (“CGUs”)  as  at  December  31,  2015  and  recognized  an 
impairment of PP&E of $64.1 million and an impairment of the full goodwill balance of $18.2 million. As at  June 30, 
2016,  the  Company  reviewed  each  CGU  for  indicators  of  possible  impairment  and  concluded  that  there  were  no 
indicators of impairment during the interim reporting period.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The  Company  has  a  revolving  committed  term  credit  facility  (“the  Credit  Facility”)  with  a  syndicate  of  financial 
institutions.  As  at  June  30,  2016,  the  authorized  borrowing  amount  available  under  the  Credit  Facility  was  $185.0 
million. As part of the semi-annual borrowing base review completed on May 31, 2016, all of the lenders, other than a 
single  lender  representing  $10.0  million  of  the  total  commitment  amount  (the  “Term  Lender”),  agreed  to  extend  the 
revolving period to April 29, 2017. The Company is obligated to pay out the Term Lender in full on April 28, 2017. The 
Credit Facility is available for a revolving period of 364 days, maturing on April 29, 2017, and may be extended for an 
additional 364 days at the discretion of the lenders, with a term-out to April 27, 2018 if not renewed.
The Credit Facility is subject to semi-annual borrowing base reviews, occurring approximately in April and November 
of  each  year. In  the  event  that  the  lenders  reduced the  borrowing  base  below  the  amount  drawn  at  the time  of the 
redetermination, the Company would have 60 days to eliminate any borrowing base shortfall by repaying the amount 
drawn  in  excess  of  the  re-determined  borrowing  base  or  by  providing  additional  security  or  other  consideration 
satisfactory to the lenders. Repayments of principal are not required provided that the borrowings under the facility do 
not exceed the authorized borrowing amount and the Company is in compliance with all covenants, representations 
and warranties.
There  are  no  financial  covenants  under  the  Credit  Facility  and  Kelt  is  in  compliance  with  all  other  covenants. 
Covenants  include  industry  standard  positive  and  negative  covenants  including  reporting  requirements,  permitted 
indebtedness, permitted dispositions (to a maximum in each calendar year which are in the aggregate not more than 
5% of the borrowing base then in effect), permitted risk management activities (as more particularly described in note 
14),  permitted  encumbrances  and  other  standard  business  operating  covenants.  Security  is  provided  for  by  a  first 
fixed and floating charge debenture over all assets in the amount of $800.0 million and general assignment of book 
debts.
Interest  is  payable  monthly  for  borrowings  through  direct  advances.  Interest  rates  fluctuate  based  on  a  pricing  grid 
and range from bank prime plus 1.0% to bank prime plus 2.5%, depending upon the Company’s then current debt to 
cash flow ratio of between less than one and one tenth times to greater than three times. Under the  Credit Facility, 
borrowings through the use of bankers’ acceptances are also available. Stamping fees fluctuate based on a pricing 
grid and range from 2.0% to 3.5%, depending upon the Company’s then current debt to cash flow ratio of between 
less than one and one tenth times to greater than three times.

On  May  3,  2016,  the  Company  issued  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  convertible  unsecured  subordinated 
debentures for net proceeds of $86.4 million. The Debentures mature on May 31, 2021 (the “Maturity Date”) and bear 
interest  at  5.0%  per  annum  payable  semi-annually  on  May  31st  and  November  30th,  commencing  November  30, 
2016. At the holder’s option, the Debentures may be converted into common shares of the Company at any time prior 
to the close of business on the earlier of the business day immediately preceding (i) the Maturity Date, (ii) if called for 
redemption, the date fixed for redemption by the Company, or (iii) if called for repurchase in the event of a change of 
control, the payment date, at a conversion price of $5.50 per share (the “Conversion Price”), being a conversion rate 
of  approximately  181.8182  common  shares  per  $1,000  principal  amount  of  Debentures,  subject  to  adjustment  in 
certain events.
The Debentures are redeemable by the Company after May 31, 2019 and prior to May 31, 2020, in whole or in part, 
from time to time, on not more than 60 days and not less than 40 days prior notice at a redemption price equal to their 
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the date set for redemption, provided

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
that  the  volume  weighted  average  trading  price  of  the  common  shares  on  the  TSX  for  the  20  consecutive  trading 
days ending five trading days (the “Current Market Price”) prior to the date on which notice of redemption is provided 
is  at  least  125% of  the  Conversion  Price.  On  or after  May  31,  2020  and  prior  to the  Maturity  Date,  the  Debentures 
may be redeemed by the Company, in whole or in part, from time to time, on not more than 60 days and not less than 
40 days prior notice at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up 
to but excluding the date set for redemption.
The Company may, at its option, elect to satisfy its obligation to repay all or any portion of the principal amount of the 
Debentures upon redemption or due at maturity, by issuing common shares instead of cash (subject to the receipt of 
any  required  regulatory  approvals  and  provided  that  no  event  of  default  has  occurred).  The  number  of  common 
shares  to  be  issued  would  be  obtained  by  dividing  the  principal  amount  of  the  Debentures  by  95%  of  the  Current 
Market Price on the date fixed for redemption or maturity, as applicable.
The liability component of the  Debentures was recognized initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not 
have  an  equity  conversion  option,  which  was  calculated  based  on  a  market  interest  rate  of  10.5%.  The  difference 
between  the  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  the  Debentures  and  the  fair  value  of  the  liability  component  was 
recognized  in  shareholders’  equity,  net  of  deferred  income  taxes.  Total  transaction  costs  directly  attributable  to  the 
offering of $3.6 million were allocated to the liability and equity components of the Debentures proportionately.
Accretion  of  the  liability  component  and  accrued  interest  payable  on  the  Debentures  are  included  in  financing 
expenses in the Statement of Profit  (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) (note 15). At June 30, 2016, the fair 
value of the Debentures was $102.8 million (note 14).
11. DECOMMISSIONING OBLIGATIONS
Decommissioning obligations arise as a result of the Company’s net ownership interests in petroleum and natural gas 
assets including well sites, processing facilities and infrastructure. The following table provides a reconciliation of the 
carrying amount of the obligation associated with the retirement of oil and gas properties:

(1) Decommissioning obligations acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair value using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to 
discount estimated future cash outflows. The revaluation of obligations acquired using the risk-free rate at the end of the period results in an increase in 
the present value of the obligation reported in the Statement of Financial Position. Revaluation of the decommissioning obligations associated with the 
assets acquired at Progress, Alberta (note 5), resulted in a change in estimate of $1.6 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016.
The key assumptions on which the carrying amount of the decommissioning obligations is based, include  a risk-free 
rate of 2.0% (December 31, 2015 - 2.2%) and an inflation rate of 2.0% (December 31, 2015 - 2.0%). The underlying 
cost estimates are derived from a combination of published industry benchmarks as well as site specific information. 
As at June 30, 2016, the undiscounted amount of the estimated cash flows required to settle the obligation is $150.4 
million (December 31, 2015 - $150.6 million), and is expected to be incurred over the next 50 years.
Accretion of the decommissioning obligation due to the passage of time is presented within financing expenses in the 
Statement of Profit (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) (note 15).

12. SHARE CAPITAL
Authorized
The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares and an unlimited number of preferred 
shares, each without par value.
There are no preferred shares issued or outstanding as of June 30, 2016 (December 31, 2015 - nil).
Common share offerings
During  the  second  quarter  of  2016,  the  Company  completed  non-brokered  private  placements  of  4.7  million  flow-
through  common  shares  at  a  price  of  $4.70  per  flow-through  common  share,  resulting  in  gross  proceeds  of  $22.1 
million. The implied premium on the flow-through shares was determined to be $2.6 million or $0.55 per flow-through 
share, assuming a market price of $4.15 per ordinary common share. Certain directors and officers of the Company 
subscribed to purchase  0.2 million flow-through common shares for gross proceeds of  $0.9 million. Pursuant to the 
provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada), the Company shall incur eligible Canadian development expenses (the 
“Qualifying Expenditures”) after the respective closing dates and prior to December 31, 2016 in the aggregate amount 
of not less than the total gross proceeds raised from the offering. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had not incurred 
Qualifying Expenditures, leaving $22.1 million of Qualifying Expenditures to be incurred in the balance of 2016.
During  the  first  quarter  of  2015,  the  Company  completed  non-brokered  private  placements  of  3.881  million  flow-
through shares at a price of $8.60 per flow-through share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $33.4 million. The 
implied  premium  on  the  flow-through  shares  was  determined  to  be  $2.9  million  or  $0.74  per  flow-through  share. 
Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  Income  Tax  Act  (Canada),  the  Company  incurred  eligible  Canadian  development 
expenses  and  renounced  the  qualifying  expenditures  to  the  subscribers  of  the  flow-through  shares  on  or  before 
December 31, 2015, as required under the subscription agreements. The Company had fully satisfied its obligations 
and incurred the full commitment of $33.4 million as of December 31, 2015.
On  July  7,  2015,  the  Company  issued  9.775  million  common  shares  by  way  of  a  short-form  prospectus  and  0.4 
million  common  shares  on  a  non-brokered  basis  to  certain  directors  and  officers  of  the  Company  and  their 
associates, at a price of $8.85 per share, providing gross proceeds of $90.0 million.
Stock options
Kelt  has  an  Incentive  Stock  Option  Plan  (the  “Option  Plan”)  that  provides  for  granting  of  stock  options  to  directors, 
officers, employees and certain consultants. The stock options granted pursuant to the Option Plan are to be settled 
through the issuance of new common shares of the Company and have a maximum term of five years to expiry. The 
vesting  schedule  is  determined  at  the  discretion  of  the  Company’s  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of 
Directors; stock options typically vest in equal tranches over a three year period.  Each stock option granted permits 
the  holder  to  purchase  one  common  share  of  the  Company  at  the  stated  exercise  price.  The  exercise  price  is 
determined  based  on  the  volume  weighted  average  trading  price  on  the  TSX  over  three  trading  days  immediately 
prior to the date of grant.

Restricted share units
Kelt has a Restricted Share Unit Plan (the “RSU Plan”) that provides for granting of RSUs to officers, employees and 
certain consultants. The RSUs granted under the RSU Plan are to be settled through the issuance of new common 
shares  upon  vesting.  The  vesting  schedule  is  determined  at  the  discretion  of  the  Company’s  Compensation 
Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors;  RSUs  typically  vest  in  two  equal  tranches  with  the  first  half  vesting  after  two 
years  and  the  second  half  after  three  years.  On  the  vesting  date,  one common share  is  released  from  treasury  for 
each RSU.

The amount and timing of reversals of temporary differences will be dependent upon a number of factors, including 
the  nature  and  timing  of  future  capital  expenditures  and  the  Company’s  future  operating  results.  In  the  next  twelve 
months,  the  Company  expects  approximately  $1.1  million  of  deferred  income  tax  assets  to  be  recovered  related  to 
temporary  differences  in  respect  of  share  and  bank  debt  issue  costs,  provisions  for  potential  credit  losses  and  the 
derivative  financial  instrument  liability.  The  Company  does  not  expect  any  other  deferred  income  tax  assets  or 
liabilities to reverse within the next twelve months.
14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
Financial instruments of the Company include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accrued revenue, 
deposits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,  derivative financial instruments, Debentures, and bank debt. The 
Company  is  exposed  to  financial  risks  arising  from  its  financial  assets  and  liabilities  that  include  credit  and  liquidity 
risk in addition to the market risks associated with commodity prices, and interest and foreign exchange rates. Profit 
(loss), cash flows and the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may fluctuate due to movement in market prices 
or as a result of the Company’s exposure to credit and liquidity risks.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in order to manage market risks. The objective 
of  market  risk  management  is  to  manage  and  control  market  risk  exposures  within  acceptable  limits,  while 
maximizing long-term returns. All such transactions are conducted in accordance with the Company’s established risk 
management policies that permit management to enter into commodity price agreements, provided that:
the contracts are not entered into for speculative purposes;
i) 
ii)  the  total  notional  quantity  hedged,  at  the  time  of  entering  into  the  contract,  does  not  exceed  65%  of
average daily production; and
iii)  the contracted term does not exceed 36 months.

Inherent to the business of producing oil and gas, the Company’s cash provided by operating activities is subject to 
commodity  price  risk.  Commodity  price  risk  is  the  risk  that future  cash  flows  will  fluctuate  as  a  result of  changes  in 
commodity prices. Commodity prices for oil and natural gas are impacted by world economic events that dictate the 
levels  of  supply  and  demand  as  well  as  the  currency  exchange  rate  relationship  between  the  Canadian  and  U.S. 
dollar.
During  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2016,  the  Company  entered  into  financial  derivative  contracts  to  fix  the  basis 
differential between certain natural gas reference prices.

Interest rate risk management contracts
The  Company  is  exposed  to  interest  rate  risk  to  the  extent  that  changes  in  market  interest  rates  will  impact  the 
Company’s  Credit  Facility  which  is  subject  to  a  floating  interest  rate.  Kelt  had  the  following  interest  rate  risk

The fair value of the interest rate swap is sensitive to changes in the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”). If the

by approximately $0.1 million.
Foreign exchange risk management contracts
Kelt  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  of  the  Canadian  to  U.S.  dollar  exchange  rate  given  realized  pricing  is  directly 
influenced  by  U.S.  dollar  denominated  benchmark  pricing.  The  Company  also  has  commitments  for  firm  gas 
transportation  service  under  contracts  denominated  in  U.S.  dollars  as  outlined  in  note  16.  Exposure  to  foreign 
exchange  rates  is  mitigating  by  entering  U.S.  dollar  denominated  commodity  price  or  foreign  exchange  derivative 
financial instruments.
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The  Company  did  not  have  any  U.S.  dollar  denominated  commodity  price  contracts  or  foreign  exchange  contacts 
outstanding during the period ended or as at June 30, 2016.
Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company entered a forward foreign exchange swaption contract 
whereby  the  counterparty  has  the  right,  if  exercised  on  December  30,  2016,  to  enter  a  series  of  forward  foreign 
exchange  transactions  fixing  the  exchange  rate  at  CA$/US$1.33  from  January  to  December  2017,  on  a  notional 
amount  of  US$1.0  million  per  month.  In  consideration  for  the  swaption,  Kelt  received  a  cash  premium  of  $0.255 
million at the time of entering into the contract.
Fair value measurements
The  Company  classifies  fair  value  measurements  using  a  fair  value  hierarchy  that  reflects  the  significance  of  the 
inputs  used  in  making  the  measurements.  The  Company  maximizes  the  use  of  observable  inputs  when  preparing 
calculations of fair value, where possible. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:



Level  1  -  Values  are  based  on  unadjusted  quoted  prices  available  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or 
liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 - Values are based on inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and volatility 
factors,  which  can  be  substantially  observed  or  corroborated  in  the  marketplace.  Prices  in  Level  2  are  either 
directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 - Values are based on prices or valuation techniques that are not based on observable market data.
Assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect 
the placement within the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accrued revenue, deposits, accounts payable 
and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying value due to the short term to maturity of these instruments. Bank 
debt  bears  interest  at  a  floating  market  rate  and  accordingly  the  fair  market  value  of  bank  debt  approximates  the 
carrying amount.
The fair value of the convertible debentures is estimated using quoted market prices on the TSX as of the Statement 
of Financial Position date.
The  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  excluding  working  capital,  is  attributable  to  the  following  fair  value 
hierarchy levels at June 30, 2016:

(1) Financial assets and liabilities are only offset if the Company has the current legal right to offset and intends to settle on a net basis or settle the 
asset  and  liability  simultaneously.  Kelt  offsets  derivative  contracts  assets  and  liabilities  when  the  counterparty,  commodity,  currency  and  timing  of 
settlement are the same. As at June 30, 2016, there are no offsetting derivative financial contracts.
(2) The  fair value of the convertible debentures is based  on  the closing market  price on the TSX  of  114.17 per debenture as at June 30, 2016,  and 
represents the market value of the entire instrument.
Credit Risk
As  at  June  30,  2016,  the  carrying  amount  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  derivative  financial  instrument  assets, 
accounts  receivable and  accrued  revenue, and  deposits  represent  the  Company’s maximum  credit exposure.  Cash 
and  cash  equivalents  are  held  on  deposit  with  a  Canadian  chartered  bank.  The  Company’s  credit  risk  exposure 
arises primarily from receivables from oil and gas marketers and joint venture partners.
KELT EXPLORATION LTD.
45
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, sales to four oil and gas marketers each individually represented more than 
10% of total revenue. Sales to these marketers account for approximately 40%, 18%, 11%, and 11% of total revenue, 
respectively. During the previous year ended December 31, 2015, sales to five oil and gas marketers accounted for 
approximately  23%, 17%, 15%,  13%  and 11% of  total  revenue,  respectively.  Kelt has  secured  parental  guarantees 
(with terms ranging from two to five years) or letters of credit covering approximately 75% its monthly credit exposure 
from oil and gas marketers, calculated based on average sales by purchaser for the second quarter of 2016.
Credit risk from joint venture receivables is mitigated by obtaining partner approval of significant capital expenditures 
prior  to  expenditure  and  in  certain  circumstances  may  require  cash  deposits  in  advance  of  incurring  financial 
obligations on behalf of joint venture partners. The Company has the ability to withhold production from joint venture 
partners in the event of non-payment or may be able to register security on the assets of joint venture partners.
The oil and gas industry has a pre-arranged monthly clearing day for payment of revenues from all buyers of oil and 
natural gas; this occurs on the 25th day following the month of sale. As a result, the Company’s production revenues 
are current. All other accounts receivable are generally contractually due within 30 days.
The ageing of the Company’s accounts receivable is summarized in the following table:

The  balance  of  accounts  receivable  outstanding  for  more  than  90  days  relates  primarily  to  receivables  from  the 
Company’s joint venture partners. Due to the current business environment and low commodity prices, many oil and 
gas  companies,  including  some  of  Kelt’s  partners,  are  facing  significant  financial  challenges.  Management  has 
reviewed  past  due  accounts  receivable  balances  as  at  June  30,  2016  and  expects  the  accounts  to  be  collectible, 
except  for  approximately  $1.2  million  of  accounts  receivable  which  are  provided  for  in  the  allowance  for  doubtful 
accounts.

Liquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  Company  will  not  be  able  to  meet  its  financial  obligations  as  they  are  due.  The 
Company’s  financial  liabilities  include  accounts  payable,  derivative  financial  instruments,  bank  debt  and  convertible 
debentures.  The  Company  manages  liquidity  risk  through  prudent  use  of  bank  debt  and  an  actively  managed 
production and capital expenditure budgeting process.

under Credit Facility is assumed on April 28, 2017, with the remaining repayment assumed to occur on April 27, 2018. 
(2) The contractual maturity  analysis includes semi-annual cash interest payments at the fixed coupon rate  of  5.0%, assuming that  the $90.0 million 
principal amount of the Debentures is outstanding for the full term to maturity on May 31, 2021, provided that: the equity conversion option is not first 
exercised by the holder; and that the Company does not elect to settle its financial obligation by issuing common shares instead of cash at redemption 
or maturity. Refer to additional information regarding the Debentures in note 10.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at June 30, 2016, the Company’s working capital deficit of  $12.1 million (excluding current bank debt) combined 
with outstanding bank debt of $127.0 million, represented 75% of the authorized borrowing amount available under 
the Credit Facility of $185.0 million. The Company is obligated to repay $10.0 million  to the Term Lender under the 
Credit Facility on April 28, 2017. The remaining $117.0 million drawn on the Credit Facility is available for a revolving 
period of 364 days, maturing on April 29, 2017, and may be extended for an additional 364 days at the discretion of 
the  lenders,  with  a  term-out  to  April  27,  2018  if  not  renewed.  The  next  semi-annual  borrowing  base  review  is 
scheduled to occur on or before November 30, 2016.  In an event that the lenders reduce the borrowing base below 
the amount drawn at the time of the redetermination, the Company would have 60 days to eliminate any borrowing 
base shortfall by repaying the amount drawn in excess of a re-determined borrowing base or by providing additional 
security or other consideration satisfactory to the lenders. Although management expects that the Company will not 
have a borrowing base shortfall and that the lenders will extend the Credit Facility on or before November 30, 2016, 
there is  no assurance  that  the  financial institutions  will  choose  to  do  so.  Should  the  financial  institutions  not  extend 
the loan, the Company would need to seek alternate sources of debt or equity financing.
Capital Management
The  Company’s  capital  structure  is  comprised  of  shareholders’  capital,  convertible  debentures,  bank  debt  and 
working capital. Kelt’s objectives when managing its capital structure is to maintain financial flexibility in order to meet 
financial  obligations,  as  well  as  to  finance  future  growth  through  capital  expenditures  relating  to  exploration, 
development and acquisition activities.
The  Company  monitors  its  capital  structure  and  short-term  financing  requirements  using  a  net  bank  debt  to  trailing 
funds from operations ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(1) The current portion of bank debt of $10.0 million is included in “Bank debt” and excluded from the “Working capital deficiency”.
(2) Comparative information  for the  year  ended December 31,  2015  has been revised. Details regarding the revision are set-forth in  note 4 of these 
interim financial statements. Kelt previously reported a debt to trailing funds from operation ratio of 4.7 times as at December 31, 2015.
(3) Funds from operations is a non-GAAP measure which is calculated as cash provided by operating activities, before transaction costs, provisions for 
potential credit losses, settlement of decommissioning obligations and changes in non-cash operating working capital.
(4) Trailing funds from operations is annualized based on the most recent quarter’s funds from operations.
Kelt targets a net bank debt to trailing funds from operations ratio of less than 2.0 times. The Company manages its 
capital structure and makes adjustments according to market conditions in order to maintain flexibility to achieve its 
objectives stated above. To adjust its capital structure, the Company may increase or decrease capital expenditures, 
issue new shares, issue new debt or repay existing debt.
The Company has reduced its net bank debt to trailing funds from operations ratio to 3.0 times as at June 30, 2016 
from 4.8 times at December 31, 2015. On May 3, 2016, the Company significantly reduced the amount drawn under 
its  revolving  bank  credit  facility  using  net  proceeds  of  the  offering  of  $90.0  million  principal  amount  of  convertible 
debentures that mature on May 31, 2021. In addition, the Company closed a private placement of 4.7 million common 
shares for gross proceeds of $22.1 million on April 7, 2016.
As  more  particularly  described  in  note  9,  Kelt  is  subject  to certain  non-financial  covenants  under  the  Credit  Facility 
agreement. As at June 30, 2016, the Company is in compliance with all covenants. The Company is not subject to 
any other externally imposed capital requirements.

18. CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES
During the previous year ended December 31, 2015, the Company reclassified certain charges that were previously 
presented as transportation expenses to production expenses. The Company concluded that a portion of the charges 
being  incurred  pursuant  to  a  firm  transportation  contract  and  a  gas  sales  agreement  related  to  upstream  services, 
primarily gas gathering and processing fees, which are more appropriately presented as a production expense rather 
than  transportation  expense.  The  adjustment,  which  was  recognized  in  the  Company’s  financial  statements  during 
the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  resulted  in  a  total  reclassification  of  production  and  transportation  expenses  previously 
reported  by  $1.8  million  for  the  nine  month  period  ended  September  30,  2015.  The  reclassification  had  a  net  nil 
impact on cash flow provided by operating activities and profit (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) reported for 
the periods.
