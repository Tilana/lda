<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth 
session from 3 to 14 October 2011.  The review of Tajikistan was held at the 1st meeting on 
3 October 2011. The delegation of Tajikistan was headed by Bakhtiyor Khudoyarov, 
Minister of Justice of the Republic of Tajikistan. At its 5th meeting held on 5 October 2011, 
the Working Group adopted the report on Tajikistan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Tajikistan: Costa Rica, Mauritius and 
Thailand. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Tajikistan: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/TJK/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TJK/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TJK/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, the Czech Republic, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Tajikistan through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation considered the universal periodic review an important instrument to 
ensure dialogue, improve the fulfilment of the State&#8217;s commitments towards human rights 
and assess the positive changes as well as problems that the country faced. 
</p>
<p>6. Despite the challenges encountered since independence, Tajikistan became a full-
fledged member of the international community and declared the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms a priority in its policy. Tajikistan adhered to the principles 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and acceded to seven core human rights 
treaties.  
</p>
<p>7. The Constitution recognized the supremacy of international legal acts over the 
national legislation. A number of State bodies have been established to implement 
Tajikistan&#8217;s international obligations, including the Commission on Ensuring the Fulfilment 
</p>
<p>of International Obligations in the Field of Human Rights. The first Human Rights 
Ombudsman was appointed in 2009, based on the 2008 Law on the Human Rights 
Ombudsman.  
</p>
<p>8. Tajikistan has cooperated with the United Nations human rights treaty bodies. The 
delegation reported on visits by three Special Rapporteurs conducted over the period  2005&#8211;
2008, the upcoming visit by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, as well as on 
invitations to visit the country extended by Tajikistan to the Special Rapporteurs on the </p>


<p>question of torture, on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest standard of physical and mental health. 
</p>
<p>9. The Constitution guarantees everyone the freedom of speech and press, and 
censorship and persecution for expressing critical views are prohibited. The delegation 
informed about a number of independent and private media outlets functioning in the 
country, including 127 newspapers, 20 private television channels and 9 private radio 
stations.   
</p>
<p>10. Eight political parties and over 2,000 public associations have been registered. To 
enhance the role of women in society, a number of laws and measures for their 
implementation have been adopted, including the 2005 Law on the State guarantees of 
equality of men and women and equal opportunities for their realization. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation informed about several developments in the area of human rights, 
including the adoption of the National Action Plan on Juvenile Justice Reform (2010&#8211;
2015); the adoption of the Comprehensive Programme on Combating Human Trafficking 
(2011&#8211;2013) and the 2004 Law on combating human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>12. Since independence, significant results have been achieved in respect of the 
enjoyment of the freedom of religion. In 2009, the Law on freedom of conscience and 
religious associations was adopted to regulate the relations between the State and religious 
associations and the legal status of religious associations. The legal system does not give  
preference to any religious movement or tendency and it does not allow anyone to impose 
their ideology on the whole of society. 
</p>
<p>13. The social protection of the population remained the primary task of the 
Government. In the past five years, the minimum wage and pension have increased by 3 
and 4 times, respectively and 582,000 new jobs have been created. Furthermore, Tajikistan 
was one of the pilot countries in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals 
and thus, under the auspices of the United Nations, a comprehensive evaluation of the 
country&#8217;s needs had been conducted. As a result, the National Development Strategy for 
2006&#8211;2015 and National Poverty Reduction Strategies were adopted to ensure stable 
economic progress and enhance the quality of life of the population. 
</p>
<p>14. In 2010, the new Law on the social protection of persons with disabilities was 
adopted and the Government allocates additional funds on an annual basis for the higher 
education of persons with disabilities.   
</p>
<p>15. Free secondary public education is guaranteed and despite the economic difficulties, 
the Government has continually increased financing of the education sector. In 2011, 17 per 
cent of the national budget has been allocated to the education sector. In 2001, human rights 
was introduced as a subject in secondary schools. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation reported on the reforms to the criminal codes and the implementation 
of a State programme aimed at making the policy in respect of criminal law more humane. 
The new Criminal Procedure Code was adopted in 2010 to bring it in line with international 
human rights standards, including the principles of presumption of innocence and equality 
of arms. The new Code provides a mechanism for consideration by a court of the legality 
and justification of detention. The status of the defender in the criminal process has also 
been strengthened. 
</p>
<p>17. A moratorium on the use of death penalty was introduced and life imprisonment is 
intended only as an alternative to the death penalty for serious offences. A working group 
has been established by Presidential order to study the social and legal aspects of the 
abolition of the death penalty.  In August 2011, the Law on amnesty was adopted and about 
4,000 prisoners were granted amnesty and released from the prisons. </p>


<p>18. In 2011, the Law on the order and conditions of detention of suspects, accused and 
defendants was adopted, which regulates several important issues regarding places of 
detention, including the obligatory medical examination by medical officers in places of 
detention. In 2011, the financing of the penitentiary system was increased sixfold compared 
to 2004. Furthermore, a draft amendment to the Criminal Code was developed to introduce 
a separate article on torture, in line with article 1 of the Convention against Torture.  
</p>
<p>19. Since 2007, the Government has implemented judicial and legal reforms to improve 
laws and procedures regulating the justice system, with the aim of further strengthening the 
judiciary and the status of judges. 
</p>
<p>20. An effective legal framework to combat corruption has been established and the 
Government has taken comprehensive measures in this area, including the ratification of the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption and the adoption of the Law and strategy on 
combating corruption and the establishment of the National Council on combating 
corruption. 
</p>
<p>21. Although results have been achieved, including the high level of ratification of 
international human rights and the moratorium on use of death penalty, the Government 
must still address a number of issues, including the difficulties relating to the process of 
transition from the planned economy to market relations, improving the living standards of 
the population and raising public awareness on human rights. In this respect, the 
Government would welcome the continued assistance of the international community to 
implement the Millennium Development Goals and improve the system of protection and 
promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation provided responses to a number of advanced questions, including 
those on the prohibition of torture and the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. The delegation stated that the Government has undertaken a 
number of measures to combat the use of torture. The law establishes criminal liability for 
the use of torture. Under the Criminal Procedure Code, evidence obtained during initial 
inquiries and pretrial investigations through the use of force, coercion, inhuman treatment 
or other illegal means is considered invalid and may not serve as a basis for a charge. In the 
past 8 months, the Prosecutor&#8217;s office initiated investigations into 16 out of 66 complaints 
received from individuals. Over 1,500 police officers were subject to disciplinary sanctions 
and some of them lost their job due to violations of freedom from torture. The Ombudsman 
also deals with the issue of the use of torture, which has also been discussed in a session of 
the National Security Council at the initiative of the President. Furthermore, as a preventive 
measure, seminars and training were organized for the judiciary, the Prosecutor&#8217;s office and 
law enforcement agencies.  
</p>
<p>23. The delegation stated that an inter-ministerial working group has been established to 
study the possibility of Tajikistan ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture. A working group has also been established to introduce further improvements to 
the Criminal Code. In this respect, amendments have been drafted to introduce a definition 
of torture in line with the Convention.   
</p>
<p>24. In response to questions on the advancement of women&#8217;s role in society, the 
delegation informed that about 24 per cent of civil servants were women, and that 81 out of 
381 judges were women. Training has been provided to women working in the central and 
local Government bodies. A gender network has been established for women involved in 
agriculture to assist and enhance their entrepreneurship, and a Presidential programme has 
been established to provide grants to women entrepreneurs.  
</p>
<p>25. With regard to questions about domestic violence, the delegation informed that there 
were legal services and hotlines available to support women and girls who were victims of 
domestic violence. As a result, over one hundred girls have received legal, psychological, </p>


<p>social and rehabilitation services in the framework of the project implemented by the 
Government Committee on Women&#8217;s Issues and Families since 2009. Based on the 
decision of the Ministry of Interior, inspectors specialized in issues of domestic violence 
were introduced.  
</p>
<p>26. Regarding religious freedom, the delegation stated that the 2009 Law on conscience 
and religious organizations was adopted taking into account international human rights 
instruments, the Constitution as well as recommendations by the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief. The Law on the responsibility of parents for the upbringing 
and education of children was adopted following a broad consultation of citizens and 
stakeholders in order to protect children&#8217;s right to education, to protection from physical 
and psychological violence and from proselytization, in line with the requirements of 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. According to the Law, children are entitled to 
religious education and other activities manifesting their religion on the consent of their 
parents. A State body on the issue of religious freedom was established and 3,829 religious 
associations have been registered. There are several religious educational institutions and 
courses on religions have been introduced in primary and secondary schools. 
</p>
<p>27. Domestic legislation developed based on the Paris Principles provides a broad 
mandate to Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman). The Ombudsman enjoys full 
independence from the Government; he has unlimited access to State bodies, the army and 
penitentiary institutions, may request and received information from State bodies, carry out 
independent investigations related to the work of State bodies and request the relevant 
bodies to initiate disciplinary and criminal measures against officials whose actions have 
resulted in violations of human rights. The Ombudsman, in cooperation with NGOs and 
journalists, have started carrying out visits to places of detention. Public complaints 
reception centres have been established in four regions of the country. 
</p>
<p>28. Regarding the judiciary, the delegation stated that the Constitution and relevant laws 
guaranteed the independence of the judiciary and set out the functions and terms of office 
of judges. The length of judges&#8217; tenure as well as the remuneration of judges and other 
members of the judiciary have been raised. The question of the lifelong appointment of 
judges is currently being examined. The Council of Justice is a collegial body established 
to, inter alia, put forward proposals for judicial reform, thereby removing the responsibility 
for those issues from the executive branch.  
</p>
<p>29. Regarding defamation laws, the delegation stated that criminal cases have been 
initiated by individuals claiming to have been slandered or insulted. 
</p>
<p>30. An inter-ministerial working group has been examining the issue of adhesion to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, however, the 2010 Law on the social 
protection of disabled persons has already incorporated norms contained in the Convention. 
</p>
<p>31. Regarding questions on child labour, the delegation stated that child labour is 
regulated by the Labour Code and other relevant laws, including a provision in the Law on 
education which bans the use of pupils and students in agricultural labour during the school 
year, and a section in the national poverty reduction strategy. Tajikistan noted that the high 
level of unemployment has an impact on child labour, with many children taking on jobs, 
often at the order of their parents. The issue of child labour will also be included in future 
poverty reduction strategies. 
</p>
<p>32. Regarding rights during administrative arrest, Tajikistan stated that in accordance 
with the Code of Administrative Offences, rights during administrative arrest are the same 
as for those detained under the Criminal Code or the Criminal Procedure Code, and would 
be further enlarged in the Law on the code of administrative procedure currently under 
preparation. </p>


<p>33. Tajikistan stated that it is not a country of transit for human trafficking. An inter-
departmental commission has been set up to organize the return of trafficked persons, as 
well as a specific unit on trafficking within the Ministry of Interior. No case of involvement 
of Government officials in human trafficking has been recorded. 
</p>
<p>34. As to the question regarding access by detainees to an independent doctor, this is 
guaranteed by the 2010 Law on procedures and conditions of detention.  
</p>
<p>35. Regarding the question of identity of transgender persons, the delegation noted that 
identity documents are issued on the basis of the Law on civil registration, and that a 
certificate of change of gender issued by a medical organization was required. 
</p>
<p>36. Regarding measures to implement the 2011-2015 national strategy on the migration 
of Tajiks for labour abroad, Tajikistan referred to measures to address health-related issues 
and the legal protection of Tajik nationals working abroad. A number of consular 
representations are already operating in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, which 
provide consular assistance and protection; there are plans to open additional ones and 
increase the resources allocated thereto. 
</p>
<p>37. Regarding implementation of treaty bodies&#8217; recommendations, Tajikistan referred to 
the significant  changes to its legislation, inter alia, the Civil Code, the Criminal Code, the 
Criminal Procedural Code and others, as well as reforms to the judiciary and law 
enforcement.  
</p>
<p>38. The power to limit civil rights was transferred from the procurator to the judge, and 
the execution of sentences from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Justice. The 
inadmissibility of evidence obtained under torture has been introduced, and in the draft 
amendments to the Criminal Procedural Code, a separate article has been foreseen, which 
introduces a definition of torture in line with the Convention against Torture.  The Criminal 
Code provides for the reduction in the number of crimes punishable by the death penalty to 
five. 
</p>
<p>39. The delegation expressed disagreement with the assessment that between 33 and 50 
per cent of women in Tajikistan experienced physical, physiological or sexual violence, 
stating that the facts at the disposal of the Government contradicted those numbers; only 2 
per cent of individuals who applied to the 37 advisory centres for help claimed to be 
victims of domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>40. Regarding the death penalty, the President established an inter-ministerial working 
group on this issue in 2010. Among other undertakings, with the participation of NGOs and 
international partners, an international conference was held in May 2011 with the support 
and cooperation of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The 
delegation expressed its belief that the steps undertaken in this regard would assist in 
deciding whether to ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR).  
</p>
<p>41. Regarding concerns expressed about the prosecution of journalists, the delegation 
mentioned that there had been two such cases in the last 18 months, and that in one case, 
the prosecution was not related to the journalistic work of the individual, but rather to his 
extremist activities. 
</p>
<p>42. The delegation asserted that mass media in Tajikistan are free and that citizens could 
freely express their views and convictions through them. The number of registered media 
outlets exceeds those that are State-owned.  In 2011, Parliament elaborated a draft law on 
mass media with a view to expanding the scope of their activities and freedoms and to 
ensure also that they provide objective information. </p>


<p>43. The delegation also indicated that in August 2011, the International Committee of 
the Red Cross had been invited to visit detention centres in Tajikistan. The scope of the 
draft cooperation agreement with the ICRC will be based on the outcome of this visit and 
the international obligations and national legislation of Tajikistan. 
</p>
<p>44. As to freedom of religion, the delegation explained that the new law on religious 
activities does not restrict freedom of religion, but regulates registration procedures. The 
law sets out a framework for the functioning of religious organizations and guarantees the 
freedom of religion. Every citizen has the right to profess any or no religion and to 
participate in religious services and ceremonies. There is no law forbidding women to wear 
the hijab or to perform prayers in mosques. The latter issue has been subject to a fatwa by 
religious scholars, in whose affairs the State could not interfere. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>45. During the interactive dialogue, 42 delegations made statements. A number of 
countries recognized Tajikistan&#8217;s open participation in the universal periodic review and 
</p>

</p>
<p>50. France enquired about measures planned to align the legislation with the definition

arbitrary arrests and torture. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. China recognized the positive measures taken to promote socio-economic

the rights of persons with disabilities. Tajikistan has actively engaged in international 
human rights cooperation. China acknowledged the challenges faced by Tajikistan and 
called on the international community to provide assistance. It made a recommendation. </p>


<p>52. India noted with interest the measures taken by Tajikistan in a number of areas, 
including raising the age for marriage and the moratorium on the death penalty. It also 
welcomed the measures taken to strengthen the judicial branch. However, India 
acknowledged the insufficient resources that Tajikistan encountered and underlined the 
need for further technical assistance for the construction of prisons. 
</p>
<p>53. Canada, while acknowledging the security challenges and budget constraints, was 
concerned at restrictions on the practice of religion and on freedom of the press, conditions 
of detention and deaths in custody, impunity with regard to allegations of torture and 
confessions obtained through torture, lack of independence of the judiciary, domestic 
violence, discrimination against women, child labour, institutionalization of children with 
disabilities and incidents regarding lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons. 
Canada made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>54. Hungary noted with appreciation the adoption of the Commissioner for Human 
Rights Act in 2008. It also commended Tajikistan for the moratorium on the death penalty

made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Poland welcomed the cooperation of Tajikistan with the human rights mechanisms 
and special procedures and the establishment of the Human Rights Ombudsman Institution. 
However, it noted with concern that Tajikistan was not party to some of the core human 
rights treaties. It remained concerned by the high level of deaths in custody and by 
allegations of the use of torture by law enforcement agencies. Poland made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Slovakia commended Tajikistan for the high ratification of international human 
rights instruments and its secondary school human rights education programme. It referred

registration procedures for religious organizations, and media censorship. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Switzerland indicated that Tajikistan was the last Central Asian country which has  
not abolished the death penalty. It welcomed the commitment taken by the Ombudsman to 
visit places of detention and the invitation extended to the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture to visit the country. Switzerland commended Tajikistan for the opening 
of a migration service. It expressed concern about the restrictions to freedom of the media 
in the country. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Estonia noted with appreciation that Tajikistan has ratified the main international 
human rights instruments and made efforts to harmonize its domestic legislation with 
international law. It praised Tajikistan for having declared a moratorium on the death 
penalty. Estonia further appreciated the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman. 
Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Norway acknowledged the establishment of the Ombudsman and the adoption of the 
new Code of Criminal Procedure. It expressed concern at the increasing restrictions on 
religious and civil society organizations, and on independent media. It also noted that 
gender inequalities persisted in all spheres of life. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Turkey positively observed achievements made with regard to human rights. It 
commended the establishment of the Ombudsman institution and the introduction of human 
rights into the secondary education curriculum. It welcomed the strategy to enhance the role 
of women, the national actions plans for children and the enhancement of juvenile justice. 
Turkey made recommendations. </p>


<p>61. Australia commended Tajikistan for the establishment of the Ombudsman institution 
and for the ratification of a number of core human rights treaties. It called on Tajikistan to 
implement commitments under those treaties at domestic level. It welcomed the draft law 
on domestic violence but remained concerned about reports of violence against women, 
forced marriages, child labour and trafficking. Other concerns related to the lack of a 
definition of torture and the persistence of the death penalty in domestic law. Australia 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Germany enquired what steps had been taken to recognize the right to conscientious 
objection to compulsory military service, improve the conditions of enrolment and provide 
an alternative civil service. It noted that the national provision prohibiting unregistered 
religious activities was incompatible with international standards, observing that the 
registration requirements prescribed by the Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious 
Associations were too extensive. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Slovenia asked whether the Tajik Government intended to ratify the Second 
Optional Protocol to ICCPR and abolish the death penalty. After expressing concerns 
about, inter alia, patriarchal traditions, domestic violence and the role of women, Slovenia

to whether Tajikistan prohibited other forms of child labour. Slovenia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Japan commended Tajikistan for its ratification status in relation to human rights

noted that despite policy developments, the gender gap still persisted. Japan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Brazil acknowledged Tajikistan&#8217;s efforts to reduce poverty, but noted that there was 
a lack of funding for education, health care and social welfare. It welcomed the moratorium 
on the death penalty. While positively noting the free public secondary education, it 
observed a decline in the enrolment of girls in schools.  Brazil recognized the steps taken in 
the field of gender equality but observed that patriarchal traditions and stereotypes were a 
structural source of discrimination. Brazil made recommendations.  
</p>

treatment of women. It indicated that further progress needed to be made in economic 
areas. Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. The United States of America commended Tajikistan for its ratification status and

international human rights treaties. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Afghanistan acknowledged Tajikistan&#8217;s achievements, such as the enhancement of 
the role of women, the adoption of a programme for combating trafficking in persons, the 
poverty-reduction strategy and calls to reform the State administration. It suggested that  
Tajikistan, inter alia, adopt measures to alleviate the mass labour migration of the male 
population and the increase in the number of women-headed households and take stock of 
the provisions of the UNCT report framing the significance in the decline in the relative 
poverty rate in 2009, while extreme poverty was alleged to have remained almost 
unchanged compared to 2007. 
</p>
<p>72. Sweden noted positively the status of ratifications of core human rights treaties, but
