The $400,000,000 Short-Dated Tender Cap applies to the aggregate purchase price (exclusive of accrued
interest) of the Priority 1 Notes, collectively, and the $250,000,000 Long-Dated Tender Cap applies to the
aggregate purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) of the Long-Dated Notes, collectively. In addition, the
Priority 3 Notes accepted for purchase are subject to the Priority 3 Tender Cap. For purposes of determining
the application of the Short-Dated Tender Cap, the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount and proration, the
aggregate purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) to be paid in Euros for the 6.25% Euro-denominated
Senior Notes due 2017 will be converted into U.S. dollars at an exchange ratio of $1.1162 to €1,000 as of 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on August 12, 2016, as set forth by the Bloomberg EURUSD Spot Exchange Rate.
Per €1,000 principal amount of 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017 and $1,000 principal amount
of Notes (other than the 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017) validly tendered and accepted for
purchase in the applicable Tender Offer (exclusive of any accrued interest, which will be paid in addition to the
Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable, to, but not including, the applicable
Settlement Date). Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, the Tender Caps and proration
described in the Offer to Purchase, notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date (as defined
below) will be accepted for purchase before any notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date.
(1)
(2)
(3)Includes the applicable Early Tender Premium.
The Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on September 12, 2016 (such date and time with
respect to a Tender Offer, as it may be extended for such Tender Offer, the “Expiration Date”). No tenders will be
valid if submitted after the Expiration Date. Tendered Notes may be withdrawn from the Tender Offers at or prior
to, but not after, 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 25, 2016 (such date and time with respect to a Tender
Offer, as it may be extended for such Tender Offer, the “Withdrawal Deadline”). Holders of Notes who tender their
Notes after the Withdrawal Deadline, but prior to the Expiration Date, may not withdraw their tendered Notes,
except for certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers, the consideration for each €1,000 principal amount of
6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017 and $1,000 principal amount of Notes (other than the 6.25%
Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017) validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for
purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers will be the tender offer consideration for the applicable series of Notes
set forth in the table above (with respect to each series of Notes, the “Tender Offer Consideration”). Holders of
Notes that are validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August
25, 2016 (such date and time with respect to a Tender Offer, as it may be extended for such Tender Offer, the
“Early Tender Date”) and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers will receive the applicable Tender
Offer Consideration plus the early tender premium for the applicable series of Notes set forth in the table above
(with respect to each series of Notes, the “Early Tender Premium” and, together with the applicable Tender Offer
Consideration, the “Total Consideration”). Holders of Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date, but at or
prior to the
Expiration Date, and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers will receive the applicable Tender
Offer Consideration, but not the Early Tender Premium for the applicable series of Notes. No tenders will be valid
if submitted after the Expiration Date.
In addition to the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable, all Holders of Notes
accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers will, on the Early Settlement Date (as defined below) or the
Final Settlement Date (as defined below), as applicable, also receive accrued and unpaid interest on those
Notes from the last interest payment date with respect to those Notes to, but not including, the Early Settlement
Date or the Final Settlement Date, as applicable (the “Accrued Interest”).
Chesapeake reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to increase or decrease the Aggregate Maximum Purchase
Amount and any Tender Cap at any time without extending the Early Tender Date or the Withdrawal Deadline or
otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights for any Tender Offer, subject to compliance with applicable law, which
could result in the Company’s purchasing a greater or lesser amount of Notes in the Tender Offers. If
Chesapeake changes the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount or any Tender Cap, it does not expect to
extend the Withdrawal Deadline, subject to applicable law.
Chesapeake reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at any point following the Early Tender Date and prior to the
Expiration Date, to accept for purchase any Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to the
Early Tender Date (the date of such acceptance and purchase, the “Early Settlement Date”), subject to the
Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, the Tender Caps, the Acceptance Priority Levels and proration as
described in the Offer to Purchase. The Early Settlement Date will be determined at Chesapeake’s option,
assuming the conditions to the Tender Offers have been either satisfied or waived by Chesapeake at or prior to
the Early Settlement Date. Chesapeake currently does not expect to have an Early Settlement Date. Irrespective
of whether Chesapeake chooses to exercise its option to have an Early Settlement Date, Chesapeake will
purchase any remaining Notes that have been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to the
Expiration Date and accepted for purchase, subject to all conditions to the Tender Offers having been either
satisfied or waived by Chesapeake, promptly following the Expiration Date (the date of such acceptance and
purchase, the “Final Settlement Date”; the Final Settlement Date and the Early Settlement Date each being a
“Settlement Date”), subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, the Tender Caps, the Acceptance
Priority Levels and proration as described in the Offer to Purchase. The Final Settlement Date is expected to
occur on the second business day following the Expiration Date, assuming the conditions to the Tender Offers
have been either satisfied or waived by Chesapeake at or prior to the Expiration Date and Notes having an
aggregate purchase price (exclusive of Accrued Interest) equal to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount are
not purchased on the Early Settlement Date.
Subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, the Tender Caps and proration as described in the Offer
to Purchase, all Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date having a higher Acceptance Priority
Level will be accepted for purchase before any Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date having
a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted for purchase, and all Notes validly tendered after the Early
Tender Date having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted for purchase before any Notes validly
tendered after the Early Tender Date having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted for purchase.
However, even if the Tender Offers are not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, subject to the Aggregate
Maximum Purchase Amount and the Tender Caps, Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date
will be accepted for purchase before any Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date are accepted for
purchase, even if such Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date have a higher Acceptance Priority
Level than Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date. Therefore, if the aggregate purchase price
(exclusive of Accrued Interest) of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date equals or exceeds
the Aggregate
Maximum Purchase Amount, Chesapeake will not accept for purchase any Notes tendered after the Early
Tender Date, and if the aggregate purchase price (exclusive of Accrued Interest) of Priority 1 Notes, Long-Dated
Notes or Priority 3 Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date equals or exceeds the Short-Dated
Tender Cap, the Long-Dated Tender Cap or the Priority 3 Tender Cap, as applicable, Chesapeake will not
accept for purchase Priority 1 Notes, Long-Dated Notes or Priority 3 Notes, as applicable, tendered after the
Early Tender Date. Additional information about the application of the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount,
Acceptance Priority Levels, Tender Caps and proration is set forth in the Offer to Purchase.
The Tender Offers are not conditioned upon a minimum amount of Notes of any series, or a minimum amount of
Notes of all series, being tendered. However, the Tender Offers are subject to, and conditioned upon, the
satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, including receipt by Chesapeake
of net proceeds from a concurrent secured term loan agreement on terms satisfactory to Chesapeake in an
amount sufficient to fund the payment of the Tender Offer Consideration and the Total Consideration and to fund
the consideration for the Concurrent Tender Offers. The term loan agreement is expected to be with one or more
banks, investment banks, insurance companies, mutual funds or other institutional lenders providing for floating
rate term loans aggregating $1.0 billion. Such term loans are to be secured by the same collateral as the liens on
the collateral securing the Company’s existing revolving credit facility (with a position in the collateral proceeds
waterfall junior to the revolving credit facility) and are to be guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee,
among other obligations, such revolving credit facility.
Chesapeake also announced today that it has commenced separate tender offers to acquire up to $500 million in
aggregate purchase price of its outstanding 2.5% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 and 2.25%
Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2038 (the “Concurrent Tender Offers”). Chesapeake’s obligation to
consummate the Tender Offers is not subject to completion of the Concurrent Tender Offers.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. is acting as the dealer manager in the Tender Offers. Global Bondholder Services
Corporation has been retained to serve as both the depositary and the information agent for the Tender Offers.
Persons with questions regarding the Tender Offers should contact Goldman, Sachs & Co. at (toll-free) (800)
828-3182 or (collect) (212) 902-6941. Requests for copies of the Offer to Purchase, the related Letter of
Transmittal and other related materials should be directed to Global Bondholder Services Corporation at (toll-

None of Chesapeake, its board of directors, its officers, the dealer manager, the depositary, the information agent
or the trustees with respect to the Notes, or any of their respective affiliates, makes any recommendation that
holders tender or refrain from tendering all or any portion of the principal amount of their Notes, and no one has
been authorized by any of them to make such a recommendation. Holders must make their own decision as to
whether to tender their Notes and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender. The Tender Offers are made only
by the Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal. This press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a
solicitation of an offer to sell any notes in the Tender Offers. The Tender Offers are not being made to holders of
Notes in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the
securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction in which the Tender Offers are required to
be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Tender Offers will be deemed to be made on behalf of Chesapeake
by the dealer manager or one or more registered brokers or dealers that are licensed under the laws of such
jurisdiction.
