The appellant was sentenced to an effective term of 8 years imprisonment in the Magistrates Court for robbery with violence and other charges. The High Court dismissed his appeal against sentence.

The appellants Notice of Appeal does not involve any question of law. Accordingly, since the appeal is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal and no right to seek leave to appeal, acting under s.35 of the Court of Appeal Act, as amended, I dismiss the appeal.
