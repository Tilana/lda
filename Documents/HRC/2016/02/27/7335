<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 26/6, adopted at its twenty-sixth session, the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>decided to extend the mandate of the Independent Expert on human rights and international 
</p>
<p>solidarity, and noted with appreciation the proposed draft declaration on the right of 
</p>
<p>peoples and individuals to international solidarity set out in the annex to her report 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/26/34). The Council also decided that, in order to obtain input from as many 
</p>
<p>Member States as possible on the proposed draft declaration, the Independent Expert should 
</p>
<p>convene regional consultations and/or workshops, and requested the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner to assist her in organizing those gatherings. In the same 
</p>
<p>resolution, the Council also requested the Independent Expert to consolidate and consider 
</p>
<p>the output from all the regional consultations; to submit to it, at its thirty-second session, a 
</p>
<p>report on those consultations; and to submit to the Council and the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p>before the end of her second term, a revised draft declaration. 
</p>
<p>2. In her report to the General Assembly at its 69th session (A/69/366), the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert explored the application of the provisions of the proposed draft 
</p>
<p>declaration to the illustrative goals recommended by the High-Level Panel of Eminent 
</p>
<p>Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, together with the sustainable development 
</p>
<p>goals proposed by the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals. Her brief analysis was written with a view to contributing to the 
</p>
<p>current process of formulating the future sustainable development goals to ensure that they 
</p>
<p>are consistent with universal human rights standards, focusing on the value added to the 
</p>
<p>goals when they are defined and informed by the right to international solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Activities undertaken during the reporting period 
</b></p>
<p>3. Pursuant to other requests reiterated by the Council in its resolution 26/6, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert has continued to pursue her mandated activities. They include 
</p>
<p>participation in relevant international forums and major events with a view to promoting the 
</p>
<p>importance of human rights and international solidarity, particularly in the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the Millennium Development Goals and the United Nations development agenda beyond 
</p>
<p>2015. The Independent Expert closely followed and actively participated in activities and 
</p>
<p>initiatives relating to the post-2015 development process, including those relating to climate 
</p>
<p>change, in various conferences and consultations at the international and regional levels. 
</p>
<p>4. In August 2014, she was invited to speak in the session entitled &#8220;Accountability and 
</p>
<p>a renewed global partnership&#8221; during the Asia-Pacific Regional Consultation on 
</p>
<p>Accountability for the Post-2015 Development Agenda, held at the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Conference Centre in Bangkok. The expected output of the consultation was a set of 
</p>
<p>recommendations on how global partnerships could be made more effective and 
</p>
<p>accountable, and how such partnerships could benefit from regional platforms. During the 
</p>
<p>discussions, the Independent Expert stressed that effective global partnerships in the 
</p>
<p>context of the post-2015 development agenda should be grounded in human rights 
</p>
<p>standards and that States&#8217; human rights accountability was already set forth in the 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties that they had ratified. 
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert also had an opportunity to highlight once again the need to 
</p>
<p>integrate human rights throughout the sustainable development processes and outcomes 
</p>
<p>when she was invited by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia 
</p>
<p>and the Pacific to speak as a panellist at the Expert Group Meeting on Macroeconomic 
</p>
<p>Prospects, Policy Challenges and Sustainable Development in Asia-Pacific, held in 
</p>
<p>December 2014 in Bangkok. The expert group meeting brought together development </p>


<p>experts from the region and beyond to provide new regional perspectives for policy options 
</p>
<p>which Asian and Pacific countries could adopt to meet their development objectives. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert participated in discussions focused on the strategies needed to improve 
</p>
<p>the economic, social and environmental aspects of economic growth that are 
</p>
<p>simultaneously people-centred and inclusive, dynamic and resilient, and within the capacity 
</p>
<p>of the earth and its resources; overcoming the fundamental barriers to the integration of the 
</p>
<p>economic, social and environmental dimensions that support people-centred sustainable 
</p>
<p>development; and the key steps required to turn trade-offs between the economic, social 
</p>
<p>and environmental dimensions into synergies.  
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert attended the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and 
</p>
<p>the Climate Change Summit, which were held simultaneously during the opening week of 
</p>
<p>the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, in September 2014, with a view to 
</p>
<p>gathering more recent data relevant to the proposed draft declaration on the right to 
</p>
<p>international solidarity. She was invited to participate in the Leaders&#8217; Forum on Women 
</p>
<p>Leading the Way: Raising Ambition for Climate Action, an event hosted by UN-Women 
</p>
<p>and the Mary Robinson Foundation &#8211; Climate Justice. Current and former women heads of 
</p>
<p>State, representatives of governments, leaders of grassroots, youth and indigenous 
</p>
<p>organizations, civil society, the private sector, the scientific community and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system were gathered together to demonstrate women&#8217;s leadership on climate 
</p>
<p>action and highlight gender-responsive action taken at both the local and national levels. 
</p>
<p>The forum&#8217;s outcomes were intended to feed into the Secretary-General&#8217;s Climate Change 
</p>
<p>Summit, which was aimed at mobilizing action by governments, business, the financial 
</p>
<p>sector and civil society to enable the world to shift towards a low-carbon economy.  
</p>
<p>7. In November 2014, the Independent Expert, at the invitation of the Association of 
</p>
<p>Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>participated as a speaker and resource person during the Commission&#8217;s workshop on the 
</p>
<p>theme &#8220;Regional mechanisms: &#8220;best practices on implementation of human rights&#8221;, which 
</p>
<p>was held with a view to creating a platform for exchanging and sharing experiences, best 
</p>
<p>practices and lessons learned among representatives of regional human rights mechanisms 
</p>
<p>around the globe and other relevant stakeholders, including representatives of government 
</p>
<p>agencies, national human rights institutions, United Nations agencies and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations. The workshop was convened with a view also to enhancing and regularizing 
</p>
<p>cooperation between the Commission, other regional mechanisms and other stakeholders 
</p>
<p>for the better promotion and protection of human rights in the ASEAN subregion, which 
</p>
<p>was to be integrated into a single economic community by the end of 2015. During the 
</p>
<p>discussions, the Independent Expert spoke on experiences and challenges in developing and 
</p>
<p>implementing regional norms, standards or instruments and on the way forward for 
</p>
<p>cooperation between the regional mechanisms and the United Nations agencies and treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Context of the present report 
</b></p>
<p>8. At recent events in various parts of the world, opposing interest groups have been 
</p>
<p>using the term &#8220;solidarity&#8221; loosely, rendering the term and, by association, the concept of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;international solidarity&#8221; vaguer or more ambiguous than they already are. This ambiguity 
</p>
<p>gives rise to the need to limit the possible interpretations of the term that may be applied on 
</p>
<p>the various occasions when the term may be used In the present report, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert discusses how the term &#8220;international solidarity&#8221; as a principle underpinning 
</p>
<p>international law should be understood in the context of the proposed draft declaration on </p>


<p>the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity. In the preamble to the 
</p>
<p>proposed draft declaration, the Independent Expert defines and clarifies the concept of 
</p>
<p>international solidarity,1 its value and significance. Although reviews of international 
</p>
<p>solidarity has been undertaken in the past, including by the present mandate holder&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>predecessor, this is the first time that international solidarity has been examined with 
</p>
<p>reference to the text of the proposed draft declaration on the right of peoples and 
</p>
<p>individuals to international solidarity.2 In that it expounds the concept of international 
</p>
<p>solidarity, the present report will also be of use for the series of regional consultations being 
</p>
<p>held in 2015 as mandated by the Human Rights Council in resolution 26/6.  
</p>
<p>9. It is not the intention of the Independent Expert in the present report to trace the 
</p>
<p>historical pathways that international solidarity has taken over the decades since the term 
</p>
<p>was first used in a socialist context in the 1890s. Instead, she focuses on the concept of 
</p>
<p>international solidarity in human rights terms, in line with the mandate on human rights and 
</p>
<p>international solidarity established by the Commission on Human Rights, the predecessor 
</p>
<p>of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>10. In the present report, the Independent Expert responds to issues around the question 
</p>
<p>as to what international solidarity is and what it is not, in the context of the proposed draft 
</p>
<p>declaration. In view of the limitations on the length of the present report, the core features 
</p>
<p>of international solidarity&#8212;preventive solidarity and international cooperation&#8212;will be 
</p>
<p>discussed further in subsequent reports. The proposed draft declaration on the right of 
</p>
<p>peoples and individuals to international solidarity itself will be closely and critically 
</p>
<p>analysed in the forthcoming series of regional consultation workshops to be convened in 
</p>
<p>2015 and early 2016, and the outcome will be described in the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>subsequent reports. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Attributes of international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>11. The principle of solidarity has been given prominent attention in international law, 
</p>
<p>notably in the writings of Karel Wellens, in which it was analyzed in the light of the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;common responsibilities of States, international organizations, peoples and nations, and 
</p>
<p>civil society.&#8221;3 It has been said and rightly so, that the principle of solidarity is a concept 
</p>
<p>that progressively moves forward in asserting common rights and responsibilities and in the 
</p>
<p>shaping of an international community, representing values to be attached, as a whole, to 
</p>
<p>the life of present and future generations, and to the development of a democratic and 
</p>
<p>equitable international order.4  
</p>
<p>12. When she first took up her mandate, the present Independent Expert spoke of 
</p>
<p>solidarity as a persuasion that combines differences and opposites, holding them together in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Committee (A/HRC/21/66), paras. 11&#8210;14.

</p>
<p>and individuals to international solidarity.

</i></p>

</p>
<p>

<p>one heterogeneous whole, imbuing that whole with the universal values of human rights.5 
</p>
<p>She continues to maintain that solidarity is a positive force in the lives of people and 
</p>
<p>nations and that it should be protected from exploitation and corruption, most importantly 
</p>
<p>at the international level, across national boundaries and cultural diversities. International 
</p>
<p>solidarity should be explicitly linked with human rights if it is to be true to the purposes of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, and if it is to be the engine that will drive the international community&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>collective actions to overcome the common challenges, risks and threats faced by nations 
</p>
<p>and peoples and achieve the transformative changes that are imperative in these troubled 
</p>
<p>times. 
</p>
<p>13. The proposed draft declaration provides that international solidarity shall be 
</p>
<p>understood as the convergence of interests, purposes and actions between and among 
</p>
<p>peoples, individuals, States and their international organizations to achieve the common 
</p>
<p>goals that require international cooperation and collective action in order to foster peace 
</p>
<p>and security, development and human rights. This requires that States respect the human 
</p>
<p>rights standards set forth in the international human rights treaties that they have ratified, 
</p>
<p>and comply with their existing treaty obligations. It also implies that non-State actors 
</p>
<p>should be guided in their activities by codes of conduct to prevent harm. International 
</p>
<p>solidarity carries with it the precondition of compliance with duties and obligations for 
</p>
<p>actors who come together to act collectively. International solidarity should not therefore be 
</p>
<p>misconstrued as relating in any way to collective action by States that result in the 
</p>
<p>contravention of any of the international human rights treaties to which they are parties. 
</p>
<p>Nor is international solidarity related to any form of collective action undertaken by non-
</p>
<p>State actors the outcome of which may be, for example, to cause or perpetuate inequality, 
</p>
<p>discrimination and exclusion among or between the individuals, groups and peoples with 
</p>
<p>whom they work. 
</p>
<p>14. The Independent Expert holds the view that, given the disturbing conflicts and 
</p>
<p>discord ongoing in many parts of the world, it is important to reconsider whether and how 
</p>
<p>solidarity is indeed advancing rights and responsibilities as it influences the shaping of the 
</p>
<p>international community. The time is appropriate, while the proposed draft declaration is 
</p>
<p>still in the form of a proposal, to identify and rethink the attributes of international 
</p>
<p>solidarity in human rights terms, a facet that is often neglected or ignored. There is a need 
</p>
<p>to re-examine the issues that persist around international solidarity, this time taking fully 
</p>
<p>into account the new dynamics that are rapidly changing the present global realities. The 
</p>
<p>challenges that confront the world today cannot be addressed using the previous 
</p>
<p>perspectives, which may no longer be relevant or applicable. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>reiterates what she has pointed out a number of times in the past: that international 
</p>
<p>cooperation is a key mechanism for international solidarity, but that international 
</p>
<p>cooperation is not the same as international solidarity. In the report on the enhancement of 
</p>
<p>international cooperation in the field of human rights prepared by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council Advisory Committee, a definition of international cooperation is not given but 
</p>
<p>merely implied, with a detailed description of its practice and conceptual ramifications. For 
</p>
<p>example, the report quotes the following text from the Declaration on Principles of 
</p>
<p>International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Charter of the United Nations: &#8220;States have the duty to co-operate with 
</p>
<p>one another, irrespective of the differences in their political, economic and social systems, 
</p>
<p>in the various spheres of international relations, in order to maintain international peace and 
</p>
<p>security and to promote international economic stability and progress, the general welfare 
</p>

<p> 5  V. Dandan, as cited by S. Puvimanasinghe in &#8220;Understanding the right to development&#8221; in <i>Realizing 
</i></p>
<p><i>the Right to Development</i> (Geneva, United Nations, 2013) p. 205. </p>


<p>of nations and international co-operation free from discrimination based on such differences 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/AC/8/3, para. 12).&#8221; 
</p>
<p>15. The proposed draft declaration defines international solidarity as a much broader 
</p>
<p>principle, encompassing a comprehensive and coherent conceptual and operational 
</p>
<p>framework to regulate a spectrum of global governance issues beyond the more limited 
</p>
<p>instances of international cooperation in the development field. For example, international 
</p>
<p>solidarity requires the deployment of preventive solidarity aimed at proactively preventing 
</p>
<p>and removing the root causes of inequalities between developed and developing countries, 
</p>
<p>as well as the structural obstacles that generate poverty. International solidarity represents a 
</p>
<p>multi-directional&#8212;rather than a one-way&#8212;deployment of action, together with the 
</p>
<p>corresponding obligation and accountability, thus creating a nexus of intersecting elements 
</p>
<p>that would bring about an enabling environment where human rights can be exercised and 
</p>
<p>enjoyed by individuals, groups and peoples.  
</p>
<p>16. International solidarity is a foundational principle underpinning the three pillars of 
</p>
<p>the Charter of the United Nations : peace and security, development and human rights. The 
</p>
<p>Charter distinctly reaffirms faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of 
</p>
<p>the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. 
</p>
<p>The Charter is a testimony to the determination of States to establish the conditions under 
</p>
<p>which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of 
</p>
<p>international law can be maintained; to promote social progress and better standards of life 
</p>
<p>in greater freedom; and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the 
</p>
<p>economic and social advancement of all peoples.6 Accordingly, international solidarity 
</p>
<p>should be understood within the context of the conditions that States are bound to maintain, 
</p>
<p>and not otherwise. The Charter of the United Nations needs to be revisited as often as 
</p>
<p>necessary, as a reminder of its timeless vision, given the evolving needs of a changing 
</p>
<p>world. Article 1 of the Charter, articulating the purposes of the Organization, implicitly 
</p>
<p>calls for international solidarity to undertake effective collective measures for the 
</p>
<p>prevention and removal of threats to peace. Article 1 also calls for international cooperation 
</p>
<p>in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, 
</p>
<p>through international cooperation. The Independent Expert interprets this article as 
</p>
<p>consistent with the view that international cooperation is a key mechanism of international 
</p>
<p>solidarity. 
</p>
<p>17. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the equal and inalienable 
</p>
<p>rights of all members of the human family (preamble), and asserts that all human beings are 
</p>
<p>born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to a social and 
</p>
<p>international order in which rights and freedoms can be fully realized (art. 28). The civil, 
</p>
<p>political, economic, social and cultural rights that are enshrined in the Declaration have 
</p>
<p>been codified in various international human rights instruments which the majority of 
</p>
<p>States have ratified. The Declaration and international solidarity are mutually reinforcing 
</p>
<p>since, while the Declaration is one of the pillars upon which international solidarity is built, 
</p>
<p>international solidarity has been, throughout the history of the modern human rights 
</p>
<p>movement, among the most powerful and essential tools of advocates and activists seeking 
</p>
<p>to advance the vision embodied in the Declaration (see A/HRC/21/44/Add.1, para. 4). 
</p>
<p>18. A number of articles in the Declaration are of particular relevance to international 
</p>
<p>solidarity, such as article 1, which provides that all human beings &#8220;are endowed with reason 
</p>
<p>and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood&#8221;; article 22, 
</p>
<p>which provides that as a member of society, everyone is entitled to the realization &#8220;through 
</p>
<p>national effort and international cooperation and in accordance with the organization and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6  Charter of the United Nations, preamble.  </p>


<p>resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his (the 
</p>
<p>person&#8217;s) dignity and the free development of his personality&#8221;; article 27, which provides 
</p>
<p>that everyone has the right &#8220;freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to 
</p>
<p>enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits&#8221;; and article 29, which 
</p>
<p>provides that everyone &#8220;has duties to the community in which alone the free and full 
</p>
<p>development of his personality is possible&#8221;. The preamble and the above-mentioned articles 
</p>
<p>of the Declaration shape the contours of international solidarity as both a principle and a 
</p>
<p>right of peoples and individuals. They also reinforce the idea of international solidarity as 
</p>
<p>an instrument that responds to the existing imperative to establish the conditions under 
</p>
<p>which all individuals and peoples can enjoy and realize their human rights. It is in addition 
</p>
<p>the engine for international assistance and cooperation towards the effective 
</p>
<p>implementation of sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>19. While international solidarity has instrumental value, it is also an end in itself. It is 
</p>
<p>instrumental in that it draws attention to interdependency and the need for collective action, 
</p>
<p>but is at the same time a guide for the collective action of States towards the desired 
</p>
<p>outcome of international solidarity for the full realization of all human rights 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/21/44/Add.1, para. 20). This is consistent with the affirmation by the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council that international solidarity is not limited to international assistance and 
</p>
<p>cooperation, aid or humanitarian assistance; that it includes sustainability in international 
</p>
<p>relations, especially international economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all 
</p>
<p>members of the international community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of 
</p>
<p>benefits and burdens (resolution 18/5, para. 2). The Council&#8217;s statement implicitly refers to 
</p>
<p>international solidarity as a foundation of the three pillars of the United Nations: peace and 
</p>
<p>security, development and human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International solidarity in action 
</b></p>
<p>20. International solidarity recognizes that collective action affecting human rights is not 
</p>
<p>limited to activities undertaken by governments and international organizations alone. Such 
</p>
<p>action also includes that by non-State actors, such as civil society and its organizations, 
</p>
<p>acting in the civil, political, economic, social or cultural fields, whether in the international 
</p>
<p>arena or within the internal processes of their societies. International solidarity requires that 
</p>
<p>human rights standards should guide the policies and practices of State and of non-State 
</p>
<p>actors alike when these affect the individuals, groups and peoples, within or outside their 
</p>
<p>territories.7 The paragraphs that follow provide a few examples that illustrate international 
</p>
<p>solidarity as practised among States and non-State actors.  
</p>
<p>21. It has been observed that the overwhelming expression of international solidarity by 
</p>
<p>States8 is apparent not only in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>in 1948 but also in the multitude of commitments and pledges relating to human rights and 
</p>
<p>development to which States have agreed, such as the Declaration on the Right to 
</p>
<p>Development in 1986, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in 1993, the 
</p>
<p>Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action on Social Development in 1995, the 
</p>
<p>Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action in 1995 and the Millennium Declaration in 
</p>
<p>2000, not to mention the numerous declarations and decisions that have been agreed upon 
</p>
<p>in various United Nations international conferences and regional summits. International 
</p>
<p>solidarity is manifested among States when their collective action has a positive impact on

<p>the exercise and enjoyment of human rights by peoples and individuals within and outside 
</p>
<p>their respective territories upon the actual implementation of the commitments and 
</p>
<p>decisions made between and among them at the regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>International solidarity permeates the vision and purposes of the various United Nations 
</p>
<p>specialized agencies, and is reflected in their programmes and activities. More importantly, 
</p>
<p>the outcomes of such programmes and activities substantiate their impact on the ground. 
</p>
<p>22. International solidarity is just as evident on the part of peoples, groups, and civil 
</p>
<p>society and their organizations, which establish forums and platforms domestically and 
</p>
<p>transnationally at which actors in different situations and geographical locations can 
</p>
<p>peacefully share, discuss and disseminate information, interact with each other, negotiate&#8212;
</p>
<p>formally or informally&#8212;and advance their social, cultural and political interests in order to 
</p>
<p>foster respect for, and protection and fulfilment of, all human rights on the basis of equality 
</p>
<p>and non-discrimination. The work of non-State actors becomes even more significant and 
</p>
<p>productive when they complement the efforts of States through their own activities. The 
</p>
<p>initiatives around the Millennium Development Goals are a notable example. Since the 
</p>
<p>Goals were adopted in 2000, governments, international agencies and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations worldwide have worked together and contributed to remarkable 
</p>
<p>achievements. Although much more needs to be done, there are now half a billion fewer 
</p>
<p>people living in extreme poverty; the lives of about 3 million children have been saved each 
</p>
<p>year; four out of five children are now vaccinated for a range of diseases; maternal 
</p>
<p>mortality is now receiving the focused attention it deserves; deaths from malaria have fallen 
</p>
<p>by one quarter; contracting HIV no longer constitutes a death sentence; and, in 2011, a 
</p>
<p>record 590 million children in developing countries attended primary school.9  
</p>
<p>23. The Global Forum for Migration and Development is arguably the world&#8217;s foremost 
</p>
<p>dialogue opportunity for civil society organizations and governments to discuss 
</p>
<p>international migration and development at the international level. The Forum was 
</p>
<p>established in Brussels in 2007 and is a State-led voluntary process outside the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system at which policymakers and stakeholders from countries all over the world 
</p>
<p>participate in meetings, notably the annual meetings, to discuss the relationship between 
</p>
<p>migration and development, share experiences and forge practical cooperation. Although 
</p>
<p>State-led, civil society has been directly engaged in the Forum from the beginning. At its 
</p>
<p>annual meeting, the Forum produces a number of recommendations for governments to 
</p>
<p>pursue, including those put forward by civil society during the Civil Society Days, prior to 
</p>
<p>the government meeting.10 The Platform for Partnership, a feature of the Forum, is an 
</p>
<p>online initiative that highlights government policies and practices that have been inspired 
</p>
<p>by recommendations from civil society. The online platform facilitates the dissemination of 
</p>
<p>information, communication and exchanges between stakeholders, who share their 
</p>
<p>experiences and the outcomes of migration and development projects that have emerged 
</p>
<p>from the recommendations and that they have adapted to their own situations.  
</p>
<p>24. International solidarity has enduring significance in the conduct of international 
</p>
<p>affairs and is critical in ensuring that global challenges such as epidemics and public health 
</p>
<p>crises are approached and managed in such a way that the burdens and the financial 
</p>
<p>responsibilities are distributed fairly, in accordance with the principles of equity and social 
</p>
<p>justice. The alarming spread of HIV/AIDS has challenged the development, progress and 
</p>
<p>stability of societies, calling for a exceptional and comprehensive global response.11 The 
</p>
<p>crisis has united the international community in an unprecedented manner: few other

</p>
<p> 11  See Security Council resolution 1983 (2011). </p>


<p>challenges have generated a similar set of reactions.12 Multiple stakeholders and partners, 
</p>
<p>including the United Nations, governments and civil society organizations, have laboured, 
</p>
<p>and continue to do so, in a spirit of shared and global responsibility, to combat the 
</p>
<p>epidemic. The disease spurred local initiatives for the protection of the human rights of the 
</p>
<p>most vulnerable and disadvantaged peoples and prompted remarkable international 
</p>
<p>solidarity between the global north and the global south.13  
</p>
<p>25. The challenges that arise from epidemics such as HIV/AIDS demand that peoples, 
</p>
<p>nations and the international community tackle governance differently, to yield positive 
</p>
<p>outcomes, while at the same time taking fully into account respect for, and protection of, 
</p>
<p>human rights. The nature of the disease and the scale of the epidemic have spurred 
</p>
<p>governments and local people to be more responsible and resourceful in governing 
</p>
<p>themselves in order to ensure that national priorities are aligned with shared international 
</p>
<p>commitments, not only to combat HIV/AIDS but also to promote health, development and 
</p>
<p>human rights. In 1987, the World Health Organization (WHO) took on the lead 
</p>
<p>responsibility for AIDS in the United Nations and set up the Special Programme on AIDS, 
</p>
<p>which subsequently became the Global Programme on AIDS. In response, an 
</p>
<p>unprecedented 160 countries rapidly set up national programmes to combat HIV/AIDS.14 
</p>
<p>As a national priority in the worst affected countries, the programmes for the treatment of 
</p>
<p>the disease were expanded to include prevention, along with social support for affected 
</p>
<p>groups down to the community level. It was at that point that the direct repercussions of 
</p>
<p>AIDS on social, cultural and economic development became apparent. HIV/AIDS was not 
</p>
<p>simply a disease but a social and economic handicap that hindered development. The need 
</p>
<p>for a broader response at the international level led to the creation in 1995 of the Joint 
</p>
<p>United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), whose establishment was 
</p>
<p>coordinated by WHO. UNAIDS has been in operation since 1996 and coordinates the 
</p>
<p>efforts of the United Nations family of agencies and organizations. It spearheads global 
</p>
<p>action to help the world prevent new HIV infections, care for people living with HIV and 
</p>
<p>mitigate the impact of the epidemic.15  
</p>
<p>26. UNAIDS is tasked with putting together the global response to an epidemic of a 
</p>
<p>dreaded and highly stigmatizing disease, whose ramifications affect all human rights and 
</p>
<p>extend across virtually all aspects of society.16 The International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights, first developed in 1998 by UNAIDS and the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, are a tool for States to use in designing, 
</p>
<p>coordinating and implementing effective national HIV/AIDS policies and strategies. As a 
</p>
<p>human rights-based response to HIV/AIDS, the Guidelines rely on broad approaches such 
</p>
<p>as support and increased private sector and community participation to respond ethically 
</p>
<p>and effectively to HIV/AIDS.17 However, there are still no data regarding the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the guidelines and their effectiveness in achieving expected outcomes.

</p>
<p>and undertaking subsequent global AIDS response progress reporting. The collection and

<p>reporting of high-quality results on the AIDS response are crucial components of the 
</p>
<p>UNAIDS plan for continued mutual responsibility and international solidarity.18  
</p>
<p>27. During the period from 1996 to 2012, global investments for a concerted AIDS 
</p>
<p>response increased from US$ 300 million to about US$ 15 billion. Those considerable 
</p>
<p>financial contributions substantiated the political declarations that had been made and 
</p>
<p>resulted in impressive returns &#8211; from a global increase in access to prevention and treatment 
</p>
<p>to significant declines in new infections and in AIDS-related fatalities. Similarly, the 
</p>
<p>Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria caused a drop in the price of anti-
</p>
<p>retroviral drugs and set the conditions for fixing the prices of pharmaceuticals.19 
</p>
<p>Commitments by donors both large and small, national investments by States, the 
</p>
<p>significant impact of the Global Fund and initiatives such as the United States President&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief have proved crucial in tackling the urgent need for 
</p>
<p>sustained funding.20 Political entities and policymakers also rose to the occasion, discussing 
</p>
<p>and making crucial decisions regarding the issue in relation to finance and debt.21 The funds 
</p>
<p>raised from cancellation of debt or debt relief have assisted countries in their efforts to 
</p>
<p>combat HIV/AIDS and to implement poverty reduction programmes.22  
</p>
<p><b> C. Building on international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>28. International solidarity, in the true sense of the term, should inform the new 
</p>
<p>opportunities for economic growth and the development of the world economy that have 
</p>
<p>been brought about by globalization but that have, however, also been accompanied by a 
</p>
<p>widening gap between developed and developing countries, widespread poverty and 
</p>
<p>inequality including gender inequality, unemployment, social erosion and environmental 
</p>
<p>risks. The ongoing globalization of trade and capital contributes to the interconnectedness 
</p>
<p>and interdependence of individuals and States, presenting challenges that demand increased 
</p>
<p>coordination and collective decision-making at the global level. It is in this area that 
</p>
<p>international solidarity can deploy international cooperation to promote a global enabling 
</p>
<p>environment that should not be limited to the promotion of economic growth through 
</p>
<p>unchecked trade liberalization and free movement of capital. Instead, international 
</p>
<p>cooperation should actively promote a multilateral trading and investment system that is 
</p>
<p>conducive to the realization of all human rights. Establishment of a fair, inclusive and 
</p>
<p>rights-based international trade and investment regime requires that all States, acting in 
</p>
<p>solidarity and pursuant to their common but differentiated responsibilities, recognize their 
</p>
<p>obligations to ensure that no international trade agreement or policy to which they are party 
</p>
<p>adversely impacts upon the protection and promotion of human rights inside or outside of 
</p>
<p>their borders. The notion of international obligations becomes even more relevant in the 
</p>
<p>present context of globalization, where the role of the State is increasingly being reduced, 
</p>
<p>inadvertently in some cases, it might be argued. Whether or not this is the case, the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>capacity to respect, protect and fulfil human rights is diminished. In such a context, the 
</p>
<p>value of international cooperation, a key feature of international solidarity, takes on even 
</p>
<p>more importance, particularly in connection with supporting a State that needs assistance in 
</p>
<p>complying with its core human rights obligations. Collective action by States in

<p>undertaking measures of reactive solidarity, as well as preventive solidarity,23 are of critical 
</p>
<p>importance in minimizing adverse impacts on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p>29. During the Millennium Summit in 2000, States resolved to, inter alia, promote 
</p>
<p>gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective ways to combat poverty, 
</p>
<p>hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly sustainable; to combat all 
</p>
<p>forms of violence against women; and to implement the Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Discrimination against Women.24 Eradication of poverty based on sustained 
</p>
<p>economic growth, social development, environmental protection and social justice requires 
</p>
<p>the involvement of women in economic and social development, and equal opportunities 
</p>
<p>and the full and equal participation of women and men as agents of, and not just as the 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries of, people-centred sustainable development (Beijing Declaration, para. 16). 
</p>
<p>The General Assembly, in its resolution 66/216 on women and development, recognized 
</p>
<p>the mutually reinforcing links between gender equality and poverty eradication, and the 
</p>
<p>achievement of all of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the need to elaborate 
</p>
<p>and implement, where appropriate, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>comprehensive gender-sensitive poverty eradication strategies to address social, structural 
</p>
<p>and macroeconomic issues. In paragraph 10 of resolution 66/216, the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>urged the donor community, Member States, international organizations including the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, trade unions and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to strengthen the focus and impact of development assistance, targeting gender 
</p>
<p>equality and the empowerment of women and girls through gender mainstreaming, the 
</p>
<p>funding of targeted activities and enhanced dialogue between donors and partners, and also 
</p>
<p>to strengthen the mechanisms needed to measure effectively the resources allocated to 
</p>
<p>incorporating gender perspectives in all areas of development assistance. The resolution 
</p>
<p>brings to the fore the need for international solidarity between States that enter into 
</p>
<p>international cooperation, which should be based on equal partnerships and mutual 
</p>
<p>commitments and obligations taking into account the best interests of the constituents in 
</p>
<p>their jurisdictions, on the basis of equality and non-discrimination, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international human rights principles and standards. 
</p>
<p>30. The Social Protection Floor Initiative (SPF Initiative), established in 2009 by a 
</p>
<p>coalition of United Nations agencies and development partners extending beyond the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, promotes universal access to social transfers and services as a means of 
</p>
<p>reducing poverty and inequality. It is predicated on the results of various studies showing 
</p>
<p>that a basic floor of social transfers is affordable in all countries at all stages of economic 
</p>
<p>development, although the least developed countries may need initial assistance from the 
</p>
<p>donor community.25 The initiative transcends the mandate of any individual United Nations 
</p>
<p>agency, and it is logical therefore that it is being implemented through a coherent, system-
</p>
<p>wide approach. The optimal use of experts, resources and logistical support is ensured 
</p>
<p>through joint United Nations country responses, with each United Nations agency 
</p>
<p>contributing to the initiative in its respective area of expertise. This system of operations is 
</p>
<p>a collective endeavour aimed at a common outcome that will impact on the realization of 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p>31. The social protection floor consists of a basic set of transfers, either in cash or in 
</p>
<p>kind, to provide a minimum income and livelihood security for all; and the supply of an 
</p>
<p>essential level of goods and social services such as health, water and sanitation, education, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 23  Preventive solidarity is another key feature of international solidarity, with reactive solidarity its other 
</p>
<p>side. The key features of international solidarity will be discussed in a forthcoming report. 
</p>
<p> 24  General Assembly resolution 55/2 on the United Nations Millennium Declaration.

<p>food, housing, and life and asset-saving information, accessible to all. The SPF Initiative 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the need to guarantee services and transfers across the life cycle, from children 
</p>
<p>to the economically active but with insufficient income, to older persons, paying particular 
</p>
<p>attention to vulnerable groups, including people living with HIV/AIDS, migrants and 
</p>
<p>populations exposed and highly sensitive to adverse external factors such as natural 
</p>
<p>hazards, extreme weather events and other climate phenomena. The initiative also takes 
</p>
<p>into account key characteristics that cut across all age groups, including gender, 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic status, ethnicity and disability.26  
</p>
<p>32. In June 2012, at its 101st session, the International Labour Conference adopted, by 
</p>
<p>an impressive tripartite consensus, International Labour Organization (ILO) 
</p>
<p>recommendation No. 202 (2012) concerning national floors of social protection. The 
</p>
<p>recommendation established a new international labour standard, calling for a basic social 
</p>
<p>protection floor for all through the provision of health care and income security. In adopting 
</p>
<p>its recommendation No. 202, the ILO General Conference recognized the importance of 
</p>
<p>social security in preventing and reducing poverty, inequality and social exclusion, and the 
</p>
<p>role of social security systems as automatic stabilizers in times of crisis. The 
</p>
<p>recommendation provides guidance to States on establishing and maintaining social 
</p>
<p>protection floors as a fundamental element of their national social security systems. Social 
</p>
<p>Floor Protection Initiative processes are country-driven, consultative, inclusive and 
</p>
<p>participatory in nature, involving all stakeholders, including government representatives 
</p>
<p>from the relevant agencies, social partners, parliamentarians and civil society through social 
</p>
<p>dialogue.  
</p>
<p>33. The expansion of social protection has proved to be important in reducing inequality 
</p>
<p>and poverty in a range of national contexts in both developing and developed countries. 
</p>
<p>According to recent reports, some 30 developing countries have already taken measures to 
</p>
<p>introduce elements of a social protection floor. Their experiences have shown that social 
</p>
<p>security schemes are a vital and flexible policy tool to counteract and soften the social and 
</p>
<p>economic consequences of financial shocks. They have also demonstrated the feasibility of 
</p>
<p>building social protection floors and that, with the necessary political will, adequate 
</p>
<p>resources for capacity-building and a sound implementation process, a strong national 
</p>
<p>consensus in favour of social protection floor policies can be created and developed.27 The 
</p>
<p>Social Protection Floor Initiative is a way for people to earn sufficient income for adequate 
</p>
<p>food, housing, water and sanitation, education and good health. It also paves the way for 
</p>
<p>people to take part in cultural life, exercise their freedom of expression and share 
</p>
<p>knowledge and ideas, all human rights to which everyone is entitled. The SPF Initiative 
</p>
<p>contributes to more stable, fairer and cohesive societies by making those rights available 
</p>
<p>and more accessible. At the same time, it strengthens the capacity of States to comply with 
</p>
<p>their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, which is a defining attribute of 
</p>
<p>international solidarity.  
</p>
<p>34. The International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Mexico in 
</p>
<p>March 2002, was hailed as an exceptional event, different from other United Nations 
</p>
<p>conferences, primarily because of the inclusion of all the stakeholders in the constructive 
</p>
<p>interaction between developed and developing countries, and also because it was free from 
</p>
<p>hostilities between the rich and the poor countries, which at that time was considered 
</p>
<p>remarkable.28 The outcome document, known as the Monterrey Consensus, was a blueprint

<p>for a new partnership that focused for the most part on a shared responsibility between 
</p>
<p>developed and developing countries, based on the recognition that each country had 
</p>
<p>&#8220;primary responsibility for its own economic and social development&#8221;, stressing the role of 
</p>
<p>national policies and development strategies and putting forward a renewed commitment by 
</p>
<p>the international community to support its efforts.29 The Monterrey Consensus did not 
</p>
<p>constitute an end point but marked the beginning of an important process stemming from 
</p>
<p>the resolve of States and other stakeholders to build an alliance for development and &#8220;act 
</p>
<p>together&#8221;. It was during the conference that it was decided that donor countries should 
</p>
<p>commit to allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development 
</p>
<p>assistance.30  
</p>
<p>35. The period beginning in 2000 has been defined by the aid effectiveness agenda. 
</p>
<p>What started as a small gathering of major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
</p>
<p>Development (OECD) donors in the early 2000s grew to an unprecedented gathering of 
</p>
<p>developed and developing countries, and international and regional civil society. The global 
</p>
<p>landscape changed during this period, economically, politically and socially. The lines 
</p>
<p>between developed and developing countries have blurred, and new forms of cooperation 
</p>
<p>have emerged. In the years that followed the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus in 2002, 
</p>
<p>four high-level forums on aid effectiveness were convened by OECD: in Rome in 2003, 
</p>
<p>Paris in 2005, Accra in 2008 and, most recently, in Busan, Republic of Korea, in 2011. 
</p>
<p>Busan was the venue for the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, at which over 
</p>
<p>three thousand delegates met to review progress on implementing the principles of the Paris 
</p>
<p>Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and discuss how to maintain the relevance of the aid 
</p>
<p>effectiveness agenda in the context of the evolving development landscape. The forum 
</p>
<p>culminated in the signing of the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation 
</p>
<p>by ministers from developed and developing countries, emerging economies and providers 
</p>
<p>of South-South and triangular cooperation. For the first time in the history of the High 
</p>
<p>Level Forum, a civil society representative took part in the actual negotiating process, 
</p>
<p>marking a critical turning point in development cooperation and international solidarity, 
</p>
<p>particularly where the language of the partnership emphasized the link between fighting 
</p>
<p>poverty and protecting human rights.31  
</p>
<p>36. A new chapter in the history of international cooperation was initiated in Busan, 
</p>
<p>where the focus shifted from aid effectiveness to the broader concept of development 
</p>
<p>effectiveness. Through the inclusion of a diverse range of development stakeholders &#8211;  
</p>
<p>donor governments from the North and the South, the private sector, civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, parliamentarians and local authorities, inter alia &#8211; the Busan Partnership for 
</p>
<p>Effective Development Cooperation provided a more realistic framework for improving the 
</p>
<p>way cooperation is implemented on the ground and how it works with other drivers of 
</p>
<p>development. For civil society organizations, Busan was a particularly significant 
</p>
<p>milestone, as it marked the first time that civil society had participated as a full and equal 
</p>
<p>stakeholder in aid effectiveness negotiations alongside governments and donors. It was thus 
</p>
<p>a unique opportunity to influence development cooperation for people&#8217;s organizations, and 
</p>
<p>also strengthened the shift from a technical aid effectiveness approach to development 
</p>
<p>effectiveness based on long-term sustainability, addressing the root causes of poverty and 
</p>
<p>the realization of human rights.32

<p>37. &#8220;The Future We Want&#8221;,33 the outcome document of the United Nations Conference 
</p>
<p>on Sustainable Development, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2012, encompasses a broad 
</p>
<p>range of issues and outlines an agenda for the future, representing the common vision of 
</p>
<p>States with the full participation of civil society. In it, the Heads of State and Government 
</p>
<p>who attended the Conference recognize that eradicating poverty is the &#8220;greatest global 
</p>
<p>challenge facing the world today&#8221; and commit themselves to freeing humanity from 
</p>
<p>poverty and hunger &#8220;as a matter of urgency.34 The contents of the outcome document are 
</p>
<p>summarized thus:  
</p>
<p>We recognize that poverty eradication, changing unsustainable and promoting 
</p>
<p>sustainable patterns of consumption and production and protecting and managing the 
</p>
<p>natural resource base of economic and social development are the overarching 
</p>
<p>objectives of, and essential requirements for, sustainable development. We also 
</p>
<p>reaffirm the need to achieve sustainable development by promoting sustained, 
</p>
<p>inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, 
</p>
<p>reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable 
</p>
<p>development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management 
</p>
<p>of natural resources and ecosystems that supports, inter alia, economic, social and 
</p>
<p>human development while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration and 
</p>
<p>restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges.35 
</p>
<p>We reaffirm the importance of international human rights instruments and 
</p>
<p>international law. We emphasize the responsibilities of all States, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the Charter , to respect, protect and promote human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms for all without distinction;36 We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen 
</p>
<p>international cooperation to address the persistent challenges related to sustainable 
</p>
<p>development for all, in particular in developing countries, &#8230; the need to achieve 
</p>
<p>economic stability, sustained economic growth, the promotion of social equity and 
</p>
<p>the protection of the environment, while enhancing gender equality, the 
</p>
<p>empowerment of women and equal opportunities for all, and the protection, survival 
</p>
<p>and development of children to their full potential, including through education.37  
</p>
<p>38. The avowed commitment of States to strengthening international cooperation to 
</p>
<p>address the &#8220;persistent challenges&#8221; to sustainable development cannot be overemphasized, 
</p>
<p>as it implies that they must be true to that pledge. It should also be emphasized that States 
</p>
<p>stressed that sustainable development required concrete and urgent action, and that 
</p>
<p>sustainable development could &#8220;only be achieved with a broad alliance of people, 
</p>
<p>government, civil society and the private sector, all working together to secure the future 
</p>
<p>we want for present and future generations&#8221;.38 Those words, together with those in the 
</p>
<p>preceding paragraph, effectively define international solidarity. Another report, entitled &#8220;A 
</p>

</p>
<p>towards a new spirit of solidarity, cooperation and mutual accountability that must underpin 
</p>
<p>the post-2015 agenda&#8221;, namely, leave no one behind; put sustainable development at the

<p>core; transform economies for jobs and inclusive growth; build peace and effective, open

<p>and accountable institutions for all: and forge a new global partnership.41  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>In 2015, two important international agreements to be decided upon by States 
</b></p>
<p><b>will affect the future of human development. One is a new set of sustainable 
</b></p>
<p><b>development goals to take over from and continue the Millennium Development 
</b></p>
<p><b>Goals, which expire at the end of 2015. The other is the outcome of the Conference of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>primary international intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to 
</b></p>
<p><b>climate change. The Conference is crucial because it must produce an international 
</b></p>
<p><b>climate agreement for adoption in December 2015. The new agreement will limit 
</b></p>
<p><b>global warming to the 2-degrees Celsius target, requiring a commitment from each 
</b></p>
<p><b>government to indicate targets for reducing the levels of carbon emissions. Funding 
</b></p>
<p><b>for those efforts will also be pledged at the Conference. The binding agreement will 
</b></p>
<p><b>apply to all countries and will be implemented in 2020.  
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>The lead-up to the Conferenceand the United Nations summit for the adoption 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the post-2015 development agenda has been closely monitored by stakeholders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>advocates who have been continuously calling for human rights to be at the forefront 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the negotiations and to be integrated into the final agreements. The United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>conferences at which States have pledged their commitments to goals and objectives 
</b></p>
<p><b>that entail action at the national, regional or international level, are much too 
</b></p>
<p><b>numerous to mention in the present report. Furthermore, information on the actual 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of such pledges and their outcomes is very difficult to obtain, perhaps 
</b></p>
<p><b>because of the paucity of action taken. The Independent Expert reiterates that 
</b></p>
<p><b>international solidarity cannot be inferred merely from collective decisions or 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitments agreed upon between State and non-State entities, until such time as 
</b></p>
<p><b>those agreements are acted upon. But the integration of human rights into such 
</b></p>
<p><b>agreements will indicate the path leading to the desired outcome of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>solidarity.  
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The claim is not that genuine international solidarity as described above, nor 
</b></p>
<p><b>international solidarity in general, is a magic formula for achieving desired outcomes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rather, the Independent Expert suggests that international solidarity is a powerful 
</b></p>
<p><b>tool for addressing key global challenges to human rights. In the context of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable development goals and the climate agreement to be forged in 2015, 
</b></p>
<p><b>international solidarity as described in the present report would ensure a fair and just 
</b></p>
<p><b>relationship between State and non-State actors engaged in the pursuit of common 
</b></p>
<p><b>goals or in overcoming a common challenge, in full cognizance of the human rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the peoples, individuals and groups concerned. This resonates with the view of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-</b>2015 Development Agenda: &#8220;This is

<p><b>a world of challenges, but these challenges can also present opportunities, if they 
</b></p>
<p><b>kindle a new spirit of solidarity, mutual respect and mutual benefit, based on our 
</b></p>
<p>common humanity and the Rio principles.&#8221;<b>42 The need is greater than ever before for 
</b></p>
<p><b>States and non-State actors to come together and undertake collective action in 
</b></p>
<p><b>solidarity, whatever the outcomes of the two international agreements.</b>
