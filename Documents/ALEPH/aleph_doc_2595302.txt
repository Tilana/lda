Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
Vermilion Energy Inc. (“Vermilion”, “We”, “Our”, “Us” or the “Company”) (TSX, NYSE: VET) is pleased to report operating and unaudited financial
results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
HIGHLIGHTS
Ø
Achieved average production of 64,285 boe/d during Q2 2016, a decrease of 2% as compared to 65,389 boe/d in the prior quarter. Production
increased 24% from 51,831 boe/d in Q2 2015, with higher volumes from our Irish, Netherlands, Australian, Canadian and US business units.
Ø
Fund flows from operations (“FFO”) for Q2 2016 was $126.6 million ($1.10/basic share(1)), an increase of 35% quarter-over-quarter and a 2%
decrease year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter increase in FFO was attributable to higher commodity prices and lower operating expenses
from our ongoing focus on cost reduction initiatives.
Ø
Irish production continued to ramp up during the quarter, with better than expected well deliverability and minimal downtime at Corrib since start
up on December 30, 2015. With five of the six wells currently online, production averaged 47 mmcf/d (7,877 boe/d) net to Vermilion during Q2
2016, an increase of 39% versus the prior quarter. Following recertification activities associated with the third party gas distribution pipeline
network during the quarter, production volumes at Corrib reached full plant capacity of approximately 65 mmcf/d (10,900 boe/d), net to Vermilion at
the end of Q2 2016.
Ø
Completed our two-well sidetrack drilling program in Australia during the quarter. Both wells were drilled from the Wandoo B platform. The first
well was placed on production at the end of June at an average rate of 2,000 bbls/d for the first month of production, with the second well placed
on production during the last week of July at an average rate of 2,700 bbls/d.
Ø
On June 28, Vermilion entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement for operated and non-operated interests in five oil and three gas
producing fields in Germany from Engie E&P Deutschland GmbH, for total consideration of €33 million ($47.9 million), with an expected closing
date in Q4 2016. Vermilion will assume operatorship of six of the eight producing fields. The assets are expected to produce approximately 2,000
boe/d (50% oil) in 2016. Proved plus probable reserves are estimated at 9.2 million boe(2) (74% proved developed producing(2)) based on an
independent evaluation by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. with an effective date of December 31, 2015. Transaction metrics are estimated at
approximately $24,000 per boe per day, $5.86 per boe of proved plus probable reserves(2) including future development capital (generating a 2P
recycle ratio of 3.5 times based on projected 2016 netbacks), and 3.1 times estimated 2016 operating cash flow(1). The acquisition is expected to
be accretive for all pertinent per share metrics including production, fund flows from operations(2), reserves and net asset value. The acquisition
adds another low decline rate (approximately 10%) asset to our portfolio, and provides us with our first operated producing properties in Germany,
further strengthening our presence in the country.
Ø
Our Profitability Enhancement Program ("PEP") initiative continues to generate tangible results, further strengthening our balance sheet and
enhancing the long-term profitability of our business. PEP cost savings related to capital spending, operating expenses and G&A expenditures
reached nearly $90 million for full-year 2015, and we expect to deliver a further $40 to $50 million of cost reductions for 2016. Year to date, we
have reduced unit operating costs by 18% versus the prior year. Looking forward, we anticipate full-year unit operating expense to be lower than
2015, which would result in four consecutive years of improvement in unit operating costs, reflecting both increased volumes and our reduced cost
structure.
Cost reductions in our project portfolio have allowed us to reinstate several projects to our capital program during the latter part of 2016 with only a
modest change to our 2016 capital budget. Additions include the reinstatement of a four-well drilling program in the Champotran field in France,
three (3.0 net) Cardium wells, and seven (4.0 net) Mannville wells in Canada. As a result of these additions, we expect to invest $240 million on
Øexploration and development (“E&D”) capital during 2016, as compared to our previous guidance of $235 million. Because the additions will occur
in the latter part of the year, they will have little impact on 2016 production. Consequently, our full year production guidance of 62,500 to 63,500
boe/d, representing 10% per share production growth year-over-year, remains unchanged. We expect to produce at the upper end of this
production guidance range.
Ø
As part of an ongoing effort to better define and disclose our future growth profile, we have accelerated certain parts of our annual budgeting
process and expanded our efforts to look at the next two years instead of just 2017. While we will not disclose our formal budget guidance until
late 2016, we are able to set approximate targets now for the next two years based on current forward commodity prices. At present, subject to
unexpected changes in the commodity price outlook, we anticipate investing E&D capital of approximately $295 million in 2017 and $335 million
in 2018. With these projected investment levels, we expect to deliver production of 69,000 to 70,000 boe/d in 2017 and 75,000 to 76,000 boe/d in
2018, representing year-over-year increases of approximately 9% for both years. A summary of our drilling locations by region and play type can
be found in our updated August 2016 investor presentation, located on the company website.
Ø
We plan to start prorating the Premium DividendTM component of our Dividend Reinvestment Plan by 25% in Q4 2016, beginning with our
October dividend. Eligible shareholders who have elected to participate in the Premium DividendTM component will continue to receive a 1.5%
premium on 75% of their shares, and will receive the regular cash dividend on the remaining 25% of their shares. Subject to unexpected changes
in the commodity price outlook, it is our intent to continue increasing the proration during 2017, at the end of which there would be no further equity
issuance under the Premium DividendTM component of our Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

Ø
On June 9, 2016, the four exploration blocks conditionally granted to Vermilion were ratified by the Republic of Croatia. The exploration blocks
consist of approximately 2.35 million gross acres (100% working interest), with a substantial portion of the acreage located near existing crude oil
and natural gas fields in northeast Croatia. Work obligations include typical exploration and appraisal activity with modest, back-loaded capital
commitments. The initial five-year exploration period consists of two phases with an option to relinquish the blocks following the initial three-year
phase.
Ø
Vermilion’s MSCI ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) rating increased from BB to BBB for 2016, and our Governance Metrics score
ranked in the 90th percentile globally. This follows our 9th-place ranking in the 2016 Corporate Knights Future 40 Responsible Corporate Leaders
in Canada list (the highest ranking for an oil and gas company). These recognitions reflect Vermilion’s continued focus on combining financial
results with exemplary environmental, social and governance performance. Please refer to our Sustainability Report at

Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
MESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS
Over the past two years of significantly lower commodity prices, Vermilion’s course and priorities have remained consistent. Our priorities
are to maintain a strong balance sheet, protect our dividend, and to provide for future production growth, in that order. Despite the
challenging pricing environment, we have been able to achieve all of these objectives.
Following our disciplined approach to financial management, we remain committed to running a sustainable growth-and-income business
model. We are managing our business based on the current commodity strip price, and have structured our spending so that fund flows
from operations will match or exceed cash outflows for net dividends and exploration and development (“E&D”) capital expenditures.
Based on current strip prices, we project a 2016 payout of approximately 80%, which provides cash flow to fund our first priority,
strengthening the balance sheet through debt reduction.
Our Profitability Enhancement Program ("PEP") initiative continues to generate tangible results, further strengthening our balance sheet
and enhancing the long-term profitability of our business. PEP cost savings related to capital spending, operating expenses and G&A
expenditures reached nearly $90 million for full-year 2015, and we expect to deliver a further $40 to $50 million of cost reductions for 2016.
Year-to-date, we have reduced unit operating expenses by 18% versus the prior year. Looking forward, we anticipate full-year unit
operating expense to be lower than 2015, which would result in four consecutive years of unit operating cost improvement, reflecting both
increased volumes and our reduced cost structure.
Another initiative in response to low commodity prices is the Premium DividendTM Component of our Dividend Reinvestment Plan, which
we implemented in early 2015 as a short-term measure to preserve our financial flexibility and to conservatively and inexpensively access
equity capital. We plan to start prorating the Premium DividendTM by 25% in Q4 2016. Subject to unexpected changes in the commodity
price outlook, it is our intent to continue increasing the proration during 2017, at the end of which there would be no further equity
issuance under the Premium DividendTM component of our Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Last quarter, we reiterated our intention to adhere closely to our announced $235 million E&D capital budget for 2016. This budget
represents a decrease of over 50% from 2015 and more than 65% from 2014 capital expenditure levels. Despite this significant reduction
in capital investment and the voluntary reduction of over 2,000 boe/d of gas production in Canada currently (approximately 1,000 boe/d
on an annual basis for 2016) with the objective of achieving higher prices this winter, we still anticipate achieving production of between
62,500 to 63,500 boe/d, representing 15% year-over-year production growth, or nearly 10% growth on a per share basis. Due to continuing
improvements in the cost efficiency of our capital projects, we have been able to add additional capital activities to our 2016 capital plan
with only a $5 million increase to our E&D capital budget, bringing it to $240 million for 2016. Additional activities include the
reinstatement of a four-well drilling program in the Champotran field in France, three (3.0 net) Cardium wells, and seven (4.0 net) Mannville
wells in Canada. Vermilion’s international exposure and diversified project inventory provides the flexibility to react to changing
conditions and selectively allocate capital to the highest rate of return projects. This advantage is even more evident during times of
restricted capital availability.
Having focused on our long-term priorities of protecting our balance sheet, defending our dividend, and continuing to invest in long-term
growth, Vermilion is positioned to excel when commodity prices move off the lows recorded earlier this year. As part of an ongoing effort
to better define and disclose our future growth profile, we have accelerated certain parts of our annual budgeting process and expanded
our efforts to look at our potential budgets for the next two years, instead of just 2017. While we will not disclose our formal budget
guidance until late in 2016, we are able to set approximate targets now for the next two years based on current forward commodity prices.
At present, subject to unexpected changes in the commodity price outlook, we anticipate investing E&D capital of approximately $295
million in 2017 and approximately $335 million in 2018. With these projected investment levels, we expect to deliver production of 69,000
to 70,000 boe/d in 2017 and 75,000 to 76,000 boe/d in 2018, representing year-over-year increases of 9% for both years. We believe that the
depth and capital efficiency of our portfolio of assets and projects has never been stronger. Over the long-term, we continue to target
consistent organic production growth with only a modest increase in capital investment. A summary of our drilling locations by region
and play type can be found in our updated August 2016 investor presentation, located on the company website.

OPERATIONS REVIEW
Europe
In France, we have reinstated a four-well drilling program in Champotran. This program will follow on three consecutive years of
Champotran drilling campaigns, where we have drilled 14 wells to date with a 100% success rate. As with our other highly-economic
workover and waterflood activities in France, Champotran drilling targets favourably priced Brent crude production and generates strong
capital efficiencies.
Subsequent to quarter end, we spudded the first well in our two (0.9 net) well drilling program in the Netherlands. As we announced last
quarter, we were able to add this activity back into our $235 million capital budget by finding investment and cost reductions elsewhere in
our budget. The prolific nature of the wells and the premium price received for our European gas, generate rates of return in excess of
100% for drilling projects in the Netherlands at current prices. Our plan is to drill the Langezwaag-03 (42% working interest) and Andel-6ST
(45% working interest) wells during Q3 2016. If successful, we expect to bring the wells on-stream in the latter part of 2016.
In Germany, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement for operated and non-operated interests in five oil and three gas
producing fields from Engie E&P Deutschland GmbH, for total consideration of €33 million ($47.9 million). The acquisition will be funded
through existing credit facilities and is expected to close in late 2016. Vermilion will assume operatorship of six of the eight producing
fields. The assets are expected to produce approximately 2,000 boe/d (50% oil) in 2016. Proved plus probable reserves are estimated at
9.2 million boe(2) (74% proved developed producing(2)) based on an independent evaluation by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. with an
effective date of December 31, 2015. Transaction metrics are estimated at approximately $24,000 per boe per day, $5.86 per boe of proved
plus probable reserves(2) including future development capital (generating a 2P recycle ratio of 3.5 times based on projected 2016
netbacks), and 3.1 times estimated 2016 operating cash flow(1). The acquisition is expected to be accretive for all pertinent per share
metrics including production, fund flows from operations(2), reserves and net asset value.
The Engie acquisition adds another low decline rate (approximately 10%) asset to our portfolio, and provides us with our first operated
producing properties in Germany. The producing assets and lands to be acquired are natural extensions to our steadily expanding land
base in the North German Basin, which is the dominant producing region in Germany. The development opportunities and subsurface
characteristics of the acquired assets are similar to our existing European portfolio, including a number of low-risk optimization and
workover opportunities from which we expect to maintain a flat-to-moderately growing production profile while generating free cash
flow(1). In addition, we have identified development and exploration drilling opportunities that are not included in our current reserves
estimate. Vermilion entered Germany in early 2014 through the acquisition of a 25% non-operating interest in a four-partner consortium. In
July 2015, we executed a significant exploratory farm-in that provides us with participating interest in over 850,000 net acres of
undeveloped land, as well as access to key technical data in the North German Basin. This acquisition significantly advances our
objective of developing a material business unit in Germany, a country with a long history of oil and natural gas development, a
consistent fiscal framework and low political risk.
The four exploration blocks conditionally granted to Vermilion in 2015 were ratified by the Republic of Croatia on June 9, 2016. The blocks
cover approximately 2.35 million gross acres, with a substantial portion of the acreage located near existing crude oil and natural gas
fields in northeast Croatia near the Hungarian border. Capital commitments are modest and back-loaded. The initial 5-year exploration
period consists of two phases with an option to relinquish the blocks following the initial 3-year phase. The ratification makes Vermilion
the largest onshore landholder in Croatia. Like our concessions in Hungary, the assets in Croatia are located in the under-developed
Pannonian basin and are well-positioned to benefit from renewed investment and new technology.
Since the initiation of first gas at Corrib in Ireland on December 30, 2015, project ramp up has exceeded our expectations in terms of
uptime and well deliverability. Net to Vermilion, production averaged approximately 34 mmcf/d (5,650 boe/d) in Q1 2016, 47 mmcf/d (7,877
boe/d) in Q2 2016, and reached full plant capacity of approximately 65 mmcf/d (10,900 boe/d) at the end of Q2 2016. During the quarter,
planned recertification activities associated with the third party gas distribution pipeline network were completed, as well as some subsea
inspections, maintenance and repairs on the subsea systems. Currently, five of the six wells are on production, with the final well to be
brought online in Q3 2016 following the conclusion of an offshore work program to lay a pipeline to the sixth well.
Australia
Following our successful sidetrack well drilled in Q4 2015, we executed a two-well drilling program in Q2 2016. The wells drilled at Wandoo
are extreme long-reach lateral wells. While having true vertical depths of only 600 metres, the two most recent sidetrack wells have
measured depths of nearly 3,000 metres and 3,800 metres, respectively. We are pleased that our 2016 Australia drilling program came in
under budget, while meeting all operational and health, safety and environmental objectives. The first well was placed on production at
the end of June at an average rate of 2,000 bbls/d for the first month of production, with the second well placed on production in during
the last week of July at an average rate of 2,700 bbls/d. Both wells have been produced at restricted rates to manage production levels
and limit early-stage well drawdown Although we do not anticipate the need to drill another well until 2019, we may consider drilling one
additional sidetrack well in 2017 or 2018, should rig availability on the northwest shelf and favourable day rates make such an investment
particularly attractive.

North America
Q2 2016 capital activities in Canada and the United States were limited, as our 2016 capital plan focused on drilling land expiries on our
operated properties and participating in wells proposed by our partners on non-operated properties. We currently have approximately 12
mmcf/d (2,000 boe/d) of gas-weighted production voluntarily curtailed in response to low AECO prices, with the intent of achieving greater
value by bringing this production back on when gas prices improve. Similarly, we have deferred completion into 2017 for our four (4.0 net)
operated Midale oil wells drilled in southeast Saskatchewan drilled earlier in 2016. While the wells are economic to drill, complete, and tie
in at current prices, we believe that net present value will be enhanced by delaying completion and tie-in until oil prices increase from their
current level.
Sustainability, Governance and Culture
Vermilion’s MSCI ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) rating increased from BB to BBB and our Governance Metrics score for
2016 ranks in the 90th percentile globally. This follows our 9th-place ranking in the 2016 Corporate Knights Future 40 Responsible
Corporate Leaders in Canada list (the highest ranking for an oil and gas company). Recognition such as this reflects Vermilion’s
continued focus on combining financial results with exemplary environmental, social and governance performance. Our next
Sustainability Report is expected to be released in August 2016, which will have further information about our environmental and social
stewardship.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following is Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), dated August 4, 2016, of Vermilion Energy Inc.’s (“Vermilion”, “We”,
“Our”, “Us” or the “Company”) operating and financial results as at and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with
the corresponding periods in the prior year.
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
together with accompanying notes. Additional information relating to Vermilion, including its Annual Information Form, is available on
SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on Vermilion’s website at www.vermilionenergy.com.
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and comparative
information have been prepared in Canadian dollars, except where another currency is indicated, and in accordance with IAS 34, “Interim
Financial Reporting”, as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (“IASB”).
This MD&A includes references to certain financial and performance measures which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). These measures include:
Fund flows from operations: Fund flows from operations is a measure of profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”. Please see
SEGMENTED INFORMATION in the NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for a reconciliation
·
of fund flows from operations to net earnings. We analyze fund flows from operations both on a consolidated basis and on a business unit basis in
order to assess the contribution of each business unit to our ability to generate income necessary to pay dividends, repay debt, fund asset
retirement obligations and make capital investments.
Netbacks: Netbacks are per boe and per mcf performance measures used in the analysis of operational activities. We assess netbacks both on a
·
consolidated basis and on a business unit basis in order to compare and assess the operational and financial performance of each business unit
versus other business units and also versus third party crude oil and natural gas producers.
In addition, this MD&A includes references to certain financial measures which are not specified, defined, or determined under IFRS and
are therefore considered non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar
financial measures presented by other issuers. For a full description of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these
measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES”.

Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
CHANGE IN PRESENTATION
Prior to 2016, we reported our condensate production in Canada and the Netherlands business units within the NGLs production line.
Beginning in Q1 2016, we now report condensate production within the crude oil and condensate production line.  We believe that this
presentation better reflects the historical and forecasted pricing for condensate, which is more closely correlated with crude oil pricing
than with pricing for propane, butane and ethane (collectively “NGLs” for the purposes of this report). Comparative periods have been
adjusted to reflect this change.
2016 GUIDANCE
On November 9, 2015 we announced preliminary 2016 capital expenditure guidance of $350 million and production guidance of between
63,000-65,000 boe/d. On January 5, 2016, in response to the continued weakness in commodity prices we reduced our 2016 capital
expenditure guidance to $285 million with corresponding production guidance of 62,500-63,500 boe/d. On February 29, 2016, we further
revised our 2016 capital expenditure guidance to $235 million as a result of continued commodity price deterioration. We maintained our
production guidance of 62,500-63,500 boe/d. The February 29, 2016 reduction primarily reflected lower expected non-operated drilling
activity in Canada, fewer workovers in France, and a deferral of our Netherlands pipeline twinning program. On August 8, 2016, we
modestly increased our 2016 capital expenditure guidance to $240 million with the reinstatement of a four-well drilling program in the
Champotran field in France and added drilling activity in Canada, partially offset by capital cost savings achieved to date.
The following table summarizes our 2016 guidance:

Operational review
Consolidated average production of 64,285 boe/d in Q2 2016 was a 2% decrease from Q1 2016 due to lower production in Canada and the
·
Netherlands, driven by planned downtime, offset by increased production from Ireland.
Increased consolidated average production for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, by 24% and 27%, respectively, versus the
·
comparable periods in 2015. These increases were primarily due to the addition of Corrib production in Ireland, as well as production growth in
Canada, the Netherlands, the US, and Australia business units.
Executed capital expenditures totalling $71.7 million, primarily in Australia where capital expenditures of $39.9 million were incurred related to the
·
two-well sidetrack drilling program.
Financial review
Net (loss) earnings
The net loss for Q2 2016 was $55.7 million ($0.48/basic share), as compared to a net loss of $85.8 million ($0.76/basic share) in Q1 2016. The
·
decrease in the net loss was primarily attributable to higher revenues as a result of stronger crude oil pricing.
The net loss for Q2 2016 of $55.7 million is compared to net earnings of $6.8 million in Q2 2015. The change was a result of lower petroleum and
natural gas sales as a result of lower commodity prices, as well as higher depletion and depreciation charges associated with higher sold volumes.
·
The net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $141.5 million compared to net earnings of $8.8 million for the comparable period in the
prior year. The change was a result of lower petroleum and natural gas sales as a result of lower commodity prices, higher depletion and
depreciation charges associated with higher sold volumes, and the absence of a $31.8 million court-awarded recovery recognized in Q1 2015.
Fund flows from operations
Generated fund flows from operations of $126.6 million during Q2 2016, an increase of 35% from Q1 2016. This quarter-over-quarter increase was
·
primarily driven by higher crude oil pricing and global cost reductions, including a 6% decrease in per unit operating expense.
Fund flows from operations decreased by 2% and 12% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, versus the comparable
periods in the prior year. This decrease was the result of lower pricing for all commodities, partially offset by higher sold volumes, including the
·
impact of six months of production from Corrib, and global cost reductions. The six months ended June 30, 2016, was also impacted by the
absence of the $31.8 million court-awarded recovery recognized in Q1 2015.
Net debt
· Net debt remained relatively consistent at $1.40 billion.
Dividends
Declared dividends of $0.215 per common share per month during the second quarter of 2016, totalling $1.290 per common share for the six
·
months ended June 30, 2016.

Oil benchmarks saw a sharp quarter-over-quarter rise in price due to seasonal factors as well as unexpected global supply disruptions, primarily
·
from Nigeria and Canada. Averaging US $45.59/bbl in Q2 2016, WTI was up 36% quarter-over-quarter but still down 21% versus the same quarter
in 2015. Dated Brent was up 34% quarter-over-quarter but down 26% from the same period in 2015.
Edmonton Sweet increased 43% quarter-over-quarter to average US $42.51/bbl for Q2 2016. However, Edmonton Sweet prices remained 23%
·
below the same period in 2015.
Seasonal factors and above-normal gas-in-storage resulted in lower AECO gas prices for Q2 2016. Averaging $1.40/mmbtu during Q2 2016,
·
AECO was down by 23% versus Q1 2016 and 47% versus the same period in 2015.
European gas markets managed to largely maintain price levels despite the second quarter typically being a seasonally weaker period. Fuel
·
switching and unplanned maintenance were the main drivers behind the relatively flat quarter-over-quarter price for both TTF and NBP. For Q2
2016, TTF averaged $5.61/mmbtu while NBP averaged $5.78/mmbtu, which represented a 2% and 3% quarter-over-quarter decline, respectively.
The Canadian dollar gained against both the US dollar and the Euro, as stronger oil prices and no change in the US overnight rate benefitted the
·
Canadian dollar. However, the Canadian dollar was weaker on a year-over-year basis.

Fund flows from operations of $126.6 million during Q2 2016 represented an increase of 35% versus Q1 2016. This increase relates
primarily to higher crude oil pricing and global cost reductions, including a 6% decrease in per unit operating expense.
Fund flows from operations decreased by 2% and 12% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, versus the
comparable periods in the prior year. This decrease was the result of lower pricing for all commodities, offset by higher sold volumes,
including the impact of six months of production from Corrib. The impact of lower pricing was further minimized by global cost
reductions, including a 26% and 18% decrease in per unit operating expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2015. Fund flows from operations for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 was also
affected by the absence of a $31.8 million court-awarded recovery recognized in Q1 2015.

Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
Fluctuations in fund flows from operations (and correspondingly net (loss) earnings) may occur as a result of changes in commodity
prices and costs to produce petroleum and natural gas. In addition, fund flows from operations may be significantly affected by the timing
of crude oil shipments in Australia and France. When crude oil inventory is built up, the related operating expense, royalties, and
depletion expense are deferred and carried as inventory on the consolidated balance sheet. When the crude oil inventory is subsequently
drawn down, the related expenses are recognized in income.

Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
Production
Q2 2016 average production in Canada decreased by 8% quarter-over-quarter, mainly driven by a planned turnaround at our West Pembina
battery, production declines, and voluntary gas-weighted production curtailment of approximately 6 mmcf/d (1,000 boe/d) over the quarter in
·
response to low AECO prices. Q2 2016 production increased 8% year-over-year, primarily attributable to strong organic production growth in our
Mannville condensate-rich gas resource play.
·Cardium production averaged approximately 6,700 boe/d in Q2 2016, a 10% decrease quarter-over-quarter.
Mannville production averaged approximately 11,500 boe/d in Q2 2016, a 12% decrease quarter-over-quarter but more than double Q2 2015
·
production of approximately 5,600 boe/d.
·Production from our southeast Saskatchewan assets averaged approximately 2,800 boe/d in Q2 2016, an increase of 5% quarter-over-quarter.
Activity review
·Vermilion drilled one (1.0 net) operated well and participated in the drilling of one (0.1 net) non-operated well during Q2 2016.
Cardium
In Q2 2016, no new operated wells were drilled, completed or brought on production. One (0.1 net) non-operated well was drilled, completed and
-
brought on production during the quarter.
-2016 activity includes drilling three (3.0 net) operated wells, in addition to the optimization of existing assets.
Mannville
-During Q2 2016, one (0.3 net) non-operated well was completed and two (0.8 net) non-operated wells were brought on production.
-In 2016, we plan to drill or participate in 13 (7.8 net) wells; six (3.8 net) wells have been drilled to date.
Saskatchewan
We drilled one (1.0 net) operated Midale well during Q2 2016, which we plan to complete and bring on production in Q1 2017 along with the three
-
operated wells drilled in Q1 2016. One (0.5 net) non-operated well drilled in Q1 2016 was tied in and brought on production during the quarter.
-We have drilled and participated in seven (5.5 net) wells, completing our 2016 planned capital activity.
Sales
The realized price for our crude oil and condensate production in Canada is directly linked to WTI, but is also subject to market conditions in
western Canada. These market conditions can result in fluctuations in the pricing differential to WTI, as reflected by the Edmonton Sweet index
·
price. The realized price of our NGLs in Canada is based on product specific differentials pertaining to trading hubs in the United States. The
realized price of our natural gas in Canada is based on the AECO spot price in Canada.
·Q2 2016 sales per boe increased versus Q1 2016 due to strengthening crude oil pricing.
Sales per boe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased versus the comparable periods in 2015, largely as a result of lower
·
crude oil and natural gas pricing.
Royalties
Royalties as a percentage of sales for Q2 2016 decreased to 6.1% as compared to 9.8% in Q1 2016 as a result of an annual favourable gas cost
·
allowance adjustment in Alberta resulting in gas royalties being in a recovery position for the current quarter.
Royalties as a percentage of sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to 6.1% and 7.9% versus 6.3% and 8.5% for the
·
comparable 2015 periods due to the impact of lower reference prices on the sliding scale used to determine crude oil royalty rates.
Transportation
·Transportation expense relates to the delivery of crude oil and natural gas production to major pipelines where legal title transfers.
·Transportation expense for Q2 2016 was lower than Q1 2016 as a result of lower production.
Transportation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was lower for both periods in absolute dollars while production
·
increased. This was primarily the result of production having an increased natural gas weighting, which has a lower per unit transportation cost
relative to crude oil, condensate and NGLs.
Operating
Operating expense reductions of 23% in Q2 2016 versus Q1 2016, resulting in a 16% reduction in per unit costs for the second consecutive quarter.
·
Our cost control and cost-cutting initiatives, including service cost negotiations impacting numerous cost drivers, have resulted in these cost
reductions.
Operating expenses were lower on an absolute dollar basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in
·
2015 by 24% and 7% respectively. As a result of the cost control and cost-cutting initiatives, these reductions were achieved while increasing
production, resulting in year-over-year per unit decreases of 29% and 19%.
15
Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
General and administration
·General and administration expense fluctuation in Q2 2016 as compared to Q1 2016 was the result of expenditure timing.
Year-over-year, general and administration expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was 29% lower than the comparable period in 2015
·
due to cost-cutting initiatives to reduce our cost structure and preserve balance sheet strength.

Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
Production
Production increased 1% versus the prior quarter. Year-over-year production decreased 4%, due to the impact of production additions from our
·
Champotran drilling program in 2015 and third party restrictions impacting Vic Bilh gas production.
Activity review
·During the quarter we completed a number of workover and optimization programs in the Aquitaine and Paris Basins.
In 2016, our planned capital activity includes a four-well drilling program in Champotran, and approximately 15 well workovers in the Aquitaine and
·
Paris Basins.
Sales
· Crude oil in France is priced with reference to Dated Brent.
·Q2 2016 sales per boe increased versus Q1 2016 due to strengthening crude oil pricing.
Sales per boe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased versus the comparable periods in 2015 as a result of weakening crude
·
oil pricing.
Royalties
Royalties in France relate to two components: RCDM (levied on units of production and not subject to changes in commodity prices) and R31
·
(based on a percentage of sales).
Royalties as a percentage of sales was 10.7% and 12.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease from the 14.1% realized in
·
Q1 2016 and an increase over the comparable periods in 2015. These fluctuations in royalties as a percentage of sales were the result of fixed per
unit RCDM royalties.
Transportation
·Transportation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was relatively consistent with Q1 2016 and Q2 2015.
Transportation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by 10% compared to the prior year due to a 6% increase in volumes
sold and an 8% depreciation in the Canadian dollar relative to the Euro. After adjusting for the unfavourable foreign exchange impact, per unit
·
transportation costs decreased by 4% year-over-year due to successful vessel cost renegotiations and a lower level of project activity at the Ambès
terminal.
Operating
Operating expense decreased by 21% from Q1 2016 primarily due to decreases in electricity pricing, electricity consumption and lower downhole
·
maintenance costs. In addition, an inventory build and a favourable foreign exchange adjustment as the Euro weakened relative to the Canadian
dollar resulted in lower costs.
Operating expense on a dollar basis decreased 7% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and increased 12% for the six months ended June
30, 2016 versus the same periods in 2015. An ongoing focus on cost reduction initiatives and savings from contract renegotiations helped offset an
·
unfavourable foreign exchange expense in both periods. After normalizing for the unfavourable foreign exchange impact, per unit costs have
decreased 7% and 2% respectively for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
General and administration
General and administration expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 3% and 6% respectively compared to the
·
prior year due to cost reduction initiatives.
Current income taxes
In France, current income taxes are applied to taxable income, after eligible deductions, at a statutory rate of 34.4% for 2016.  For 2016, the
·
effective rate on current taxes is expected to be between approximately 1% to 3% of pre-tax fund flows from operations. This is subject to change in
response to commodity price fluctuations, the timing of capital expenditures, and other eligible in-country adjustments.
·Current income taxes in Q2 2016 were higher compared to Q1 2016 and lower compared to Q2 2015 due to the respective change in sales.
·Current income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were lower versus the comparative period in 2015 as a result of decreased sales.

Production
Q2 2016 production decreased 8% versus the prior quarter mainly due to downtime associated with the installation of permanent wellsite facilities
·
for the Slootdorp-06/07 wells.
Year-over-year production increased 50%, primarily due to production additions from Diever-02 and Slootdorp-06/07 wells, and enhanced by
·
debottlenecking at our Garijp Treatment Centre. The Diever-02 exploration well (45% working interest), which came on an extended production test
in late October 2015, continues to produce approximately 15 mmcf/d (2,500 boe/d), net to Vermilion.
·Production in the Netherlands is actively managed to optimize facility use and regulate declines.
Activity review
· Installed permanent wellsite facilities for the Slootdorp-06/07 wells during Q2 2016.
Planning activities for the drilling of Langezwaag-03 (42% working interest) and Andel-6ST (45% working interest) were carried out during the
·
quarter. We expect to drill these wells in Q3 2016, and if successful, we expect to have the wells on production prior to year end.

Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
Sales
The price of our natural gas in the Netherlands is based on the TTF day-ahead index. GasTerra, a state owned entity, continues to purchase all of
·
the natural gas we produce in the Netherlands.
Sales per boe decreased versus all comparable periods, consistent with a decrease in the TTF reference price. Compared to the comparable
·
periods in 2015, the decrease in price was entirely offset by increased production.
Royalties
In the Netherlands, we pay overriding royalties on certain wells associated with an acquisition completed by the Netherlands business unit in
·
October 2013.  As such, fluctuations in royalty expense in the periods presented relate to the amount of production from those wells subject to
overriding royalties.
Transportation
·Our production in the Netherlands is not subject to transportation expense as gas is sold at the plant gate.
Operating
·Operating expense on a dollar basis decreased versus Q1 2016 by 28% due to continued focus on cost-cutting initiatives.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 operating expense was lower on a dollar and per unit basis compared to the same periods in
·
2015. Our ongoing focus on cost control, while increasing year-over-year volumes by approximately 50%, resulted in per unit cost decreases of
47% and 39% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 versus the comparable periods in 2015.
General and administration
Variances in general and administration expense generally relate to timing of expenditures, including the timing of allocations from Vermilion’s
·
Corporate segment.
Current income taxes
In the Netherlands, current income taxes are applied to taxable income, after eligible deductions, at an implied tax rate of approximately 46%. For
·
2016, the effective rate on current taxes is expected to be between approximately 15% and 17% of pre-tax fund flows from operations. This rate is
subject to change in response to commodity price fluctuations, the timing of capital expenditures, and other eligible in-country adjustments.
Current income taxes in Q2 2016 were higher compared to Q1 2016 as decreased revenues were offset by the impact of changes to the 2016 full
·
year tax estimates. Q2 2016 current income taxes were higher compared to Q2 2015 as result of increased pre-tax fund flows from operations.
Q2 2016 year-to-date current income taxes were higher compared to the comparative period in 2015 as a result of increased pre-tax fund flows from
·
operations.

Production
Q2 2016 production decreased 10% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year. Q2 2016 production was impacted by a shut down for pipeline
·
pigging operations.
Activity review
During Q2 2016, Vermilion entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement for operated and non-operated interests in five oil and three gas
producing fields from Engie E&P Deutschland GmbH, for total consideration of €33 million ($47.9 million). Vermilion will assume operatorship of six
·
of the eight producing fields. For 2016, the assets are expected to produce approximately 2,000 boe/d (50% oil). The acquisition has an effective
date of January 1, 2016 and is anticipated to close in late Q4 2016.
In 2016, the majority of activity will be associated with permitting and pre-drill activities for Burgmoor Z5 and two farm-in prospects, which are
·
planned for 2017. In addition, we will continue our ongoing analysis of the proprietary geologic data associated with the farm-in assets.
Sales
· The price of our natural gas in Germany is based on the TTF month-ahead index.
·Sales per boe decreased versus all comparable periods, consistent with a decrease in the TTF reference price.
21
Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
Royalties
·Our production in Germany is subject to state and private royalties on sales after certain eligible deductions.
Royalties as a percentage of sales was 15.4% and 13.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease from the 21.1% and 17.4%
·
for the comparable periods in 2015. The decrease is due to unfavourable prior year adjustments impacting 2015.
Transportation
·Transportation expense in Germany relates to costs incurred to deliver natural gas from the processing facility to the customer.
Q2 2016 transportation expense increased from Q1 2016 on a total dollar and per unit basis due to an adjustment recorded in the current quarter
·
relating to 2015.
Transportation expense decreased by 15% and 9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015,
·
primarily due to declining production.
Operating
·Operating expenses for Germany primarily relate to tariffs charged for facility operations and gas processing.
Operating expense for Q2 2016 was consistent with Q1 2016 and increased from Q2 2015 on a total dollar basis due to higher levels of project
·
activity.
·Year-to-date Q2 2016 operating expense increased versus 2015 on a total dollar and per unit basis due to higher levels of project activity.
·We expect per unit operating costs to improve as our production base in Germany grows.
General and administration
· Q2 2016 general and administration expenses were consistent with Q1 2016.
General and administration costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are higher compared to 2015 due to higher staffing levels and
·
office costs incurred to support our farm-in agreement, as well as costs incurred to support asset acquisition activity.
·We expect per unit general and administration costs to improve as our production base in Germany grows.
Current income taxes
Current income taxes in Germany are applied to taxable income, after eligible deductions, at a statutory tax rate of approximately 24.2%. As a
·
function of Vermilion’s tax basis in Germany, Vermilion does not presently pay income taxes in Germany.

Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
Sales
· Crude oil in Australia is priced with reference to Dated Brent.
Q2 2016 sales per boe increased versus Q1 2016, consistent with an increase in the Dated Brent reference price. This increase in price, combined
·
with higher volumes sold, resulted in a 69% increase in sales.
Sales per boe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased versus the comparable periods in 2015 due to weaker crude oil pricing.
·
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, this decline in price was coupled with lower volumes sold, resulting in a 40% decrease in sales.
Royalties and transportation
·Our production in Australia is not subject to royalties or transportation expense as crude oil is sold directly at the Wandoo B platform.
Operating
Operating expense on a dollar basis increased from Q1 2016, primarily due to the 29% increase in volumes sold, higher diesel costs and increased
·
project activity.
Year-over-year operating expense is down 33% and 18% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 versus the comparable periods in
·
2015. After adjusting for timing of sales, per unit cost decreases of 15% and 22% for the three and six month periods were realized through a
continued focus on cost reduction initiatives, including reduced helicopter and vessel costs.
General and administration
Fluctuation in general and administration expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 versus the comparable periods in 2015 was
·
largely a result of the timing of expenditures.
PRRT and corporate income taxes
In Australia, current income taxes include both PRRT and corporate income taxes. PRRT is a profit based tax applied at a rate of 40% on sales less
·
eligible expenditures, including operating expenses and capital expenditures.  Corporate income taxes are applied at a rate of 30% on taxable
income after eligible deductions, which include PRRT.
For 2016, the effective tax rate for corporate income tax is expected to be between approximately 4% to 6% of pre-tax fund flows from operations
·
and PRRT is expected to be between approximately 0% to 2% of pre-tax fund flows from operations. This is subject to change in response to
commodity price fluctuations, the timing of capital expenditures and other eligible in-country adjustments.
·Current income taxes in Q2 2016 were higher compared to Q1 2016 and lower compared to Q2 2015 due to the respective change in sales.
PPRT in Q2 2016 was relatively flat compared to Q1 2016 as increased sales were offset with the impact of 2016 capital expenditures in the
·
calculation of PRRT. Q2 2016 PRRT was lower compared to Q2 2015 due to decreased sales.
·Q2 2016 year-to-date current income taxes and PRRT were lower versus the comparable period in 2015 as a result of decreased sales.

Production
Q2 2016 production increased 15% versus the prior quarter and over 300% versus the prior year due to production additions from our Seedy Draw
well drilled in 2015, and Coyote Draw and Reed 17 wells completed in Q1 2016. The Coyote Draw well is currently producing 145 bbls/d in its
·
fourth month of production. The Reed 17 well experienced a mechanical failure during the completion operation which resulted in only
approximately 8% of the horizontal section being open to production. Despite only producing from one or two frac stages, the Reed 17 well is
currently producing 40 bbls/d of oil in its third month of production.
Activity review
·In Q1 2016, we completed the two (2.0 net) wells drilled in the East Finn prospect in Q4 2015.
Sales
·The price of crude oil in the United States is directly linked to WTI, subject to market conditions in the United States.
27
Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
Royalties
·Our production in the United States is subject to federal and private royalties, severance tax, and ad valorem tax.
·
Royalties (including severance and ad valorem taxes) as a percentage of sales of approximately 30% has remained consistent across all periods.
Operating
The increase in operating expense for Q2 2016 as compared to Q1 2016 and Q2 2015 was primarily due to increasing production rates over these
·
periods. On a per unit basis, expenses have decreased by 6% and 35% for these periods.
On a year-over-year basis, full year per unit operating costs have decreased by 49% as a result of a continued focus on cost cutting initiatives and
·
our drilling program (which resulted in a 251% increase in production).
General and administration
·General and administration expenses decreased versus Q1 2016 and Q2 2015 due to cost-cutting initiatives.
·On a year-over year basis cost-cutting initiatives have resulted in a 10% reduction in expenses.

General and administration
The fluctuations in the recovery of general and administration costs for Q2 2016 versus all comparable periods is due to the timing of expenditures
·
and salary allocations to the various business unit segments.
Current income taxes
·Taxes in our corporate segment relate to holding companies that pay current taxes in foreign jurisdictions.
Interest expense
The decrease in interest expense versus Q1 2016 and Q2 2015 is primarily due to the retiring of our 6.5% senior unsecured notes in February
·
using funds from our revolving credit facility, which has a marginal rate of 3.4%.
Interest expense of the six months ended June 30, 2016 was relatively unchanged as the aforementioned reduced interest expense from retiring
·
our 6.5% senior unsecured notes was offset by higher average borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Hedging
The nature of our operations results in exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We monitor
and, when appropriate, use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. All transactions of this nature entered into
are related to an underlying financial position or to future crude oil and natural gas production. We do not use derivative financial instruments for
·
speculative purposes. We have elected not to designate any of our derivative financial instruments as accounting hedges and thus account for
changes in fair value in net (loss) earnings at each reporting period. We have not obtained collateral or other security to support our financial
derivatives as we review the creditworthiness of our counterparties prior to entering into derivative contracts.
Our hedging philosophy is to hedge solely for the purposes of risk mitigation. Our approach is to hedge centrally to manage our global risk (typically
·
with an outlook of 12 to 18 months) up to 50% of net of royalty volumes through a portfolio of forward collars, swaps, and physical fixed price
arrangements. We currently have European gas contracts up to 30 months forward as an exception to our typical horizon.
We believe that our hedging philosophy and approach increases the stability of revenues, cash flows, and future dividends while also assisting us
·
in the execution of our capital and development plans.
·The realized gain in Q2 2016 related primarily to amounts received on our global natural gas and crude oil hedges.
·A listing of derivative positions as at June 30, 2016 is included in “Supplemental Table 2” of this MD&A.

The fluctuations in net (loss) earnings from period-to-period are caused by changes in both cash and non-cash based income and
charges. Cash based items are reflected in fund flows from operations and include: sales, royalties, operating expenses, transportation,
general and administration expense, current tax expense, interest expense, realized gains and losses on derivative instruments, and
realized foreign exchange gains and losses. Non-cash items include: equity based compensation expense, unrealized gains and losses
on derivative instruments, unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, accretion, depletion and depreciation expense, and deferred
taxes. In addition, non-cash items may also include amounts resulting from acquisitions or charges resulting from impairment or
impairment recoveries.
Equity based compensation
Equity based compensation expense relates primarily to non-cash compensation expense attributable to long-term incentives granted to
directors, officers, and employees under the Vermilion Incentive Plan (“VIP”). The expense is recognized over the vesting period based
on the grant date fair value of awards, adjusted for the ultimate number of awards that actually vest as determined by the Company’s
achievement of performance conditions.
Equity based compensation decreased versus all comparable periods primarily due to a revision of vesting estimates. The decrease from
Q1 2016 also resulted from the settlement of the employee bonus plan with equity in Q1 2016.
Unrealized gain or loss on derivative instruments
Unrealized gain or loss on derivative instruments arise as a result of changes in forecasted future commodity prices. As Vermilion uses
derivative instruments to manage the commodity price exposure of our future crude oil and natural gas production, we will normally
recognize unrealized gains on derivative instruments when forecasted future commodity prices decline and vice-versa.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized an unrealized loss on derivative instruments of $63.4 million, relating primarily to
a loss on our global natural gas hedges. As at June 30, 2016, we have a net derivative asset position of $5.0 million.
Unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss
As a result of Vermilion’s international operations, Vermilion has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
Canadian dollar. These monetary assets and liabilities include cash, receivables, payables, long-term debt, derivative instruments and
intercompany loans, primarily denominated in the US dollar and Euro.
Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses result from translating these monetary assets and liabilities from their underlying currency
to the functional currency of Vermilion and its subsidiaries. Unrealized foreign exchange primarily results from the translation of Euro
denominated financial assets and US dollar denominated financial liabilities. As such, an appreciation in the Euro against the Canadian
dollar will result in an unrealized foreign exchange gain while an appreciation in the US dollar against the Canadian dollar will result in an
unrealized foreign exchange loss (and vice-versa).
30
Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Canadian dollar weakened slightly against the US dollar while remaining relatively
unchanged against the Euro, resulting in an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $2.8 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the
Canadian dollar strengthened more significantly against the Euro than the US dollar, resulting in an unrealized foreign exchange loss of
$1.2 million.
Accretion
Accretion expense is recognized to update the present value of the asset retirement obligation balance. Fluctuations in accretion
expense are primarily the result of changes in discount rates applicable to the balance of asset retirement obligations and changes in the
balance of asset retirement obligations, including the impact of additions resulting from drilling and acquisitions.
Q2 2016 accretion expense was relatively consistent with all comparative periods.
Depletion and depreciation
Depletion and depreciation expense is recognized to allocate the capitalized cost of extracting natural resources and the cost of material
assets over the useful life of the respective assets. Fluctuations in depletion and depreciation expense are primarily the result of changes
in produced crude oil and natural gas volumes.
Depletion and depreciation on a per boe basis for Q2 2016 of $22.80 was relatively consistent as compared to $21.65 in Q1 2016 and
$22.98 in Q2 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, depletion and depreciation on a per boe basis of $22.23 was relatively
consistent with $22.48 in the same period of 2015.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax expense (recovery) arises primarily as a result of changes in the accounting basis and tax basis for capital assets and asset
retirement obligations and changes in available tax losses.
Impairment
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, Vermilion recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $14.8 million in Ireland as a result of a
decline in the price forecast for European natural gas.
FINANCIAL POSITION REVIEW
Balance sheet strategy
We believe that our balance sheet supports our defined growth initiatives and our focus is on managing and maintaining a conservative
balance sheet. To ensure that our balance sheet continues to support our defined growth initiatives, we regularly review whether
forecasted fund flows from operations is sufficient to finance planned capital expenditures, dividends, and abandonment and reclamation
expenditures. To the extent that forecasted fund flows from operations is not expected to be sufficient to fulfill such expenditures, we will
evaluate our ability to finance any excess with debt (including borrowing using the unutilized capacity of our existing revolving credit
facility), issue equity, or by reducing some or all categories of expenditures to ensure that total expenditures do not exceed available
funds.
To ensure that we maintain a conservative balance sheet, we monitor the ratio of net debt to fund flows from operations and typically
strive to maintain an internally targeted ratio of approximately 1.0 to 1.5 in a normalized commodity price environment. Where prices trend
higher, we may target a lower ratio and conversely, in a lower commodity price environment, the acceptable ratio may be higher. At times,
we will use our balance sheet to finance acquisitions and, in these situations, we are prepared to accept a higher ratio in the short term
but will implement a strategy to reduce the ratio to acceptable levels within a reasonable period of time, usually considered to be no more
than 12 to 24 months. This plan could potentially include an increase in hedging activities, a reduction in capital expenditures, an
issuance of equity or the utilization of excess fund flows from operations to reduce outstanding indebtedness.
In the current low commodity price environment, Vermilion’s net debt to fund flows from operations ratio is expected to be higher than the
internally targeted ratio. During this period, Vermilion will remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet by aligning capital
expenditures within forecasted fund flows from operations, which is continually monitored for revised forward price estimates, as well as
by hedging additional European natural gas volumes to maintain a diversified commodity portfolio.

(1) Current liabilities at December 31, 2015 includes $224,901 relating to the current portion of long-term debt.
As at June 30, 2016, long term debt decreased to $1.35 billion (December 31, 2015 - $1.39 billion, including the current portion of long-term
debt) as capital expenditures and cash dividends were funded through fund flows from operations. The decrease in long-term debt was
offset by working capital changes, such that net debt increased from $1.38 billion at December 31, 2015 to $1.40 billion at June 30, 2016.
Weaker commodity prices versus the prior period decreased fund flows from operations, resulting in the ratio of net debt to annualized
fund flows from operations increasing from 2.7 to 3.2.
Shareholders’ capital
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we maintained monthly dividends at $0.215 per share and declared dividends which totalled
$147.5 million.
The following table outlines our dividend payment history:

January 2014 to Present
$0.215
Our policy with respect to dividends is to be conservative and maintain a low ratio of dividends to fund flows from operations. During low
commodity price cycles, we will initially maintain dividends and allow the ratio to rise. Should low commodity price cycles remain for an
extended period of time, we will evaluate the necessity of changing the level of dividends, taking into consideration capital development
requirements, debt levels, and acquisition opportunities.
As a further step to preserve our financial flexibility and conservatively exercise our access to capital, in February of 2015 we amended
our existing dividend reinvestment plan to include a Premium Dividend™ Component. The Premium Dividend™ Component, when
combined with our continuing Dividend Reinvestment Component, increases our access to the lowest cost sources of equity capital
available. While the Premium Dividend™ results in a modest amount of equity issuance, we believe it represents the most prudent
approach to preserving near-term balance sheet strength. We view implementation of a Premium Dividend™ as a short-term measure to
maintain our financial flexibility while we continue to lower our unit costs and await further clarity on the direction of commodity prices.
Both components of our program can be reduced or eliminated at the company’s discretion, offering considerable flexibility. We will
actively monitor our ongoing needs and manage our continued use of each component as circumstances dictate.
Although we expect to be able to maintain our current dividend, fund flows from operations may not be sufficient during this low
commodity price environment to fund cash dividends, capital expenditures, and asset retirement obligations. We will evaluate our ability
to finance any shortfalls with debt, issuances of equity, or by reducing some or all categories of expenditures to ensure that total
expenditures do not exceed available funds.

(1) DRIP Refers to Vermilion’s dividend reinvestment and Premium DividendTM plans.
As at June 30, 2016, there were approximately 1.7 million VIP awards outstanding. As at August 4, 2016, there were approximately 116.6
million common shares issued and outstanding.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
As at June 30, 2016, asset retirement obligations were $329.1 million compared to $305.6 million as at December 31, 2015.
The increase in asset retirement obligations is largely attributable to an overall decrease in the discount rates applied to the abandonment
obligations.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have certain lease agreements that are entered into in the normal course of operations, including operating leases for which no asset
or liability value has been assigned to the consolidated balance sheet as at June 30, 2016.
We have not entered into any guarantee or off balance sheet arrangements that would materially impact our financial position or results of
operations.
RISK MANAGEMENT
Vermilion is exposed to various market and operational risks. For a detailed discussion of these risks, please see Vermilion’s Annual
Report for the year ended December 31, 2015.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions
that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, gains and losses, and disclosures of any possible contingencies. These
estimates and assumptions are developed based on the best available information which management believed to be reasonable at the
time such estimates and assumptions were made. As such, these assumptions are uncertain at the time estimates are made and could
change, resulting in a material impact on Vermilion’s consolidated financial statements. Estimates are reviewed by management on an
ongoing basis and as a result may change from period to period due to the availability of new information or changes in circumstances.
Additionally, as a result of the unique circumstances of each jurisdiction that Vermilion operates in, the critical accounting estimates may
affect one or more jurisdictions. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates used in applying accounting
policies for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Further information, including a discussion of critical accounting estimates, can be
found in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and annual MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2015, available on
SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on Vermilion’s website at www.vermilionenergy.com.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There was no change in Vermilion’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this MD&A that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

Vermilion Energy Inc.2016 Second Quarter Report
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This MD&A includes references to certain financial measures which do not have standardized meanings. These financial measures
include fund flows from operations, a measure of profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” (please see
SEGMENTED INFORMATION in the NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) and net debt, a
measure of capital in accordance with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (please see CAPITAL DISCLOSURES in the NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).
In addition, this MD&A includes financial measures which are not specified, defined, or determined under IFRS and are therefore
considered non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These non-GAAP
financial measures include:
Fund flows from operations per basic and diluted share: Management assesses fund flows from operations on a per share basis as we
believe this provides a measure of our operating performance after taking into account the issuance and potential future issuance of
Vermilion common shares. Fund flows from operations per basic share is calculated by dividing fund flows from operations by the basic
weighted average shares outstanding as defined under IFRS. Fund flows from operations per diluted share is calculated by dividing fund
flows from operations by the sum of basic weighted average shares outstanding and incremental shares issuable under the VIP as
determined using the treasury stock method.
Free cash flow: Represents fund flows from operations in excess of drilling and development and exploration and evaluation costs
(collectively referred to as capital expenditures).  We consider free cash flow to be a key measure as it is used to determine the funding
available for investing and financing activities, including payment of dividends, repayment of long-term debt, reallocation to existing
business units, and deployment into new ventures.
Net dividends: We define net dividends as dividends declared less proceeds received for the issuance of shares pursuant to the dividend
reinvestment and Premium Dividend™ plans. Management monitors net dividends and net dividends as a percentage of fund flows from
operations to assess our ability to pay dividends.
Payout: We define payout as net dividends plus drilling and development costs, exploration and evaluation costs, dispositions, and asset
retirement obligations settled. Management uses payout to assess the amount of cash distributed back to shareholders and re-invested
in the business for maintaining production and organic growth.
Fund flows from operations (excluding Corrib) and Payout (excluding Corrib): Management excludes expenditures relating to the Corrib
project in assessing fund flows from operations and payout in order to assess our ability to generate income and finance organic growth
from our current producing assets. Beginning in Q1 2016, the Corrib project is considered a producing asset, and as such these financial
measures are not applicable for the 2016 periods.
Diluted shares outstanding: Is the sum of shares outstanding at the period end plus outstanding awards under the VIP, based on current
estimates of future performance factors and forfeiture rates.
Cash dividends per share: Represents cash dividends declared per share.
The following tables reconcile fund flows from operations excluding Corrib, net dividends, payout (and excluding Corrib), and diluted
shares outstanding to their most directly comparable GAAP measures as presented in our financial statements:

Impairment
On a quarterly basis, Vermilion performs an assessment as to whether any cash generating units (“CGUs”) have indicators of impairment.
When indicators of impairment are identified, Vermilion assesses the recoverable amount of the applicable CGU based on the higher of
the estimated fair value less costs to sell and value in use as at the reporting date. The estimated recoverable amount takes into account
commodity price forecasts, expected production, estimated costs and timing of development, and undeveloped land values.
As a result of declines in the European natural gas price forecast, which decreased expected cash flows, Vermilion recorded a non-cash
impairment charge of $14.8 million in the Ireland segment for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The recoverable amount of the CGU
was determined using a value in use approach based on forecasted reserves and expected cash flows and an after-tax discount rate of
9%.
The determination of impairment is sensitive to changes in key judgments, including reserve revisions, changes in forward commodity
prices and exchange rates, and changes in costs and timing of development. Changes in these key judgments would impact the
recoverable amount of CGUs, therefore resulting in additional impairment charges or recoveries. For the six months ended June 30, 2016,
a one percent increase in the assumed discount rate on expected cash flows of the Ireland CGU would result in an additional impairment
of $25.6 million, and a five percent decrease in forward commodity prices would result in an additional impairment of $39.6 million.
The following table outlines the forward commodity price estimates that were used in the calculation of the recoverable amount:

Revolving Credit Facility
At June 30, 2016, Vermilion had in place a bank revolving credit facility totalling $2 billion, of which approximately $1.35 billion was drawn.
The facility, which matures on May 31, 2019, is fully revolving up to the date of maturity.
The facility is extendable from time to time, but not more than once per year, for a period not longer than four years, at the option of the
lenders and upon notice from Vermilion. If no extension is granted by the lenders, the amounts owing pursuant to the facility are due at
the maturity date. This facility bears interest at a rate applicable to demand loans plus applicable margins. For the six months ended June
30, 2016, the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was approximately 3.4% (2015 – 3.1%).
The amount available to Vermilion under this facility is reduced by certain outstanding letters of credit associated with Vermilion’s
operations totalling $24.0 million as at June 30, 2016 (December 31, 2015 - $25.2 million).
The facility is secured by various fixed and floating charges against the subsidiaries of Vermilion. As at June 30, 2016, Vermilion was in
compliance with all financial covenants. These financial covenants required Vermilion to maintain:
A ratio of total debt (defined as amounts classified as “Long-term debt”, “Current portion of long term debt”, and “Finance lease obligation” on the
·
balance sheet), to consolidated net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, accretion and other certain non-cash items (defined as
consolidated EBITDA) of not greater than 4.0.
A ratio of consolidated total senior debt (defined as consolidated total debt excluding unsecured and subordinated debt) to total capitalization
·
(defined as amounts classified as “Shareholders’ equity” on the balance sheet plus consolidated total senior debt as defined above) of not greater
than 55%.

The ratio of net debt to annualized fund flows from operations increased to 3.2 times for the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily as a
result of declines in commodity prices, which decreased annualized fund flows from operations.
11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Determination of Fair Values
The level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorized is determined on the basis of the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Transfers between levels on the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred
at the end of the reporting period.
Level 1 – Fair value measurement is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.
Level 2 – Fair value measurement is determined based on inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices that are observable, either directly
or indirectly.
Level 3 – Fair value measurement is based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 measurements. Cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and payables approximate
their value due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The fair value of long-term debt on the revolving credit facility approximates
carrying value due to the use of short-term borrowing instruments at market rates of interest.
Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are classified as Level 2 measurements. The fair value for derivative assets and derivative
liabilities are determined using pricing models incorporating future prices that are based on assumptions which are supported by prices
from observable market transactions and are adjusted for credit risk.
Vermilion does not have any financial instruments classified as Level 3 measurements.

Nature and Extent of Risks Arising from Financial Instruments
Market risk:
Vermilion’s financial instruments are exposed to currency risk related to changes in foreign currency denominated financial instruments
and commodity price risk related to outstanding derivatives. The following table summarizes the impact on comprehensive income before
tax for the six months ended June 30, 2016 given changes in the relevant risk variables that Vermilion considers reasonably possible at
the balance sheet date. The impact on comprehensive income before tax associated with changes in these risk variables for assets and
liabilities that are not considered financial instruments are excluded from this analysis. This analysis does not attempt to reflect any
interdependencies between the relevant risk variables.
