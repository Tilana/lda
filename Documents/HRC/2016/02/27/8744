<p><b>  Mission to Paraguay 
</b></p>
<p>  (14&#8211;22 April 2009) 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Mr. Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, 
undertook a mission to Paraguay between 14 and 22 April 2009. In the course of the 
mission the Special Rapporteur examined the status of the right to education at all levels: 
preschool, primary, secondary and tertiary education. 
</p>
<p> In this report the Special Rapporteur examines the main characteristics of the 
Paraguayan education system in terms of organization, coverage, infrastructure, State 
expenditure and the policy of the current Government; and looks at a number of specific 
programmes, such as bilingual intercultural education, and several other State agencies 
working with education, such as the National Programme on Equal Opportunities for 
Women in Education (PRIOME) and the Abrazo programme. 
 The Special Rapporteur found that there are a number of challenges facing 
Paraguay&#8217;s education system. He notes with concern the high repetition rate in basic 
education (30 per cent), low completion rate in secondary education (27 per cent) and the 
neglect into which rural dwellers and the indigenous communities have fallen, in nearly all 
aspects of development. The Special Rapporteur finds it regrettable that the illiteracy rate 
among indigenous people aged over 15 is 40 per cent. 
</p>
<p> In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the Paraguayan Congress should allocate a 
progressive budget to education. The Special Rapporteur recalls the State&#8217;s domestic and

<p>international obligation to gradually invest in education to the maximum of its available 
resources. In this context he recommends that the education budget should grow by 0.5 per 
cent of GDP per year until it reaches at least the level of 6 per cent established by 
international standards. 
</p>
<p> In addition, the Special Rapporteur believes it is necessary to attempt to build a 
national consensus on education, one that will transcend changes of government. Debate 
should be encouraged, so that the problems of education are no longer seen as &#8220;political 
footballs&#8221;. Education urgently needs to be made a national priority and the first task is to 
assign it the budget it needs, and not merely to cover teachers&#8217; pay. The education system 
needs resources to solve infrastructure problems and for drinking water, school meals, 
culturally diverse teaching materials, teacher training and affirmative measures of all kinds 
to ensure that the poorest members of the community can get to school, stay there and do 
well there.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Mr. Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, 
undertook a mission to Paraguay between 14 and 22 April 2009. He visited the cities of 
Asunci&#243;n and Ciudad del Este and the departments of Presidente Hayes and Central and 
Alto Paran&#225;. The Special Rapporteur had the honour to be received by the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Education, the Minister for Women, the Minister for 
Children and the Minister Secretary-General of the Office of the President; and by the 
Ombudsman, the National Council on Education and Culture, the Commission on 
Bilingualism, the Chair of the Senate Education Commission and other national and local 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>2. In the course of some 60 separate meetings, the Special Rapporteur also spoke with 
more than 300 representatives of civil society, including indigenous leaders, school 
teachers, students, parents, teachers&#8217; unions and representatives of United Nations agencies 
in Paraguay. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit primary and secondary 
schools and evening schools, and Asunci&#243;n University, a prison, and formal and non-formal 
education projects run by NGOs, as well as other State agencies working in this area, such 
as the National Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women in Education (PRIOME) 
and the Abrazo programme. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to the Government for its 
invitation and for having made it possible for him to meet all the authorities relevant to his 
mandate, and to all those individuals he met in the course of his visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Right to education: principles, norms and standards 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Republic of Paraguay is party to various international human rights instruments: 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (accession 1992); the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1992); the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1990) and the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture (2005); the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (2003); the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1987); the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (1990) and its two optional protocols, on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict (2002) and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
(2003); and the ILO Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries, 1989 (No. 169) (1993). All these instruments contain specific provisions on 
education and place an obligation on the State to take all necessary steps to protect, observe 
and promote the exercise of the right to education for all persons in its territory, without 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>4. Under article 137 of the Constitution, &#8220;the Constitution is the supreme law of the 
Republic. The Constitution, the international treaties, conventions and agreements that have 
been approved and ratified by Congress, the laws adopted by Congress, and other related 
legal provisions of lesser rank make up Paraguay&#8217;s corpus of positive law, in the order of 
precedence in which they appear above&#8221;. Similarly, article 141 states: &#8220;International treaties 
that have been duly concluded and adopted by Act of Congress and in respect of which the 
instruments of ratification have been exchanged or deposited shall form part of domestic 
legislation, with the rank specified in article 137.&#8221; Under domestic law and the international 
human rights instruments ratified by Paraguay, the State has an obligation to provide and 
facilitate education to its inhabitants without discrimination. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12088 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal framework and national policies 
</b></p>
<p>5. The three main legal texts relating to education in Paraguay are the 1992 
Constitution, chapter VII, on education and culture, the provisions of which are outlined 
above, the Education Act (Act No. 1264 of 1998) and the Children and Adolescents Code 
(Act No. 1680 of 2001). 
</p><p>6. Under article 76 of the Constitution, basic education is compulsory and free of 
charge and the State shall promote secondary, technical, agricultural, industrial and higher 
or university education, and scientific and technological research. 
</p>
<p>7. The State of Paraguay has adopted the regulatory and legislative measures necessary 
to establish an education system that seeks to guarantee the exercise of the right to 
education. The general legislative framework is governed by those provisions of the 
Constitution that deal with education, and by the Education Act and the Children and 
Adolescents Code. These general provisions are further developed by other laws and 
regulations on specific aspects of education. Special mention will be made of these in this 
report, under the relevant headings. 
</p>
<p>8. To begin with, the Constitution recognizes the right &#8220;to comprehensive, ongoing 
education realized as a system and a process in the context of the culture of the community&#8221; 
and states that the aims of education are &#8220;the full development of the human personality and 
the promotion of freedom and peace, social justice, solidarity, cooperation and the 
integration of peoples; respect for human rights and democratic principles; the affirmation 
of commitment to the Nation and of cultural identity, intellectual, moral and civic training, 
and the elimination of discriminatory content from educational materials&#8221;.1 Under the 
Constitution, primary basic education is free of charge (in State schools) and compulsory.2 
The Constitution proclaims literacy and vocational training as &#8220;standing objectives of the 
education system&#8221; and commits the State to the organization of the school system, with the 
participation of the various educational communities.3 In addition, with regard to mother-
tongue teaching, the Constitution establishes that &#8220;instruction in the early stages of 
schooling shall be in the pupil&#8217;s official mother tongue. The pupil shall also be taught and 
learn to use both of the official languages of the Republic. Ethnic minorities whose mother 
tongue is not Guaran&#237; can opt for either of the two official languages&#8221;.4 
</p>
<p>9. On 5 December 2002 the Children and Adolescents Code was adopted, recognizing 
children&#8217;s and adolescents&#8217; right to an education that will guarantee them full and 
harmonious development and prepare them for citizenship.5 The Code guarantees children 
and adolescents: (a) the right to be respected by their educators; (b) the right to organize 
and join student bodies; (c) the promotion and dissemination of their rights; (d) access to 
free State schools near their homes; and (e) respect for their dignity.6 It also recognizes the 
right of children and adolescents with physical, sensory, intellectual or emotional 
disabilities to receive prompt, adequate and ongoing care and attention that will nurture 
their self-respect and enable them to take part in the life of their community on the basis of 
equality and dignity. Lastly, the Code bans all discrimination or ostracism of persons with 
such disabilities.7

<p>10. On 26 May 1998, Congress passed the Education Act, which regulates public and 
private education and establishes &#8220;the general principles and aims whereby it should be 
guided and inspired. The Act regulates the administration, organization and structure of the 
national education system, general and special education, and the school system and its 
modalities. It establishes basic criteria for participation and the responsibilities of the 
members of educational communities and establishments, and the modalities for funding 
the State education sector and other components of the system&#8221;.8 The Act recognizes the 
fundamental principles that every inhabitant of Paraguay has the right to &#8220;comprehensive, 
lifelong education&#8221;,9 and that the national education system &#8220;is designed to benefit all 
inhabitants of Paraguay&#8221;. It also states that the indigenous peoples &#8220;shall enjoy the rights 
recognized to them under the Constitution and this Act&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p>11. The Education Act sets forth the State&#8217;s obligations in respect of education, which 
include: (a) to guarantee the right to learn and equality of opportunities in access to 
knowledge and the benefits of humanist culture, science and technology; (b) to promote and 
facilitate education without discrimination; (c) to guarantee the freedom to teach, with no 
more requirements than those of suitability and ethical integrity, and the rights to religious 
education and ideological pluralism; (d) to ensure access to education for the entire 
population of the country and create the conditions for genuine equality of opportunities; 
(e) to finance the national education system basically from State resources; (f) to design a 
basic curriculum that will permit the development of curriculum projects adapted to the 
characteristics and needs of specific cases; and (g) to promote decentralization of State-run 
public education services.11 It places an obligation on the State to devise and set education 
policy through ongoing consultations with the agencies and organizations involved in 
education, with due regard for the rights, obligations, objectives and principles established 
in the Act.12 It also guarantees the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs and 
commits the State to facilitating access by persons of limited means to free State education 
institutions and, where such institutions are lacking or insufficient for the demand for 
places, to fund places in private institutions by means of full or partial scholarships.13 
</p>
<p>12. The Education Act allocates at least 20 per cent of the national budget to education. 
Based on this allocation, the State commits itself to providing the material and other 
resources needed for: (a) the operation of the Ministry of Education and Culture and the 
National Council on Education and Culture, educational research, and other services 
provided by the Ministry; (b) the operation, fitting, maintenance and development of State 
educational institutions; (c) the opening of new State educational institutions; (d) support 
for private institutes; and (e) initial and in-service teacher training and development of the 
national education system in general.14 
</p>
<p>13. The Education Act defines education as &#8220;the ongoing process of creative 
transmission of the culture of a community, in the context of the national and global 
culture, for the purpose of developing the individual in every dimension&#8221;, while the 
national education system is defined as &#8220;a range of interrelated levels and modalities of 
education, developed by the educational community and regulated by the State&#8221;,15 and 
comprising a general education system &#8212; formal and non-formal &#8212; a special education

<p>system and other modalities of educational provision.16 The functions of the State in respect 
of education in Paraguay are exercised by the Ministry of Education and Culture.17 
</p>
<p><b> III. Main features of the Paraguayan education system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Structure and organization 
</b></p>
<p>14. Paraguay&#8217;s present national education system is the product of the education reform 
launched in 1994 and comprises a general education system (formal and non-formal), a 
special education system and other forms of educational provision. The education system 
has the following levels: preschool education, basic education, secondary education and 
higher education; a proposed new modality is lifelong education. The Ministry of Education 
and Culture regulates, organizes and administers the education system, through the Vice-
Ministry of Education and its various departments, and in coordination with departmental 
and municipal governments. As a support body to the Ministry, the National Council on 
Education and Culture (CONEC) is responsible for the formulation of proposals for 
educational and cultural policies, the reform of the education system and monitoring of 
implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Preschool and basic education 
</b></p>
<p>15. Preschool education comprises two cycles, the first for children aged up to 3 and the 
second for 3- to 4-year-olds. At the age of 5, &#8220;preschoolers&#8221; move into basic education. 
Basic education is compulsory and free of charge in State-run public schools. For peoples 
of limited means school meals and materials are also free of charge, on a progressive scale. 
Basic education comprises nine years of schooling, divided into three cycles, and is 
available to children aged 6 to 14.18 
</p>
<p>16. Preschool and basic education are structured by compulsory subject areas, the 
definition and content of which are decided and regularly reviewed by the Ministry of 
Education and Culture. Under the Education Act, education shall be conducted in the 
pupil&#8217;s official mother tongue when they start school or from first grade onwards. The other 
official language shall also be taught from the time they start school, using a method 
appropriate to the teaching of a second language. Programmes to prevent learning 
difficulties will be applied in preschool education, along with assessment systems for the 
early detection of advanced and below average intellectual capacity, and sensory 
deficiencies, in order to take appropriate steps in good time in each case.19 In practice, both 
Guaran&#237; and Spanish are generally taught in basic education, an approach that gives 
Spanish a head start as the principal teaching language in secondary education and later on. 
In preschool education, programmes to prevent learning difficulties are applied, along with 
assessment systems for the early detection of advanced and below average intellectual 
capacity, and sensory deficiencies. 
</p>
<p>17. On completion of the third cycle of basic education, at the end of ninth grade, pupils 
receive a certificate of basic education, which gives them access to secondary education. 
The school day is five hours.

<p><b> 2. Secondary education and secondary vocational training 
</b></p>
<p>18. Secondary education comprises either the <i>bachillerato</i> (baccalaureate) or vocational 
training. It lasts three years and is for students aged 15 to 17, who can take general subjects, 
subjects specific to a given vocational or baccalaureate course, and optional subjects. There 
are two main options, the science baccalaureate and the technical baccalaureate.20 A student 
who successfully completes three years of secondary education in either baccalaureate and 
obtains a pass in all subjects prescribed in the curriculum receives the title of <i>bachiller</i>. The 
school day in secondary education is between five and six hours. 
</p>
<p>19. Secondary vocational training offers an education in areas related to the production 
of goods and services. To qualify for secondary vocational training, students must have 
completed nine years of basic education or, if they have not, may qualify by passing a test 
set by the Ministry of Education and Culture. Students must also be 17 years of age or over. 
On completion of vocational training, students receive a certificate in their specialism. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Higher and postgraduate education 
</b></p>
<p>20.  Higher education is offered in universities and higher education institutes, and in 
other tertiary-level professional training institutes. Universities offer a wide range of high-
level specialisms, whereas higher education institutes work in one particular academic field. 
Tertiary-level professional training institutes offer technical and practical training leading 
to the practice of a profession. 
</p>
<p>21. Postgraduate education is offered by universities and higher education institutes. 
Students wishing to enter postgraduate education must have a first degree or be able to 
demonstrate the level of knowledge and experience required to follow the course. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Coverage 
</b></p>
<p>22. In terms of coverage, Paraguay has an enrolment rate of around 90 per cent in 
primary education, which means that virtually everyone aged 6 to 11 attends school. 
</p>
<p>23. Of Paraguay&#8217;s total population, 57.4 per cent are urban dwellers and 42.6 per cent 
rural dwellers. Preschool enrolment is higher in urban areas (63 per cent) than in rural areas 
(33 per cent). There is wide coverage in basic education, particularly in the first two cycles, 
with 46.5 per cent of enrolled students from rural areas and 53.5 per cent from urban areas. 
The gap between rural and urban rates widens in the third cycle of basic education, with 
urban areas accounting for 66.5 per cent of enrolments. As to secondary education, there is 
a considerable difference between enrolment in urban areas (75.6 per cent) and rural areas 
(24.4 per cent).21 
</p><p>24. As to the male-female shares of educational coverage, there is little difference in 
enrolment rates in preschool, where net enrolment is 66.9 per cent for boys and 67.5 per 
cent for girls. In the first two cycles of basic education, net rates for boys and girls are the 
same, 89.9 per cent. Rates for girls in the third cycle of basic education are slightly higher, 
with a net rate of 58.5 per cent as against 53.6 per cent for boys. This gap persists into 
secondary education, where the net enrolment rate for boys is 38.1 per cent and for girls 
43.3 per cent.22

<p>25. Repetition rates are highest in the first and second cycles of basic education (4.1 per 
cent), chiefly in rural areas and State schools. Repetition as a consequence of dropping out 
of school is more common in the third cycle of basic education, particularly in rural areas.23 
</p>
<p><b> C. State expenditure on education 
</b></p>
<p>26. The budget allocation to the Ministry of Education and Culture as a percentage of 
Paraguay&#8217;s GDP has fallen in the last 10 years, from 4.4 per cent in 1997 to 3.5 per cent in 
</p><p>2007. The budget allocation to the Ministry was highest in 2000, when it stood at 5.3 per 
cent of GDP.24 
</p>
<p>27. In 2007 Paraguay invested 20 per cent of its national budget in education and 
culture. Allocations under this heading as a percentage of the national budget have varied in 
the last 10 years, the lowest being 16.4 per cent (1999) and the highest 20.1 per cent 
(2006).25 In the last five years investment in education and culture has risen to an average of 
18.5 per cent per year.26 Around 80 per cent of the funds allocated for use by the Ministry 
of Education and Culture is spent on teachers&#8217; pay. In 2007 the Ministry&#8217;s budget was 
2,004,691,000,000 guaran&#237;es (approx. $398 million). 
</p><p>28. Total expenditure on education by the Ministry covers, in addition to teachers&#8217; pay, 
school construction and the provision of basic equipment, mainly in urban areas. Yet in 
many State schools it is the parents who have to pay for materials (books, textbooks and 
other school equipment), uniforms, enrolment fees and other expenses, including ongoing 
maintenance of schools. In 2005 families spent an average of 1,103,080 guaran&#237;es per child 
on education in urban areas and 114,895 guaran&#237;es in rural areas. The Special Rapporteur 
was told that, in remote villages, parents had to build the school with their own hands, as a 
requirement for getting a teacher. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Living School programme 
</b></p>
<p>29. Escuela Viva Hekokat&#250;va (Living School) is a programme aimed at strengthening 
the reform of basic education. It works on an individual basis with schools that cater for the 
neediest population groups to provide experiences that will instil a culture of cooperation in 
which every child, teacher, head teacher and parent will be aware of their role and able to 
give of their best in pursuit of a shared goal. 
</p>
<p>30. The aim of the programme is to improve both teaching and administration in the 
schools, help children to benefit more from their learning, open schools up to families and 
the community, reduce inequities in the education system and improve teacher training. 
</p>
<p>31. The Living School programme operates along various lines of action. It works with 
basic schools, funding specific initiatives in 150 urban schools, 1,000 rural schools and 27 
indigenous schools and providing comprehensive teaching support; it is carrying out

<p>educational improvement projects in 600 schools across the country; it focuses on 
improving initial teacher training, strengthening the system by providing teacher training 
institutes with resources and creating conditions that will enable them to improve 
performance; and it addresses questions of infrastructure and equipment in the expansion of 
the third cycle of basic education (seventh to ninth grades) by investing in the construction 
of classrooms in 280 central schools and in educational areas and associated schools in 
eight of Paraguay&#8217;s departments. 
</p>
<p><b> B. PRIOME Programme 
</b></p>
<p>32. During his visit the Special Rapporteur learnt about the National Programme on 
Equal Opportunities for Women in Education (PRIOME), which was launched in 1995 by 
the Secretariat for Women. The programme comes under the Directorate-General for the 
Development of Education (Ministry of Education and Culture). Its aims are to establish 
national coordination and advice on gender for the Ministry of Education and Culture, with 
NGO help, to incorporate the gender perspective in teacher training, to assist in the analysis 
and reform of the curriculum and the production of textbooks and teaching materials that 
incorporate the gender perspective, and to raise public awareness of the need to eliminate 
discrimination in education. 
</p>
<p>33. PRIOME has been instrumental in the great strides made in gender issues in the 
design of the new curriculum, textbooks and teaching materials, and also in teacher training 
curricula, thanks to its treatment of areas such as gender roles and equal treatment in family 
structures and tasks, sex education, promotion of health and rights, including sexual and 
reproductive health, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, violence and 
respect for cultural and religious diversity. 
</p>
<p>34. Despite these efforts, sexism has not disappeared from the hidden curriculum, which 
shows that girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s rights have still not found a place in teachers&#8217; thinking or 
behaviour. With women firmly established in the labour market, and migrating abroad in 
search of better earnings, it has become necessary to place greater emphasis on the gender 
perspective in technical and professional training. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Secretariat for Women of the Office 
of the President also awarded scholarships to secondary school and university students to 
enable them to attend seminars at the Women&#8217;s Leadership Centre. Under the Technical 
and Financial Support Programme for Young Women of Limited Means, agreed by the 
Peace Corps, the Uni&#243;n de Profesionales y Empresarios J&#243;venes (Union of Young 
Professionals and Entrepreneurs, UPEJ) and the Secretariat for Women, a group of women 
was provided with technical and financial support in the amounts of $500 for university 
education, $250 for tertiary education and $100 for vocational/secondary education. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Abrazo Programme 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Abrazo Programme was set up in 2005 by the Secretariat for Children and 
Adolescents, with support from the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), to provide 
a comprehensive service for children working in the street and their families, in order to 
help the children gradually stop working. The Abrazo Programme reaches some 1,200 
children, who attend the 15 open centres to be found in Asunci&#243;n, Ciudad del Este and 
other major cities, as well as in 10 municipalities of Central department. They are given 
help with school work, school attendance is monitored, and they are fed and given 
paediatric and dental care and opportunities for sport and recreation. In parallel, their 
families are given training and support in income-generating activities to make up for the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12088 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>money the child was bringing in. Some families, those living in extreme poverty, also 
receive &#8220;solidarity vouchers&#8221; on condition that the children attend the open centres and 
schools. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in 2008, 1,150 children alternated 
between an open centre and school, and 795 families received family support. He was also 
told that 75 per cent of the children taken into the programme stopped working in the 
streets, 25 per cent cut down the time they spent on the streets and more than 500 families 
were given help with income-generating alternatives or microcredit. The Special 
Rapporteur visited the Abrazo Centre in the Chaquarita district of Asunci&#243;n and talked to 
youngsters who were using the programme&#8217;s services, including recreational and academic 
activities and meals such as lunch and snacks. 
</p>
<p>38. In the course of his conversation with the Minister responsible for the Secretariat for 
Children and Adolescents, the Special Rapporteur was also told of other programmes run 
by the Secretariat, including the Child Rights Counselling Service (CODENI), which has an 
officer in every municipality, and the Learn without Fear campaign launched in April 2009 
jointly with the Ministry of Education and Culture. The aim of this campaign is to eradicate 
all forms of violence from schools and create a positive learning environment that will 
make it possible to learn without fear. 
</p>
<p>39. There are nearly 300,000 working children in Paraguay, including babies who spend 
their days on the street, and thousands of girls who cannot study because they have to do 
domestic chores at home, in some cases for up to seven hours a day. The Special 
Rapporteur visited several schools where every single child worked before or after school. 
Efforts to combat poverty and promote education must therefore include coherent, 
persistent and tough policies and initiatives to root out child labour. 
</p>
<p><b> D. National literacy campaign 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur was told that the national literacy campaign organized by 
the Directorate-General of Lifelong Education in the Ministry of Education and Culture 
was about to be launched. 
</p>
<p>41. This campaign is a short-term, intensive pilot programme run by the Social and Civil 
Cabinet of the Office of the President, and in the longer term will be underpinned by a 
model of lifelong literacy education developed by the Ministry of Education and Culture, 
which aims to consolidate the achievements made in the initial pilot programme. A cohort 
study on literacy for development showed that Paraguay&#8217;s rate of absolute illiteracy is 5.1 
per cent. The absolute illiterate population numbers 191,683, so the goal is to teach literacy 
to 179,900 persons during 2005&#8211;2008. 
</p>
<p>42. The national literacy campaign is conceived as an educational initiative designed in 
Paraguay by Paraguayan experts, to meet the real needs of society. It will focus not only on 
reading and writing and basic numeracy, but also on other key content such as human 
rights, the environment, health and gender equality. The reading and writing and basic 
numeracy component is modelled on the &#8220;Yo s&#237; puedo&#8221; (Yes I can) method of audiovisual 
resources and workbooks, albeit adapted and adjusted to the situation in Paraguay, where, 
for example, Guaran&#237; is spoken. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur was told that this method makes it possible to reach large 
numbers of people in a relatively short time, yet there is already a trial under way that 
allows for Paraguay&#8217;s bilingual culture: the non-formal &#8220;Yo s&#237; puedo&#8221; video learning 
project launched in 2004, had reached nearly 17,000 people by 2007. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-12088 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur applauds the decision to launch the national literacy 
campaign as a government project for an entire sector of society. The main focus of the 
campaign should be the indigenous peoples, however. To ensure lasting results, the 
campaign should link in to the notion of lifelong learning and to the work of the schools, 
and should mainstream the gender perspective. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Pa&#8217;i Puku 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur visited the Pa&#8217;i Puku centre and school. Pa&#8217;i Puku is in the 
Paraguayan Chaco, a sparsely populated region inhabited mainly by ranchers, far from 
urban centres. Pa&#8217;i Puku School provides preschool, basic, secondary and technical 
education, and vocational training. The school&#8217;s philosophy builds on the principles of 
&#8220;learning to learn&#8221; and &#8220;learning by doing&#8221;, and extra support is provided as a strategy to 
help children with special learning needs. 
</p>
<p>46. The school currently caters for a population of 15,000, scattered over an area of 30 
km2. It has 600 youngsters aged 5 to 18, children of ranch hands, labourers and timber 
workers, most of them of limited means, who cannot pay much for each child they have at 
school during the nine months of classes, and who always have to travel long distances, 
some as much as 400 km. 
</p>
<p>47. The Pa&#8217;i Puku centre houses a small population of around 700 and its geographical 
location means it has to aim for self-sufficiency. This is one of the reasons why students are 
taught a sense of responsibility and self-management. Everyone has to carry out their task 
responsibly and efficiently, applying the values and principles of equity and solidarity. 
Funds are allocated according to a strict work plan, for the needs of Pa&#8217;i Puku are many and 
varied. However, parents must pay a small monthly fee for each child, although this can be 
a payment in kind. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Challenges to the education system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Rural dwellers 
</b></p>
<p>48. With 42.6 per cent of Paraguay&#8217;s population living in rural areas, a significant 
proportion of Paraguayan students live in the country and attend rural schools. There is a 
high level of poverty in country areas and access to basic health and transport services is 
extremely limited. There are numerous deficiencies in the rural education infrastructure, 
including a lack of water and electricity. In many cases, it is up to students&#8217; families to 
build and maintain the schools, and they also have to pay for materials, food and uniforms. 
As so much of the responsibility for education rests with parents&#8217; associations and teachers 
and head teachers themselves, the families have to make near-heroic efforts to meet many 
of these needs &#8211; needs that should be met by the State of Paraguay but are not. What is 
more, the teachers assigned to rural schools have no support from the central Government: 
many of them are isolated in the village where they have come to live and teach and never 
see Ministry supervisors or advisers. Access to higher education is virtually non-existent in 
country areas, so students are forced to move to towns to pursue further training, with all 
that that entails in terms of board, lodging and transport costs, among other things. 
</p>
<p>49. Many of the families who live in rural areas have no land of their own, which 
exacerbates their social vulnerability. The situation has deteriorated as land ownership has 
become concentrated in the hands of foreign companies that accumulate holdings (often 
through coercion or forced eviction of peasant families) for growing soya. Soya farming 
has expanded rapidly in recent years, taking over arable land and concentrating production </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12088 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>in large plantations measuring more than 100 hectares. Most soya farming is carried out in 
industrialized monocultures for export. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was told that toxic agricultural chemicals used in soya 
cultivation are applied indiscriminately and unchecked in rural communities where schools 
are located. He was concerned to note that soya farming makes intensive use of herbicides 
and that this has provoked numerous cases of acute and chronic poisoning in communities 
adjoining soya plantations. As yet it seems that poisoning cases are not recorded 
systematically, even though they have a serious effect on victims&#8217; health. Spraying of these 
monocultures, many of which are sited close to villages and schools, disrupts the school 
day and further exposes the communities to agricultural chemicals. This is particularly 
important for children, and it also affects their access to education. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Migration 
</b></p>
<p>51. The factors described above put enormous pressure on peasant families, forcing 
them to move to urban areas. Many of them settle in the two major cities of Asunci&#243;n and 
Ciudad del Este. Rural-urban migrants are a growing sector of the population living on the 
periphery of these cities, in poor living conditions and with a lack of basic services. Like 
rural schools, the schools located on the outskirts of these cities are seriously disadvantaged 
compared to urban schools, and their maintenance depends largely on the goodwill and 
efforts of the parents&#8217; associations. 
</p>
<p>52. In addition to internal (rural-urban) migration, the Special Rapporteur was informed 
of an increasing influx of Brazilian labourers, who come to Paraguay for the soya harvest. 
Many of them come with their families; few of them speak Spanish. Their children lack 
adequate access to education, partly because they live in remote areas, partly because they 
do not understand or speak Spanish. The Special Rapporteur also learned that, in the border 
areas with Argentina, many Paraguayan children go to Argentine schools, which are nearer 
to where they live and do not limit admission on grounds of their migrant status.  
</p>
<p>53. Lastly, crop spraying also affects the schools in these communities, seriously 
jeopardizing pupils&#8217; health and children&#8217;s access to education in those areas. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Education of the indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>54. Paraguay&#8217;s indigenous population is around 2 per cent of the total population, 
numbering around 108,300. Paraguay&#8217;s indigenous people belong to 20 nations and five 
language groups. They live in 414 communities, 92 per cent of them rural; 45 per cent of 
the indigenous population do not own land; 77 per cent live in poverty and 63 per cent in 
extreme poverty. Children and adolescents account for 54 per cent of the indigenous 
population: 45 per cent of them live in poverty and 26 per cent in extreme poverty.27 
</p>
<p>55. Some progress has been made in realizing the right to education of Paraguay&#8217;s 
indigenous peoples. There is now a Directorate-General of Indigenous Education in the 
Ministry of Education and Culture and the Indigenous Education Act was passed in 2007. It 
remains to be seen whether the Act will have any impact on indigenous students&#8217; limited 
access to vocational training and higher education (only 14 per cent of the population aged 
18&#8211;24 who are eligible to study are enrolled at university).

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-12088 
</p>
<p>56. There is evidence of serious, persistent inequalities with regard to the realization of 
the right to education of indigenous children in Paraguay. Whereas, on average, the non-
indigenous population aged 15 or over has eight years of schooling, the indigenous 
population in the same age group has only three. Regrettably, 40 per cent of Paraguay&#8217;s 
indigenous population remains illiterate, a rate nearly eight times as high as the overall 
illiteracy rate, which is 5.4 per cent. In addition, school attendance by indigenous children 
is far lower than that of their non-indigenous peers: whereas between 85 per cent and 94 per 
cent of children in the population as a whole go to school, only 79.5 per cent of indigenous 
children do. These disparities are more pronounced at the secondary level, where only 2 per 
cent of indigenous adolescents are enrolled.28 
</p>
<p>57. There are indications that the teachers of indigenous children have limited 
qualifications: only 30 per cent of the approximately 900 teachers working in indigenous 
schools have completed basic education. There are also significant inequalities in the 
provision of school materials: 9 per cent of indigenous students have no materials in the 
official language and 70 per cent find the provision inadequate; 91 per cent of indigenous 
people have no materials in other languages and 9 per cent find access to such materials 
inadequate.29 
</p>
<p>58. The infrastructure of indigenous schools is also seriously deficient. Only 25 per cent 
have electricity and only 5 per cent have mains water supplied from a public or private grid: 
most of these schools obtain water from village wells (36 per cent) or cisterns (23 per cent). 
Only 7 per cent have toilets with septic tanks, while 49 per cent have latrines; only 23 per 
cent have separate toilets for boys and girls. 
</p>
<p>59. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Government support to the indigenous 
peoples focused on the provision of specific services for specific purposes. There are no 
plans to strengthen indigenous associations or to build up their own conceptions of 
development and of indigenous education as such. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Bilingualism and education in Guaran&#237; 
</b></p>
<p>60. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view urgent action is essential to save and develop the 
Guaran&#237; language, which is one of the official languages and is spoken by more than 80 per 
cent of the population. Paraguay is the only truly bilingual country in Latin America and, 
more than that, Guaran&#237; is one of the cultural treasures of the Paraguayan nation. Yet much 
of the time this beautiful and deeply-rooted language is shunned by teachers, and younger 
people are shy about speaking it in public, even though it is protected under the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur was told that, while there are plans for Guaran&#237; to be taught 
in formal education, in practice this is viewed as a subsidiary issue. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view any improvements in educational processes and teaching methods in 
Guaran&#237; will have a positive impact on the development of students&#8217; cognitive processes. 
The enactment of the Languages Bill submitted to Congress in 2007 will pave the way for 
effective mother-tongue teaching to numerous children in preschool and for the teaching of 
both languages in basic and secondary school. 
</p>
<p>62. The promotion of Guaran&#237; should be a matter for the State, for a public policy on 
Guaran&#237; and the other languages spoken in Paraguay is urgently needed. Such public policy, 
and the establishment of a language academy, should flow from the early enactment of the

<p>Languages Bill, along with urgent measures to train teachers in the teaching of Guaran&#237; and 
the other indigenous languages. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Privatization of higher education 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur noted that most higher education (university and technical 
education) is provided by the private sector; many private universities were set up in the 
1990s and there are apparently more than 40 private universities and higher education 
institutes. These institutions are run with no quality control of the services they provide. 
The Special Rapporteur finds this commercialization of higher education regrettable; 
moreover, the decoupling of these universities from the education system means the courses 
they offer bear no relation to young Paraguayans&#8217; reality or aspirations. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur has no complaints about the accreditation systems for 
education providers, but they should be linked to improvements in in-service training. The 
Special Rapporteur does not consider it acceptable for private universities to operate with 
no control of the quality of the service they provide, the fees they charge their students or 
the qualifications of their teaching staff. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur also emphasizes the need to guarantee public university-
level education, for that is where the scientific, technological and cultural skills the country 
needs for high-quality development can be fostered. For that reason, as well as in the 
interests of progress in the enjoyment of the right to education, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the plans for expanding and reinforcing high-quality State university 
education that is accessible to all should be supported. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Inclusive education 
</b></p>
<p>66. More than 10,000 students aged between 6 and 18 in Paraguay&#8217;s education system 
have some form of diagnosed disability or impairment.30 The illiteracy rate among the 
population with disabilities is 43 per cent as compared with 7 per cent for the general 
population aged 10 or over with no disabilities. Many disabilities are the result of accident 
or illness or of malnutrition in early childhood. Many of the children who live with 
disabilities do not go to school, in some cases because schools are not equipped to cater for 
them, in others because their parents prefer to keep them at home. 
</p>
<p>67. It is estimated that only 36 per cent of persons aged 6&#8211;18 with a disability attend 
some kind of educational establishment, as compared with 82 per cent of persons without a 
disability. Disablement is an important factor in exclusion from education: 83 per cent of 
the population with disabilities have no more than six years of basic education and only 8 
per cent have some years of secondary education, while a tiny minority (2 per cent) have 
completed higher education.31 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur notes that there is a need to set up special programmes for 
students with disabilities, run by specialist teachers and with materials adapted to their 
special needs. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need to formulate and apply a new approach 
to education based on knowledge and experience of human rights. In that context, the

<p>Special Rapporteur notes that it is necessary to include the gender perspective in 
educational policies so that sex education programmes can be provided as part of the 
curriculum. This is important because of the high maternal mortality rates and the incidence 
of sexual and gender-based violence against women, younger girls and teenage girls in 
order to build human relations based on respect for all. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>70.<b> The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Paraguayan Government and civil 
society, and United Nations bodies, for their cooperation in what was a successful visit. 
The Special Rapporteur applauds the Government&#8217;s determination to try to improve 
the resources available for education and the self-criticism it has shown in 
acknowledging the great challenges it still faces. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the progress made in school 
enrolment rates (68 per cent net enrolment in preschool and 92 per cent in the first 
and second cycles), and in budget allocations, which in the early 1990s were barely 1.9 
per cent of GDP but in recent years have exceeded 4 per cent, despite demographic 
growth. He also notes the progress made in eliminating stereotyping in textbooks, and 
in the dynamism of civil society organizations, which have taken over many of the 
State&#8217;s responsibilities. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Special Rapporteur thanks the authorities for their frank 
acknowledgement of the challenges and problems, such as the high repetition rate in 
basic education (30 per cent), the grave problems regarding the quality of education 
(reading comprehension and reading and writing skills in general), the low completion 
rate in secondary education (27 per cent), and the neglect into which rural dwellers 
and the indigenous communities have fallen in nearly all aspects of development, 
including education (40 per cent illiteracy among persons aged over 15). 
</b>73.<b> Such frankness on the Government&#8217;s part should be seen, not as an expression 
of contrition, but as a statement of principle, which should now be matched by 
concrete action in many areas of education, such as the literacy campaign; the 
establishment of departments of inclusive education and indigenous education; the 
reinforcing of bodies to promote equality of educational opportunity for women and 
the improvement of resources for very young children and adolescents; the creation of 
a unit for social monitoring and social policy; and above all the revival of the Social 
Cabinet, which is vital for the coordination of education policy with other sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The Special Rapporteur is nevertheless concerned at problems relating to the 
poor quality of education; the lack of resources to underpin compulsory enrolment in 
school; the high repetition and dropout rates and the poor condition of the 
infrastructure. The rural populations still have no viable options in terms of higher 
education. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> Paraguay urgently needs resources to solve infrastructure problems and for 
drinking water, school meals, culturally diverse teaching materials, teacher training 
and affirmative measures of all kinds to ensure that the poorest members of the 
community can get into educational establishments and stay there (the university 
gives certain indigenous people immediate access but does not meet their needs). It is 
necessary to step up efforts to build a national consensus on education, one that will 
transcend changes of government. Debate should be encouraged, so that the problems 
of education are no longer seen as &#8220;political footballs&#8221;. </b></p>

Thus rural education cannot improve if the indiscriminate, unchecked application of 
toxic agricultural chemicals in the communities where rural schools are located is not 
stopped. The migration of peasant families is causing schools and indeed whole 
communities to disappear, so the lack of support for indigenous and rural 
communities threatens the very existence of many cultures.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> It is not possible to solve the problems of security and of exclusion from school 
without school meal, health and community development programmes. The school is 
not separate from the social and cultural context in which it exists, and central and 
local governments&#8217; social policies must therefore link in with educational needs. 
Education is what truly drives development, and to privatize education is to condemn 
people to poverty. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view it is important to consolidate conditional 
transfer programmes for the poorest families &#8212; they should target indigenous women 
and women in rural and marginal urban areas in particular &#8212; and to include the 
indigenous communities in all priority initiatives on lifelong education, given that 48 
per cent of the indigenous communities have no land of their own and these 
communities are the primary conservers of the forests. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The Special Rapporteur noted that free education is not yet a given in 
Paraguay and that a sizeable share of the State&#8217;s obligations has shifted to families, 
who in many cases have to bear the cost of building the school, as well as paying for 
examination fees, teaching materials, transport, uniforms and related costs. The 
school at San Isidro de Cedrales, for example, was built by the peasants. It took them 
10 years and now it stands as a living testimony to their solitary struggle.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> In terms of teacher training, the Special Rapporteur believes that the recent 
revelations regarding teachers&#8217; qualifications show that there is an urgent need to 
strengthen teacher training institutions and universities, starting with the formulation 
and implementation of a State policy on research, which will make it possible to bring 
educational theory up to date. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to appoint a resident 
adviser in Paraguay in the coming months and to consider opening an office in 
Asunci&#243;n alongside the other United Nations agencies with offices in Paraguay. Given 
the Government&#8217;s willingness to meet its obligation to bring domestic law into line 
with international human rights standards, this decision provides a unique 
opportunity to develop a national human rights plan and, in that framework, to make 
education a national priority and assign it the budget it needs to solve the problems 
mentioned. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> In light of these conclusions, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government of Paraguay should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Give education a leading role in the fight against poverty. That means, to 
begin with, giving it the budget it needs. Appropriate steps should be taken to increase 
the budget allocation to education, and notably to improve the infrastructure in 
schools by providing a budget that will make it possible to meet that obligation (giving 
priority to water and electricity supplies to schools). The education budget should 
grow by at least 0.5 per cent of GDP per year until it reaches at least the level of 6 per 
cent established by international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Consolidate conditional transfer programmes for the poorest families &#8212; 
they should target indigenous women and women in rural and marginal urban areas </b></p>

<p><b>in particular &#8212; and include the indigenous communities in all priority initiatives on 
lifelong education; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Enact as a matter of urgency the Languages Bill, which has been before 
Congress since 2007, and establish and implement modalities for the use of the official 
languages, i.e., Spanish and Guaran&#237;, in all State initiatives and policies, including 
education, as provided in the Constitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Promote the establishment of an academy of languages in the near 
future, following the early enactment of the Languages Bill; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Introduce in all government departments a requirement of bilingualism, 
with a view to designing and implementing projects and programmes in Guaran&#237;. 
These measures should go hand in hand with urgent measures to train teachers in the 
teaching of Guaran&#237; and the other indigenous languages; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Conduct research as a matter of urgency into the relationship between 
reading and writing difficulties and problems of educational quality, and the low 
status of Guaran&#237;. It is known that a lack of mother-tongue teaching may have 
undesirable cognitive effects throughout a person&#8217;s education. This requires urgent 
investigation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Include a cross-cutting gender plan in education policy in order to 
encourage the introduction of sex education into the curriculum; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Involve the Office of the Ombudsman more closely in mechanisms for 
the enforceability and justiciability of the human right to education; 
 (i) Improve the quality of education in order to meet the objectives 
contained in article 29, paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in 
accordance with general comment No. 1 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
on the aims of education, and the concluding observations of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the third periodic report of Paraguay;</b>32<b> 
request further technical cooperation from, among others, the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF); 
 (j) Mainstream the rights of the indigenous peoples across all ministerial 
initiatives so that education becomes a form of affirmative action for indigenous 
peoples and their cultures and world views are duly represented in the national 
curriculum; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Develop initiatives to promote and enhance the status of indigenous 
languages and cultures, so that all social groups, including non-indigenous groups, can 
see the benefits of intercultural education; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Promote the teaching of Guaran&#237; at all levels through the national 
literacy campaign. The Special Rapporteur also recommends establishing clear 
guidelines and ensuring the effective application of bilingual teaching methods in 
initial teacher training, particularly in the courses offered in bilingual teacher training 
colleges; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Establish a system for dealing properly with children who for some 
reason have moved to big cities, particularly the capital, so as to minimize exclusion, 
poverty and acculturation. To that end the Special Rapporteur recommends that such
