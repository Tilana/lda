<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Somalia in 2007 witnessed intense and repeated rounds of fighting between Ethiopia 
military/Somali forces and insurgent groups, particularly in the capital city of Mogadishu. It was 
also a year of political deadlocks and fragmentation for the Transitional Federal Institutions 
(TFI), some of which were finally based in Mogadishu. These military and political conflicts 
further weakened the fledgling TFIs and fostered an environment of impunity resulting in a 
marked deterioration in the already dire human rights situation in Somalia.   
</p>
<p>It must be noted that human rights in Somalia have for almost two decades been marked 
by widespread insecurity, extrajudicial killings and disappearances, arbitrary arrests and 
detentions, threats to freedom of opinion and expression, violations of the human rights of 
women, children and minorities, and infringements on economic, social and cultural rights.  To a 
large extent, the present report focuses on how the conflicts of the past year have in a great many 
cases made the human rights situation in Somalia worse.    
</p>
<p>In the several fierce battles which took place in Mogadishu commencing in December 
2006 and continuing throughout most of 2007, there were widespread reports of indiscriminate 
artillery fire, shelling and car bombs in civilian areas and that non-military targets, such as 
hospitals and schools were bombed in the fighting.  It was also reported that the wounded were 
prevented from fleeing or from receiving humanitarian assistance and protection and that urgent 
deliveries of food aid and other humanitarian assistance were hampered or blocked. Cycles of 
massive internal displacement took place. Many of the reports suggest violations in 
contravention of international humanitarian law and international human rights law.   
</p>
<p>However, independent and corroborated information about the battles continues to be 
difficult to obtain in south and central Somalia due to the security situation and the relative 
weaknesses in reporting on human rights issues. What can be identified is that virtually all 
parties to the conflict violated human rights, that the general human rights situation has further 
seriously deteriorated and that civilians have overwhelmingly paid the price.  The independent 
expert supports a thorough human rights investigation of the events of last year as well as other 
serious violations of Somalia&#8217;s past.   
</p>
<p>The independent expert, Ghanim Alnajjar, undertook his annual mission to Kenya and 
Somalia from 17 to 21 September 2007.  During this mission, he visited Mogadishu and Nairobi. 
Due to time constraints he was unable to undertake visits to &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and &#8220;Puntland&#8221;.  A 
planned and authorized visit to Baidoa was prematurely cancelled when he was prevented by 
authorities from disembarking from the plane at the airport.    
</p>
<p>The expert met with various staff of the United Nations, representatives of the 
international community, Somali civil society, clan and tribal leaders, as well as senior officials 
of the TFIs, including President Abdullahi Yusuf and (then) Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi. 
He was also able to hold productive meetings with the newly-appointed Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General for Somalia, Mr. Ahmedou Ould Abdallah. Despite the deterioration in 
Somalia in the past year, the independent expert noted optimism surrounding the appointment of 
the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the continued commitment among </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/26 
 Page 3 
 
the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Eric Laroche, and United Nations Country Team to 
continue working together on the difficult issues of Somalia.  
</p>
<p>The independent expert also noted that despite the overall worsened situation, very small, 
yet incremental changes in terms of human rights awareness and knowledge, if not human rights 
compliance, were taking place in pockets around Somalia.  
</p>
<p>He encourages the international community to continue to support the Transitional 
Federal Government (TFG) and Somali civil society in the critical human rights work that must 
occur if peace and security are to prevail in Somalia. He especially underlines technical and 
financial support in order to establish independent national institutions, protect internally 
displaced persons, establish and uphold the rule of law and protect economic, social and cultural 
rights. The expert also underscores the need for continuing dialogue and engagement between 
the TFIs and the international community on human rights and humanitarian issues and urges 
that a standing dialogue mechanism be established in this regard.   
</p>
<p>Finally, the independent expert continues to urge the TFG and TFIs to make decisions 
and take actions, with the meaningful inclusion of women, minorities and civil society that 
promote and protect human rights in Somalia. He underlines that it is the ultimate responsibility 
of the Somali authorities to provide protection for the Somali people and to effectively govern 
the country based on the rule of law and international human rights standards.

<b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with the mandate established by the Commission on Human Rights in its 
resolution 1993/86 and decision 5/1 of the Human Rights Council, the independent expert 
presents this report to the seventh session of the Human Rights Council.  It is to be recalled that 
due to extreme insecurity which forestalled his planned annual mission to Somalia in early 2007, 
the independent expert gave a mid-term oral presentation to the fifth session of the Human 
Rights Council in Geneva on 12 June 2007. The present report covers the period from January 
2007 to January 2008. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert wishes to express his gratitude to the Somali people whom he 
was able to meet in during this particular visit.  He is always particularly impressed by the 
openness, dedication and bravery of such Somalis living and working under extremely difficult 
conditions.  Despite some initial difficulties encountered with access to Baidoa, the independent 
expert expresses his appreciation to the Somali authorities for facilitating his visit to Mogadishu. 
He is grateful to President Abdullahi Yusuf, (then) Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi and other 
members of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) for taking the time to meet with him to 
discuss the human rights challenges facing Somalia and for considering ways to address them.   
</p>
<p>3. Once again, the independent expert wishes to express his particular gratitude to the 
professional, committed and courageous staff of the United Nations with whom he met and who 
shared their information and experience. Logistical, security and public relations support was 
ably provided by the staff of the United Nations Country Team and the Office of the Resident 
and Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia, Eric Laroche. The independent expert also met with 
colleagues of the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS) and the newly-appointed 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah. 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert also wishes to thank the representatives of the diplomatic 
community with whom he met in Nairobi. During various meetings, he was able to exchange 
views on the role and approaches of the international community with respect to Somalia. 
</p>
<p>5. Finally, the independent expert is also grateful to the representatives of the international 
institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Oxfam-NOVIB, who provided 
him with helpful briefings on the situation of human rights in Somalia. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
</b></p>
<p>6. By early January 2007, TFG forces backed by Ethiopian troops dislodged the Islamic 
Courts Union (ICU) from south and central Somalia and took control of the capital city of 
Mogadishu. While the two-week military campaign was very swift with reports of violations of 
human rights and international humanitarian law, ICU remnants and Somali clan militias 
continuously challenged the authority of the TFG to govern and the presence of Ethiopian troops 
in Somalia, and deadly clashes between them periodically took place. 
</p>
<p>7. In February 2007, in an attempt to assist in the stabilization in south and central Somalia 
and in support of the TFG, the United Nations Security Council in its resolution 1744 (2007) 
authorized the deployment of an African Union peacekeeping force (AMISOM) for a six-month 
operation leading to a possible United Nations peacekeeping operation. AMISOM includes a </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/26

<p>                                                
</p>
<p>mandate to protect the TFG and other transitional federal institutions, but it is not mandated to 
protect civilians. To date, approximately 1,<footnote name="7">2. The independent expert also met with 15 members of the Hawiye Elders Council while in 
Mogadishu. The Elders expressed dissatisfaction with the presence of Ethiopian military and 
argued that their withdrawal presented the starting point for securing stability in Somalia. They 
also strongly condemned the fighting and conflicts of the past year, comparing the situation to 
</footnote>00 Ugandan troops and 100 Burundian troops out of 
a planned multi-national force of 8,000 have been deployed to Mogadishu with the intention of 
eventually replacing the Ethiopian troops. On 18 July 2007, the Security Council approved the 
extension of the AMISOM mandate a further six months to January 2008.   
</p>
<p>8. Most of 2007 saw recurrent clashes between the TFG/Somali forces, Ethiopian troops 
and insurgents/clan militias. Various government buildings, military installations and public 
figures were targeted.  Two particularly heavy rounds of fierce fighting took place in Mogadishu 
between March and April 2007 causing high numbers of fatalities and casualties as well as 
massive internal displacement. Once again, there were reports of serious violations of human 
rights and international humanitarian law. In a statement issued on 1 May 2007, the independent 
expert and 12 other mandate-holders 1  expressed deep concern at the latest round of fierce 
fighting in Mogadishu, urging respect for international humanitarian law and calling for a 
cessation of hostilities. Throughout the year, intermittent but intense clashes, suicide car bombs, 
assassination attempts and targeted killings took place in Somalia, resulting in thousands of 
fatalities and casualties, destruction of property and massive internal displacement.  
</p>
<p>9.  A Technical Assessment Mission (TAM) to Somalia, sent pursuant to Security Council 
resolution 1744 (2007), took place from 15 to 26 March 2007 charged with providing 
recommendations about further United Nations engagement in support of peace and security in 
Somalia, as well as recommendations on stabilization and reconstruction. Further to the TAM, 
on 24 April, the Security Council authorized the beginning of contingency planning for a 
possible United Nations mission for Somalia.  
</p>
<p>10. In the context of the armed conflicts in south and central Somalia, a parallel political 
crisis was also taking place in Somalia. While 2006 seemed to hold some promise of political 
consolidation and progress for Somalia, 2007 was unfortunately a year of political wrangling, 
fragmentation and deadlock. Under pressure of the armed insurgency, a deep conflict arose 
between members of the Transitional Federal Parliament and the TFG, wherein the former 
accused the latter of a lack of governmental financial transparency and accountability. There 
were also political difficulties within the TFG itself, eventually leading to the conciliatory 
resignation of Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi in late October 2007.  President Abdullahi 
Yusuf appointed Nur Hassan Hussein as his successor on 22 November 2007.   
</p>
<p>11. Political opposition to the TFG also continued in the form of the so-called &#8220;Asmara 
Group&#8221; based in Eritrea. This group comprised of former ICU members, warlords, business

people and clerics, primarily contests the legitimacy of the TFG and the presence of Ethiopian 
troops in Somalia. In 2007, the Asmara Group held a Somali Congress for the Liberation and 
Reconstitution (SCLR) to devise a political formula for Somalia. 
</p>
<p>12. The TFG-sponsored Somali National Reconciliation Congress, which had been delayed 
on three occasions due to a number of security, planning and logistical reasons, took place from 
15 July to 30 August 2007 in Mogadishu. Some 1,<footnote name="3">See A/HRC/5/2, A/HRC/2/CRP.<footnote name="2">S/2007/259.  </footnote> and E/CN.<footnote name="4">A/HRC/2/CRP.<footnote name="2">1. It was also stated that people were allegedly being captured, tortured and held for ransom 
by both TFG and assorted militia.  There were also some reports that renditions were occurring 
and that detainees were being held incommunicado outside the country. It was alleged that 
authorities were using &#8220;security sector reform&#8221; or the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; as to conceal violations of 
human rights. During his mission, the expert also raised the issues of reports of persons detained 
in hidden prisons or alleged cases of &#8220;rendition&#8221; outside Somalia. He was told by authorities that 
they did not have any information about such allegations but was assured that these reports 
would be investigated.  </footnote>. 
 </footnote>/2005/117.  </footnote>25 delegates from within the country and the 
Somali diaspora attended on the basis of the &#8220;<footnote name="4">4. One positive child rights development was that the Child Justice Bill was making 
progress through the TFP and was expected to be passed in the coming months. During the 
independent expert&#8217;s meeting with (then) Prime Minister Gedi in Mogadishu, the latter agreed 
that Somalia must endeavour to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
that there should be monitoring and reporting instruments in place to support that ratification.  
</footnote>.<footnote name="5">6. It was also discussed that the large numbers of IDPs had resulted in several unofficial 
IDP settlements being established. For example, on the road between Afgooye and Marka, there 
was an IDP settlement every 100 metres.  These settlements were not acknowledged by the 
authorities and as a result displaced persons there received little or no humanitarian assistance. </footnote> clan power-sharing formula&#8221;. The international 
community provided technical advice through the International Advisory Committee; however, 
there were concerns about the inclusiveness, the representation of civil society and minority 
groups, and the agenda of the Congress.  
</p>
<p>13. The independent expert has stated on several occasions that sustainable peace in Somalia 
can only be attained through an inclusive dialogue leading to a political solution and national 
reconciliation. It must be underscored that the National Reconciliation Congress is a first step 
within the broader framework of a longer term reconciliation process for Somalia. Somalis must 
be urged and supported to continue to hold public and inclusive discussions about transitional 
justice, reconciliation and any future processes. The &#8220;right to the truth&#8221; must be upheld on behalf 
of all victims and Somalis must work to ensure that impunity will not undermine the future peace 
of Somalia.   
</p>
<p>14. The independent expert acknowledges the regional dimensions of the conflicts and 
developments of the past year in Somalia. The insecurity and instability in Somalia affects its 
neighbours and situations such as the border impasse between Eritrea and Ethiopia or the 
escalation of the crisis in the Ogaden region of Ethiopia affects Somalia.  Similarly, in the 
aftermath of the initial fighting in January 2007, ICU militia had been chased to the Kenyan 
border area in the south-western part of the country. Since then, the Kenyan border has been 
effectively &#8220;sealed&#8221; and asylum-seekers have been stranded in the border zone or have been 
turned back.  These regional conflicts and issues also affect Somalia&#8217;s ability to secure its peace 
and stability.   
</p>
<p>15. Finally, the independent expert has been following Security Council discussions to 
establish a United Nations peacekeeping operation for Somalia in an effort to further stabilize the 
country and allow for a phased withdrawal of Ethiopian forces. He is supportive of a 
peacekeeping operation, provided that it will have a mandate to assist in the protection of 
civilians and that it will feature a significant human rights component. As he has advocated for 
several years, a human rights presence for Somalia is necessary - either as part of a peacekeeping 
operation or more advisable, as a separate entity.  The human rights situation in Somalia is 
sufficiently grave that a focused human rights presence is required to monitor and report 
regularly on the situation and provide much-needed human rights expertise.  
</p>
<p><b>II. HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DURING THE PERIOD  
COVERED BY THE REPORT </b></p>
<p>16. The entire group of interdependent and universal human rights are at extreme risk in the 
current context of Somalia. The following summary does not intend to reflect all of the long-
standing and previously documented human rights issues and violations, but presents 
thematically key human rights issues and abuses brought to light during the period under </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/26 
Page 8 
</p>
<p>consideration.  The expert also notes that while the situation in Somalia has always been of 
serious concern, the repeated peaks of violence which occurred over the past year have 
reportedly led to graver and deeper violations taking place in an environment of impunity. 
</p>
<p>17. Allegations have been raised that serious violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law, perpetrated by all sides, including TFG/Somali forces, Ethiopian troops and 
insurgents/clan militias took place during the fighting. The possibility to verify and confirm 
reports on human rights violations is limited. There are also concerns that an independent 
account of fatalities and casualties as well as of the very serious events has not been undertaken.   
</p>
<p><b>A.  The right to life and safety and security of the person 
</b></p>
<p>18. As noted above, the recurrent and fierce cycles of violence in Somalia last year led to 
grave and widespread violations of the right to life. While there is no independent and official 
account, it is estimated that more than 3,<footnote name="50">. The independent expert was also briefed about the introduction of a civilian advisory 
committee or monitoring mechanism for policing in Mogadishu. It was stated that 8 of 16 police 
stations were currently being monitored in order to avoid the transfer of prisoners from 
monitored to unmonitored prisons. In addition, monitoring ensured that persons were not </footnote>0 people died and thousands were wounded as a result 
of the conflicts. It has also been estimated that about 60 per cent of the dead and wounded are the 
elderly, women and children. The situation in Mogadishu and other parts of south and central 
Somalia continues to be insecure and highly unstable as at the writing of this report.  
</p>
<p>19. In the several fierce battles which took place last year (particularly in Mogadishu), there 
were widespread reports of indiscriminate artillery fire, shelling and car bombs in civilian areas 
and that non-military targets, such as hospitals and schools were bombed in the fighting.  It was 
also reported that the wounded were prevented from fleeing or from receiving humanitarian 
assistance and protection and that urgent deliveries of food aid and other humanitarian assistance 
were hampered or blocked.  The fighting also resulted in massive internal displacement. The 
high displacement figures of 600,000 persons (in addition to the 400,000 internally displaced 
persons (IDP) previously displaced around Somalia) appeared to have decreased just marginally 
as some IDPs have reportedly returned to Mogadishu, often only to flee yet again.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Arbitrary arrest and detention, disappearances and summary executions   
</b></p>
<p>20. In early July 2007, a reported wave of arbitrary arrests and unlawful detentions took 
place following house-to-house searches by TFG forces/Ethiopian troops. At that time, it was 
reported that 1,<footnote name="5">5. Many of the people in IDP camps, when asked, stated that they would opt to return to 
their homes, if they were able to do so. However, difficulties associated with ancestral lands 
often prevented this. While many IDPs claimed to originate from a certain ancestral area, they 
had not in fact lived on that land for generations and often discovered that other people had been 
residing on these lands for a long period of time.  
</footnote>00 persons were unaccounted for. There are also reports of persons being 
summarily executed and a number of civil society, human rights defenders and political leaders 
have been assassinated. It was alleged during the independent expert&#8217;s mission that authorities 
had been unlawfully detaining people in hidden makeshift prisons, and well as notorious jails 
such as that reputed to lie underground near the State house, &#8220;Villa Somalia&#8221; in Mogadishu. 
There were also allegations that detainees were being held by Ethiopian forces in Somalia.  
</p>
<p> A/HRC/7/26 
 Page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Intentional attacks on personnel involved in humanitarian assistance  
</b></p>
<p>22. On 28 June 2007, Mohamed Muse Ali, Somali district programme manager of the NGO 
International Medical Corps (IMC) was killed by three gunmen in the town of El Berde, 250 
kilometres northwest of Mogadishu. On 28 January 2008, three staff members of M&#233;decins sans 
Fronti&#232;res (MSF) &#8211; Holland in Somalia were killed in a roadside explosion in the town of 
Kismayo. Victor Okunnu, a Kenyan doctor, Damien Lehalle, a French logistician and their 
Somali driver, Billan were killed when their car was hit by the blast and Somali journalist, 
Hassan Kafi Hared, as well as a Somali boy - both who were nearby were also reportedly killed.  
The independent expert issued a press statement on 29 January condemning the killings of the 
MSF staff and all attacks on aid workers, journalists and human rights defenders in Somalia. He 
strongly reiterated that the international aid community must be allowed to carry out their 
humanitarian and human rights work in safety and without fear of retaliation.  He appealed to all 
authorities and groups concerned to ensure safe and secure conditions for humanitarian and 
human rights activities and urged the Somali authorities to investigate this case and all cases in 
order to bring the perpetrators to justice.  
</p>
<p>23. These killings are only some examples of several direct and intentional threats to 
humanitarian personnel which took place in the past year.  In the period covered by this report, 
harassment and intentional attacks on international and national personnel involved in 
humanitarian assistance continued to occur.  Such actions threatened assistance to vulnerable 
persons and groups, especially the more than 1 million internally displaced persons dispersed 
across Somalia.   
</p>
<p><b>D.  The right to freedom of opinion and expression  
</b></p>
<p>24. A pervasive climate of fear and intimidation amongst journalists and media professionals 
has had a chilling effect on the right to freedom of opinion and expression particularly in 
Mogadishu, but throughout Somalia as well. Between January 2007 and January 2008, nine 
media professionals were killed and dozens more threatened into silence for their work, while 
several fled Mogadishu in fear.  
</p>
<p>25. Somali journalist Mahad Ahmed Elmi of Capital Voice radio was shot dead near his 
office on 11 August 2007. Hours later, as he returned from Mr Elmi&#8217;s funeral, Ali Sharmarke, 
founder and co-owner of HornAfrik Media, was killed when his car was reportedly hit by a 
remotely detonated landmine explosion.  In December 2007, a group of 24 journalists from 
Mogadishu who had sought safe haven in Hargeisa in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; were then expelled by 
authorities a few weeks later. These are only a few examples.  
</p>
<p>26. In the period covered by the report, there were several other attacks by clan militia as 
well as Government authorities on the media and threats to freedom of the press, including cases 
of censorship, banning of journalists, arbitrary detention and torture of media personnel.  It was 
also raised that journalists were at times labelled as terrorists as a means of silencing them and 
that authorities have repeatedly cracked down on various media for covering the plight of 
civilians. Such attacks and targeted killings made Somalia the second most dangerous place in 
the world for journalists (according to <i>Reporters Without Borders International</i>).  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/26 
Page 10 
</p>
<p>27. There was also constant intimidation which caused some media outlets to self &#8211;censor 
their reporting or there were outright attacks on media premises causing them to cease 
operations.  For example, from 19 to 20 September 2007, the premises of the Radio Shabelle 
network came under intense gunfire trapping a technician inside and forcing its closure and 
termination of media activities.  This attack was allegedly carried out by government forces. In 
addition, following months of intimidation and harassment, by November, three media 
organisations - Shabelle Media Network, Banadir Radio and Radio Simba, were effectively 
closed by the TFIs.   
</p>
<p>28. The independent expert has learned that in almost all cases, no investigations have been 
carried out and no perpetrators have been brought to justice.  Last year, he continually 
condemned all these acts in public statements and private discussions and has called for 
investigations into all these threats, attacks and killings against the media and the prompt re-
opening of the closed media organisations. He held meetings with officials in cities such as 
Geneva and London on this topic. He also raised this issue with authorities during his mission 
and was informed that some media organizations were legitimate security concerns as they were 
involved in terrorist activities. He was informed that the TFG condemns violence against the 
media and that investigations would be undertaken.      
</p>
<p><b>E.  Economic, social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>29. In the realms of economic, social and cultural rights, the situation is still gravely 
concerning. Somalia continues to be one of the poorest countries in the world and has amongst 
the lowest indicators for life expectancy, infant and under-five mortality, adult literacy and 
school enrolment. Diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera are widespread and chronic 
malnutrition, especially among children, is common.    </p>
<p>30. Due to the limited influence of the TFIs and weak local authorities, basic service 
provision is very poor, especially in the education and health sectors. Livelihoods and the 
economy as a whole are susceptible to drought, flooding, conflict and bans on livestock 
importation. These factors presented significant obstacles to the ability of Somalis to realize the 
right to food, to access education and to earn livelihoods and gain employment. In addition, 
Somalia&#8217;s pre-existing and unresolved land and property rights issues were in many ways 
exacerbated by the conflict, as there were further population movements of IDPs, land and 
property confiscation as well as evictions by authorities of people, including IDPs, from public 
buildings. 
</p>
<p>31. As the independent expert has stated on several previous occasions, the waters off the 
extensive unmonitored Somali coast are rife with human rights abuses. Unfettered fishing and 
environmental degradation by foreign vessels continues. Piracy &#8211; which often hampers much-
needed humanitarian assistance was increasing, and in 2007 and early 2008, humanitarian aid 
deliveries by ship were increasingly accompanied by French and Danish navy vessels for 
protection. The independent expert reiterates that efforts to control and protect the coastline 
should be intensified. In the long term, this should be achieved through the establishment of an 
effective coastguard and adequate monitoring structures. To ensure coastline protection in the 
medium term, the independent expert calls for the establishment of an organization (similar to 
Somalia&#8217;s current civil aviation model), mandated to safeguard the Somali coastline until such a 
time that the Somali authorities are able to do so.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>F. Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>32. Discrimination and abuse of marginalized groups and minorities also appeared to 
continue unabated. Predominantly landless, destitute and unarmed minority groups such as the 
&#8220;African&#8221; Bantu/Jarir, the Benadir/Rer Hamar and the Midgan (Gaboye), were at greater risk of 
international displacement, discrimination, exclusion and abuse in the period covered by the 
report. 
</p>
<p>33. The fighting taking place in south and central Somalia also adversely affected their 
ability to earn a livelihood as labourers, metal-workers, herbalists and hunter-gatherers. They 
also reportedly faced greater difficulties in accessing humanitarian assistance and were more at 
risk in IDP camps.  Sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation of minority women and 
girls, especially of the Bantu ethnic group, appeared more pronounced last year.   
</p>
<p>34. The independent expert learned that in the context of the National Reconciliation 
Congress, minority groups gained some recognition as a &#8220;fifth clan.&#8221;  While they are still only 
attributed .<footnote name="5">4. According to United Nations estimates close to 600,000 people fled Mogadishu and 
surrounding areas in the past year due to the fighting. This figure is in addition to the more than 
400,000 IDPs already scattered around Somalia. Many of the displaced went to outlying areas 
near Mogadishu, Lower and Middle Shabelle, as well as &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and &#8220;Puntland&#8221; and 
beyond. It was raised during meetings with the independent expert that it appeared that many 
Hawiye clans had displaced further inland returning to claimed places of origin or ancestral 
lands.   
</footnote> of seats, the independent expert considers this a small but important gain and urges 
that minority groups continue to be represented, reflected and involved in Somalia&#8217;s 
reconciliation, constitution-drafting and governance processes.   
</p>
<p><b>G. The human rights of women  
</b></p>
<p>35. The situation of women and girls in Somalia continues to deteriorate with the massive 
internal displacement, militarized environment and lack of governance leading to an increase in 
discrimination and sexual and gender-based violence.    
</p>
<p>36. While sexual violence has always been of concern in Somalia due to the ongoing 
conflicts, the lack of a justice system and the limited law and order, and the huge IDP population 
in camps; it also proved to be the case that the peaks of violence of the past year and the 
deteriorating security situation had further detrimental consequences for the protection of women 
and girls. According to reports received from Kismayo and Mogadishu, IDP women and girls, 
particularly those belonging to minority groups, are increasingly becoming the targets of sexual 
violence by youth gangs. The lack of security in and around IDP settlements, the re-emergence 
of armed groups and freelance militias and the new large population of military troops have also 
contributed to the increase of incidents and to the atmosphere of utter impunity in which they 
occur. Increased and often forced prostitution has also been linked to the militarized presence in 
Mogadishu and south-central Somalia.  
</p>
<p>37. Outside the context of the ongoing conflicts, revenge or &#8220;honour&#8221; killings still took place 
and women continued to be discriminated against with regard to property rights and inheritance. 
The most serious forms of female genital mutilation(FGM) are still also commonly practiced.  
</p>
<p>38. The independent expert continues to advocate for the improved representation and 
meaningful participation of women in the TFG, Transitional federal parliament (TFP) and other 
government institutions. He notes, however, that among the &#8220;Financial Decisions and 
Suggestions of the National Reconciliation Congress&#8221; are that &#8220;women should receive their 12 
per cent share in the Parliamentary seats&#8221; and that &#8220;women should get their share in the 
Government and Judiciary organs.&#8221;  </p>

<p>                                                
</p>
<p><b>H. The human rights of children  
</b></p>
<p>39. According to several sources, children featured prominently in recent fighting as active 
combatants &#8211; they are recruited by militias as &#8220;child recruits&#8221; and are reportedly used by 
insurgent groups to throw grenades for small compensation. The independent expert finds this 
completely unacceptable and urges all parties to immediately release from their ranks (or from 
detention centres where they might currently be held) all children associated with armed forces 
or groups. In this regard, he welcomed the recent report about Somali children in armed conflict 
submitted to the Security Council, pursuant to its resolution 1612 (2005).2  
</p>
<p>40. Traditional protection systems such as community and schools have been supplanted by 
violence, conflict and displacement. It was reported that new cases of child rape occurred every 
week, but that the response was often one of social denial and stigma. The numbers of orphans 
and street children was also increasing due to internal displacement and children were 
malnourished and often abused in the unregulated and haphazard IDP camps. It was noted that 
children of minority groups and clans faced greater discrimination and abuse. 
</p>
<p>41. The recent fighting has also severely affected school enrolment; with enrolment numbers 
decreased by 50 per cent from the previous year. Most Somali children have very limited 
chances of accessing formal education and the conflicts of the past months have only 
exacerbated this situation. When not in school, children were more likely to be recruited, killed 
or severely injured, forced into child labour and were more vulnerable to trauma and attacks. 
Young girls in Somalia were the most disadvantaged in accessing what little education there is 
available. 
</p>
<p>42. In meetings with United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) officials, the independent 
expert learned that while UNICEF had committed to building some new schools last year, plans 
had been hampered by the insecurity and many of the schools which had been operational had 
been closed due to the insecurity.  
</p>
<p>43. UNICEF representatives also confirmed to the independent expert that the custom and 
practice of <i>asi walid, </i>where<i> s</i>ome parents enforced disciplinary action on their children by 
placing them in prison without due process continued. As a result, a very high number of 
children were housed with adult detainees and inmates, in gross violation of the human rights of 
the children. Despite his previous dialogues with TFG, &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and &#8220;Puntland&#8221; officials, 
the independent expert learned that there had been little action to address these violations.  
</p>
<p> A/HRC/7/26 
 Page 13 
 
</p>
<p><b>III. GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW ISSUES AND IMPUNITY 
</b></p>
<p>45. Lack of governance and rule of law, weak institutions and impunity are not in and of 
themselves human rights issues. Rather, they are the circumstances and context which create and 
allow for human rights infringements and violations, enable them to continue unabated or 
prevent their remedy or redress. Principles of good governance and the rule of law are built on 
human rights standards and norms such as due process, gender equality, participation and non-
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>46. It has too long been the case in Somalia that a weakly functioning central Government 
has resulted in an<b> </b>absence of order, security, the rule of law and justice. There is no central 
trained police service and there is often no independent and professional judiciary, which creates 
a climate of utter impunity. The judiciary and police or security services do not function and 
customary <i>(xeer)</i>, Islamic law (sharia) and various national legal standards are applied arbitrarily 
in the absence of a national legal framework. Decisions are often taken by officials without 
regard to transparency, fairness and accountability.  
</p>
<p>47. On the second day of his mission on 18 September, the independent expert experienced 
first-hand arbitrary treatment when he was prevented from disembarking at the Baidoa airport 
despite having received prior authorization. He was obliged to return to Nairobi, where he was 
met with official apologies from the TFG and the promise of an investigation into the matter.  
Also, while on mission, the independent expert learned that the President of the Supreme Court, 
Yusuf Ali Harun and another judge of the Supreme Court had been arrested and that the 
Attorney-General, Abdullahi Dahir and his deputy had been dismissed. As at the writing of this 
report, the President of Supreme Court and his associate were still awaiting trial. The 
independent expert condemns these decisions taken without regard to rules and procedures and 
which clearly violate the doctrines of the separation of powers and the independence of the 
judiciary.  
</p>
<p>48. The independent expert contends that the most pressing governance areas in need of 
reform and strengthening include the executive office or cabinet, ministry of the attorney-general 
and the judicial branch, and ministries such as interior and those responsible for the security 
sector.  
</p>
<p>49. During the mission, the independent expert was updated on rule of law and security 
issues by colleagues of the Rule of Law and Security Program of the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP).  The independent expert learned that in Baidoa there is a 
semblance of a law system, in which arrests and cases were being channelled through. It was 
also noted that in Mogadishu, cases were being considered in a new system applying a mixture 
of customary and civil law. Customary law was also slowly being introduced into the penal code 
in some courts in south and central Somalia, allowing for the enforcement of customary laws. 
Some local communities were also beginning to vet nominees to the judiciary in south and 
central Somalia.   
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/26 
Page 14 
</p>
<p>detained without cause and that detainees were allowed access to legal representation.  The 
independent expert was urged to advocate with TFG officials the expansion of this system to the 
remaining prisons, to which he agreed. He learned that police trainees from all over Somalia 
attended the police academy in &#8220;Puntland&#8221; where they were trained in human rights, code of 
conducts and rules of engagement.  It was also noted that United Nations training did not provide 
for arms training which presented a major challenge given the security environment in which 
heavy weaponry was widely used.  One solution proposed was training and provision of 
equipment by bilateral partners.   
</p>
<p>51. The independent expert maintains that while some slow progress is being made with 
respect to police training and establishing of some courts in Somalia, the building of key state 
institutions with the rule of law and human rights as their cornerstone must be emphasized, 
strengthened and strongly supported by the international community.  
</p>
<p>52. In addition, Somalia&#8217;s Transitional Federal Charter contains positive human rights 
provisions, including specific reference to international human rights treaties ratified by Somalia; 
however, implementation of these provisions is severely lacking. It is clear that the TFIs are 
severely hampered in their ability to protect civilians and provide even the most basic services 
such as health, education, justice and security. The independent expert feels that the drafting of 
the national constitution will be an important next step in building such a legal framework with 
strong provisions for the protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>53. During his mission, the independent expert was briefed by various sources about the 
intense violence and allegations of serious violations of human rights which had occurred in 
Mogadishu over the past year. As he has done in the past, he strongly urged for the investigation 
of all human rights abuses committed in Somalia, past and present. He also called for justice and 
accountability, so that Somalia's fragile peace will not be built on impunity. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS</b>  
</p>
<p> A/HRC/7/26 
 Page 15 
 
The independent expert wishes to note that there is a divergence of opinion between Somali 
authorities and the international community about exact IDP figures, and that accurate figures 
are difficult to establish given often cyclical population movements and insecurity.   
</p>
<p>57. It was again brought to the attention of the independent expert that internally displaced 
persons were subject to threats, intimidation, looting, assault and sexual and gender-based 
violence. Due to a lack of humanitarian access, thousands of IDPs went without any form of 
assistance for weeks, living in the open and often forced to pay a &#8220;shade tax&#8221; to shelter from the 
sun and the coming rainy season. Many were and are forced to live in crowded camps where 
there is a lack of water, food, sanitation, basic health services and shelter and where there exist 
infectious diseases, like cholera.   
</p>
<p>58. It has been reported that several thousand IDPs have at various times this past year also 
returned to Mogadishu, when there has been a lull in the fighting. There are, however, reports 
that some returnees have been prevented from returning to their homes and that some are facing 
discrimination, confiscation of property, lack of compensation or forced relocation. There is also 
an ongoing issue whereby the Government has been forcibly evicting IDPs from public buildings 
in Mogadishu and Kismayo without offering acceptable alternatives.  
</p>
<p>59. As he has done so in the past, the independent expert maintains that Somali authorities 
should accept greater responsibility for the IDP population and their protection, and the 
international community should not be considered a substitute. Nevertheless, the United Nations 
and donors should increase their assistance and presence with respect to IDPs in Somalia and 
should be more active.  
</p>
<p><b>V. &#8220;MIXED MIGRATION&#8221;  
</b></p>
<p>60. Last year, over 23,000 &#8220;boat people&#8221; made the crossing from Bossaso in &#8220;Puntland&#8221; 
across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. It is estimated that about 10,000 of these people are from 
Somalia.  As at November 2007, it was reported that 497 people died and 524 went missing in 
their attempts to migrate. (IASC Migration Task Force)<i>.</i> It is also reported that a sizeable group 
of the migrants are trafficked women and children. 
</p>
<p>61. During his mission, the independent expert received updates about the apparent increase 
in the number of migrants arriving in the north-eastern port of Bossaso in &#8220;Puntland&#8221;, hoping to 
make the crossing to Yemen, and from there, on to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. The term 
&#8220;mixed migration&#8221; is used because the migrants can be from various backgrounds, countries and 
ethnic groups, and while the causes of their migration can be economic, nomadic or forced, the 
migration patterns are usually linked to violent conflict and political instability in the region. He 
heard that many migrants became victims of attacks, theft, harassment or sexual assault in their 
attempt to reach the port town by road or during their &#8220;stay&#8221; in Bossaso awaiting passage. 
Crowded onto fishing boats, there was also the risk that they would be denied food, water and air 
or that human traffickers would verbally and physically abuse their human cargo or throw 
passengers overboard to their deaths. The independent expert deplores the conditions the 
migrants are forced to endure and strongly denounces those who profit from their desperation.  
</p>
<p>62. On 13 June 2007 at a parallel event during the fifth session of the Human Rights Council 
in Geneva, the independent expert chaired a panel discussion on the situation of human rights in </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/26 
Page 16 
</p>
<p>Somalia, which included representatives from Amnesty International and the East and Horn of 
Africa Human Rights Defenders Network  Another panellist was French filmmaker, Daniel 
Grandcl&#233;ment, who in 2006 captured one such harrowing crossing of the Gulf of Aden between 
Bossaso and Yemen in his film, &#8220;Les Martyrs du Golfe d&#8217;Aden&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>63. The film and the parallel event attracted some attention to this dreadful phenomenon.  
However, it is clear that this mixed migrant population requires protection against sexual and 
gender-based violence, targeted harassment, trafficking, insecurity and vulnerability to common 
criminality, inequitable access to social services and humanitarian assistance and forced 
deportation/expulsion upon arrival without respect for their right to seek asylum.  The 
independent expert is very pleased with the good work carried out by the Mixed Migration Task 
Force (comprised of United Nations agencies and NGOs) and calls on international community 
to mobilize more funds in order for them to implement much-needed awareness-raising and 
protection strategies in the future. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI. HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
</b></p>
<p>64. The provision of humanitarian assistance in south and central Somalia is still often 
problematic, and the ability of people in dire need to access humanitarian aid is hampered. 
Convoys delivering food and humanitarian assistance have been delayed by weeks and months 
and face illegal &#8220;taxation&#8221; at numerous temporary checkpoints. Food deliveries by ship have 
been hijacked by pirates in Somali waters and there are reports of theft of food from 
beneficiaries - particularly from minority groups - occurring during and immediately after food 
distribution.  
</p>
<p>65. Access to humanitarian assistance - such as food and basic amenities, water and 
sanitation, and primary medical care - is also compromised by threats and intimidation of aid 
personnel and the targeting of actual aid operations by various parties. In some places, aid 
vehicles have been shot and in the course of their work, humanitarian aid personnel are forced to 
navigate roads possibly mined or planted with improvised explosive devices.  
</p>
<p>66. During the independent expert&#8217;s mission, it was raised by some observers that the 
scale and magnitude of the human tragedy in Somalia justified a declaration of a state of 
emergency by the humanitarian community. It was underscored that the humanitarian needs of 
the civilian population, including now more than one million internally displaced persons and 
attacks against aid workers must be addressed and that all parties to the conflict must be pressed 
to preserve this vital humanitarian space.  
</p>
<p>67. The independent expert emphasized the need for the establishment of a standing 
dialogue/engagement mechanism for the United Nations to address humanitarian and human 
rights issues with the TFIs. He urges that this useful mechanism be put in place rapidly to foster 
understanding and communication on key human rights and humanitarian issues, possibly 
benefiting from the recent appointment of Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and a new TFG 
cabinet. </p>

</p>
<p><b>VII. FIELD VISITS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Visit to Baidoa  
</b></p>
<p>68. The independent expert&#8217;s mission to Somalia included a planned and authorized visit to 
Baidoa on 17 September 2007 in order to meet with various officials of the TFIs.  Unfortunately, 
that morning he was prevented from disembarking the plane on arrival in Baidoa and was 
obliged to return to Nairobi. Following this incident, he received numerous apologies from 
various members of the TFG and an undertaking that the incident would be investigated. While 
appreciating all the apologies and explanations received after this incident, the experience starkly 
highlighted for the independent expert the arbitrariness of decision-making by authorities and the 
deficiencies in institutional structures in Somalia.     
</p>
<p><b>B. Visit to Mogadishu 
</b></p>
<p>69. On 20 September 2007, the independent expert met with President Abdullahi Yusuf. The 
President began by offering renewed apologies over the Baidoa incident stating that the 
independent expert was always welcome. The independent expert raised the issue of the negative 
environment for journalists and the media to which the President stated that some media 
organizations presented legitimate security concerns in that they were &#8220;hiding terrorists.&#8221;  
President Yusuf also noted that human rights reports were often mere allegations by human 
rights organizations which very often could not be corroborated or considered credible.     
</p>
<p>70. The independent expert also met with the (then) Prime Minister of the TFG, Ali 
Mohamed Gedi, in Mogadishu. The latter also apologized for the Baidoa incident and assured 
the independent expert that those responsible would be held accountable. The independent expert 
then briefed the Prime Minister on his previous reports and presentations to the Human Rights 
Council.3 The independent expert raised several issues arising from his current mission with the 
Prime Minister, including reiterating his recommendation that the Somali Government sign and 
ratify all key international human rights instruments, as well as his opinion that the establishment 
of a national human rights commission would assist in addressing some of the pressing human 
rights challenges facing Somalia. He encouraged the TFG to request the assistance of the Human 
Rights Adviser deployed to the United Nations Country Team. The Prime Minister stated that the 
TFG remained committed to the idea of a national human rights institution and stressed that 
international assistance and support would be necessary in order to achieve this goal.  
</p>
<p>71. In a meeting with the Chair of the National Governance and Reconciliation Commission, 
Ali Mahdi, the independent expert was apprised of the outcomes of the National Reconciliation 
Congress. He learned that the Congress will be followed by discussions facilitated by 
participants within their communities in a parallel track to the constitution drafting process. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/26

</p>
<p>that of the &#8220;genocide in Rwanda.&#8221; They also denounced the recurrent crackdowns on the media, 
including the latest attacks on the Shabelle media network premises.    
</p>
<p>73. The independent expert also met with some civil society representatives and journalists 
who reinforced many of the reports about attacks, harassment and intimidation against media 
personnel and human rights defenders.   
</p>
<p><b>C. Meetings in Nairobi 
</b></p>
<p>74. On various occasions during his mission, the independent expert met with the United 
Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia, Eric Laroche and also held 
meetings with several other members of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), including 
UNDP, UNICEF, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA). In discussions with UNCT on 21 September 2007, the independent expert 
briefed them on his visit to Mogadishu and his various meetings. He also underscored the human 
rights themes of his mission including the repeated conflicts of 2007 and its deleterious effects 
on human rights. The independent expert also welcomed the United Nations Transition Plan 
(UNTP) which provides the comprehensive framework for United Nations action in regard to 
Somalia and which intends to address some of the human rights issues and challenges raised by 
the independent expert and others. 
</p>
<p>75. The independent expert met the newly appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah and the staff of UNPOS to discuss the political developments 
in Somalia, strengthening the TFIs, as well as political and national reconciliation processes, 
including the National Reconciliation Congress.   
</p>
<p>76. The independent expert also held several meetings with representatives of interested 
donor countries while in Nairobi, during which he exchanged views on the situation of human 
rights in Somalia and he briefed them on his recent mission. During these discussions, he raised 
numerous human rights issues such as the human rights of women, children and minorities; the 
weaknesses of TFIs and the need for the improved governance and the rule of law; reconciliation 
processes and the right to the truth; the desperate conditions of IDPs in Somalia and the need for 
international support for the establishment of human rights institutions in Somalia, &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; 
and &#8220;Puntland&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>77. On 21 September 2007, the independent expert held a final press conference outlining the  </p>
<p>key findings of his mission. During the press conference he paid tribute to the journalists and 
human rights defenders who were operating under very difficult conditions in Somalia. He also 
underscored the importance played by civil society groups and NGOs in the absence of fully-
functioning civil authorities. He encouraged the Somali authorities, as well as donors and 
United Nations agencies, to give increased support to these civil society organizations who are 
undertaking vital human rights work.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>VIII.   &#8220;SOMALILAND&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>78. As documented in the last report of the independent expert 4 , there appeared to be 
progress in respect of the border dispute between &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; and &#8220;Puntland&#8221; in the regions of 
Eastern Sool and Sanaag. However, between April and October of last year, several clashes 
erupted between &#8220;Puntland&#8221; and &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; forces which resulted in an estimated thirty 
deaths and raised tensions over the disputed territories which had been dormant for sometime. 
These incidents also generated additional waves of internal displacement. The independent 
expert hopes that this was an errant period and that both sides will refrain from further hostilities 
or provocative acts.  
</p>
<p>79. Otherwise the situation in &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; was comparatively peaceful in contrast to south 
and central Somalia. Following the first-ever parliamentary elections in 2005, &#8220;Somaliland&#8221; 
continued to make incremental progress on public administration and governance. Authorities 
continued to undertake modest infrastructure projects and NGOs carried on with their local 
human rights work, albeit with little or no resources.  However, in &#8220;Somaliland,&#8221; the 
independent expert remains concerned about police brutality, arbitrary arrests of journalists and 
human rights defenders, reports of impunity and so-called security committees which continue to 
exercise judicial responsibilities by issuing sentences without due process. During past missions 
to &#8220;Somaliland&#8221;, the independent expert has been impressed with the activities of the Rule of 
Law and Security Program of UNDP and further to his briefing while in Nairobi on this mission, 
it is his understanding that UNDP will expand further these activities to other parts of Somalia.  
</p>
<p><b>IX. &#8220;PUNTLAND&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>80. In &#8220;Puntland&#8221; the issues of coastline protection, the living conditions <i>in</i> and the need for 
humanitarian assistance <i>to</i> IDP camps, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment of the 
media, and the lack of rule of law and an effective justice system continue to be problematic. 
&#8220;Puntland&#8221; also witnessed increased instability in the form threats to humanitarian workers, civil 
unrest and police brutality.  
</p>
<p>81. In 2006, and as reflected in the previous report of the independent expert, the political 
outlook for &#8220;Puntland&#8221; looked positive. As noted above, it appeared that both &#8220;Puntland&#8221; and 
&#8220;Somaliland&#8221; were reinforcing their positions in the contested Sool region, following fighting in 
the town of Lasanod. This seemingly renewed military conflict may threaten &quot;Puntland&quot;&#8217;s recent 
political consolidation. Once again, observers have expressed their concern over the economic 
crisis in &#8220;Puntland&#8221; and highlighted the risks that a lack of economic growth could also pose to 
the region. The independent expert continues to urge authorities to take action against the human 
traffickers and smugglers who are responsible for such misery and human rights abuses against 
the &#8220;boat people&#8221; which was mentioned in paragraphs 59 to 62 above.

<p><b>(a) Calls upon the United Nations to encourage greater support to the 
Transitional Federal Institutions to press them to provide protection to the Somali 
population and to implement the human rights principles contained in the Transitional 
Federal Charter. The independent expert supports the establishment of a standing 
dialogue/engagement mechanism for the United Nations to address humanitarian and 
human rights issues with the TFIs;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Calls upon the Transitional Federal Parliament and Transitional Federal 
Government of Somalia to ensure that human rights safeguards and principles are 
included in all their deliberations, documentation, institutions and actions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Calls upon all Somali authorities to provide full protection and independence 
for journalists and media personnel, human rights defenders and international 
humanitarian aid personnel operating in Somalia;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Calls upon the Transitional Federal Parliament to undertake discussions 
to work towards signing and ratifying the core international human rights treaties, 
in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Urges that in their engagement with the TFIs, the international community 
should emphasize and strongly support the building of key State institutions with the rule 
of law and human rights as their cornerstone; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f)  Calls upon the United Nations and the Somali authorities to increase their 
efforts to address the immediate humanitarian needs and protect the human rights of the 
approximately 1 million internally displaced persons  in Somalia;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g)  Calls upon the United Nations and the international community to work with 
Transitional Federal Government officials to address, possibly through an inquiry or 
investigation, the issue of the very limited information available on the current human 
rights situation in Somalia and on any violations which allegedly took place in 2007 during 
the various rounds of fighting. Similarly, past injustices and human rights violations which 
have occurred during Somalia&#8217;s 14-year civil conflict as well as under the previous regime 
must also be addressed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Calls on the Secretary-General and the Security Council to establish a 
committee of independent experts to examine allegations of past massive human rights 
violations and crimes against humanity committed in Somalia, and to report on options for 
how these might be addressed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)  Calls upon the international community to support Somalis in their 
reconciliation efforts and processes, bearing in mind that an event such as the recent 
National Reconciliation Congress is within a larger framework of reconciliation and as 
such is the beginning of a process which does not preclude other transitional justice 
initiatives or processes;  </b></p>

<p> A/HRC/7/26

</p>
<p><b>(j)  Urges that in the event that a United Nations mission is authorized for 
Somalia, such an operation include a human rights component to conduct monitoring and 
investigations as well as undertaking capacity development and awareness-raising, and 
have a strong mandate for the protection of civilians; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k)  Urges that a human rights presence for Somalia be established, either as part 
of a peacekeeping operation or, more advisable, as a separate office. The human rights 
situation in Somalia is sufficiently grave that a focused human rights presence is required 
to monitor and report regularly on the situation and provide much-needed human rights 
expertise;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Calls upon Somali authorities to establish independent human rights 
institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights, and encourages the 
United Nations agencies as well as donor countries to provide technical assistance and 
financial support; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Calls upon all Somali authorities to pay serious attention to the protection of 
children and to coordinate with UNICEF and relevant international NGOs to achieve the 
goal of a better life for the children of Somalia; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Calls upon the Transitional Federal Government to increase its support for 
the Ministry of Gender and Family Affairs and to keep the human rights of women at the 
top of their agenda.  The independent expert also urges the international community and 
the United Nations Country Team to support projects and programmes which benefit 
Somalia&#8217;s women;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) Urges the international community to reinforce their financial support and 
technical assistance to the Transitional Federal Parliament and Transitional Federal 
Government, with a view to ensuring that human rights are thoroughly integrated in the 
institutions, frameworks and laws which are being forged.
