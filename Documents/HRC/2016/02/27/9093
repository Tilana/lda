<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is a preliminary note concerning the mission to Equatorial Guinea, 
conducted at the invitation of the Government by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak, from 9 to 
18 November 2008. The final report will be published and submitted at a later stage. 
</p>
<p>2. The main purposes of the visit were to assess the current situation of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including the conditions of detention in 
pre- and post-trial detention facilities, and to make concrete recommendations to the Government 
on how to improve the situation.  
</p>
<p>3. During his visit the Special Rapporteur met with the First Deputy Prime Minister for 
Human Rights, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and la Francophonie, 
the Minister of National Security, the Minister of Justice, Religion and Prison Establishments, 
the Minister of the Interior and Local Corporations, the Minister for Social Affairs and the 
Advancement of Women, the Vice-Minister of National Defence, the Attorney-General of the 
Republic of Equatorial Guinea, the Governor of the Province of Bata - Litoral, 
and other officials, and visited a number of places of detention on Bioko Island and on the 
mainland.<b>1</b>

</p>
<p>4. In addition to Government officials, the Special Rapporteur met with the President of the 
Appeals Court of Malabo and the National Human Rights Commission. He also had discussions 
with civil society representatives and met with the United Nations country team and the 
diplomatic community. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur wishes to extend his thanks to the Government of Equatorial 
Guinea for its invitation to undertake a mission to the country. He interprets this invitation as a 
sign of the willingness of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea to open itself up to independent and 
objective scrutiny of the situation of torture and ill-treatment, practices to which no country in 
the world is immune. He expresses his gratitude to his governmental and non-governmental 
interlocutors in Malabo, Bata and elsewhere. He regrets however that, in violation of the terms of 
reference for fact-finding missions by special rapporteurs (E/CN.4/1998/45), he was not given 
access to any places of detention under the control of the military, and that, in a number of 
instances, access to other facilities was delayed or denied. He is also concerned about possible 
reprisals against detainees who provided testimony to him. The fact that he was denied access 
to the Central Police Stations in Malabo and Bata during a follow-up visit reinforces these 
concerns. 
</p>
<p>6. On the basis of an analysis of the legal system, visits to detention facilities, interviews with 
detainees, supporting forensic medical evidence and meetings with Government officials, 
lawyers and representatives of civil society, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
following preliminary comments. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  TORTURE AND ILL-TREATMENT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Police or gendarmerie custody 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur found that torture is used systematically by the police against 
persons who refuse to &#8220;cooperate&#8221;, such as persons suspected of political as well as ordinary 
crimes, in particular at the Central Police Stations in Bata and Malabo. The gendarmerie appears 
to practise torture to a lesser extent. The Special Rapporteur was unable to verify allegations 
against the military because he was denied access to military facilities. 
</p>
<p>8. The types of abuse reported to him and corroborated by expert medical analysis, and 
evidence found in the respective police stations, include: blows to various parts of the body, 
although often on the soles of the feet and/or the buttocks, using police batons, rubber-coated 
cables and wooden sticks; electric shocks delivered by battery cables attached to different parts 
of the body with alligator clips; various forms of suspension, with hands and feet tied together, 
including the so-called &#8220;Ethiopian style&#8221;, for extended periods of time. In these positions the 
victims were swung around and beaten, or heavy objects, for example car batteries, were placed 
on their backs. Furthermore, they were sometimes blindfolded or forced to inhale candle smoke. 
In most instances, the purpose of the torture was to extract information or a confession; 
sometimes it was intended as punishment or intimidation or a means of extorting money. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Prisons 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur received numerous reports that corporal punishment continues to 
be used routinely by prison guards in full view of other prisoners in Bata and Black Beach 
prisons. On the other hand, he was encouraged to learn that corporal punishment has not been 
used in Evinayong prison for several months. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONDITIONS OF DETENTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Police or gendarmerie custody 
</b></p>
<p>10. With the exception of the recently built Bata Central Police Station, police and 
gendarmerie holding cells were generally in a deplorable condition. The cells were dirty and 
damp and lacked any sanitary or sleeping facilities. Generally speaking, food was only provided 
by families or fellow prisoners; access to water for drinking and washing was severely restricted; 
prisoners were often not allowed to use the toilet, and as a result had to resort to using plastic 
bottles or plastic bags; they had no opportunity to exercise and no access to medical care. The 
Special Rapporteur was also concerned at reports of violence among detainees, which were 
allegedly ignored or even tolerated by the authorities.  
</p>
<p>11. The fact that many detainees were held in these conditions well beyond the 72 hours 
stipulated by law, sometimes up to several months, exacerbates the situation and amounts to 
inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Prisons 
</b></p>
<p>12. Generally speaking the prisons are fairly spacious, although the Special Rapporteur was 
told that during periods of peak demand prisoners in one wing of Black Beach Prison had to 
share beds. One of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main concerns with regard to Black Beach Prison is 
that family visits seem to be prohibited, except for certain prisoners. The Special Rapporteur 
stresses that contact with the outside world is an important factor for the successful rehabilitation 
and reintegration of detainees, as stipulated in article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>13. In all the prisons the Special Rapporteur received numerous complaints about the food, 
which is insufficient if not supplemented by family members. Although in Black Beach Prison 
medical doctors are on duty and can treat minor problems, access to medical treatment and 
medicine is severely restricted and completely unavailable in Bata and Evinayong Prisons. The 
most serious cases generally go untreated if the detainee cannot afford to pay for treatment.  
</p>
<p>14. Another major problem identified by the Special Rapporteur was the allegation that some 
persons suspected of political crimes had been held in solitary confinement in Black Beach 
Prison for up to four years, without being allowed the one hour of exercise per day required by 
the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Moreover, they were said to have </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/44/Add.1 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>been held in leg irons practically all the time. Prolonged solitary confinement and the permanent 
use of leg irons amount to inhuman treatment. In addition, the Special Rapporteur received 
allegations from various sources about persons held incommunicado and in secret detention, 
which he could not verify because of lack of access.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>15. Despite the lack of any legal basis for the detention of immigrants awaiting deportation, 
they are frequently held for long periods in police detention in poor conditions, without access to 
water and/or food since they have no family members nearby to help them. Their ability to 
contact the consular representatives of their countries is limited. The Special Rapporteur also 
received credible reports that immigrants are at increased risk of being subjected to 
discriminatory practices and even physical abuse by other detainees, with the tacit approval of 
the police.  
</p>
<p>16. Women and children are not separated from male adults in prisons or in police and 
gendarmerie custody and are therefore extremely vulnerable to sexual violence and other forms 
of abuse. This is a clear violation of international norms. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  DYSFUNCTIONAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p>17. The non-existence of a properly functioning justice system, and the resulting absence of 
the rule of law, encourage a situation where torture can continue unabated. Factors contributing 
to this situation are: 
</p>
<p> (a) The lack of an independent judicial system; 
 (b) Endemic corruption;  
</p>
<p> (c) Routine use of arbitrary detention and ineffectiveness of habeas corpus guarantees in 
practice;  
</p>
<p> (d) Lack of any clear distinction between the various State security bodies, which are 
militarized and effectively control the judicial system;  
 (e) &#8220;Evidence&#8221; obtained under torture is commonly used as the basis 
for convictions, which means that there is considerable pressure on the police to extract 
confessions;  
</p>
<p> (f) Notwithstanding Act No. 6/2006 on the Prevention and Punishment of Torture, there 
is near total impunity. With the exception of one female police officer who was sentenced to 
seven months in prison for a case of torture causing death, no alleged perpetrator of torture has 
been brought to justice. On the contrary, certain officers known to use torture regularly continue 
working in the police and gendarmerie. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> (g) The Special Rapporteur notes with particular concern that, in many cases, victims of 
torture fall into a vicious circle of re-victimization. Contrary to what is required by international 
standards, they experience a total lack of justice, which, combined with the physical and 
psychological consequences of ill-treatment and the lack of any rehabilitation or compensation 
mechanism, causes ongoing suffering that can amount to inhuman treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>V. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND  
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
</b></p>
<p>18. In order for Equatorial Guinea to comply with its obligations under both international 
human rights law and its Constitution, it must undertake a comprehensive reform of its 
institutions and judicial system, involving the establishment of law enforcement bodies based on 
the rule of law, an independent judiciary and effective mechanisms for monitoring and ensuring 
transparency.  
</p>
<p>19. In addition to the foregoing, a number of steps should be taken in the immediate future to 
address the most urgent human rights concerns:  
</p>
<p> (a) Implement the recommendations contained in the report on the 2007 visit of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) to Equatorial Guinea (A/HRC/7/4/Add.3, 
para. 100), notably that the Government should: put an immediate end to the practice of secret 
detentions; revise the national criminal law framework, including with regard to making 
guarantees of habeas corpus effective; reform the judiciary with a view to complying with the 
international instruments to which Equatorial Guinea is a State party; and allow civil society 
organizations to function independently; 
</p>
<p> (b) Strictly separate women and minors from adult men in all places of detention;  
</p>
<p> (c) Introduce proper registers in police detention facilities (to some extent the 
gendarmerie registers can serve as an example) and maintain proper registers in prisons; issue a 
transparent set of rules allowing for regular family visits in all places of detention; make minimal 
use of solitary confinement (see also A/63/175, paras. 77-85 and annex) and refrain from using 
leg irons; 
</p>
<p> (d) Improve conditions in police and gendarmerie detention facilities; in particular by 
providing food and drinking water and ensuring that detainees have access to medical care as 
well as toilets and sanitary facilities;  
</p>
<p> (e) With regard to foreigners, the Special Rapporteur underscores the recommendation 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to avoid their detention where possible, and to 
guarantee them all the rights recognized to persons deprived of liberty by international 
instruments, including the right to communicate with their respective consulates. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>20. As for the international community, the Special Rapporteur notes that, as a result of the 
discovery of considerable oil reserves on Equatorial Guinean territory, many transnational 
corporations are operating in the country. In addition, a number of bilateral and multilateral 
donors have technical assistance programmes under way, including in the areas of law 
enforcement and the administration of justice. The Special Rapporteur calls on all the 
international actors present in the country, including transnational corporations, to take note of 
his assessment that torture is systematically practised by the police, and to ensure that, in their 
projects and initiatives, they do not become accomplices to violations of the prohibition of 
torture and ill-treatment.<b>2</b>
