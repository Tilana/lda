GOLDEN QUEEN MINING CO. LTD.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
(US dollars - Unaudited)
Nature of Business Golden Queen Mining Co. Ltd. (“Golden Queen”, “GQM Ltd.” or the “Company”) is engaged in the
development and operation of the Soledad Mountain Project (“the Project”), located in the Mojave Mining District, Kern County,
California. The construction phase of the Project was completed in February 2016 and the Company commenced production in
April 2016.
The Company originally used its wholly owned subsidiary, Golden Queen Mining Company, Inc. (“GQM Inc.”), to explore and
develop the Project. On September 10, 2014, GQM Inc. was converted to a limited liability company, Golden Queen Mining
Company, LLC (“GQM LLC”). The Company entered into a Joint Venture (the “JV”) agreement with Gauss LLC (“Gauss”)
through its newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Golden Queen Mining Holdings, Inc. (“GQM Holdings”). The JV was
completed on September 15, 2014. Upon completion of the JV, both the Company, through GQM Holdings, and Gauss each
owned, and continue to own, 50% of GQM LLC. In February 2015, the Company incorporated Golden Queen Mining Canada
Ltd. (“GQM Canada”), a wholly-owned British Columbia subsidiary, to hold the Company’s interest in GQM Holdings.
Basis of Preparation These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accounting
policies followed in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are those used by the Company as
set out in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, with the exception of
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-02. This update was adopted January 1, 2016 as described below under the
recent accounting standards.
Certain information and note disclosures normally included for annual consolidated financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read
together with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary (including reclassifications and normal recurring
adjustments) to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at June 30, 2016 and for all periods
presented, have been included in these financial statements. The interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the
full year ending December 31, 2016, or future operating periods. For further information, see the Company’s annual
consolidated financial statements, including the accounting policies and notes thereto.
Judgements and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates and judgements have been made by Management in several areas including the
accounting for the joint venture transaction and determination of temporary and permanent non-controlling interest, the
recoverability of mineral properties expenditures, royalty obligations, inventory valuations, ore on heap leach pads, ore
reserves, mine plan, useful lives of assets, asset retirement obligations, convertible debentures, and derivative liability –
warrants. A key judgement for 2016 related to when the Soledad Mountain mine enters the production phase. Generally, under
US GAAP a mine would be considered to be in the production phase once it has demonstrated that it is producing saleable
quantities of product. The Company concluded that the Soledad Mountain mine began producing saleable material in the
second quarter of 2016.
Principles of Consolidation The Company consolidates all entities in which it can vote a majority of the outstanding voting
stock. In addition, it consolidates entities which meet the definition of a variable interest entity for which it is the primary
beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party who has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most
significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and who has an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to
receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity. We consider special allocations of cash flows
and preferences, if any, to determine amounts allocable to non-controlling interests. All intercompany transactions and
balances are eliminated in consolidation.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of Golden Queen, a British Columbia
corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, GQM Canada, GQM Holdings, a US (State of California) corporation, and GQM
LLC, a limited liability company in which Golden Queen has a 50% interest, through GQM Holdings. GQM LLC meets the
definition of a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). Golden Queen has determined it is the member of the related party group that is
most closely associated with GQM LLC and, as a result, is the primary beneficiary who consolidates GQM LLC.

GOLDEN QUEEN MINING CO. LTD.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
(US dollars - Unaudited)
Recent Accounting Standards
(i)
Effective August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40
–Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The update essentially requires
management of all entities, for annual and interim periods, to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in
the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the
date the financial statements are issued.
If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, but the substantial doubt
is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, the entity should disclose information that enables users of
the financial statements to understand all of the following:
1.
2.
Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern (before
consideration of management’s plans).
Management’s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s ability to meet its
obligations.
3.Management’s plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial doubt is
not alleviated after consideration of management’s plans, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating that
there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the
financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).
This update will come into effect for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard.
(ii)
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) – Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
which focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations (public and private companies and not-for-profit
organizations) that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In addition to reducing the
number of consolidation models from four to two, the new standard simplifies the standards and improves current GAAP by:
Placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. A reporting organization may no
longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances based solely on its fee arrangement, when certain
criteria are met.
Reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a
variable interest entity (VIE).
Changing consolidation conclusions for public and private companies in several industries that typically make use of
limited partnerships or VIEs.
The ASU became effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015, for public companies. Early adoption was
permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company adopted the ASU effective January 1, 2016. The Company
assessed and concluded there was no impact on the Company with the adoption of the new standard.

(US dollars - Unaudited)
(iii)
In January 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Recognition and measurement of financial assets
and financial liabilities (Subtopic 825-10) which updates several aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments that are relevant to the Company are as follows:
1.
2.
Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate
the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.
Require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for
disclosure purposes.
Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial
asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial
statements.
3.
The ASU will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. The Company is assessing
the impact of this standard.
(iv)
In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Subtopic 718) which updates several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
The ASU will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, for public companies. The Company is assessing
the impact of this standard.

In May 2014, ASU 2014-09 was issued related to revenue from contracts with customers. The ASU was further amended in
August 2015, March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016 by ASU 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12. The new standard
provides a five-step approach to be applied to all contracts with customers and also requires expanded disclosures about
revenue recognition.
In August 2015, the effective date was deferred to reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after December 31,
2017, and will be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance
and the impact it will have on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

(US dollars - Unaudited)
1.Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
The Company entered the production phase and began generating revenues from operations during the three months ended
June 30, 2016. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $90,940,578 and a working capital deficit of $29,001,254 at June
30, 2016. Cash used in operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $7,056,662.
Golden Queen, on a non-consolidated basis, currently does not have sufficient funds to repay the $37,500,000 loan (Note 7(ii)),
plus the accrued interest, at the issuance date of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. However, in order to
secure the necessary funds to meet this upcoming obligation and mitigate the going concern issue, management is evaluating
its options, including debt and equity, and to re-finance the June 2015 Loan which matures on December 8, 2016. The
Company raised gross proceeds of C$16 million in July, and the proceeds will be used to repay a portion of the loan.
While Golden Queen has been successful at certain of these efforts in the past, there can be no assurance that future efforts
will be successful. This raises substantial doubt about this entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
At the Project level, GQM LLC has sufficient funds to meet its contractual obligations for the next twelve months.
The Company’s access to the net assets of GQM LLC is determined by the Board of Managers of GQM LLC. The Board of
Managers is not controlled by the Company and therefore there is no guarantee that any access to the net assets of GQM LLC
would be provided to the Company in order to continue as a going concern. The Board of Managers of GQM LLC determine
when and if distributions from GQM LLC are made to the holders of its membership units at their sole discretion.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable
to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.

As at June 30, 2016, the Company had capitalized depreciation of $3,559,886 (December 31, 2015 - $1,850,403) relating to
assets used in the development of the mine. As the Company entered production on April 1, 2016, the Company began
amortising assets put into production on this date and also discontinued capitalizing depreciation.
The Company capitalized a portion of the interest expense related to the convertible debenture and notes payable in
accordance with its accounting policy. As the Company entered the production phase during the three months ended June 30,
2016, interest was no longer being capitalized. See Note 7 (iv) –Amortization of Discounts and Interest Expense.
4.Share Capital
The Company’s common shares outstanding are no par value, voting shares with no preferences or rights attached to them.
Common shares – 2015
In March 2015, the Company issued 150,000 common shares to the former President of the Company for achieving two of the
three milestones outlined in his management agreement (See Note 6 – Commitments and Contingencies). The common
shares had a total fair value of $151,428 (Note 7(i)). The fair value was based on the market price on the date of issuance.
Stock options
The Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted.
In accordance with the accounting standard for employees, the compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period, which approximates the vesting period. Compensation expense for stock options granted to
non-employees is amortized over the contract services period or, if none exists, from the date of grant until the options vest.
Compensation associated with unvested options granted to non-employees is re-measured on each balance sheet date using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

5.Asset Retirement Obligations and Financial Reclamation Assurance
Financial Reclamation Assurance
The Company is required to provide the Bureau of Land Management, the State Office of Mine Reclamation and Kern County
with a revised reclamation cost estimate annually.  The financial assurance is adjusted once the cost estimate is approved. 
The Company’s provision for reclamation of the property is estimated each year by an independent consulting engineer. This
estimate, once approved by state and county authorities, forms the basis for the reclamation financial assurance. The
reclamation assurance provided as at June 30, 2016 was $624,142 (December 31, 2015 - $624,142). This amount is expected
to increase to $1,460,496 during the 3rd quarter of 2016.

(US dollars - Unaudited)
5.Asset Retirement Obligations and Financial Reclamation Assurance - Continued
The Company is also required to provide financial assurance with the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (the
“Regional Board”) for closure and reclamation costs related to the lined impoundments, which are defined as the Stage 1 heap
leach pad, the overflow pond, and the solution collection channel. The reclamation financial assurance estimate for as of June
30, 2016 is $1,210,889 (December 31, 2015 - $Nil).
In addition to the above, the Company is required to obtain and maintain financial assurance for initiating and completing
corrective action and remediation of a reasonably foreseeable release from the Project’s waste management units as required
by the Regional Board.  The reclamation financial assurance estimate for as of June 30, 2016 is $278,240 (December 31, 2015
- $278,240).
In January 2016, the Company entered into $2.1 million in surety bond agreements in order to release its reclamation deposits
and post a portion of the financial assurance due in 2016. The Company pays a yearly premium. Golden Queen Ltd. has
provided a corporate guarantee on the surety bonds.
Asset Retirement Obligation
The total asset retirement obligation as of June 30, 2016 is $1,171,845 (December 31, 2015 - $978,453).
The Company estimated its asset retirement obligations based on its understanding of the requirements to reclaim and clean-
up its property based on its activities to date.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, there was an increase of
$96,696 and $193,392 (Three and six months ended June 30, 2015 - $278,240 and $278,240) to the asset retirement
obligations. Of these totals, $74,167 and $170,863 was capitalized to property, plant, equipment and mineral interests as the
asset portion of the asset retirement obligation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 (Three and six months ended
June 30, 2015 - $278,240 and $278,240).  The remaining amount of $22,529, for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016, was expensed to operations as accretion expense (Three and six months ended June 30, 2015 - $Nil and $Nil). The
Company estimates that the cash outflows related to these reclamation activities will be incurred primarily in 2028.  
Reclamation provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows discounted to their present value using a
credit adjusted risk-free interest rate and adjusted for inflation. The Company used a credit adjusted risk-free rate of 9.20%
(December 31, 2015 – 9.20%) and an inflation rate of 2.27% (December 31, 2015 – 2.27%).

6.Commitments and Contingencies
Property rent payments and Production Royalties
The Company has acquired a number of mineral properties outright. It has acquired exclusive rights to explore, develop and
mine other portions of the Project under various mining lease agreements with landowners.
The Company is required to make property rent payments related to its mining lease agreements with landholders, in the form
of advance minimum royalties.  The total property rent payments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were $167
and $10,167 (three months ended June 30, 2015 – $50,167 and six months ended June 30, 3015 -$60,167), and the Company
expects to pay approximately $30,000 in property rent payments in 2016.
Production royalty payments commenced during the first quarter of 2016. The Company has paid $40,000 and $41,802 in
production royalties during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
There are multiple third party landholders and the royalty amount due to each landholder over the life of the Project varies with
each property.

6.Commitments and Contingencies - Continued
Finder’s fee
The Company has agreed to issue 100,000 common shares as a finder’s fee in connection with certain property acquisitions
upon commencement of commercial production, as defined in the agreement, at the Project. As of June 30, 2016, commercial
production had not commenced and accordingly no shares have been issued.
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
The Company’s exploration and development activities are subject to laws and regulations controlling not only the exploration
and mining of mineral properties, but also the effect of such activities on the environment. Compliance with such laws and
regulations may necessitate additional capital outlays or affect the economics of a project, and cause changes or delays in the
Company’s activities.
The Company may, from time to time, be involved in legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Company believes that any adverse outcome of existing claims, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material
effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
See Note 12 for further details on the mining equipment loans.
7.Related Party Transactions
Except as noted elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements, related party transactions are disclosed as follows:
(i)
Consulting Fees
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company paid $Nil and $188,934 to Mr. H. Lutz Klingmann for services
as President of the Company. Included in these consulting fees was $151,428 related to 150,000 bonus shares (Refer to Note
4 – Share Capital). There were no consulting fees paid during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company paid a total of $27,703 and $56,238 (Three and six
months ended June 30, 2015 - $18,414 and $36,852) to the three independent directors of the Company. During the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016, Thomas M. Clay did not receive director fees.
(ii)
Notes Payable
On January 1, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to secure a $10,000,000 loan (the “January 2014 Loan”). The
January 2014 Loan was provided by members of the Clay family, who are shareholders of the Company, including $7,500,000
provided by an investment vehicle managed by Thomas M. Clay, a Director and insider of the Company. The January 2014
Loan had a twelve-month term and an annual interest rate of 5%, payable on the maturity date.
The January 2014 Loan was repaid on a date that is less than 183 days before the maturity date. As a result, the Company
paid the Lenders an additional charge in the amount that is equivalent to 5% of the principal amount, plus interest on the
principal amount at the rate of 5% per annum accrued to the date the January 2014 Loan was repaid. The Company repaid
$7,500,000 loan plus the $375,000 accrued interest and $375,000 additional charge on December 31, 2014.
The remaining balance of the loan, $2,500,000, the accrued interest of $125,000 and the additional charge of $125,000, were
paid on January 5, 2015.
On December 31, 2014 the Company also entered into a new loan (the “December 2014 Loan”) with the same parties for an
amount of $12,500,000. The December 2014 Loan was due on demand on July 1, 2015 and bore an annual interest rate of
10% payable at the end of each quarter. The loan was guaranteed by GQM Holdings, and secured by a pledge of the
Company's interests in GQM Canada, GQM Canada’s interest in GQM Holdings and GQM Holdings' 50% interest in GQM
LLC.

Notes Payable - Continued
The Company also incurred a financing fee to secure the loan in the amount of $1,000,000, of which $750,000 was paid on
December 31, 2014 and the remaining $250,000 was paid on January 5, 2015. The Company agreed to pay the legal fees
incurred by the lenders relating to this instrument which amounted to $90,916. The total legal fees paid for the transaction were
$118,695. The Company also agreed to provide the lenders with the option for certain registration rights whereby the Company
would bear the costs and responsibility of registering the lenders common shares for the purposes of disposition subsequent to
July 1, 2015. The Company has determined it is unlikely the registration option would be exercised and therefore has not
accrued any potential costs related to the registration of the common shares. The Company has presented these transaction
costs as a contra liability as substantially all of these costs were paid to the lenders.
On June 8, 2015, the Company amended the December 2014 Loan to extend the maturity to December 8, 2016 and increased
the principal amount from $12,500,000 to $37,500,000 (the “June 2015 Loan”). The Company also issued 10,000,000 common
share purchase warrants exercisable for a period of five years expiring June 8, 2020. The common share purchase warrants
have an exercise price of $0.95. All other terms remained the same as the December 2014 Loan. The Company also incurred
a financing fee to secure the loan in the amount of $1,500,000, all of which was paid on June 8, 2015. The Company agreed to
pay the legal fees incurred by the lenders relating to this instrument which amounted to $46,408. The legal fees were
expensed as the transaction met the definition of a debt extinguishment. The terms of the registration rights remains
unchanged as does the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of the registration rights being exercised.
As such, as of June 30, 2016, no accrual has been made for the potential costs related to the registration rights.

Note 14 for complete details.
(iii)
Share Purchase Warrants
On June 8, 2015 the Company issued 10,000,000 share purchase warrants to the Clay family in connection with the June 2015
Loan. The share purchase warrants are exercisable until June 8, 2020 at an exercise price of $0.95. Included in the June 2015
Loan agreement was an anti-dilution provision. If the Company were to complete a financing at a share price lower than the
exercise price of the share purchase warrants, the exercise price of the share purchase warrants would be adjusted to match
the price at which the financing was completed.
The share purchase warrants meet the definition of a derivative liability instrument as the exercise price is not a fixed price as
described above. Therefore, the settlement feature does not meet the “fixed-for-fixed” criteria outlined in ASC 815-40-15.

Company is part of a related party group that, in its entirety, would meet the definition of a primary beneficiary.   Although no
individual variable interest holder individually meets the definition of a primary beneficiary in the absence of the related party
group, Golden Queen has determined it is considered the member of the related party group most closely associated with GQM
LLC.  As a result, the Company has consolidated 100% of the accounts of GQM LLC in these consolidated financial
statements, while presenting a non-controlling interest portion representing the 50% interest of Gauss in GQM LLC on its
balance sheet.  A portion of the non-controlling interest has been presented as temporary equity on the Company’s balance
sheet representing the initial value of the non-controlling interest that could potentially be redeemable by Gauss in the future.
The net assets of GQM LLC as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:
June 30, 2016  December 31, 2015

Included in the assets above, is $13,875,539 (December 31, 2015 - $31,531,853) in cash held as at June 30, 2016. The cash
in GQM LLC is directed specifically to fund working capital until the Project reaches positive cash flows. The liabilities of GQM
LLC do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary except in two situations. Please refer to notes 5 and
12 for details on the exceptions.
Non-Controlling Interest The carrying value of the non-controlling interest is adjusted for net income and loss, distributions and
contributions pursuant to ASC 810-10 based on the same percentage allocation used to calculate the initial book value of
temporary equity.

10.Financial Instruments
Fair Value Measurements
All financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs are expensed
when they are incurred, unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition of qualifying assets, in which case they are
added to the costs of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted
assets or liabilities;
Level 2
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially
the full term of the asset or liability;
Level 3
Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and
unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

Under fair value accounting, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value measurement of the financial instruments above use observable inputs
in option price models such as the binomial and the Black-Scholes valuation models.

13.Comparative Figures
Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation adopted for the current
year. The reclassifications had no impact on the net loss, comprehensive loss, deficit accumulated or the cash flows as
previously reported. Also see Note 16 for restatement of certain 2015 balances.
14.Subsequent Events
On July 1st, 2016, the Company was to make the quarterly interest payment on the June 2015 loan. In accordance with the
terms of the June 2015 loan agreement, the Company chose to exercise its right to add the interest owed on July1st, 2016 to
the principal balance of the June 2015 loan. The principal balance of the loan was accordingly increased by $1,013,346.
The Company completed a bought deal equity financing for gross proceeds of C$16.1 million in July. A total of 11,120,000
shares and 6,317,700 warrants were issued in conjunction with the equity financing. Each warrant entitles the holder to acquire
one additional common share of the Company at a price of C$2.00 per common share for a period of 3 years expiring July 25,
2019.
15.Prior Periods Financial Restatements
During the preparation of the deferred tax calculations for 2015 the Company found an accounting error in the calculation of the
deferred income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014. The accounting error related to the recognition of a deferred tax
liability resulting from the dilution gain recorded in additional paid-in capital from the JV transaction (Note 7(v)). The impact of
the error on the financial statements as at June 30, 2015 are presented below. There was no impact on the Company’s

The Soledad Mountain Project
Overview
The Company is an emerging gold and silver producer utilizing an open pit, heap leach operation on its Soledad Mountain
property, located just outside the town of Mojave in Kern County in southern California. The Soledad Mountain Project (the
“Project”) utilizes conventional open pit mining methods and the cyanide heap leach and Merrill-Crowe processes to recover
gold and silver from crushed, agglomerated ore.
The Company closed a joint venture transaction (the “Joint Venture Transaction”) with Gauss LLC (“Gauss”) pursuant to which
it sold 50% of its ownership in the Project for an investment of $110 million in September 2014. Gauss is a funding vehicle
owned by entities controlled by Leucadia National Corporation (NYSE: LUK) (“Leucadia”) and certain members of the Clay
family, a shareholder group which, at the time of the Joint Venture Transaction, collectively owned approximately 27% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Golden Queen (the “Clay Group”). Gauss is owned 70.51% by Gauss Holdings LLC (“Gauss
Holdings”, Leucadia’s investment entity) and 29.49% by Auvergne LLC (“Auvergne”, the Clay Group’s investment entity).
Golden Queen Mining Co., Inc. (“GQM Inc.”), a California corporation and the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was
converted into a limited liability company, Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC (“GQM LLC”) on September 10, 2014 in
preparation for the formation of the Joint Venture. Golden Queen Mining Holdings (“GQ Holdings”), the Company’s wholly-
owned subsidiary, now owns a 50% interest in GQM LLC and Gauss holds the remaining 50%.
Please refer to the Company’s Form 10-K dated March 30, 2016 for information on the Project and the Joint Venture
Transaction.
The Company commenced commissioning of the facilities in the last quarter of 2015. The first gold and silver doré was poured,
as part of the testing and commissioning process, on March 1, 2016. Testing and commissioning continued in March 2016 and
production commenced on April 1, 2016.
Commissioning of the Facilities
Commissioning of the crushing-screening plant commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015 as scheduled.  Leaching of the
agglomerated ore was initiated in early February and the commissioning of the Merrill-Crowe facility was completed mid-
February. A significant milestone was achieved when the inaugural gold and silver doré bar was poured on March 1, 2016.
The mining rate for ore was sufficient to supply the crushing and screening plant during the quarter. The crushing and
screening plant continued to be ramped up during the second quarter and 24-hour, 7-day per week operations commenced in
June. Irrigation rates of ore on the heap were at the upper level of anticipated flow. The Company anticipates achieving an
average throughput of 10,000-11,000 tons per day in the second half of 2016.
In accordance with US GAAP, the Company has begun recognizing revenues and expenses related to the sale of metals in the
second quarter of 2016.
Please refer to the Operating performance section below for further details.
23
Feasibility Study
The Company filed a technical report pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects
(“NI 43-101”) titled “Soledad Mountain Technical Report and Updated Feasibility Study” with an effective date of February 25,
2015 (the “Technical Report”) on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) on February 27, 2015
and the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (“EDGAR”) on March 2, 2015.
Please refer to the Company’s news release dated February 10, 2015 and Form 10-K dated March 30, 2016 for further details
on the Technical Report and updated feasibility study. The Technical Report and updated feasibility study are also available
on the Company’s website or on SEDAR.
The Center for Biodiversity Petition to List the Mohave Shoulderband Snail as an Endangered Species
On January 31, 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity (“CBD”) filed an emergency petition (the “Petition”) with the United
States Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”) asking the USFWS to list the Mohave Shoulderband snail as a threatened or
endangered species. Citing a report published more than 80 years ago, the Petition claims that the snail exists in only three
places and that most of the snail habitat occurs on Soledad Mountain, where the Company is developing the Project.
The Company worked with its environmental and legal advisors to prepare a detailed response to the petition, which was filed
with the USFWS on March 31, 2014. The Company’s response is available on the Company’s website at
www.goldenqueen.com.
On April 22, 2014, the Company learned that the USFWS had determined that there is no emergency to justify listing the
Mohave Shoulderband snail as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The
USFWS reviewed the petition filed by the CBD and concluded that there was no imminent threat to the snail that would cause
them to believe an emergency listing was required.
Even though an emergency listing was not warranted, the USFWS is required by the Endangered Species Act to continue
processing the listing petition. A public comment period on the petition commenced on April 10, 2015 for a period of 60 days.
On September 9, 2015, the USFWS and the CBD entered into a Stipulated Settlement Agreement that established a 12 Month
Finding date of April 11, 2016.
In November 2015, the Company, the USFWS, and the CBD entered into a Memorandum of Understanding under which the
USFWS and the CBD agreed to defer the 12 Month Finding date to June 30, 2017, and the Company agreed not to disturb
until June 30, 2017 certain points on Soledad Mountain where snails or snail shells had been identified. The Company, the
USFWS, and the CBD have jointly selected a third party environmental consultant that will conduct a survey to better
understand the snail’s range and distribution on Soledad Mountain before the USFWS prepares its 12 Month Finding.
Surveying is anticipated to take place between the fall of 2016 and the spring of 2017.
The Project has received all necessary regulatory approvals. The ongoing review by the USFWS does not affect the Project’s
regulatory approvals or interfere with the Project’s operation. The November 2015 Memorandum of Understanding caused no
material adjustments to the Project’s mine plan. The Company believes that conservation of the snail can be accomplished
without material adjustments to the Project’s mine plan, but if the USFWS ultimately finds that the snail is ‘endangered’ or
‘threatened’ and no agreed conservation plan is established, material adjustments to the Project’s mine plan may be required.
24
Other Legal Matters
National Labor Relations Board
The Company filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”) against the Building and Construction
Trades Council of Kern, Inyo, and Mono Counties (the “Union”) on May 23, 2014. The charge was in response to the action
taken by the Union related to a 1997 project labor agreement (PLA) that the Company believes is not applicable to the Project
and unenforceable under federal labor law.
The NLRB issued a Complaint against the Union and the matter was heard by an NLRB Administrative Law Judge resulting in
a December 2015finding by the judge that the PLA violates Section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act and is therefore
unenforceable. The Union has appealed that decision to the NLRB in Washington, D.C., and the North America’s Building
Trades Unions have filed an amicus curiae brief in support. The Company has filed its Responses to both briefs.
Results of Operations
The following are the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and the corresponding periods
ended June 30, 2015.
The Company had $3,464,093 revenue from operations during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
The Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $989,229 and $2,516,406 during the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $1,991,215 and $2,730,747 for the same periods in 2015. Costs were lower by
$1,001,986 and $214,341 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 when compared with the same periods in 2015.
The reasons for the variance in costs are highlighted below.
The following significant general and administrative expenses were incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 with a
comparison to costs incurred during the same period in 2015:
$532,349 (2015 - $615,322) for legal expenses. Legal costs were lower during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
·
compared to the same period in 2015 due to the legal fees related to the financing activities and the snail and union issues in
2015 (see Other Legal Matters section above).
$439,525 (2015 - $275,368) for audit, tax and accounting fees. Audit and accounting costs were higher during the six months
·
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to the increased complexity of the audit work as the
Soledad Mountain project advances and the additional costs relating to the calculations of the deferred tax liability.
25
$239,776 (2015 - $135,902) for insurance expenses. The insurance expense increase is related to the general increase in
·

complete and the Project is transitioning into the production phase.
$Nil (2015 - $201,312) for consulting expenses. The 2015 consulting fees were payments for the services provided by the
·
Company’s former CEO. The current CEO salary in now included under corporate salary.
$Nil (2015 - $108,545) for feasibility study expenses. The 2015 feasibility study expenses were related to the preparation of
·
the Company’s revised feasibility study, which was completed in February 2015.
The following significant general and administrative expenses were incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016
with a comparison to costs incurred during the same period in 2015:
$394,870 (2015 - $603,418) for corporate salary. The 2015 corporate salary expenses were greater during the second quarter
·
of 2015 when compared to the same period in 2016 as bonuses were paid during that period. The 2016 bonuses were paid
during the first quarter of 2016.
$136,387 (2015 - $95,385) for audit, tax and accounting fees. Audit and accounting costs were higher during the three months
·
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 mainly due to the increased complexity of the audit work and
additional costs related to the calculations of the deferred tax liability.
$115,820 (2015 - $72,713) for insurance expenses. The insurance expense increase is related to the general increase in
·
corporate and site activities. Enhanced insurance coverage is required because construction of the processing facilities is
complete and the Project is transitioning into the production phase.
$61,420 (2015 - $369,400) for legal expenses. Legal costs were significantly lower during the three months ended June 30,
·
2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to the legal fees related to the financing activities and the snail and union
issues in 2015. (see Other Legal Matters section above).
The Company experienced a net foreign exchange gain of $1,157 and a loss of $2,105 during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, as compared with a loss of $94,424 and a gain of $467,088 for the same period in 2015. The net foreign
exchange gain is made up by realized and unrealized gains and losses related to the Company’s Canadian expenditures, the
Canadian balances of cash, accounts payable and, in 2015, the convertible debentures. During the second quarter of 2015 the
net foreign exchange gain was mainly the result of the gain unrealized on the convertible debentures, which were
denominated in Canadian dollars while the Company’s functional currency is the US dollar. The exchange rate, stated in US
dollar per one Canadian dollar, moved from $0.72 as of December 31, 2015 to $0.77 on June 30, 2016.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred a total interest expense of $1,792,894 and
$2,554,465 respectively (three months ended June 30, 2015 - $1,070,111, six months ended June 30, 2015 – 2,017,864)
related to its various loans. The increase is mainly due to the amortization of the discount of the June 2015 loan and the fact
that the Company no longer capitalizes a portion of the interest payable. Please refer to the Transaction with Related Parties
section for a complete breakdown of the interest expenses.
During the second quarter of 2016 the amount of the Company’s derivative liability includes the warrants issued in conjunction
with the June 2015 Loan and the fair value of hedging instruments. During the second quarter of 2015 the Company’s
derivative liability included the convertible debentures and the warrants issued in conjunction with the June 2015 Loan. The
Company recorded a decrease in the derivative liability including foreign exchange of $1,135,233 mostly as a result of a
decrease in the Company’s share price during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a decrease of
$2,568,849 for the same quarter in 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded an increase in the
derivative liability including foreign exchange of $5,895,992 as a result of a significant increase in the Company’s share price
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to a decrease of $2,467,100 for the same period in 2015. Refer to
Notes 7(iii) and 8 of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for a detailed analysis of the changes
in fair value of the derivative liability.
Interest income of $43,373 (2015 - $52,383) was lower during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared with the
same period in 2015 due to a decrease in the cash balances. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the interest income was
$82,902 (2015 - $118,525) as compared with the same period in 2015 also due to a decrease in the cash balances. Interest
rates remained low during the second quarter and are projected to remain low for the remainder of 2016.
26
The Company recorded a net loss and comprehensive loss of $2,108,781* and $11,034,557* (or $0.02 and $0.09) loss per
basic share during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to net and comprehensive loss of $1,379,265*
and $2,815,451* (or $0.01 and $0.03) loss per basic share during the same period of 2015. The difference between the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is mainly due to the significant increase in the derivative liability related to the
Company’s warrants. The Company also recorded revenue for the first time during the second quarter of 2016, which was
more than off-set by the cost of sales as the mine ramps up production. The project was under construction in 2015 and most
site related costs were still being capitalized then.

* Net income (loss) for the period attributable to the Company
For the quarters illustrated in the above table, the main reasons for the significant fluctuations in net income (loss) between
periods are the fluctuations in the Company’s derivative liabilities, interest expense and the costs related to the Joint Venture
Transaction. The Company’s derivative liabilities are a function of the Company’s stock price as compared to the instruments’
strike price and the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar. As the stock price rises, the derivative
liabilities increase resulting in the Company recognizing losses. When the stock price decreases, the Company recognizes
gains.
For fiscal 2015, the Company experienced a loss related to its derivative liabilities in the amount of $101,749 (2014 – Loss of
$5,747,376) in the first quarter whereas it recorded a gain of $2,568,849 (2014 – Gain of $1,634,681) during the second
quarter. The second quarter gain was however off-set by higher interest expense and a one-time financing fee of $1,500,000
paid in connection with the June 2015 Loan. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company experienced a loss of $598,770 (2014 –
Gain of $2,861,314) related to the derivative liabilities. Adding to the losses for the three months ended September 30, 2015
were the interest expense and amortization of the discount on the June 2015 loan and the convertible debenture and the
interest expense related to the Komatsu loans. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company experienced a gain of $1,465,895
(2014 – Gain of $2,255,598) related to the derivative liabilities. This gain was partially off-set by interest expense and
amortization of the discount on the June 2015 loan and the interest expense related to the Komatsu loans.
27
For fiscal 2014, the Company experienced a significant loss related to its derivative liabilities in the amount of $5,747,376
(2013 – Gain of $611,949) in the first quarter whereas the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014 resulted in gains of
$1,634,681 (2013 – $1,672,861), $2,861,314 (2013 – $475,862) and $2,255,598 (2013 – $2,624,988), respectively. In addition
to the derivative liabilities, the Company also incurred in 2014 a commitment fee of $2,250,000 (2013 - $Nil) and a Joint
Venture Transaction fee of $2,275,000 (2013 - $Nil) in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 that were meaningful contributing factors
to the significant loss recognized in that quarter.  Both fees were one-time fees not previously incurred in earlier quarters or to
be incurred in future quarters.
In general, the results of operations can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the nature, timing and cost of activities
undertaken during the quarter, whether or not the Company incurs gains or losses on foreign exchange or grants stock options,
and the movements in its derivative liability.
Please refer to the Results of Operations section above for the results of operations for the three and six months ended on
June 30, 2016.
Reclamation Financial Assurance and Asset Retirement Obligation
Reclamation Financial Assurance
The Company is required to provide the Bureau of Land Management, the State Office of Mine Reclamation and Kern County
with a revised reclamation cost estimate annually. The financial assurance is adjusted once the cost estimate is approved. The
Company’s provision for reclamation of the property is estimated each year by an independent consulting engineer. This
estimate, once approved by state and county authorities, forms the basis for the reclamation financial assurance. The
reclamation assurance provided as at June 30, 2016 was $624,142 (December 31, 2015 - $624,142). This amount is expected
to increase to $1,460,496 during the third quarter of 2016.
The Company is also required to provide financial assurance with the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board (the
“Regional Board”) for closure and reclamation costs related to the lined impoundments, which are defined as the Stage 1 heap
leach pad, the overflow pond, and the solution collection channel. The reclamation financial assurance estimate for as of June
30, 2016 is $1,210,889 (December 31, 2015 - $Nil).
In addition to the above, the Company is required to obtain and maintain financial assurance for initiating and completing
corrective action and remediation of a reasonably foreseeable release from the Project’s waste management units as required
by the Regional Board. The reclamation financial assurance estimate as of June 30, 2016 is $278,240 (December 31, 2015 -
$278,240).
In January 2016, the Company entered into $2.1 million in surety bond agreements in order to release its reclamation deposits
and post a portion of the financial assurance due in 2016. The Company pays a yearly premium. Golden Queen Ltd. has
provided a corporate guarantee on the surety bonds.
Asset Retirement Obligation
The total asset retirement obligation as of June 30, 2016 is $1,171,845 (December 31, 2015 - $978,453).
The Company estimated its asset retirement obligations based on its understanding of the requirements to reclaim and clean-
up its property based on its activities to date.  During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, there was an increase of
$96,696 and $193,392 (Three and six months ended June 30, 2015 - $278,240 and $278,240) to the asset retirement
obligations.  Of the total, $74,167 and $170,863 was capitalized to property, plant, equipment and mineral interests as the
asset portion of the asset retirement obligation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 (Three and six months ended
June 30, 2015 - $278,240 and $278,240).   The remaining amount of $22,529 for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 was expensed to operations as accretion expense (Three and six months ended June 30, 2015 - $Nil and $Nil.
The Company estimates that the cash outflows related to these reclamation activities will be incurred primarily in 2028.  
Reclamation provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows discounted to their present value using a
credit adjusted risk-free interest rate and adjusted for inflation.  The Company used a credit adjusted risk-free rate of 9.20%
(December 31, 2015 – 9.20%) and an inflation rate of 2.27% (December 31, 2015 – 2.27%).
28
Property Rent Payments and Production Royalties
The Company has acquired a number of mineral properties outright. It has acquired exclusive rights to explore, develop and
mine other portions of the Project under various mining lease agreements with landowners.
The Company is required to make property rent payments related to its mining lease agreements with landholders, in the form
of advance minimum royalties. The total property rent payments for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were $167 and
$10,167 (three months ended June 30, 2015 – $50,167 and six months ended June 30, 3015 -$60,167), and the Company
expects to pay approximately $30,000 in property rent payments in 2016.
Production royalty payments commenced during the first quarter of 2016. The Company has paid $40,000 and $41,802 in
production royalties during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
There are multiple third party landholders and the royalty amount due to each landholder over the life of the Project varies with
each property.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Stock Option Plan
The Company’s current stock option plan (the “Plan”) was adopted by the Company in 2013 and approved by shareholders of
the Company in 2013. The Company also adopted a house keeping amendment to the plan on April 27, 2015 to clarify the
procedure for fixing the early termination date of stock options. The Plan provides a fixed number of 7,200,000 common shares
of the Company that may be issued pursuant to the grant of stock options. The exercise price of stock options granted under
the Plan shall be determined by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), but shall not be less than the volume-
weighted, average trading price of the Company’s shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) for the five trading days
immediately prior to the date of the grant. The expiry date of a stock option shall be the date so fixed by the Board subject to a
maximum term of five years. The Plan provides that the expiry date of the vested portion of a stock option will be the earlier of
the date so fixed by the Board at the time the stock option is awarded and the early termination date (the “Early Termination
Date”). The Early Termination Date will be the date the vested portion of a stock option expires following the option holder
ceasing to be a director, employee or consultant, as determined by the Board at the time of grant, or in the absence thereof at
any time prior to the time the option holder ceases to be a director, employee or consultant, in accordance with and subject to
the provisions of the Plan. All options granted under the 2013 Plan will be subject to such vesting requirements as may be
prescribed by the TSX, if applicable, or as may be imposed by the Board.
29
A total of 1,070,000 (976,667 exercisable) (December 31, 2015 – 1,070,000 (976,667 exercisable); June 30, 2015 – 700,000
(700,000 exercisable)) common shares were issuable pursuant to such stock options as at June 30, 2016.
Transactions with Related Parties
Except as noted elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, related party transactions are disclosed as follows:
(i)
Consulting Fees
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company paid $Nil and $188,934 to Mr. H. Lutz Klingmann for services
as President of the Company. Included in these consulting fees was $151,428 related to 150,000 bonus shares (Refer to Note
4 – Share Capital). There were no consulting fees paid during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company paid a total of $27,703 and $56,238 (Three and six
months ended June 30, 2015 - $18,414 and $36,852) to the three independent directors of the Company. During the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015, Thomas M. Clay did not received director fees.
(ii)
Notes Payable
On January 1, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to secure a $10,000,000 loan (the “January 2014 Loan”). The
January 2014 Loan was provided by members of the Clay family, who are shareholders of the Company, including $7,500,000
provided by an investment vehicle managed by Thomas M. Clay, a Director and insider of the Company. The January 2014
Loan had a twelve-month term and an annual interest rate of 5%, payable on the maturity date.
The January 2014 Loan was repaid on a date that is less than 183 days before the maturity date. As a result, the Company
paid the Lenders an additional charge in the amount that is equivalent to 5% of the principal amount, plus interest on the
principal amount at the rate of 5% per annum accrued to the date the January 2014 Loan was repaid. The Company repaid
$7,500,000 loan plus the $375,000 accrued interest and $375,000 additional charge on December 31, 2014.
The remaining balance of the loan, $2,500,000, the accrued interest of $125,000 and the additional charge of $125,000, were
paid on January 5, 2015.
On December 31, 2014 the Company also entered into a new loan (the “December 2014 Loan”) with the same parties for an
amount of $12,500,000. The December 2014 Loan was due on demand on July 1, 2015 and bore an annual interest rate of
10% payable at the end of each quarter. The loan was guaranteed by GQM Holdings, and secured by a pledge of the
Company's interests in GQM Canada, GQM Canada’s interest in GQM Holdings and GQM Holdings' 50% interest in GQM
LLC. The Company also incurred a financing fee to secure the loan in the amount of $1,000,000, of which $750,000 was paid
on December 31, 2014 and the remaining $250,000 was paid on January 5, 2015. The Company agreed to pay the legal fees
incurred by the lenders relating to this instrument which amounted to $90,916. The total legal fees paid for the transaction were
$118,695. The Company also agreed to provide the lenders with the option for certain registration rights whereby the Company
would bear the costs and responsibility of registering the lenders common shares for the purposes of disposition subsequent to
July 1, 2015. The Company has determined it is unlikely the registration option would be exercised and therefore has not
accrued any potential costs related to the registration of the common shares. The Company has presented these transaction
costs as a contra liability as substantially all of these costs were paid to the lenders.
On June 8, 2015, the Company amended the December 2014 Loan to extend the maturity to December 8, 2016 and increased
the principal amount from $12,500,000 to $37,500,000 (the “June 2015 Loan”). The Company also issued 10,000,000 common
share purchase warrants exercisable for a period of five years expiring June 8, 2020. The common share purchase warrants
have an exercise price of $0.95. All other terms remained the same as the December 2014 Loan. The Company also incurred
a financing fee to secure the loan in the amount of $1,500,000, all of which was paid on June 8, 2015. The Company agreed to
pay the legal fees incurred by the lenders relating to this instrument which amounted to $46,408. The legal fees were
expensed as the transaction met the definition of a debt extinguishment. The terms of the registration rights remain unchanged
as does the Company’s assessment of the likelihood of the registration rights being exercised.
30
As such, as of June 30, 2016, no accrual has been made for the potential costs related to the registration rights.

the subsequent events details.
(iii)
Share Purchase Warrants
On June 8, 2015 the Company issued 10,000,000 share purchase warrants to the Clay family in connection with the June 2015
Loan. The share purchase warrants are exercisable until June 8, 2020 at an exercise price of $0.95. Included in the June 2015
Loan agreement was an anti-dilution provision. If the Company were to complete a financing at a share price lower than the
exercise price of the share purchase warrants, the exercise price of the share purchase warrants would be adjusted to match
the price at which the financing was completed.
The share purchase warrants meet the definition of a derivative liability instrument as the exercise price is not a fixed price as
described above. Therefore, the settlement feature does not meet the “fixed-for-fixed” criteria outlined in ASC 815-40-15.
The fair value of the derivative liability related to the share purchase warrants as at June 30, 2016 is $8,072,628 (December
31, 2015 - $2,498,269). The derivative liability was calculated using an option pricing valuation model with the following
assumptions:

Joint Venture Transaction
Variable Interest Entity
In accordance with ASC 810-10-30, the Company has determined that GQM LLC meets the definition of a VIE and that the
Company is part of a related party group that, in its entirety, would meet the definition of a primary beneficiary.   Although no
individual variable interest holder individually meets the definition of a primary beneficiary in the absence of the related party
group, Golden Queen has determined it is considered the member of the related party group most closely associated with GQM
LLC.  As a result, the Company has consolidated 100% of the accounts of GQM LLC in these consolidated financial
statements, while presenting a non-controlling interest portion representing the 50% interest of Gauss in GQM LLC on its
balance sheet.  A portion of the non-controlling interest has been presented as temporary equity on the Company’s balance
sheet representing the initial value of the non-controlling interest that could potentially be redeemable by Gauss in the future.

Mining
A total of 660K tons of ore has been mined during the second quarter with a strip ratio of 1.8:1 waste to ore. A total of
951K tons of ore has now been mined since January 2016 with a strip ratio of 2.3:1 waste to ore. The lower stripping
ratio, when compared to the mine plan for the first half of 2016, is due to more ore at a slightly lower grade
encountered on all benches mined thus far in the Northwest Area and in the Main Pit Phase-1. This has resulted in
more ore and less waste available for mining. Seven-day per week operations started in the Mining function in June.
North West Pit: The mining of the North West Pit commenced in 2015 and the waste rock is being used to construct
the East Pit access road. Mining of the North West Pit will continue for the remainder of the year.
Main Pit: Mining of the Main Pit, phase 1, commenced in early January of this year.  Mining of the Main pit will continue
into 2017.
Reconciliation of benches mined in the North West Pit and Main Pit in the quarter showed an average of 27% more ore
with 5% lower Au grade, yielding 21% more Au than the 2016 Mine Plan (based on the current Block Model quantities).
The foregoing ore quantities and grades are based on the results of mining activity to date, and may not necessarily
be indicative of future results.
East Pit: The development of the East Pit access road is advancing on schedule. Bench mining started in the East Pit
in June for waste and overburden. An in-fill drilling program of the East Pit will commence in mid-July. The $960,000
drilling program is expected to confirm the current mineral reserve and resources located in the East Pit and will be
used to optimize the mine planning for the next 5 years. The Company anticipates that ore mining in the East Pit will
begin in March 2017.
34
Processing and Production
The Company has made steady progress with the production rate of the crushing-screening plant and the pad-
loading systems. HPGR performance continues to exceed expectations. The hourly throughput of the plant, when
operating, was above the design rate and exceeded an average of 750 tons per hour. Run-time continues to improve
but was hampered by higher than expected wear on some components. The daily average throughput for placing ore
on the pad was 8,852 tons per scheduled operating day for the quarter and 8,744 tons per day in June. Seven-day per
week operations started in the Process function in June.
At the end of June, 1,007,765 tons, loaded in 2016, were under leach on the heap-leach pad. Agglomerate quality was
excellent in Q2’16 and the porosity and permeability of the heap-leach pad are high. The Company forecasts the 150-
day recovery of the first pad lift to be approximately 70% to 75%.
The average grade of ore processed during Q2 2016 was 0.013 oz/t Au and 0.40 oz/t Ag. A total of 8,636 gold ounces
and 261,021 silver ounces were placed on the heap leach pad during the second quarter.
Au production commenced in April 2016. GQM LLC produced 2,827 gold ounces and 33,346 silver ounces during Q2
2016.
Cost of sales
The Project is still in the ramp-up phase and it is anticipated that operating costs will decrease when we reach name
plate throughput later in 2016.
Mining costs averaged $1.60 per ton mined during the second quarter of 2016. The unit costs were somewhat higher
than anticipated due to the lower than anticipated tonnage moved during the quarter. However, the unit cost per ton
placed on the pad was lower than anticipated due to the lower than expected stripping ratio. Equipment availability
was high, leading to lower overall cost.
Processing costs averaged $4.74 per ton processed during the second quarter of 2016. The Processing unit costs
were higher than anticipated due to the lower tonnage loaded on the pad. Higher actual costs were also due to greater
than anticipated wear in some parts of the process plant.
Site support, maintenance and site G&A averaged $2.62 per ton processed during the second quarter of 2016. G&A
costs were on target but some support costs were higher due to the start-up. Maintenance costs were higher in the
process due to the wear and start-up.
Total site operating costs averaged $11.94 per ton processed during the second quarter of 2016.
Cash costs per ounces of gold sold were $1,580/oz net of silver by-product. The Project is still in the ramp-up phase,
and cash costs are expected to decrease as gold production increases. Please refer to Non-GAAP Financial
Performance Measures section below for further details.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has generated $3,464,093 revenue from operations since inception and as at June 30, 2016 had an
accumulated deficit of $90,977,661 and a working capital deficit of $29,001,254. Cash used in operations for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 was $7,056,661.
As at June 30, 2016, Golden Queen, on a non-consolidated basis, currently does not have sufficient funds to repay the
$37,500,000 loan plus the accrued interest. However, in order to secure the necessary funds to meet this upcoming
obligation and mitigate the going concern issue, management is actively exploring several options including debt
financing and equity issuance.
Subsequent to the quarter-end, the Company completed an equity financing and raised gross proceeds of C$16.1
million. The net proceeds of C$15.0 million will be used to repay a portion of the loan.
While Golden Queen has been successful at certain of these efforts in the past, there can be no assurance that future
efforts will be successful. This raises substantial doubt about this entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
At the Project level, GQM LLC has sufficient funds to meet its contractual obligations for the next 12 months.
The Company’s access to the net assets of GQM LLC is determined by the Board of Managers of GQM LLC. The
Board of Managers is not controlled by the Company and therefore there is no guarantee that any access to the net
assets of GQM LLC would be provided to the Company in order to continue as a going concern. The Board of
Managers of GQM LLC determine when and if distributions from GQM LLC are made to the holders of its membership
units at their sole discretion.
36
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.
The Company’s 50%-owned subsidiary, GQM LLC, which holds the Company’s interest in the Soledad Mountain
project, held $13,875,539 in cash as of June 30, 2016 as compared to $71,275,286 on June 30, 2015. It is expected that
the current cash on hand will fund remaining working capital needs until later in 2016 when the Project is expected to
reach positive cash flow.
Cash used in Operating Activities:
Cash used to fund operating activities, was $7,056,661 (six months ended June 30, 2015 - $4,196,935) for the six
months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in cash used in operating activities is mostly due to the increase in activity
on site as the company started the commissioning of its facilities during the first quarter of 2016.
Cash used in Investing Activities:
The Company began capitalizing all development expenditures directly related to the Project in July 2012. Prior to July
2012, all Project-related expenditures were expensed due to uncertainties around obtaining the necessary approvals
for proceeding with the Project.
Cash used in investing activities totaled $9,387,028 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 (six months ended
June 30, 2015 - $34,738,762). The decrease is due to the decreased level of construction activity on site as the Project
construction was finalized.
The significant development costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 included the completion of the
crushing-screening plant facilities, the conveying and stacking system, the Merrill-Crowe plant and the water and
power supply.
Cash from Financing Activities:
Cash used in financing activities totaled $2,477,503 during the six months ended June 30, 2016 (six months ended
June 30, 2015 – cash provided by financing activities $33,250,000). The cash used in financing activities for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 relates to the repayments of loans payable at the project level. The April 1, 2016 interest
payment due on the June 2015 Loan of $988,696 has been added to the principal balance. The cash provided by
financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was the result of the June 2015 Loan and our JV partner’s
Top-Up contribution.

As at June 30, 2016, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had current assets of $27,490,809 (December 31, 2015 -
$39,979,225) and current liabilities of $56,492,063 (December 31, 2015 - $47,722,334) or working capital deficit of
$29,001,254 (December 31, 2015 – working capital deficit of $7,743,109). The decrease in current assets from
December 31, 2015 is mostly the result of construction and working capital expenditures on site. The increase in
current liabilities is mainly due to the increase in the derivative liability.
37
GQM LLC will use its cash on hand for working capital related expenditures until later in 2016 when the Project is
expected to be generating positive cash flows.
Golden Queen Mining Co. Ltd will use its cash for general corporate expenditures such as accounting fees, legal fees,
interest expense and corporate salary expenses.

The Company is evaluating its options, including debt financing and equity issuance, to refinance the June 2015 Loan
which matures on December 8, 2016. The Company has raised gross proceeds of C$16.1 million in July to repay a
portion of the loan.
The ability of the Company to operate a mine on the property is subject to numerous risks, certain of which are
disclosed in the Company’s latest Form 10-K filing with the SEC, dated March 30, 2016. Readers should evaluate the
Company’s prospects in light of these and other risk factors.
Mineral Interests
In July 2012, the Company received notice that it had met all remaining major conditions of the conditional use permits
for the Project. As a result, Management made the decision to begin capitalizing all development expenditures related
to the Project while all other expenses not related to the development of the project continue to be expensed as
incurred. Refer also to Note 3 Property, Plant, Equipment and Mineral Interests of the unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements for a more detailed discussion.
Subsequent Events
On July 1st, 2016, the Company was to make the quarterly interest payment on the June 2015 loan. In accordance with
the terms of the June 2015 loan agreement, the Company chose to exercise its right to add the interest owed on July
1st, 2016 to the principal balance of the June 2015 loan. The principal balance of the loan was accordingly increased
by $1,013,346.
The Company completed a bought deal equity financing for gross proceeds of C$16.1 million in July. A total of
11,120,000 shares and 6,317,700 warrants were issued in conjunction with the equity financing. Each warrant entitles
the holder to acquire one additional common share of the Company at a price of C$2.00 per common share for a
period of 3 years expiring July 25, 2019.

Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures
Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard
meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles. These measures should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Total Cash Costs
Total cash costs are common financial performance measures in the gold mining industry but with no standard
meaning under US GAAP. Management believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance
with US GAAP, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow.
Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The measure, along with sales, is
considered to be a key indicator of a Company’s ability to generate earnings and cash flow from its mining operations.
Total cash cost figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by The Gold Institute, which was a
worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading North American gold producers.
The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, but the standard is the accepted standard of reporting cash cost of
production in North America. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies may calculate these measures
differently. Total cash costs are derived from amounts included in the statement of operations and include direct
mining costs and site general and administrative costs. The direct mining costs shown on the table below include
mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, smelting, refining, third party transportation costs, advanced
minimum royalties and production costs less silver metals revenues. Management has determined that silver metals
revenues when compared with gold metals revenues, are immaterial and therefore are considered a by-product of the
production of gold. The table below shows a reconciliation of total cash costs per gold ounce and cash costs per gold
ounce on a by-product basis:

All-in Sustaining Costs
In June 2013, the World Gold Council, a non-regulatory association of the world’s leading gold mining companies
established to promote the use of gold to industry, consumers and investors, provided guidance for the calculation of
the measure “All-in sustaining costs”, which has no standard meaning under US GAAP. These standards became
effective January 1, 2014. Management believes that the all-in sustaining costs measure provides additional insight
into the costs of producing gold by capturing all of the expenditures required for the discovery, development and
sustaining of gold production and allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures to sustain
future production from the generation of operating cash flows. Management believes that, in addition to conventional
measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance
and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP.
Golden Queen defines all-in sustaining costs as the sum of direct mining costs (as defined under total cash costs),
site general and administrative costs, capital expenditures that are sustaining in nature, and reclamation liability
accretion. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

accounting principles in the United Stated can be found in notes of its audited consolidated financial statements as at
December 31, 2015.
Recent Accounting Standards
(i)
Effective August 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards update (“ASU”) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements –
Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40 –Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The
update essentially requires management of all entities, for annual and interim periods, to evaluate whether there are
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued.
If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, but the
substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management’s plans, the entity should disclose
information that enables users of the financial statements to understand all of the following:
1.
Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern (before
consideration of management’s plans).
Management’s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entity’s ability to meet its
2.
obligations.
3.Management’s plans that alleviated substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, and substantial
doubt is not alleviated after consideration of management’s plans, an entity should include a statement in the
footnotes indicating that there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).
This update will come into effect for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and
interim periods thereafter. The Company is assessing the impact of this standard.
(ii)
In February, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) – Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
which focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations (public and private companies and not-for-profit
organizations) that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In addition to reducing the
number of consolidation models from four to two, the new standard simplifies the standards and improves current GAAP by:
Placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. A reporting organization may no
·
longer have to consolidate a legal entity in certain circumstances based solely on its fee arrangement, when certain criteria
are met.
40
Reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a
·
variable interest entity (VIE).
Changing consolidation conclusions for public and private companies in several industries that typically make use of limited
·
partnerships or VIEs.
The ASU will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015, for public companies. Early adoption is
permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company will adopt the ASU effective January 1, 2016.
(iii)
In January 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Recognition and measurement of financial assets
and financial liabilities (Subtopic 825-10) which updates several aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments that are relevant to the Company are as follows:
1.
2.
Eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate
the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet.
Require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for
disclosure purposes.
Require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial
asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial
statements.
3.
The ASU will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017, for public companies. The Company is
assessing the impact of this standard.
(iv)
In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Subtopic 718) which updates several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of
awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
The ASU will be effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, for public companies. The Company is
assessing the impact of this standard.
(v)
In May 2014, ASU 2014-09 was issued related to revenue from contracts with customers. The ASU was further amended in
August 2015, March 2016, April 2016, and May 2016 by ASU 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10 and 2016-12. The new standard
provides a five-step approach to be applied to all contracts with customers and also requires expanded disclosures about
revenue recognition.
In August 2015, the effective date was deferred to reporting periods, including interim periods, beginning after
December 31, 2017, and will be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating this guidance and the impact it will have on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
Qualified Person and Caution With Respect to Forward-looking Statements
Mr. Sean Ennis, P. Eng., P.E. is a qualified person for the purposes of NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the
technical information in this Form 10-Q.
This Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements, which relate to the intent, belief and current expectations
of the Company’s management, as well as assumptions and parameters used in the feasibility study referenced in this
report. These forward-looking statements are based upon numerous assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties
and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking
statements. Such factors include among other things the receipt and compliance with the terms of required approvals
and permits, the costs of and availability of sufficient capital to fund the projects to be undertaken by the Company
and commodity prices. In addition, projected mining results, including quantity of ore, grade, production rates, and
recovery rates, are subject to numerous risks normally associated with mining activity of the nature described in this
report and in the feasibility study, and as a result actual results may differ substantially from projected results.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
the statements were made.

Caution to U.S. Investors
Management advises U.S. investors that while the terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources” and “inferred
resources” are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize these terms. U.S.
investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the material in the mineral resource categories will be
converted into mineral reserves. References to such terms are contained in the Company’s Form 10-K and other
publicly available filings. We further advise U.S. investors that the mineral reserve estimates disclosed in this report
have been prepared in accordance with Canadian regulations and may not qualify as “reserves” under the SEC
Industry Guide 7. Accordingly, information concerning mineral resources and reserves set forth herein may not be
comparable with information presented by companies using only U.S. standards in their public disclosure.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the Company by
failing to discharge its obligations. To mitigate exposure to credit risk on financial assets the Company has
established policies to ensure liquidity of funds and ensure counterparties demonstrate minimum acceptable credit
worthiness.
The Company maintains its US Dollar and Canadian Dollar cash in bank accounts with major financial institutions with
high credit standings. Cash deposits held in the United States are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000 and
Canadian Dollar cash deposits held in Canada are insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (“CDIC”) for
up to C$100,000.
Certain United States and Canadian bank accounts held by the Company exceed these federally insured limits or are
uninsured as they relate to US Dollar deposits held in Canadian financial institutions. As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the Company’s cash balances held in United States and Canadian financial institutions include
$18,666,119 and $37,587,311 respectively, which are not fully insured by the FDIC or CDIC. The Company has not
experienced any losses on such accounts and management believes that using major financial institutions with high
credit ratings mitigates the credit risk in cash.
Interest Rate Risk
The interest rates received on these balances may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on the
average cash balances during the three months ending June 30, 2016, a 1% decrease in interest rates would have
reduced the interest income to a trivial amount.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Certain labour costs are denominated in Canadian dollars. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact
the costs of our operations. Specifically, the appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar may result in
an increase in the Canadian operating expenses in U.S. dollar terms. As of June 30, 2016, the Company maintained
the majority of its cash balance in U.S. dollars.
Commodity Price Risk
The Company’s primary business activity is the development of the open pit, gold and silver, heap leach project on
the Property. Decreases in the price of either of these metals from current levels has the potential to negatively impact
the future viability of the Project. The Company holds a small portfolio of derivative contracts in the form of gold zero-
cost collars in order to hedge against the gold spot price volatility risk. A 10% change in the gold spot price would
have a trivial impact on the change in the fair value of the derivative contracts held by the Company. The Company
may enter into hedging contracts from time to time to protect the cash flows from commodity price volatility.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The term “disclosure controls and procedures” is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.
These rules refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It is management’s
responsibility to establish and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures.
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and our external Sarbanes-Oxley consultants carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016 and concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were operating effectively.
Changes in Internal Control
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
