<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 15 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The review of Mongolia was held at the 4th meeting, on 5 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Mongolia was headed by Mr. Tsogoo Uugangerel. At its 10th meeting, held 
</p>
<p>on 8 May 2015, the Working Group adopted the report on Mongolia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Mongolia: Cuba, Sierra Leone, and the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents 
</p>
<p>were issued for the review of Mongolia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MNG/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MNG/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/MNG/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Liechtenstein, Mexico, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Mongolia through the 
</p>
<p>troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Mongolia stated that the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>recommendations would serve as a soft law, a self-monitoring system for the Government, 
</p>
<p>and an instrument for civil society organizations to demand effective implementation from 
</p>
<p>the Government. 
</p>
<p>6. Mongolia, following the first the universal periodic review, adopted an action plan 
</p>
<p>for the implementation of recommendations. Private, public, and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organization (NGO) stakeholders all contributed their best efforts to the successful 
</p>
<p>implementation of the plan and recommendations. The efforts of such collaboration were 
</p>
<p>incorporated into the mid-term voluntary report submitted to the Human Rights Council in 
</p>
<p>May 2014. The delegation of Mongolia highlighted a forum that consolidated more than 40 
</p>
<p>human rights NGOs that carried out sustainable activities to improve the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation in Mongolia. This experience of cooperation with NGOs in Mongolia was 
</p>
<p>illustrative of how the universal periodic review facilitated the strengthening of mutual 
</p>
<p>understanding and confidence between governmental agencies and human rights NGOs.  
</p>
<p>7. In 2012, Mongolia acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty. In 
</p>
<p>2014, Mongolia ratified the International Convention for the protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment as reflected in 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first universal periodic review, and voluntary pledges made by 
</p>
<p>Mongolia as a 2015 Election Candidate to the Human Rights Council.  </p>


<p>8. Since the submission of the national report for the second cycle of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, the State of Great Khural (Parliament) of Mongolia had ratified in April 
</p>
<p>the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications 
</p>
<p>procedure, and in May, the Minamata Convention on Mercury. Furthermore, domestic 
</p>
<p>ratification of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 176 concerning 
</p>
<p>Safety and Health in Mines and the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court is expected to be completed this year.  
</p>
<p>9. Following the commencement in 2012 of a comprehensive legal reform, Mongolia 
</p>
<p>enacted a number of laws and regulations aimed at ensuring human rights. As part of this 
</p>
<p>process, the Parliament of Mongolia was considering draft laws in the field of criminal law 
</p>
<p>that included a revised Criminal Code. The delegation of Mongolia noted there was a 
</p>
<p>lengthy time process for the reform to enjoy public support, be transparent, and be subject 
</p>
<p>to independent monitoring, and adequate human and financial resources.  
</p>
<p>10. In response to an advanced question concerning the death penalty, Mongolia 
</p>
<p>reiterated its support for the abolition of the death penalty. On 14 January 2010, the 
</p>
<p>President of Mongolia declared a moratorium and granted a pardon to all persons sentenced 
</p>
<p>to death prior to the moratorium. In the draft Criminal Code that was currently under 
</p>
<p>parliamentary review, the death penalty was excluded from the classification of criminal 
</p>
<p>punishment.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation of Mongolia said it was confident that, with the ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 2014, the introduction of concurrent monitoring by 
</p>
<p>the Sub-Committee on Prevention of Torture, and the National Preventive Mechanism, a 
</p>
<p>tangible process in preventing torture, as well as holding perpetrators liable, would be 
</p>
<p>established. Furthermore, the National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia, based on 
</p>
<p>the relevant laws of Mongolia and its independent status from the Government, would be 
</p>
<p>assigned the functions of the national preventive mechanism in compliance with the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol. The delegation further acknowledged that the current definition of 
</p>
<p>torture did not include all forms of torture in compliance with article 1 of the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture; however, the draft Criminal Code under parliamentary review provided a 
</p>
<p>definition of torture, as well as applicable liability sanctions in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>Convention. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation acknowledged criticism by civil society organizations concerning the 
</p>
<p>disbandment of the Special Investigation Unit of the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, and the 
</p>
<p>allocation of its functions to the Anti-Corruption Authority and Police according to the 
</p>
<p>nature of the crime. Moreover, it was noted that victims of torture enjoyed the right to be 
</p>
<p>compensated for both material and moral damage caused by unlawful acts of the 
</p>
<p>investigator, prosecutor or judge.  
</p>
<p>13. A cluster of new laws focusing on the judiciary were adopted in 2013 to strengthen 
</p>
<p>the right to a fair and independent trial. These included the separation by law of court 
</p>
<p>administration and court procedure, which ensured that judges were free from 
</p>
<p>administration management and its influence. Moreover, all court hearings were recorded 
</p>
<p>as they were equipped with video and audio surveillance. Court decisions were published 
</p>
<p>on the court&#8217;s website with the exception of closed court hearings as required by law, 
</p>
<p>enabling access for all stakeholders to analyse and review court decisions, the application 
</p>
<p>of laws, and the exercise of the rights of the case participants in the court hearings. 
</p>
<p>Measures were also being taken to gradually increase the salaries of judges.  
</p>
<p>14. In response to an advanced question regarding human trafficking, the delegation 
</p>
<p>explained that in 2012 the Law on Combatting Human Trafficking was enacted. In addition 
</p>
<p>to concluding bilateral agreements on cooperation to combat crimes of human trafficking </p>


<p>with different countries, in 2013 Mongolia enacted regulations to provide assistance to 
</p>
<p>citizens who became victims of human trafficking abroad.  
</p>
<p>15. The 2011 Law on Gender Equality contained several provisions for protecting and 
</p>
<p>promoting the rights of women, including the prohibition of all forms of discrimination 
</p>
<p>against women in the political, economic, social and family domains, as well as the 
</p>
<p>introduction of a quota requirement for women&#8217;s participation at the decision-making level 
</p>
<p>of the ministries, agencies and local governing organizations. The delegation of Mongolia 
</p>
<p>noted significant achievement and progress in gender equality since the enactment of this 
</p>
<p>law. Furthermore, prior to and during the legislative process of the Law, Mongolia 
</p>
<p>organized public awareness activities and campaigns. An example of the positive outcome 
</p>
<p>of both the enactment of the Law and the awareness raising campaigns was the increased 
</p>
<p>number of complaints related to sexual harassment in workplaces that were received by the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission and then transferred to the law enforcement agencies 
</p>
<p>for investigation.  
</p>
<p>16. Mongolia established a National Committee on Gender Equality led by the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister, whose functions included the implementation of the Law and Mid-term 
</p>
<p>Implementation Programme, in addition to 49 Gender subcommittees that oversaw the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Law in ministries, agencies, and local governing organizations.  
</p>
<p>17. The delegation of Mongolia discussed the 20 per cent quota requirement for women 
</p>
<p>candidacy in the Parliament Election Law, and currently there were 11 women 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians. There was an ongoing campaign to legislate a 30 per cent quota for 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s candidacy in Parliament and local elections. Also, 38 per cent of 1,300 business 
</p>
<p>enterprises that were members of the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and 
</p>
<p>Industry were managed by women CEOs.  
</p>
<p>18. In response to an advanced question concerning domestic violence, the delegation 
</p>
<p>explained numerous measures that had been taken to combat domestic violence, such as a 
</p>
<p>draft law on Combating Domestic Violence that was currently under review by the State of 
</p>
<p>Great Khural. Moreover, in an effort to help victims of domestic violence, various measures 
</p>
<p>were taken, including a shelter for victims of domestic violence established in Ulaanbaatar 
</p>
<p>in 2014, in addition to shelter facilities established in seven provinces from 2013 to 2014; 
</p>
<p>three One-stop Service Centres that provided medical, psychological, and legal services and 
</p>
<p>counselling in Ulaanbaatar and one in Zavkhan Province; and the operation of a 107 and 
</p>
<p>108 hotline for emergency assistance to domestic violence victims. A police unit was also 
</p>
<p>established to prevent and investigate child abuse and domestic violence, in addition to 
</p>
<p>releasing statistics on domestic violence to the public.  
</p>
<p>19. The delegation of Mongolia highlighted the revised Law on Health and a Law on 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 
</p>
<p>were adopted in 2011 and 2012 respectively. These laws ban any restriction of human 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms due to HIV infection or AIDS and prohibit all forms of discrimination 
</p>
<p>against such persons.  
</p>
<p>20. The delegation noted that child labour and corporal punishment still remained issues 
</p>
<p>in Mongolia. The National Programme on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour 
</p>
<p>was enacted in 2011, and in the new draft Labour Code there were provisions to prohibit 
</p>
<p>labour for those under the age of 15.  
</p>
<p>21. The delegation of Mongolia explained that there were no official records of 
</p>
<p>complaints received by the police regarding discrimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
</p>
<p>transgender (LGBT) people and on alleged mistreatment and dismissal of their complaints 
</p>
<p>by law enforcement and supervisory bodies. Nonetheless, greater attention was still 
</p>
<p>necessary to ensure the effective implementation of recommendations made by relevant 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies and the National Human Rights Commission on the rights of LGBT people in </p>


<p>areas of education, employment and health services, and other issues necessary in 
</p>
<p>upholding their human rights.  
</p>
<p>22. In order to improve safety and health standards in the mining industry, the 
</p>
<p>delegation reported that the Government had drafted and submitted to Parliament 
</p>
<p>amendments to the Law on Labour Safety and Health. Moreover, a subcommittee was 
</p>
<p>established to address safety and health issues in the geology, mining and petroleum 
</p>
<p>sectors, in addition to developing comprehensive regulations on the safety in open-pit, 
</p>
<p>underground mining, concentrator and explosive activities.  
</p>
<p>23. The delegation of Mongolia acknowledged that there had been cases of illegal and 
</p>
<p>unsafe use of mercury in mining, but various measures, such as the inspection for illegal 
</p>
<p>use of chemicals, had been carried out nationwide. In 2014, a national standard on 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercury poisoning diagnosis and treatment&#8221; was introduced. However, Mongolia 
</p>
<p>explained that there was still a need to bring medical services closer to the sites of small 
</p>
<p>and artisanal mining.  
</p>
<p>24. The delegation highlighted the importance of achieving a balance between the 
</p>
<p>development of the agriculture and mining sectors. Due to the high priority of the issue of 
</p>
<p>compensation by the Government, an intersectoral working group was established to 
</p>
<p>develop a proposal on improving a system of compensation and protecting the right of 
</p>
<p>herders who were at risk of losing their pasture land or winter quarters due to exploration 
</p>
<p>and mining activities. However, the Government was limited with regard to intervening 
</p>
<p>directly, such as in the assessment of the monetary value of the privately owned winter 
</p>
<p>quarters.  
</p>
<p>25. An issue of increasing concern, in conjunction with the development of the mining 
</p>
<p>industry, was water supply. The delegation noted numerous measures taken regarding the 
</p>
<p>efficient use of water resources, protection and conservation of the supply of drinking water 
</p>
<p>for local communities, water safety and security. In addition, a specific law was enacted 
</p>
<p>prohibiting mining activities within certain boundaries, and 650 water springs were taken 
</p>
<p>under protection as per the National Programme on Water in 2010.  
</p>
<p>26. A critical issue for the city of Ulaanbaatar was air pollution, as 40 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>population resided there. The Clean Air Fund made an investment of 88.82 billion togrogs </p>
<p>(US$ 45 million) to reduce air pollution.  
</p>
<p>27. The Constitution, as well as the Land Law, prohibited the forced removal of citizens 
</p>
<p>from their privately owned land and then expropriating the land. The <i>ger</i>-district 
</p>
<p>redevelopment project had been implemented in 24 locations since 2013, and included the 
</p>
<p>participation and engagement of all relevant stakeholders during redevelopment and land 
</p>
<p>acquisition. Moreover, project companies could only acquire land following a tripartite 
</p>
<p>contract between the landowner, project companies and the Mayor of the City.  
</p>
<p>28. The Constitution established that international treaties ratified or acceded to by 
</p>
<p>Mongolia would have a force equal to domestic laws. Of 425 laws currently in effect, 
</p>
<p>159 contained general provisions placing legal prevalence to international treaties above 
</p>
<p>domestic law when there was a disparity amongst the two. In order to address the issue of 
</p>
<p>compatibility between national legislation and international treaties, a draft Law on 
</p>
<p>International Treaties was currently being developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>
<p>34. Bhutan was pleased to note the enactment of the law on gender equality, which

</p>
<p>violence against children, including the disabled. 
</p>
<p>35. Brazil commended the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the

<p>36. Canada<b> </b>noted that, although Mongolia had accepted its recommendations of the first 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review cycle on death penalty and discrimination on the basis of sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation and gender identity, no action had been taken on either issue. 
</p>
<p>37. Chile praised the progress made on accession to international instruments and the 
</p>
<p>strengthening of human rights institutions. It noted that this was reflected in the national 
</p>
<p>report as a priority, especially in terms of promoting education on human rights.  
</p>
<p>38. China commended Mongolia&#8217;s judicial reforms in combating domestic violence and 
</p>

</p>
<p>international community to provide support to Mongolia in promoting human rights. 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>advance on preventing torture. It stressed that the Convention against Torture Initiative, an 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental cooperation process, was ready to explore avenues to assist the 
</p>
<p>Government of Mongolia in advancing on issues relating to torture. 
</p>

</p>
<p>importance. It noted positively the draft Law on Crime, which decriminalized defamation,

</p>
<p>of child work in mines, although listed as hazardous work for children. Germany

</p>
<p>on violence against women. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Mongolia had undertaken concrete measures to implement the recommendations, and that 
</p>
<p>progress had been made, particularly by acceding to international treaties and enhancing 
</p>
<p>national legislation. Hungary attached great importance to the establishment of an effective 
</p>
<p>national preventive mechanism in line with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>

</p>
<p>49. Indonesia welcomed that the national report was the result of an inclusive dialogue 
</p>
<p>involving a wide range of ministries, agencies and NGOs. It expressed the view that further </p>

</p>
<p>enhancement of national initiatives. 
</p>

<p>violence, measures to fight corruption and laws to better protect children. Iraq also 
</p>
<p>welcomed the National Action Plan on disabilities. 
</p>

</p>
<p>region. 
</p>
<p>65. The delegation of Mongolia noted the steps taken to abolish the death penalty, 
</p>
<p>specifically the draft Criminal Code currently under review by the Parliament. The 
</p>
<p>delegation further elaborated that all persons who were sentenced to death had been granted 
</p>
<p>a pardon by the President, and would therefore serve a 30-year prison term after which they 
</p>
<p>would be released.  
</p>
<p>66. The delegation reiterated that torture was a subject of serious concern in Mongolia 
</p>
<p>and acceding to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 2011 was one of many efforts by the 
</p>
<p>Government to abolish all torture cases in the country. There were a total of 14 cases of </p>


<p>torture recorded, and as of 2014 two cases had been addressed. Furthermore, the delegation 
</p>
<p>reiterated Mongolia&#8217;s commitment to incorporating the subject of torture in the educational 
</p>
<p>programme curricular. This provision of torture had already been included for law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officers; however, the curricular for prosecutors should also include the 
</p>
<p>subject of torture. 
</p>
<p>67. According to the Criminal Code of Mongolia, hate crimes are prohibited based on a 
</p>
<p>religious, sexual, or ethnic basis, and therefore, should such cases take place, the 
</p>
<p>perpetrator would be subject to criminal liability. Despite the lack of records concerning 
</p>
<p>discrimination against LGBT people, the delegation of Mongolia expressed the readiness of 
</p>
<p>law enforcement institutions to provide for the protection and promotion of LGBT people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>

</p>
<p>strong provisions and clauses that restrict and prohibit corporal punishment of children 
</p>
<p>within the family. 
</p>
<p>69. Following the enactment of the Human Trafficking Law in 2012, Mongolia reached 
</p>
<p>a new stage in their efforts to combat human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>70. The delegation of Mongolia explained that the Criminal Code did not allow for 
</p>
<p>detention of a suspect without a special resolution to arrest or detain a suspect issued by a 
</p>
<p>judge or prosecutor. Despite the criticism from the general public concerning cases of 
</p>
<p>unjustified or unlawful arrest or detention of suspects, there were no records of such cases.  
</p>
<p>71. In Mongolia, domestic violence remained a primary focus, especially in the National 
</p>
<p>Committee on Gender Equality, where numerous activities were conducted in order to 
</p>
<p>create public awareness of the issue, especially among the youth. With the enactment of the 
</p>
<p>revised Domestic Violence Law, Mongolia would be better able to address and tackle 
</p>
<p>domestic violence issues completely, in addition to being equipped with a new method and 
</p>
<p>instrument to deal with the problem. However, regarding liabilities and sanctions of 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of domestic violence, there was a need for more efficient coordination among 
</p>
<p>the domestic laws, especially concerning the mandates of law enforcement agencies. 
</p>
<p>72. Food security remained a critical issue in Mongolia. Numerous policy documents 
</p>
<p>regarding food and health security in the country had been approved by the Government, 
</p>
<p>including the Food Security National Programme. In addition, 21 provinces, including 8 
</p>

</p>
<p>73. The Niger congratulated Mongolia for the adoption of several laws concerning the 
</p>
<p>reform of justice in 2013 and welcomed the ratification of several international instruments, 
</p>
<p>as well as efforts to ensure a better coordination with treaty bodies. As a result, the 
</p>
<p>judiciary would be reinforced in terms of human and material resources, transparency and 
</p>
<p>independence.  
</p>
<p>74. Norway acknowledged efforts to further enhance the protection of human rights, in 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Gender Equality, Combating Human Trafficking Witness and Victim Protection, as well as

</p>

</p>
