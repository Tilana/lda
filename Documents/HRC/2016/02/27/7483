<p><i>Summary 
</i> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
examines the human rights situation of indigenous peoples in Canada on the basis of 
research and information gathered from various sources, including during a visit to Canada 
from 7 to 15 October 2013. The visit was a follow-up to the 2004 visit to and report on 
Canada by the previous Special Rapporteur (E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.3). During his visit, the 
Special Rapporteur met with government officials at the federal level, and at the provincial 
level in six provinces.  
</p>
<p> The relationship of Canada with the indigenous peoples within its borders is 
governed by a well-developed legal framework and a number of policy initiatives that in 
many respects are protective of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. But despite positive steps, 
daunting challenges remain. The numerous initiatives that have been taken at the federal 
and provincial/territorial levels to address the problems faced by indigenous peoples have 
been insufficient. The well-being gap between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in 
Canada has not narrowed over the past several years; treaty and aboriginal claims remain 
persistently unresolved; indigenous women and girls remain vulnerable to abuse; and 
overall there appear to be high levels of distrust among indigenous peoples towards the 
government at both the federal and provincial levels.

<p> Indigenous peoples&#8217; concerns merit higher priority at all levels and within all 
branches of government, and across all departments. Concerted measures, based on mutual 
understanding and real partnership with aboriginal peoples, through their own 
representative institutions, are vital to establishing long-term solutions. To that end, it is 
necessary for Canada to arrive at a common understanding with indigenous peoples of 
objectives and goals that are based on full respect for their constitutional, treaty and 
internationally recognized rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples 
examines the human rights situation of indigenous peoples in Canada on the basis of 
research and information gathered from various sources, including during a visit to Canada 
from 7 to 15 October 2013. The visit was a follow-up to the 2004 visit to and report on 
Canada by the previous Special Rapporteur (E/CN.4/2005/88/Add.3). During his visit, the 
Special Rapporteur met with government officials at the federal level and at the provincial 
level in six provinces. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation for the 
support of the Government of Canada and of the indigenous individuals, nations and 
organizations that provided indispensable assistance in the planning and coordination of the 
visit.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context 
</b></p>
<p>2. Over 1.4 million of Canada&#8217;s overall population of approximately 32.9 million (4.3 
per cent) are indigenous, or in the terminology commonly used in Canada, aboriginal. 
Around half of these are registered or &#8220;status&#8221; Indians (First Nations), 30 per cent are 
M&#233;tis, 15 per cent are unregistered First Nations, and 4 per cent are Inuit.1 There are 
currently 617 First Nations or Indian bands in Canada representing more than 50 cultural 
groups and living in about 1,000 communities and elsewhere across the country. Canada&#8217;s 
indigenous population is younger and faster-growing than the rest of the Canadian 
population. 
</p>
<p>3. The history of indigenous peoples&#8217; relationship with Europeans and Canada has 
positive aspects, such as early political and military alliances and policies of coexistence, 
the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the related policy of the British Crown of seeking 
formal permission and treaty relationships with indigenous peoples before permitting 
settlement in their territories. There are approximately 70 recognized pre-1975 treaties that 
form the basis of the relationship between 364 First Nations, representing over 600,000 
First Nations people, and Canada. In addition, 24 modern treaties are currently in effect. 
</p>
<p>4. However, there have also been notable episodes and patterns of devastating human 
rights violations, including the banning of expressions of indigenous culture and religious 
ceremonies; exclusion from voting, jury duty, and access to lawyers and Canadian courts 
for any grievances relating to land; the imposition, at times forcibly, of governance 
institutions; and policies of forced assimilation through the removal of children from 
indigenous communities and &#8220;enfranchisement&#8221; that stripped indigenous people of their 
aboriginal identity and membership. Most of those policies were executed through the 
Indian Act, a statute with nineteenth century origins. A rigidly paternalistic law at its 
inception, it continues to structure important aspects of Canada&#8217;s relationship with First 
Nations today, although efforts at reform have slowly taken place. 
</p>
<p>5. A particularly distressing part of the history of human rights violations was the 
residential school era (1874-1970s, with some schools operating until 1996), during which 
indigenous children were forced from their homes into institutions, the explicit purpose of 
which was to destroy their family and community bonds, their languages, their cultures and 
even their names. Thousands of indigenous children did not survive the experience and

</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>some of them are buried in unidentified graves. Generations of those who survived grew up 
estranged from their cultures and languages, with debilitating effects on the maintenance of 
their indigenous identity. That estrangement was heightened during the &#8220;sixties scoop&#8221;, 
when indigenous children were fostered and adopted into non-aboriginal homes, including 
outside Canada. The residential school period continues to cast a long shadow of despair on 
indigenous communities, and many of the dire social and economic problems faced by 
aboriginal peoples are linked to that experience.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal, institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. Canada&#8217;s relationship with the indigenous peoples within its borders is governed by 
a well-developed legal framework that in many respects is protective of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights. Building upon the protections in the British Crown&#8217;s Royal Proclamation of 
1763, Canada&#8217;s 1982 Constitution was one of the first in the world to enshrine indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights, recognizing and affirming the aboriginal and treaty rights of the Indian, 
Inuit and M&#233;tis people of Canada.2 Those provisions protect aboriginal title arising from 
historical occupation, treaty rights and culturally important activities.  
</p>
<p>7. Since 1982, Canada&#8217;s courts have developed a significant body of jurisprudence 
concerning aboriginal and treaty rights. In 1997, the seminal case of <i>Delgamuukw v. British 
Columbia</i> established aboriginal title as a proprietary right to land, grounded in occupation 
at the time of British assertion of sovereignty, which may only be infringed for public 
purposes with fair compensation and consultation,3 although in neither that nor any 
subsequent case has a declaration of aboriginal title been granted. Numerous cases have 
affirmed aboriginal rights to fish,, to hunt and to access lands for cultural and economic 
purposes. Furthermore, since the <i>Haida Nation v. British Columbia</i> case in 2004,4 federal 
and provincial governments have been subject to a formal duty to consult indigenous 
peoples and accommodate their interests whenever their asserted or established aboriginal 
or treaty rights may be affected by government conduct. Further jurisprudence confirms 
that treaties reached cannot be unilaterally abrogated and must be interpreted in accordance 
with the understanding of the indigenous parties.5  
</p>
<p>8. The general statute governing registered Indians/First Nations is the Indian Act, 
which regulates most aspects of aboriginal life and governance on Indian reserves. There 
are numerous complementary statutes regulating specific subject areas and claims 
processes, as well as others that give effect to modern treaties and self-government 
agreements.  
</p>
<p>9. Notably, Canada recognizes that the inherent right of self-government is an existing 
aboriginal right under the Constitution which includes the right of indigenous peoples to 
govern themselves in matters that are internal to their communities or integral to their 
unique cultures, identities, traditions, languages and institutions, and in respect to their 
special relationship with their land and their resources. This right of self-government 
includes jurisdiction over the definition of governance structures, First Nation membership, 
family matters, education, health and property rights, among other subjects; however, in 
order to exercise this jurisdiction, agreements must be negotiated with the federal 
Government. Concerns related to this are discussed in section IV.C below.

</p>
<p>10. Constitutionally, the federal Government is responsible for the State&#8217;s relationship 
with indigenous peoples, through Parliament&#8217;s jurisdiction over &#8220;Indians and lands reserved 
for Indians&#8221;,6  which as of April 2014 includes M&#233;tis.7 Administratively, the management of 
the relationship with indigenous peoples at the federal level is the responsibility of the 
Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC). Most 
provinces also have ministries or departments of aboriginal affairs, which are heavily 
involved in issues concerning social and economic policy and natural resource use, over 
which the provinces have jurisdiction.  
</p><p>11. In relation to its commitments internationally to protect the rights of indigenous 
individuals and peoples, Canada is a party to the major United Nations human rights 
treaties and, in 2010, reversing its previous position, it endorsed the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>12. In 2008, Canada made a historic apology to former students of some Indian 
residential schools, in which it expressed a commitment to healing and reconciliation with 
indigenous peoples, and to forging a new relationship in which the Government and 
indigenous peoples could move forward in partnership. Some action has been taken in this 
regard, including the ongoing implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement 
Agreement, which was negotiated and agreed upon by former students, the churches that 
ran the schools, the Assembly of First Nations, other aboriginal organizations and the 
Government of Canada. A cornerstone of the Settlement Agreement was the creation of the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission to witness the experiences of government residential 
school survivors, create a complete, accessible and permanent historical record of the 
Indian residential school system and legacy, and promote public awareness of it. The 
operating period of the Commission was recently extended for one year. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Principal human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p>13. Canada undoubtedly has in place, at both the federal and provincial levels, numerous 
laws, policies and programmes aimed at addressing indigenous peoples&#8217; concerns. Many of 
them can be pointed to as good practices, at least in their conception, such as Canada&#8217;s 
policy of negotiating modern treaties with aboriginal peoples and addressing their historical 
claims. A full exposition of those laws, policies and programmes is beyond the scope of the 
present report. Rather, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s principal aim here is to highlight the 
ongoing human rights concerns of indigenous peoples for which improvements are required 
in existing government laws and policies.  
</p>
<p>14. It is difficult to reconcile Canada&#8217;s well-developed legal framework and general 
prosperity with the human rights problems faced by indigenous peoples in Canada, which 
have reached crisis proportions in many respects. Moreover, the relationship between the 
federal Government and indigenous peoples is strained, perhaps even more so than when 
the previous Special Rapporteur visited Canada in 2004, despite certain positive 
developments since then and the shared goal of improving conditions for indigenous 
peoples.

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Social and economic conditions 
</b></p>
<p>15. The most jarring manifestation of those human rights problems is the distressing 
socioeconomic conditions of indigenous peoples in a highly developed country. Although 
in 2004 the previous Special Rapporteur recommended that Canada intensify its measures 
to close the human development indicator gap between indigenous and non-indigenous 
Canadians in health care, housing, education, welfare and social services,8 there has been no 
reduction in that gap in the intervening period in relation to registered Indians/First Nations, 
although socioeconomic conditions for M&#233;tis and non-status Indians have improved, 
according to government data.9 The statistics are striking. Of the bottom 100 Canadian 
communities on the Community Well-Being Index, 96 are First Nations and only one First 
Nation community is in the top 100.10  
</p>
<p>16. It might be expected that the costs of social services required by indigenous peoples 
would be higher than those of the general population, given their needs and the geographic 
remoteness of many indigenous communities. However, it does not appear that Canada has 
dedicated greater resources to social services for indigenous peoples. The Auditor General 
of Canada, an independent parliamentary officer, has alerted the Government that the lack 
of appropriate funding is limiting social services delivery and thus the improvement of 
living conditions on reserves.11  
</p>
<p><b>1. Education 
</b></p>
<p>17. At every level of education, indigenous people overall continue to lag far behind the 
general population. Government representatives have attributed the gap in educational 
achievement in large measure to high levels of poverty, the historical context of residential 
schools, and systemic racism.  
</p>
<p>18. Under the Indian Act, the federal Government is responsible for funding education 
on reserves, which is administered by First Nations governments. The federal Government 
also funds 110 First Nations and Inuit cultural education centres, which develop culturally 
relevant curricula. Outside of reserves, education is funded by provincial and territorial 
governments and administered by local school boards. There are two exceptions. In British 
Columbia, education for First Nations is coordinated through a single province-wide 
education authority and delivered and regulated by individual First Nations, which are 
provided with stable funding through a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal 
governments. Also, 11 First Nation bands in Nova Scotia are self-governing in respect of 
education, under an agreement concluded in 1997. 
</p>
<p>19. It bears noting that there exist a number of laudable government education 
programmes, some of which have demonstrated success. The Aboriginal Head Start in 
Urban and Northern Communities Program has shown achievements in eliminating 
disparities between aboriginal and non-aboriginal children in terms of school readiness; 
unfortunately, the Program reaches less than 10 per cent of aboriginal children.12

</p>
<p>Additionally, some provincial governments are making efforts to ensure that Canadian 
students learn more about the aboriginal contribution to the country, and to promote 
aboriginal students&#8217; success. For example, Saskatchewan has mandatory treaty education 
and includes First Nations and M&#233;tis content, perspectives and ways of knowing into 
curricula, and is currently developing a pilot strategy for teaching the Cree language.  
</p>
<p>20. However, numerous First Nations leaders have alleged that federal funding for 
primary, secondary and post-secondary education is inadequate. The Auditor General has 
noted that although the Government &#8220;identified seven categories of factors having a 
significant impact on the cost of First Nations education &#8230; it did not make funding 
adjustments based on its findings&#8221;.13  
</p><p>21. In recent years, the federal Government has placed a priority on education, as 
highlighted by its development of the First Nations Education Bill. However, the bill has 
been met with remarkably consistent and profound opposition by indigenous peoples across 
the country. Indigenous leaders have stated that their peoples have not been properly 
consulted about the bill and that their input had not been adequately incorporated in the 
drafting of the bill. The main concerns expressed by indigenous representatives include that 
(a) the imposition of provincial standards and service requirements in the bill will 
undermine or eliminate First Nation control of their children&#8217;s education; (b) the bill lacks a 
clear commitment to First Nations languages, cultures and ways of teaching and learning; 
(c) the bill does not provide for stable, adequate and equitable funding of indigenous 
schools; and (d) the bill will displace successful education programmes already in place, an 
issue that was raised particularly in British Columbia. 
</p>
<p>22. In a positive development, in February 2014, the Government, supported by the 
Assembly of First Nations, announced Can$ 1.9 billion in additional education funding 
starting in 2015, including Can$ 500 million for education infrastructure, and a 4.5 per cent 
annual &#8220;escalator&#8221; for core funding, to commence in 2016, in place of the long-standing 2 
per cent cap on funding increases. The Government also affirmed that First Nations would 
maintain control over education. However, it remains unclear to what extent First Nations 
were adequately consulted about these developments. 
</p>
<p>23. Approximately 90 aboriginal languages are spoken in Canada. Two thirds of these 
languages are endangered, severely endangered or critically endangered, due in no small 
part to the intentional suppression of indigenous languages during the Indian residential 
school era. The same year the federal Government apologized for the residential school 
policy, 2008, it committed some Can$ 220 million annually for the next five years to 
Canada&#8217;s &#8220;Linguistic Duality&#8221; programme to promote English and French.14 By 
comparison, over the same period, the federal Government spent under Can$ 19 million 
annually to support indigenous language revitalization.15 
</p>
<p><b>2. Housing 
</b></p>
<p>24. The housing situation in Inuit and First Nations communities has reached a crisis 
level, especially in the north, where remoteness and extreme weather exacerbate housing 
problems. Overcrowded housing is endemic. Homes are in need of major repairs, including 
plumbing and electrical work. These conditions add to the broader troubling water situation 
in First Nations reserves, in which more than half of the water systems pose a medium or

<p>high health risk to their users.16 The housing crisis has been identified by Inuit 
representatives as a high priority issue. It is worth noting that the chronic housing shortage 
has a severe negative effect on a wide variety of economic and social conditions. 
Overcrowding contributes to higher rates of respiratory illness, depression, sleep 
deprivation, family violence, poor educational achievement and an inability to retain skilled 
and professional members in the community.  
</p>
<p>25. Trying to meet their communities&#8217; housing needs is a major contributor to deficits 
and financial difficulties for indigenous peoples throughout the country. The federal 
Government, through AANDC and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
(CMHC), provides some support for on-reserve housing in First Nations communities. First 
Nations report that, with this funding, over the past five years they have built approximately 
1,750 new units and made renovations to more than 3,100 existing units. However, as is the 
case off reserve, First Nations are expected to seek other sources of funding, such as private 
sector loans, to meet housing needs, which is a daunting task for many communities.  
</p>
<p>26. Overall, investments have not kept pace with the demand for new housing or the 
need for major renovations to existing units. Government representatives have attributed the 
lack of adequate funding in large measure to the difficulties presented by the communal 
ownership of indigenous lands in obtaining mortgages or financing for housing. In 
response, the Government has established loan guarantees, for which First Nations can 
apply, to provide security for on-reserve housing loans. Despite loan guarantee increases in 
recent years, much more remains to be done to provide secure loans for housing, both on 
and off reserve, in a way that respects and accommodates the communally held nature of 
aboriginal lands.  
</p>
<p>27. Funding for housing in Inuit communities is different in each of the four regions. 
CMHC provides funding to provinces and territories for housing, which in turn, decide on 
priorities in their respective jurisdictions. This affords provinces and territories the 
flexibility to design and deliver programmes in order to address Inuit-specific housing 
needs and priorities as they see fit. In addition to CMHC funding, some arrangements 
specific to housing in the Inuit regions have been made. Most recently, the Government 
announced an investment of Can$ 100 million, over two years, to support the construction 
of about 250 new housing units in Nunavut under Canada&#8217;s Economic Action Plan 2013. 
Still, severe housing shortages persist for Inuit communities. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the enactment in June 2013 of 
legislation regarding on-reserve matrimonial real property, the Family Homes on Reserves 
and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act, to provide protection to aboriginal women 
equivalent to what non-aboriginal women receive in the event of a marriage breakdown, as 
recommended by the previous Special Rapporteur in 2004.17 However, concerns have been 
raised that the legislation may be unworkable in a context in which multiple generations or 
families occupy the same home due to housing shortages, or in which people other than the 
divorcing spouses may have an interest in the home according to indigenous custom. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Health and well-being 
</b></p>
<p>29. The health of First Nations, Inuit and M&#233;tis people in Canada is a matter of 
significant concern. Although overall the health situation of indigenous peoples in Canada 
has improved in recent years, significant gaps still remain in health outcomes of aboriginal 
as compared to non-aboriginal Canadians, including in terms of life expectancy, infant

<p>mortality, suicide, injuries, and communicable and chronic diseases such as diabetes. The 
health situation is exacerbated by overcrowded housing, high population growth rates, high 
poverty rates and the geographic remoteness of many communities, especially Inuit 
communities in the north.  
</p>
<p>30. Health care for aboriginal people in Canada is delivered through a complex array of 
federal, provincial and aboriginal services, and concerns have been raised about the 
adequacy of coordination among them. A recent positive development in British Columbia, 
which could provide a model for other areas, is the 2013 implementation of a tripartite 
agreement to achieve a more responsive health-care system. The oversight and delivery of 
federally funded health services in British Columbia have been transferred to First Nations, 
while the three levels of government (First Nations, provincial and federal) work 
collaboratively to support integration and accountability. 
</p>
<p>31. With respect to other issues affecting the well-being of indigenous peoples in 
Canada, among the results of the residential school and &#8220;sixties scoop&#8221; eras and associated 
cultural dislocation has been a lack of intergenerational transmission of child-raising skills 
and high rates of substance abuse. Aboriginal children continue to be taken into the care of 
child services at a rate eight times higher than non-indigenous Canadians. Further, the 
Auditor General identified funding and service level disparities in child and family services 
for indigenous children compared to non-indigenous children,18 an issue highlighted by a 
formal complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal by the First Nations Child and 
Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations. In a positive development, in 
2000 the Province of Manitoba and the Manitoba M&#233;tis Federation, which represents M&#233;tis 
rights and interests in the province, signed a memorandum of understanding for the delivery 
of community-based and culturally appropriate child and family services, which has 
demonstrated important successes. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Administration of justice 
  1. Overrepresentation in the justice system 
</b></p>
<p>32. Given these dire social and economic circumstances, it may not come as a surprise 
that, although indigenous people comprise around 4 per cent of the Canadian population, 
they make up 25 per cent of the prison population. This proportion appears to be increasing. 
Aboriginal women, at 33 per cent of the total female inmate population, are even more 
disproportionately incarcerated than indigenous individuals generally and have been the 
fastest growing population in federal prisons.  
</p>
<p>33. This situation exists despite notable efforts, such as the Aboriginal Courtwork 
Program (which provides funds to assist aboriginal people in the criminal justice system to 
obtain equitable and culturally appropriate treatment); the Aboriginal Justice Strategy 
(which provides aboriginal people with alternatives to the mainstream justice system, where 
appropriate); the &#8220;Gladue principle&#8221; (which requires courts to consider reasonable 
alternatives to incarceration in sentencing aboriginal people); and the efforts of the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission to facilitate aboriginal communities&#8217; development of 
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. However, more recently, the Government has 
enacted legislation19 that limits the judicial discretion upon which these programmes rely, 
raising concerns about the potential for such efforts to reduce the overrepresentation of 
aboriginal men, women and children in detention.

<p><b>2. Missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>34. Indigenous women and girls are also disproportionately victims of violent crime. 
The Native Women&#8217;s Association of Canada has documented over 660 cases of women and 
girls across Canada who have gone missing or been murdered in the last 20 years, many of 
which remain unresolved, although the exact number of unresolved cases remains to be 
determined. Since 1996, there have been at least 29 official inquiries and reports dealing 
with aspects of this issue, which have resulted in over 500 recommendations for action.20  
</p>
<p>35. To address this severe problem, in 2010 the federal Government implemented a 
seven-point plan, which includes a mix of law enforcement and justice initiatives, as well as 
funding for victim and family support and prevention and awareness programmes. One part 
of the plan, which involves the identification of best practices in policing and the justice 
system in interactions with aboriginal women, resulted in the creation in March 2012 of an 
online searchable Compendium of Promising Practices to Reduce Violence and Increase 
Safety of Aboriginal Women in Canada. Further, over the last decade, the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, Canada&#8217;s federal police force, has established integrated projects, units 
and task forces in Manitoba, British Columbia and Alberta to review unsolved homicides 
and missing persons cases.  
</p>
<p>36. There has also been action at the provincial level. For example, Manitoba has 
implemented legislative changes to improve investigative powers in missing persons cases 
and protect victims of trafficking, and has engaged in a number of consultations and 
awareness-raising efforts and funded anti-violence programmes. Ontario now includes 
persons missing for more than a month in their major crimes database, and the provincial 
police force has established an internal working group to link analysis, prevention and 
investigative efforts across the organization. Likewise, the Saskatchewan police have a 
provincial database on missing persons, which identifies aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
persons, and the province has a unique Provincial Partnership Committee on Missing 
Persons, which coordinates policy and public awareness development between aboriginal 
groups, the police and the justice system, and with non-governmental agencies.  
</p><p>37. Nevertheless, these efforts and any positive results from them have not, at least yet, 
abated continuing calls for greater and more effective action to address the problem of 
missing indigenous women and girls. During his visit to Canada, the Special Rapporteur 
heard consistent, insistent calls across the country for a comprehensive, nationwide inquiry, 
organized in consultation with indigenous peoples, that could provide an opportunity for the 
voices of the victims&#8217; families to be heard, deepen understanding of the magnitude and 
systemic dimensions of the issue, and identify best practices that could lead to an 
adequately coordinated response. </p>
<p><b> C. Self-government and participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>  1. Self-government arrangements 
</b></p>
<p>38. By all accounts, strengthening indigenous peoples&#8217; self-government is essential to 
improving their social and economic situation and sustaining healthy communities. A 2011 
assessment by the federal Government of the achievements and problems of its self-
government policy concluded that self-governing indigenous nations enjoy improved 
outcomes in educational achievement and employment levels. In that regard, the Special

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur was pleased to hear a desire to improve the capacity of indigenous governance 
institutions from all levels of government in Canada. 
</p>
<p>39. Yet many of Canada&#8217;s laws, in particular the Indian Act, still do not permit the 
effective exercise of indigenous self-government. The Indian Act renders almost all 
decisions made by a First Nations government subject to the approval of the Minister of 
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, including changes in band by-laws, funding 
for reserve programmes and infrastructure, and the leasing of land. Most glaringly, while 
there are some legislative alternatives for First Nations to opt out of the Indian Act regime 
on a case-by-case, sector-by-sector basis, these options are limited. The principal 
alternative is through self-government agreements, which can be negotiated to enhance 
greater indigenous control and law-making authority over a range of jurisdictions, including 
social and economic development, education, health, lands and other matters, in accordance 
with the constitutionally protected &#8220;inherent right&#8221; of self-government. Another alternative 
is in the First Nations Land Management Act, which gives participating First Nations law-
making authority over the lands in their reserve and allows them to implement their own 
land management systems. However the Indian Act remains the default and still prevalent 
regime among First Nations. 
</p>
<p>40. For their part, the M&#233;tis, who are not covered by the Indian Act, have started to 
engage in tripartite negotiations towards self-government agreements in key areas, 
including the family and childcare, economic development, and housing, though much still 
remains to be done to build and fund M&#233;tis governance institutions. 
</p>
<p>41. As for the Inuit regions, two of the four land claim agreements concluded for them 
contain self-government provisions. The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (1993) led to 
the creation of Canada&#8217;s newest territory and public government in 1999. The Nunatsiavut-
Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement<b> </b>(2005) led to the establishment of the Nunatsiavut 
Government, which has the power to pass laws concerning education, health and cultural 
affairs. Agreements in the two other Inuit areas remain outstanding. In Nunavik, Makivik 
Corporation (representing the Inuit of Quebec), the Government of Quebec and Canada 
negotiated a final self-government agreement to establish a regional public government 
responsible for delivering certain social services, such as education and health services. 
However, voters in Nunavik rejected the agreement in April 2011 and efforts towards a 
self-government agreement are ongoing. In 1996, the Inuvialuit Regional Council, in 
concert with the Gwich&#8217;in Tribal Council, commenced self-government negotiations with 
Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories, with which they envisioned the 
operation of a regional public government structure, combined with a system of guaranteed 
aboriginal representation on the councils of restructured community public governments. 
An agreement-in-principle was reached in April 2003 but was later rejected by the 
Gwich&#8217;in Tribal Council. The two groups have subsequently resumed negotiating at 
separate tables on separate agreements. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Funding self-government under the Indian Act 
</b></p>
<p>42. Federal funding for First Nations governments under the Indian Act is structured 
through &#8220;contribution agreements&#8221; for which they must apply. Funding priorities and 
amounts are unilaterally, and some say arbitrarily, determined by the federal Government. 
Spending is monitored and reviewed to ensure that conditions the Government imposes are 
met, and funds are withheld if audits are not delivered on time &#8211; which forces indigenous 
governments to reallocate available funds to ensure programming continuity, making 
reporting even more difficult.  
</p>
<p>43. This funding mechanism also leads to reporting requirements that were repeatedly 
described to the Special Rapporteur as onerous. First Nations communities that receive 
federal funding under the Indian Act regime, 70 per cent of which have fewer than 500 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>residents,21 typically have to produce 100 or more reports a year for various federal 
agencies.22  The Government acknowledges that &#8220;reliance on annual funding agreements 
and multiple accountabilities &#8230; can impede the provision of timely services and can limit 
the ability of First Nations to implement longer-term development plans&#8221;.23 
</p>
<p>44. Furthermore, if a First Nation government functioning under the Indian Act has 
financial difficulties as a result of funding delays, reporting delays or other situations, it 
faces the potential imposition of a co-manager or federally appointed third-party manager 
who takes over control of all the nation&#8217;s federally funded programmes and services. There 
do not appear to be significant financial management resources available from the federal 
Government for First Nations, at their own request, before they are in a default or deficit 
position. There is clearly a perception among indigenous leaders that third-party 
management can be imposed for punitive or political reasons. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur heard criticisms over the relatively new &#8220;own-source 
revenue&#8221; policy, which is likely to be phased in to all funding agreements between the 
federal Government and First Nations. Under this policy, First Nations will be expected, as 
they are able and over time, to contribute to the costs of their government activities, with 
the expectation that indigenous reliance on federal funding will decline. Specifically, 
aboriginal representatives have expressed the feeling that they are being &#8220;punished&#8221; when 
they demonstrate success, in the sense that their funding will be reduced. 
</p>
<p><b>4. Partnership and participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>46. As noted above, the Government of Canada has a stated goal of reconciliation, 
which the Special Rapporteur heard repeated by numerous government representatives with 
whom he met. Yet even in this context, in recent years, indigenous leaders have expressed 
concern that progress towards this goal has been undermined by actions of the Government 
that limit or ignore the input of indigenous governments and representatives in various 
decisions that concern them. These actions in part sparked the &#8220;Idle No More&#8221; protests 
throughout the country in December 2012. 
</p>
<p>47. Most notable were concerns expressed about a lack of effective participation of 
indigenous peoples in the design of legislation that affected them. In 2012, the federal 
Government enacted or amended a number of statutes affecting Canada&#8217;s indigenous 
peoples, including the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the National Energy 
Board Act, the Fisheries Act, the Navigable Waters Protection Act and the Indian Act, 
through two &#8220;omnibus&#8221; budget implementation acts, the Jobs and Growth Act 2012 (Bill C-
45) and the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act (Bill C-38). Despite the vast scope 
and impact on indigenous nations of the omnibus acts, there was no specific consultation 
with indigenous peoples concerning them.  
</p>
<p>48. Other legislation of concern includes the Safe Drinking Water for First Nations Act, 
which vests broad power in the federal Government in relation to drinking and wastewater 
systems on First Nations lands. As noted above, indigenous peoples have also complained 
about a lack of consultation regarding the proposed First Nations Education Act and the 
Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or Rights Act.

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>49. In addition, there have been a number of actions in recent years that have been 
viewed as affronting the aspired-to partnership relationship between First Nations and the 
Government. For example, the prioritization of the First Nations Financial Transparency 
Act, in a context in which indigenous governments are already the most overreporting level 
of government, has been perceived by First Nations to reinforce a negative stereotype of 
aboriginal people and governments as incompetent and corrupt, and to undermine rather 
than promote public support for indigenous self-government. Also, the unilateral changes to 
contribution agreements in 2013, without consultation regarding the wording and 
implications of these new agreements, included language which in other circumstances 
would appear innocuous, but which has been widely interpreted by First Nations to imply 
that receipt of their necessary operating funds was contingent on providing their consent to 
unspecified future legislative and regulatory changes.  
</p>
<p>50. Another example of actions that have strained the relationship between indigenous 
peoples and the Government is the international border arrangement put in place for the 
Akwesasne reserve, which spans the border between Canada and the United States of 
America, after the community objected to border guards carrying firearms on their reserve. 
Since the border station was moved, Mohawk residents of the reserve travelling entirely 
within their own territory but across the international boundary are required to leave their 
reserve and report to border services at the station. Failure to report in this manner may 
result in onerous fines, confiscation of vehicles and in some cases imprisonment. Mohawk 
residents perceive this arrangement as a punitive measure in response to the community&#8217;s 
activism. 
</p>
<p>51. More broadly, indigenous leaders complain that the federal Government frequently 
uses a discourse of responsibility to Canadian taxpayers for the cost of First Nations treaty 
benefits, without a corresponding acknowledgement of the vast economic benefits that have 
accrued to non-indigenous Canadians as a result of the constitutional treaty relationships 
that provided them with access to the national territory. This discourse places First Nations 
outside, and in opposition to, &#8220;Canadian&#8221; interests, rather than understanding indigenous 
people to be an integral aspect of those interests. 
</p>
<p><b>5. Membership 
</b></p>
<p>52. A key issue that affects the self-governance capacity of First Nations is the Indian 
Act definition of who qualifies as a &#8220;status&#8221; or &#8220;registered&#8221; Indian. Like other Canadians, 
First Nations individuals have often built families with partners from different 
backgrounds. Unlike for other Canadians, however, for many First Nations individuals, 
doing so carries serious consequences for their children&#8217;s ability to stay in their community 
as adults. This in turn has significant consequences for First Nations&#8217; ability to retain 
diverse economic skills, since those most likely to &#8220;marry out&#8221; are those who have lived 
outside the community to gain education or experience.  
</p>
<p>53. While the Indian Act permits First Nations the option of making their own 
membership rules, many benefits follow statutorily defined status under the Indian Act, not 
membership. They include on-reserve tax exemptions, estate rules, certain payments and 
post-secondary education support and, perhaps most importantly, federally funded on-
reserve housing. This makes it difficult in practice for First Nations to enable non-status 
members to live on reserve, including children who have grown up on reserve and know no 
other home.  
</p>
<p>54. Those distinctions, compounded by two levels of status under the Indian Act, have 
the practical effect of imposing different classes of First Nation citizenship, within a 
convoluted regulatory matrix, regardless of the criteria or collective decisions of the First 
Nation. To simplify, under the Indian Act, 6(1) status is accorded to children with two 
status Indian parents (or to children with a status Indian father and a white mother who </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>were married prior to 1985); individuals with 6(1) status pass on status to their children. 
Children with only one 6(1) status parent are accorded 6(2) status, which means they do not 
have the right to pass Indian status to their children unless their child&#8217;s other parent has 
either 6(1) or 6(2) status.24 
</p><p>55. The enactment of the Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act remediated some of 
the ongoing discriminatory effects of historical provisions that revoked the Indian status of 
women &#8211; and all their descendants &#8211; who married non-status men, while granting status to 
non-aboriginal women &#8211; and their descendants &#8211; who married status Indians. Unfortunately, 
as acknowledged by the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights, this legislation did 
&#8220;not deal with all sex discrimination stemming from the Indian Act&#8221;;25 some classes of 
people continue to be excluded from status on the basis of the historical discrimination 
against matrilineal descent. This two-parent rule is the context for another problematic 
policy regarding unstated paternity, which arises if the child is a product of violence, rape, 
or incest, cases in which the need to obtain proof of status from the father places the mother 
at risk. Under this policy, any father who is not identified in the birth registration of an 
infant is presumed not to be a registered Indian unless the mother provides sworn proof 
from the father or his family acknowledging paternity.  
</p>
<p>56. M&#233;tis membership is not defined under the Indian Act or other legislation. Facing 
objections by the Government that it was not possible to identify members of the M&#233;tis 
community, the Supreme Court has concluded that identity is demonstrated where a person 
has an ancestral connection to the community, self-identifies as a member and is accepted 
as such by the community.26 This approach has been lauded for allowing for more 
flexibility and indigenous control over membership. 
</p>
<p>57. Inuit membership lists are maintained by each of the four beneficiary organizations 
in Canada (Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Makivik 
Corporation and the Nunatsiavut Government). In each case, they establish their own 
criteria, generally based on ancestry and self-identification as an Inuk. </p>
<p><b> D. The modern treaty and other claims processes 
</b></p>
<p>58. Over the past decades, Canada has taken determined action to address ongoing 
aspects of the history of misdealing and harm inflicted on aboriginal peoples in the country, 
a necessary step towards helping to remedy their current disadvantage. Perhaps most 
significantly, it has legislation, policy and processes in place to address historical 
grievances of indigenous peoples with respect to treaty and aboriginal rights, In this regard, 
Canada is an example to the world. Settlement agreements and other arrangements achieved 
provide important examples of reconciliation and accommodation of indigenous and 
national interests.  
</p>
<p>59. Modern treaties, also referred to as comprehensive land claims agreements, deal 
with areas over which indigenous peoples have claims that have not been addressed through 
historical treaties or other legal means. Since 1973, 24 comprehensive land claims 
agreements have been concluded and are in effect. They cover approximately 40 per cent of 
Canada&#8217;s land mass and affect 95 indigenous communities.27 At the provincial level, the 
British Columbia Treaty Process was established in 1993 to resolve outstanding claims to

</p>
<p>lands and resources in the province, and has resulted in two final agreements that have 
come into effect; the Government reports that two more are very close to taking effect.  
</p>
<p>60. Apart from modern treaty-making to comprehensively settle land claims is the 
specific claims process, which provides redress for historical grievances arising out of 
historical treaties and settlements already reached through negotiations or binding decisions 
of the Specific Claims Tribunal. The specific claims process includes a so-called Treaty 
Lands Entitlement mechanism, a procedure for settling land debt owed to First Nations that 
did not receive all of the land to which they were entitled under historical treaties. In 
particular, Treaty Lands Entitlement is significantly enhancing the land base of many First 
Nations, addressing a recommendation made by the previous Special Rapporteur in 2004.  
</p>
<p>61. Despite their positive aspects, these treaty and other claims processes have been 
mired in difficulties. As a result of these difficulties, many First Nations have all but given 
up on them. Worse yet, in many cases it appears that these processes have contributed to a 
deterioration rather than renewal of the relationship between indigenous peoples and the 
Canadian State. 
</p>
<p>62. Many negotiations under these procedures have been ongoing for many years, in 
some cases decades, with no foreseeable end. An overarching concern is that the 
Government appears to view the overall interests of Canadians as adverse to aboriginal 
interests, rather than encompassing them. In the comprehensive land claims processes, the 
Government minimizes or refuses to recognize aboriginal rights, often insisting on the 
extinguishment or non-assertion of aboriginal rights and title, and favours monetary 
compensation over the right to, or return of, lands. In litigation, the adversarial approach 
leads to an abundance of pretrial motions, which require the indigenous claimants to prove 
nearly every fact, including their very existence as a people. The often limited negotiating 
mandates of government representatives have also delayed or stymied progress towards 
agreements. 
</p>
<p>63. The Government also tends to treat litigation and negotiation as mutually exclusive 
options, instead of complementary avenues towards a mutual goal in which negotiations 
may proceed on some issues while the parties seek assistance from the courts concerning 
intractable disagreements. Furthermore, the Government&#8217;s stated objective of &#8220;full and final 
certainty&#8221; with respect to rights burdens the negotiation process with the almost impossible 
requirement of being totally comprehensive and anticipating all future circumstances. The 
federal Government has acknowledged that it is out of step with the provinces on this point 
and is reportedly contemplating changing course to allow interim or partial agreements, 
which is a hopeful sign.  
</p>
<p>64. The costs for all of the parties involved are enormous. Outstanding loans to First 
Nations from Canada in support of their participation in the comprehensive land claims 
negotiations total in excess of Can$ 700 million. These loans remain owing even if a 
government party discontinues the negotiations. Nor is litigation between Canada or its 
provinces and indigenous peoples more economical or efficient. For example, the 
Tshilhqot&#8217;in Nation&#8217;s aboriginal title litigation has cost the Nation more than 
Can$ 15 million, and taken 14 years to pursue, including five years of trial, and the case is 
currently under appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Also, the Nuu-chah-nulth Nation&#8217;s 
litigation over a commercial aboriginal right to fish has taken 12 years, including three 
years of trial and successive appeals. In the meantime, the Nuu-chah-nulth have been 
permitted to access very little of the fishery.  
</p>
<p>65. Finally, an important impact of the delay in treaty and claims negotiations is the 
growing conflict and uncertainty over resource development on lands subject to ongoing 
claims. It is understandable that First Nations who see the lands and resources over which 
they are negotiating being turned into open-pit mines or drowned by a dam would begin to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>question the utility of the process. For example, four indigenous nations in the Treaty 8 
territory in British Columbia have been in treaty land entitlement negotiations for a decade, 
for &#8220;so long that there are almost no available lands left for the First Nations to select&#8221;.28 
</p>
<p>66. Even for those First Nations that achieve an agreement despite these challenges, 
implementation has proved to be difficult. The vast majority of the country&#8217;s territory was 
constituted through historical (pre-1975) treaties with First Nations, which for many First 
Nations form a core aspect of their identity and relationship with Canada. Given their 
constitutional implications, these treaties should have a similar significance for other 
Canadians, yet treaty litigation forms 25 to 30 per cent of the Department of Justice&#8217;s 
inventory of cases, according to information provided by the Government to the Special 
Rapporteur. There are similar problems with implementation of court judgements affirming 
aboriginal rights. Poor implementation of existing rights and treaties is hardly a strong 
motivator for concluding new ones. 
</p>
<p>67. Since the visit of the previous Special Rapporteur in 2004, both the federal and 
provincial/territorial governments have made efforts to improve the treaty negotiation and 
claims processes. In 2007, the Government developed the Specific Claims Action Plan to 
address the backlog of pending claims, including by establishing a three-year time frame 
for negotiating settlements, after which First Nations may opt to refer their case to a 
tribunal for a final settlement. Also, federal legislation in 2008 established the Specific 
Claims Tribunal through which First Nations can seek and obtain decisions and awards 
binding on Canada in relation to historical grievances. In 2013, the Government established 
a Senior Oversight Committee composed of high-level federal and indigenous officials to 
review and update the comprehensive land claim policy on the basis of the principles of 
recognition and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>68. It bears mentioning that, in spite of recent judicial affirmation that the M&#233;tis had not 
been provided the lands they were owed under the letter and spirit of the constitutional 
agreement that created Manitoba,29 the Government does not appear to have a coherent 
process or policy in place to address the land and compensation claims of the M&#233;tis people. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Indigenous participation in economic development 
</b></p>
<p>69. One of the most dramatic contradictions indigenous peoples in Canada face is that so 
many live in abysmal conditions on traditional territories that are full of valuable and 
plentiful natural resources. These resources are in many cases targeted for extraction and 
development by non-indigenous interests. While indigenous peoples potentially have much 
to gain from resource development within their territories, they also face the highest risks to 
their health, economy and cultural identity from any associated environmental degradation. 
Perhaps more importantly, indigenous nations&#8217; efforts to protect their long-term interests in 
lands and resources often fit uneasily into the efforts of private non-indigenous companies, 
with the backing of the federal and provincial governments, to move forward with natural 
resource projects. 
</p><p>70. As negotiations under the treaty and claims processes reach a standstill in many 
cases, other kinds of negotiated agreements outside these contexts are taking place, 
especially in relation to natural resources development, a booming industry in Canada and a 
main driver of the Canadian economy. Indeed, there are a number of examples in which 
First Nations have enjoyed economic and social benefits from resource projects, either

<p>through their own businesses, joint ventures or benefit-sharing agreements. In particular 
those First Nations that have clarified their aboriginal rights and title can benefit from these 
potential economic development initiatives. 
</p>
<p>71. The Supreme Court of Canada has been clear that the protection of aboriginal rights 
in the Canadian constitution and the &#8220;honour of the Crown&#8221; together impose a duty to 
consult aboriginal peoples when their rights &#8211; asserted or recognized &#8211; may be affected by 
government action and, where appropriate, to accommodate those rights.30 The Special 
Rapporteur repeatedly heard from aboriginal leaders that they were not opposed to 
development in their lands generally and went to great lengths to participate in such 
consultation processes as were available, but that those were generally inadequate, not 
designed to address aboriginal and treaty rights, and usually took place at a stage when 
project proposals had already been developed. There appears to be a lack of a consistent 
framework or policy for the implementation of this duty to consult, which is contributing to 
an atmosphere of contentiousness and mistrust that is conducive neither to beneficial 
economic development nor social peace.  
</p>
<p>72. The federal Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the duty to consult 
and accommodate in connection with resource development projects could be met through 
existing processes, such as the environmental assessment process. Since the passage of the 
controversial 2012 Jobs, Growth and Long Term Prosperity omnibus legislation, discussed 
above, fewer projects require federal environmental assessments. When they do occur, they 
often require indigenous governance institutions &#8211; already overburdened with paperwork &#8211; 
to respond within relatively short time frames to what has been described as a 
&#8220;bombardment&#8221; of notices of proposed development; the onus is placed on them to carry 
out studies and develop evidence identifying and supporting their concerns. Indigenous 
governments then deliver these concerns to a federally appointed review panel that may 
have little understanding of aboriginal rights jurisprudence or concepts and that reportedly 
operates under a very formal, adversarial process with little opportunity for real dialogue. 
</p>
<p>73. Indigenous representatives made the Special Rapporteur aware of a number of 
proposed or implemented development projects that they felt posed great risks to their 
communities and about which they felt their concerns had not been adequately heard, or 
addressed. They include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the British Columbia coast 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline twinning project 
&#8226; The New Prosperity open-pit gold and copper mine in unceded Tsilhqot&#8217;in 
</p>
<p>traditional territory, which was twice rejected by an environmental assessment panel 
&#8226; The Fortune Minerals open-pit coal mine permit, which issued over 16,000 hectares 
</p>
<p>of unceded traditional territory of the Tahltan Nation in British Columbia 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Liquid Natural Gas pipeline and drill wells in northern British Columbia in 
Treaty 8 nations&#8217; traditional territory 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Site C hydroelectric dam on the Peace River affecting Treaty 8 nations 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Athabascan oil sands project, which is contaminating waters used by the 
downstream Athabasca First Nation 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Platinex project in Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug (KI) First Nation traditional 
territory, in which a lack of prior consultation resulted in bidirectional litigation and

</b></p>
<p>the imprisonment of community leaders for mounting a blockade to protect their

</p>
<p>&#8226; The clean-up, remediation and compensation process for six bitumen oil spills 
resulting from steam injection extraction in Cold Lake First Nation traditional

</p>
<p>&#8226; Two proposed hydroelectric dams affecting the Pimicikamak Nation, despite 
implementation failures of the Northern Flood Agreement that was intended to 
mitigate the effects of the last hydroelectric dam that flooded and eroded their lands 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The reopening of a Hudbay nickel/gold mine in Mathias Columb First Nation 
traditional territory without consultation with, the consent of, or a benefits-sharing 
agreement with that nation 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The construction of the Fairford and Portage Diversion water-control structures, and 
the lack of imminent flood protection, flooding and relocation of the Lake St. Martin 
First Nation in 2011 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Approval of the construction of the Jumbo Glacier Resort in an unceded area of 
spiritual significance to the Ktunaxa Nation 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Authorization of forestry operations in Mitchikanibikok Inik traditional territory 
(Algonquins of Barriere Lake) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Setting the percentage of the salmon fishery allocated to aboriginal uses (social and 
commercial) without consultation with affected First Nations 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Seismic testing for natural gas &#8220;fracking&#8221; extraction in Elsipogtog First Nation 
traditional territory. 
</p>
<p>74. Since natural resources on public lands are owned and regulated by provincial 
governments, while &#8220;Indians and lands reserved for Indians&#8221; are a federal jurisdiction, 
Canada&#8217;s duty to consult and, when appropriate, accommodate indigenous peoples with 
rights and interests over lands where development is proposed implicates both orders of 
government. As a practical matter, however, it appears that resource companies themselves 
organize the consultations, where they occur. The federal Government has acknowledged 
that it lacks a consistent consultation protocol or policy to provide guidance to provinces 
and companies concerning the level of consultation and forms of accommodation required 
by the constitutional duty to consult. 
</p>
<p>75. There are some positive developments around the duty to consult, primarily at the 
provincial level. In Ontario, the negotiation of community-specific impact and benefit 
agreements with resource companies is becoming common and expected by indigenous 
communities. Ontario has also amended its Mining Act and Green Energy Act to require 
increased consultation and accommodation to protect aboriginal rights, and notice prior to 
any mineral claim staking. Manitoba has created a Crown-Aboriginal Consultation 
Participation Fund to facilitate aboriginal participation in consultations, and is treating its 
Interim Provincial Policy and Guidelines for Crown Consultations as a work in progress 
pending further feedback and dialogue with aboriginal nations. In Nova Scotia, indigenous 
nations have worked with the provincial and federal governments to develop terms of 
reference for consultations. The federal Government is also working with a number of 
provinces on framework agreements or memorandums to improve the clarity and 
consistency of consultation processes. 
</p>
<p>76. However, the indigenous representative with whom the Special Rapporteur met 
expressed concern that, generally speaking, provincial governments did not engage with the 
duty to consult until development proposals had largely taken shape. When consultation </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>happened, resource companies had often already invested in exploration and viability 
studies, baseline studies were no longer possible, and accommodation of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; concerns required a deviation from companies&#8217; plans. The Special Rapporteur 
notes that this situation creates an unnecessarily adversarial framework of opposing 
interests, rather than facilitating the common creation of mutually beneficial development 
plans. 
</p>
<p>77. It is worth referencing other positive initiatives at the provincial level in the area of 
resource extraction that encourage indigenous participation in economic development 
activities and benefits. For example, Ontario has a loan guarantee programme to facilitate 
joint ventures in green energy development by First Nations and provides funding for them 
to obtain third-party, professional advice to assess the feasibility and viability of a proposed 
partnership. Ontario also funds the M&#233;tis Voyageur Development Fund for M&#233;tis-led 
resource development. In Alberta, industry groups point to a number of joint ventures with 
First Nations in the energy sector, such as Kainai Energy oil and gas development company 
of the Blood Tribe and Tribal North Energy Services of Whitefish Lake First Nation. In 
British Columbia and other parts of the country, governments encourage impact benefit and 
resource-sharing agreements between resource companies and First Nations. British 
Columbia also has revenue-sharing arrangements for mining royalties, stumpage fees, and 
oil and gas revenues. The Special Rapporteur is concerned, however, about the province of 
Saskatchewan&#8217;s position against revenue-sharing directly with First Nations on the ground 
that resources are for all residents of Saskatchewan.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>78. <b>Canada was one of the first countries in the modern era to extend constitutional 
protection to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. This constitutional protection has provided a 
strong foundation for advancing indigenous peoples&#8217; rights over the last 30 years, 
especially through the courts.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Federal and provincial governments have made notable efforts to address 
treaty and aboriginal claims, and to improve the social and economic well-being of 
indigenous peoples. Canada has also addressed some of the concerns that were raised 
by the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor following his visit in 2003. Moreover, 
Canada has adopted the goal of reconciliation to repair the legacy of past injustices 
and has taken steps towards that goal.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>But despite positive steps, daunting challenges remain. Canada faces a 
continuing crisis when it comes to the situation of indigenous peoples of the country. 
The well-being gap between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in Canada has not 
narrowed over the last several years, treaty and aboriginal claims remain persistently 
unresolved, indigenous women and girls remain vulnerable to abuse, and overall there 
appear to be high levels of distrust among indigenous peoples towards government at 
both the federal and provincial levels.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The numerous initiatives that have been taken at the federal and 
provincial/territorial levels to address the problems faced by indigenous peoples have 
been insufficient. Aboriginal peoples&#8217; concerns and well-being merit higher priority at 
all levels and within all branches of government, and across all departments. 
Concerted measures, based on mutual understanding and real partnership with 
aboriginal peoples, through their own representative institutions, are vital to 
establishing long-term solutions. To that end, it is necessary for Canada to arrive at a 
common understanding with aboriginal peoples of objectives and goals that are based 
on full respect for their constitutional, treaty and internationally-recognized rights. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which has 
been endorsed by Canada, provides a common framework within which the issues 
faced by indigenous peoples in the country can be addressed.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>On the basis of these conclusions and the observations in the present report, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends the following: 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Social and economic conditions 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Government should ensure sufficient funding for services for indigenous 
peoples both on and off reserve, including in areas of education, health and child 
welfare, in the light of the rights and significant needs of indigenous peoples and the 
geographic remoteness of many indigenous communities; and insure that the quality 
of these services is at least equal to that provided to other Canadians.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Federal, provincial and aboriginal governments should improve upon their 
coordination in the delivery of services. Continued efforts should be made to support 
indigenous-run and culturally appropriate social and judicial services, and to 
strengthen and expand programmes that have already demonstrated successes. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Canada must take urgent action to address the housing crisis in indigenous 
communities both on and off reserve, especially communities in the north, and 
dedicate increased funding towards this end. In particular, the Government as a 
matter of urgency should work with Inuit representatives to ensure affordable, 
sustainable and adequate housing in the Arctic, and to design and construct housing 
to adapt to the region&#8217;s environment and culture.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Government should work with indigenous peoples to enhance education 
opportunities for them, and in particular should consult with indigenous peoples, 
through their representative institutions, to address any outstanding concerns they 
may have related to the proposed First Nations Education Act, including with respect 
to adequate funding.  
</b></p>
<p><b>2. Truth and reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Government should ensure that the mandate of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission is extended for as long as may be necessary for it to 
complete its work, and should consider establishing means of reconciliation and 
redress for survivors of all types of residential schools. </b></p>
<p><b>3. Missing women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Bearing in mind the important steps already taken to inquire into the 
disturbing phenomenon of missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls and to 
develop measures to address this problem, the federal Government should undertake 
a comprehensive, nationwide inquiry into the issue of missing and murdered 
aboriginal women and girls, organized in consultation with indigenous peoples.  
</b></p>
<p><b>4. Self-government, participation and partnership 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Any existing legal barriers to the effective exercise of indigenous self-
government, including those in the Indian Act, should be removed, and effective 
measures should be taken to build indigenous governance capacity. Canada should 
continue to engage in, and adequately fund, meaningful negotiations to transfer 
governance responsibilities to First Nations, Inuit and M&#233;tis governments and to 
financially support, at adequate levels, the development and operation of indigenous 
self-governance institutions. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/52/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>In consultation with indigenous authorities, the Government should take 
measures to streamline reporting procedures under contribution agreements to 
alleviate unnecessary or overlapping reporting requirements. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>New laws, policies and programmes that affect indigenous peoples should be 
developed in consultation and true partnership with them. The federal and 
provincial/territorial governments should not push forward with laws, policies or 
programmes where significant opposition by indigenous governments and leadership 
still exists. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>With respect to legislation recently passed&#8212;including the Safe Drinking Water 
for First Nations Act, the Family Homes on Reserves and Matrimonial Interests or 
Rights Act, and the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity omnibus legislation&#8212;
Canada should ensure that these laws are only implemented following meaningful 
consultation, with a view to obtaining the consent of the indigenous peoples to which 
they will apply, and with accommodation of their concerns. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Concerted efforts should be taken to address outstanding concerns related to 
gender discrimination in determining eligibility for registration under the Indian Act, 
and to adopt where possible a more flexible approach that takes into account 
indigenous peoples&#8217; own criteria for membership. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The federal Government should work with indigenous peoples in international 
border areas, in particular the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne, to remove barriers to 
their free movement within their traditional territories. 
</b></p>
<p><b>5. Treaty negotiation and claims processes 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Concerted measures should be adopted to deal with the outstanding problems 
that have impeded progress with the treaty negotiation and claims processes. 
Moreover, within these processes the Government should take a less adversarial, 
position-based approach than the one in which it typically seeks the most restrictive 
interpretation of aboriginal and treaty rights possible. In this regard, the Government 
should instead acknowledge that the public interest is not opposed to, but rather 
includes, aboriginal concerns.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Canada should take active measures to develop a procedure for addressing 
outstanding M&#233;tis land claims, to avoid having to litigate cases individually, and enter 
into negotiations with M&#233;tis representatives to reach agreements towards this end. 
</b></p>
<p><b>6. Resource development 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>In accordance with the Canadian Constitution and relevant international 
human rights standards, as a general rule resource extraction should not occur on 
lands subject to aboriginal claims without adequate consultations with and the free, 
prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned. Also, Canada should 
endeavour to put in place a policy framework for implementing the duty to consult 
that allows for indigenous peoples&#8217; genuine input and involvement at the earliest 
stages of project development. 
</b>99. <b>Resource development projects, where they occur, should be fully consistent 
with aboriginal and treaty rights, and should in no case be prejudicial to unsettled 
claims. The federal and provincial governments should strive to maximize the control 
of indigenous peoples themselves over extractive operations on their lands and the 
development of benefits derived therefrom.
