[15 December 2009] 
</p>
<p>1. The Government of Cyprus provided a comprehensive report prepared by the Legal 
Unit of the Ministry of Justice and Public Order on the anti-discrimination work carried out 
during the last decades, and more systematically since May 2004 when Cyprus joined the 
European Union (EU), by all competent national authorities and stakeholders. Cyprus 
provided details on legislation, structural changes, and a series of awareness-raising 
activities such as educational and housing programmes, campaigns, conferences, seminars 
and other organized events, studies, and research on attitudes. 
</p>
<p>2. In terms of legislation, Cyprus has ratified most European and United Nations 
conventions and protocols relating to discrimination, including the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Protocol 12 to the 
European Convention on Human Rights, the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime 
and its Additional Protocol concerning the criminalization of acts of a racist and 
xenophobic nature committed through computer systems. Further, Cyprus has enacted 
important legislation to harmonize national law with the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, including 
relevant European Union Council Directives, such as 2000/43/EC implementing the 
principle of equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, 2000/78/EC establishing 
a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, 2003/9/EC which 
lays down the minimum standards for the reception of asylum-seekers, and 2004/113/EC 
implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and 
supply of goods and services. 
</p>
<p>3. In addition, the enjoyment of human rights and freedoms is guaranteed by the 
Constitution, which also provides that violation of human rights is an actionable right 
which can be pursued in civil courts against those perpetrating the violation in order to 
recover, inter alia, just and reasonable compensation for pecuniary or non-pecuniary 
damage suffered as a result, as established by case law since 2001. In 2004, a law was 
enacted vesting the independent Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman) with 
special competences, duties, and powers for combating and eliminating discrimination in 
both public and private sectors. In 2006, an independent agency was created by law for 
investigating complaints against police misconduct (including human rights violations). 
</p><p>4. In terms of structural changes, two separate authorities were created, namely, the 
Cyprus Anti-Discrimination Body and the Equality Authority, which, together comprise the 
Cyprus Equality Body under the Ombudsman. When certain criteria are met, the 
Ombudsman is granted the power to issue decisions which are binding on the parties; 
however, in cases where the guilty party does not abide by such decisions, the Ombudsman 
does not have the power to refer him/her to court. 
</p>
<p>5. Following the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the Ministry of Justice and Public Order in 
collaboration with the Law Commissioner and President of the National Organisation for 
the Protection of Human Rights, the Attorney-General, the Ombudsman, and all other key 
actors, prepared in 2002 a national report on the implementation of the conclusions of the 
European and World Conferences against Racism. The national report included a chapter 
containing a National Action Plan against Racism which provided for a significant 
opportunity to build upon and enhance existing policies and strategies to combat racism in </p>

<p>Cyprus and to identify new priorities, aspirations and areas of work. Further, the Ministry 
of Labour and Social Insurance prepared a National Plan for Employment for the period 
2004&#8211;2006 which included policies and measures to combat discrimination against people 
at a disadvantage in the labour market. The Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance also 
adopted in July 2004 a National Action Plan for Social Inclusion for the period 2004&#8211;2006, 
which incorporated all policies for the successful harmonization of Cyprus with the general 
European targets, mainly the EU Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. Moreover, within 
the framework of national policies for people with disabilities for the period 2004&#8211;2006 the 
Service for the Welfare of the Disabled had introduced three new schemes, co-financed by 
the European Social Fund, aiming to strengthen infrastructures to facilitate social inclusion 
and professional rehabilitation of adults with visual disabilities and to provide employment 
incentives for persons with disabilities. Finally, a National Action Plan on Gender Equality 
for the years 2007&#8211;2013 has recently been drawn up on the basis of the Beijing Platform for 
Action, as well as EU policies, aiming at a holistic approach to gender equality issues and 
the implementation of gender mainstreaming in six priority areas. 
</p>
<p>6. In terms of awareness-raising activities, Cyprus has organized a number of seminars 
and conferences, disseminated information material on human rights issues, and launched 
an information campaign &#8220;For Diversity against Discrimination&#8221;, including events and 
activities such as an award for journalists, a poster competition, and workshops for 
journalists. 
</p><p>7. Cyprus also provided an extensive list of good practices in the area of combating 
discrimination, racism, intolerance and xenophobia, and also identified some key 
challenges, such as funding inadequacies, staff shortages and a heavy workload of claims 
submitted to the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office.
