4.      
Summary of facts, as admitted by you before the court, revealed that you have committed these nine counts on three separate occasions on 12th, 13th and 18th of April 2009. You opened a factitious account at Westpac bank, MHCC,Thompson Street Suva on 27th of March 2009 under the name of Rajesh Lal by using his birth certificate. You obtained his date of birth and his father's name with a promise that you would arrange Mr. Lal's driving license and his birth certificate. Upon opening this factitious account at Westpac Bank you forged the signature of Mr. Lal on three bank cheque leaf numbers of 9802151424, 000030, and 000034 for the sum of $ 400, $ 475, and $ 600 respectively on those cheque on 12th, 18th of April 2009. Having done such, you asked one of your staff namely Zareen Shabnam Ali to produce those cheque to the SuperFood Supermarket and cashed them. 

5.      
These offences are involved with well calculated and pre- meditated deception and dishonesty by the accused person. You planed these crimes in most scandalous manner by using the trust of several persons including your own staff members and implemented it without any remorse. These kinds of crimes certainly undermine the mutual trustworthiness in the relationship between the customer and the banker in bank transaction in the commercial sector which is one of significant pillars of the economy of the country. 

6.      
Having considered the summery of fact and the aggravating circumstances in this case, I now turn to the purposes of sentencing you in this case. I emphasized that the main purposes of sentencing you in this case is to punish offenders to an extend and in a manner which is just in all the circumstance, to protect the community from offender in this nature, to deter offenders from committing offences of similar nature, and to signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of offences in this nature.

7.      
I now direct myself to consider appropriate sentence on you upon considering the general principle of sentencing under Section 15 (3) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and objective of sentencing under section 4 (1) and 4 (2) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. Further I act in pursuant of section 17 of the sentencing and penalties decree as these offences founded on same facts and / or form s series of offences of the same or similar characters. 

8.      
It was held that the tariff for the offence obtaining money by false pretence is 18 months to 5 years (State v Sinha - Sentence [2010] FJHC 589; HAC15.2009L (10 December 2010). It was held in Vinod Prasad v State (2008, HAA 012/08S Ruling 18 April 2008) that 2 years imprisonment term was within the tariff.

9.      
 The tariff for breach of trust sentences ranges from 18 months to 3 ½ years imprisonment. ( State v Bole, High Court of Fiji Criminal Case No. HAC 38 of 2005S (4 October 2005). 

10.     
In view of above judicial precedents and provisions of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and careful perusal of the summery of facts I select 2 years as starting point for the sentencing you for these offences. 

11.     
I now draw my attention to address the mitigating factors in your favors. 

i.      
 You are 47 years of age, married with three teenage children,

ii.     
Your early plea of guilt, 

iii.

iv.     
Remorseful and seek forgiveness,

v.      
Promise not to re offend,

vi.     
Seeking concurrent sentence with the present prison term, 

12.     
 In view of aforementioned aggravating factors I increase 3 years, to reach the period of 5 years. In considering your early guilty plea and other mitigating factors, I reduce 2 and six months to reach the period of two years and six month (30 months). According to section 26 (2) (b) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree sentence which is above two years could not be suspended by this court. 

13.

14.     
Accordingly, I sentence you 30 months imprisonment period for the three counts of forgery contrary to section 335 (1) of the Penal Code act 17, three counts of uttering forged document contrary to section 343(1) of the Penal Code Act 17 and three counts of Obtaining money by false pretence contrary to section 309 (1) of the Penal code Act 17 to be served concurrent with the current prison term.
