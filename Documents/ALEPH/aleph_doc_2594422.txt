TIDELANDS ROYALTY TRUST “B” AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
Note 1. Accounting Policies
The financial statements herein include the financial statements of Tidelands Royalty Trust “B”
(the “Trust”) and Tidelands Royalty “B” Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiary (“Tidelands
Corporation,” and collectively with the Trust, “Tidelands”). The financial statements are
condensed and consolidated and should be read in conjunction with Tidelands’ Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The financial statements included herein
are unaudited, but in the opinion of Southwest Bank (the “Trustee”), the Trustee of the Trust, they
include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the
periods presented. Operating results for the interim periods reported herein are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.
Note 2. Basis of Accounting
The financial statements of Tidelands are prepared on the modified cash basis method and are
not intended to present Tideland’s financial position and results of operations in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Under the modified cash
basis method the financial statements of Tidelands differ from financial statements prepared in
conformity with GAAP because of the following:
•  Royalty income is recognized in the month when received by Tidelands rather than in the
month of production.
•  Tidelands’ expenses (including accounting, legal, other professional fees, trustees’ fees
and out-of-pocket expenses) are recorded on an actual paid basis in the month paid
rather than in the month incurred. Reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain
in amount may also be established if considered necessary, which would not be recorded
under GAAP.
•  At the time the Trust was established, no determinable market value was available for the
assets transferred to the Trust; consequently, nominal values were assigned.
Accordingly, no allowance for depletion has been included. All income from oil and
natural gas royalties relate to proved developed oil and natural gas reserves.
The modified cash basis method of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles
permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as
specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts.
Note 3. Distributable Income
The Trust’s Indenture, as amended (the “Indenture”), provides that the Trustee is to distribute all
cash in the Trust, less an amount reserved for payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future
expenses, to unitholders of record on the last business day of March, June, September and
December of each year. Such payments are to be made within 15 days after the record date.
As stated under “Note 1. Accounting Policies” above, the financial statements in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q are the condensed and consolidated financial statements of the Trust and
Tidelands Corporation. However, distributable income is paid from the account balances of the
Trust. Distributable income is comprised of (i) royalties from offshore Texas leases owned
directly by the Trust, (ii) 95% of the overriding royalties received by Tidelands Corporation from
offshore Louisiana leases owned by Tidelands Corporation, which are retained by and delivered
to the Trust on a quarterly basis, and (iii) dividends paid to the Trust by Tidelands Corporation,
less (iv) administrative expenses incurred by the Trust. Distributions fluctuate from quarter to
quarter primarily due to changes in oil and natural gas prices and production quantities.

Item 2. Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
Organization
Tidelands Royalty Trust “B” (the “Trust”) is a royalty trust that was created on June 1, 1954 under
the laws of the State of Texas. Southwest Bank, an independent state bank chartered under the
laws of the State of Texas and headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, serves as corporate trustee
(the “Trustee”). The Trust’s Indenture (the “Indenture”) provides that the term of the Trust will
expire on April 30, 2021, unless extended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding units of beneficial interest. The Trust is not permitted to engage in any business
activity because it was organized for the sole purpose of providing an efficient, orderly and
practical means for the administration and liquidation of rights to interests in certain oil, natural
gas or other mineral leases formerly owned by Gulf Oil Corporation (“Gulf”) in a designated area
of the Gulf of Mexico. These rights are evidenced by a contract between the Trust’s predecessors
and Gulf dated April 30, 1951 (the “1951 Contract”), which is binding upon the assignees of Gulf.
As a result of various transactions that have occurred since 1951, the rights to interests that were
subject to the 1951 Contract now are held by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (“Chevron”), which is a
subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, and its assignees. The Trust holds title to interests in
properties subject to the 1951 Contract that are situated offshore of Texas.
The Trust’s wholly owned subsidiary, Tidelands Royalty “B” Corporation (“Tidelands
Corporation,” and collectively with the Trust, “Tidelands”), holds title to interests in properties
subject to the 1951 Contract that are situated offshore of Louisiana because at the time the Trust
was created, trusts could not hold these interests under Louisiana law. Tidelands Corporation is
prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and only takes those actions that are necessary
for the administration and liquidation of its properties.
Tidelands’ rights are generally referred to as overriding royalty interests in the oil and natural gas
industry. An overriding royalty interest is created by an assignment by the owner of a working
interest in an oil or natural gas lease. The royalty rights associated with an overriding royalty
interest terminate when the underlying lease terminates. All production and marketing functions
are conducted by the working interest owners of the leases. Income from the overriding royalties
is paid to Tidelands either (i) on the basis of the selling price of oil, natural gas and other
minerals produced, saved or sold or (ii) at the value at the wellhead as determined by industry
standards, when the selling price does not reflect the value at the wellhead.
The Trustee assumes that some units of beneficial interest are held by middlemen, as such term
is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint
owners and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name). Therefore, the Trustee
considers the Trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust (“WHFIT”) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Accordingly, the Trust will provide tax information in accordance with applicable
U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a
WHFIT. The Trustee will provide the required information and the contact information for the
Trustee is below:
Southwest Bank
2911 Turtle Creek Blvd., Suite 850
Dallas, Texas 75219
Telephone number: (855) 588-7939
Each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor for compliance with U.S. federal income tax
laws and regulations.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As stated in the Indenture, there is no requirement for capital due to the limited purpose of the
Trust. The Trust’s only obligation is to distribute the distributable income that is actually collected
to unitholders. As an administrator of oil and natural gas royalty interests, the Trust collects
royalties monthly, pays administrative expenses and disburses all net royalties that are collected
to its unitholders each quarter.
The Indenture (and Tidelands Corporation’s charter and by-laws) expressly prohibits the
operation of any kind of trade or business. The Trust’s oil and natural gas properties are
depleting assets that are not being replaced due to the prohibition against investments. These
restrictions, along with other factors, allow the Trust to be treated as a grantor trust. As a grantor
trust, all income and deductions for state and U.S. federal income tax purposes generally flow
through to each individual unitholder. The State of Texas imposes a franchise tax, but the Trust
does not believe that it is subject to the franchise tax because at least 90% of its income is from
passive sources. Please see Tidelands’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 for further information. Tidelands Corporation is a taxable entity that pays
U.S. federal income taxes and state franchise taxes. However, Tidelands Corporation’s income
specifically excludes 95% of the oil and natural gas royalties collected by Tidelands Corporation,
which are retained by and delivered to the Trust because of the Trust’s net profits interest.

The Leases
5
As of August 1, 2016, Tidelands had an overriding royalty interest in four oil and natural gas
leases covering 17,188 gross acres in the Gulf of Mexico in the Sabine Pass and West Cameron
areas. As of August 1, 2016 all four of Tidelands’ assigned leases contained active wells. As of
November 1, 2013, the wells on West Cameron Block 225 were shut-in and remain shut-in. As a
royalty owner, Tidelands does not participate in operating decisions and has not received
information from the working interest owners, ENI Petroleum USA LLC or Mariner Energy
Resources, Inc., regarding the shut-in status of the wells on West Cameron Block 225. Tidelands’
overriding royalty interest on three of the four leases is 4.1662%. On the fourth lease, the
overriding royalty interest is 1.0416%. The overriding royalty interest on the fourth lease is lower
because Chevron only acquired a 25% working interest in the lease. These leases and related
overriding royalty interests are identified in the table below:

Based on the latest public records reviewed by Tidelands, there are seven active oil or natural
gas wells that had production during the past 12 months on leases that are subject to Tidelands’
overriding royalty interest based on the records of the Bureau of Ocean Energy, Management,
Regulation and Enforcement, a division of the U.S. government. The wells vary in age from
approximately four years to fourteen years. Information on each of the seven wells is presented in

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
In accordance with the Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty
Trusts, Tidelands uses the modified cash basis method of accounting. Under this accounting
method, royalty income is recorded when received and distributions to unitholders are recorded
when declared by the Trustee of the Trust. Expenses of Tidelands (including accounting, legal,
other professional fees, trustees’ fees and out-of-pocket expenses) are recorded on an actual
paid basis. Tidelands also reports distributable income instead of net income under the modified
cash basis method of accounting. Cash reserves are permitted to be established by the Trustee
for certain contingencies that would not be recorded under generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States.
Tidelands did not have any changes in its critical accounting policies or estimates during the six
months ended June 30, 2016. Please see Tidelands’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 for a detailed discussion of its critical accounting policies.
New Accounting Pronouncements
There are no new pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on Tidelands’
financial statements.
General
Tidelands’ royalty income is derived from the oil and natural gas production activities of third
parties. Tidelands’ royalty income fluctuates from period to period based upon factors beyond
Tidelands’ control, including, without limitation, the number of productive wells drilled and
maintained on leases that are subject to Tidelands’ interest, the level of production over time from
such wells and the prices at which the oil and natural gas from such wells are sold.
Important aspects of Tidelands’ operations are conducted by third parties. Tidelands’ royalty
income is dependent on the operations of the working interest owners of the leases on which
Tidelands has an overriding royalty interest. The oil and natural gas companies that lease tracts
subject to Tidelands’ interests are responsible for the production and sale of oil and natural gas
and the calculation of royalty payments to Tidelands. The only obligation of the working interest
owners to Tidelands is to make monthly overriding royalty payments that reflect Tidelands’
interest in the oil and natural gas sold. Tidelands’ distributions are processed and paid by its
transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC.
The volume of oil and natural gas produced and the selling prices of oil and natural gas are the
primary factors in calculating overriding royalty payments. Production is affected by the natural
production decline of the producing wells, the number of new wells drilled, and the number of
existing wells that are re-worked and placed back in production on the leases. Production from
existing wells is anticipated to decrease in the future due to normal well depletion. The operators
do not provide Tidelands with information regarding future drilling or re-working operations that
could impact the oil and natural gas production from the leases for which Tidelands has an
overriding royalty interest.
Summary of Operating Results
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Tidelands realized approximately 73% of its royalty
income from the sale of oil and approximately 27% of its royalty income from the sale of natural
gas. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, Tidelands realized approximately 57% of its
royalty income from the sale of oil and approximately 43% of its royalty income from the sale of
natural gas. Royalty income includes royalties from oil and natural gas received from producers.
Distributable income per unit for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $0.02 from
$0.05 for the comparable period in 2015. Distributions per unit amounted to $0.06 for the six
months June 30, 2016, down from $0.14 for the comparable period in 2015. During the six
months ended June 30, 2016, the difference between distributable income per unit and
distributions per unit resulted from timing differences between the closing of the financial
statements and the determination date of the distributions to unitholders.

Results of Operations – Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Three
Months Ended June 30, 2015
Income from oil and natural gas royalties decreased to $35,738 during the three months ended
June 30, 2016 from $76,533 realized for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease was
primarily due to a decrease in the production of natural gas and a decrease in the price of oil and
natural gas.
Distributable loss increased to $34,323 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a
distributable loss of $3,999 for the comparable period in 2015. As a result, after the payment of
expenses, there were no funds available for distribution on July 14, 2016 to the unitholders of
record as of June 30, 2016.
Income from oil royalties decreased to $26,697 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from
$39,574 realized for the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the price of
oil. The volume of oil sold in the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to 889 bbls from
819 bbls realized for the comparable period in 2015, and the average price realized for oil
decreased to $30.03 per bbl for the three months ended June 30, 2016 from $48.32 per bbl
realized for the comparable period in 2015.
Income from natural gas royalties decreased to $9,041 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
from $36,959 realized for the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the price
and production of natural gas. The volume of natural gas sold in the three months ended
June 30, 2016 decreased to 5,979 mcf from 12,263 mcf realized for the comparable period in
2015, and the average price realized for natural gas decreased to $1.51 per mcf from $3.01 per
mcf realized for the comparable period in 2015.

Results of Operations – Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Six Months
Ended June 30, 2015
Income from oil and natural gas royalties decreased to $117,939 during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 from $166,545 realized for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease was
primarily due to a decrease in the price of oil and natural gas and a decrease in the production of
natural gas, offset by an increase in the production of oil.
Distributable income decreased to $24,586 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
$68,544 for the comparable period in 2015.
Income from oil royalties decreased to $86,371 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from
$95,344 realized for the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the price of
oil. The volume of oil sold in the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased to 2,418 bbls from
1,613 bbls realized for the comparable period in 2015, and the average price realized for oil
decreased to $35.72 per bbl for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $59.11 per bbl realized
for the comparable period in 2015.
Income from natural gas royalties decreased to $31,568 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
from $71,201 realized for the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the price
of natural gas. The volume of natural gas sold in the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased
to 18,349 mcf from 21,210 mcf realized for the comparable period in 2015, and the average price
realized for natural gas decreased to $1.72 per mcf from $3.36 per mcf realized for the
comparable period in 2015.
The following table presents the quantities of oil and natural gas sold and the average price
realized for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

General and administrative expenses decreased to $90,364 for the six months ended June 30,
2016 from $98,011 for the comparable period in 2015 primarily due to the timing of payments of,
and a reduction in, professional fees and expenses paid in the quarter.
Forward-Looking Statements
The statements discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding Tidelands’ future
financial performance and results, and other statements that are not historical facts, are forward-
looking statements as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). This
report uses the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “plan,” or other similar words to identify forward-looking statements. You should read
statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations, contain
projections of Tidelands’ financial condition, and/or state other “forward-looking” information.
Actual results may differ from expected results because of: reductions in prices or demand for oil
and natural gas, which might then lead to decreased production; reductions in production due to
the depletion of existing wells or disruptions in service, which may be caused by storm damage
to production facilities, blowouts or other production accidents, or geological changes such as
cratering of productive formations; changes in regulations; general economic conditions; actions
and policies of petroleum producing nations; other changes in domestic and international energy
markets; the resignation of the Trustee; and the expiration, termination or release of leases
subject to Tidelands’ interests. Additional risks are set forth in Tidelands’ Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated by the risks set forth in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Events may occur in the future that Tidelands is unable to accurately
predict, or over which it has no control. If one or more of these uncertainties materialize, or if
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those forward-
looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by
applicable securities laws, Tidelands does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Southwest Bank, as Trustee of the Trust, is responsible for establishing and maintaining
Tidelands’ disclosure controls and procedures. Tidelands’ disclosure controls and procedures
include controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by Tidelands in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Tidelands in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Trustee as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of June 30, 2016, the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of Tidelands’ disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-
15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Trustee concluded that Tidelands’
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in Tidelands’ internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, Tidelands’ internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed under the
heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Tidelands’ Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, other than as set forth below:
Oil and natural gas prices, which are subject to fluctuations, have declined substantially
from historical highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. The
depression in oil and natural gas prices has resulted in, and is expected to continue to
result in, lower royalty payments to Tidelands and lower cash distributions to its
unitholders.
Tidelands’ quarterly distributions are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of
oil and natural gas. During 2015 and 2016, oil and natural gas prices experienced a significant
decline and the depression of oil and natural gas prices may continue for the foreseeable future.
This decline in oil and natural gas prices has had, and could continue to have, a material
adverse effect on Tidelands’ distributable income. Any sustained decline in Tidelands’
distributable income would cause a decrease in the value of cash distributions to its unitholders
and could result in Tidelands being unable to make a cash distribution to its unitholders in one or
more quarters, as well as result in a decrease in the market price for the units. As a result of
recent declines in Tidelands’ distributable income, it was unable to make its scheduled July 2016
distribution to its unitholders of record as of June 30, 2016 because there were no funds
available for distribution after the payment of expenses.
Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile
in the future due to factors beyond Tidelands’ control. These factors include, but are not limited
to:
•  political conditions worldwide, in particular political disruption, terrorist activities, war or
other armed conflicts in oil producing regions, especially in the Middle East;
•  worldwide economic conditions;
•  weather conditions;
•  the supply and price of domestic and foreign oil and natural gas;
•  the level of consumer demand;
•  the price and availability of alternative fuels;
•  the proximity to, and capacity of, transportation facilities; and
•  the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures.
Moreover, government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price
controls, can affect oil and natural gas product prices in the long term.
The volatility of oil and natural gas prices reduces the predictability of future cash distributions to
unitholders. Substantially all of the oil and natural gas produced from the Royalty Area is being
sold under short-term or multi-month contracts at market clearing prices or on the spot market.
