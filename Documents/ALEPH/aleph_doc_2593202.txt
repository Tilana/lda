NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Basis of Presentation, Going Concern and Risks and Uncertainties
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes present the
financial position of Seventy Seven Energy Inc. (“SSE,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “ours”) as
of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, results of operations for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, changes in equity for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These notes relate to the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 (the “Current Quarter” and “Current Period,” respectively) and
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 (the “Prior Quarter” and “Prior Period,”
respectively). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions within SSE have been
eliminated.
Seventy Seven Finance Inc. (“SSF”) is a 100% owned finance subsidiary of SSE that was
incorporated for the purpose of facilitating the offering of SSE’s 2019 Notes (see Note 9). SSF
does not have any operations or revenues.
On June 7, 2016 (the “Petition Date”), SSE and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed
voluntary petitions for relief (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) under Chapter 11 of the United States
Code (“Chapter 11” or the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”), case number 16-11409. The Debtors continued to
operate their business as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court
and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the
Bankruptcy Court. The subsidiary Debtors in these Chapter 11 cases were Seventy Seven
Operating LLC (“SSO”), Seventy Seven Land Company LLC, Seventy Seven Finance Inc.,
Performance Technologies, L.L.C., PTL Prop Solutions, L.L.C., Western Wisconsin Sand
Company, LLC, Nomac Drilling, L.L.C., SSE Leasing LLC, Keystone Rock & Excavation, L.L.C.
and Great Plains Oilfield Rental, L.L.C, which represent all the subsidiaries of SSE. On July 14,
2016, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Joint Pre-
packaged Plan of Reorganization (as amended and supplemented, the “Plan”) of the Debtors. On
August 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the
Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 cases.
Although the Company is no longer a debtor-in-possession, the Company was a debtor-in-
possession for a portion of the quarter ended June 30, 2016. As such, certain aspects of the
bankruptcy proceedings of the Company and related matters are described below in order to
provide context and explain part of our financial condition and results of operations for the period
presented.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information. All material adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) which, in
the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods
have been reflected. Certain footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP have been appropriately condensed or omitted. Therefore,
these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 contained in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K (Commission File No. 333-187766) filed with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 17, 2016.
Going Concern
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming that SSE will continue as a going concern and
contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of
business. Our ability to continue as a going concern, however, is contingent upon, among other
factors, the Debtors’ ability to satisfy the remaining conditions to effectiveness contemplated
under the Plan and to implement such plan of reorganization, including obtaining any exit
financing. We satisfied the remaining conditions to effectiveness under the Plan and emerged
from Chapter 11 on August 1, 2016. See Note 21 for further discussion.
Risks and Uncertainties
We operate in a highly cyclical industry. The main factor influencing demand for oilfield services
is the level of drilling and completions activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely
on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production depletion rates.
Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and is subject to large and rapid fluctuations. When oil
and natural gas price increases occur, producers increase their capital expenditures, which
generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies. The increased
capital expenditures also ultimately result in
6
greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices that,
in turn, tend to reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, our results of operations
may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year.
The sustained decline in commodity prices since mid-2014 has dramatically reduced the level of
onshore United States drilling and completions activity and, consequently, the demand for our
services. The extent and length of the current down cycle continues to be uncertain and is
dependent on a number of economic, geopolitical and monetary policy factors that are outside our
control. Until there is a sustained recovery in commodity prices, we expect that reduced
equipment utilization levels and pricing pressure across each of our operating segments will
persist. If drilling and completions activity remains at depressed levels or worsens, it would likely
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations.
Historically, we have provided a significant percentage of our oilfield services to Chesapeake
Energy Corporation (“CHK”). For the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior
Period, CHK accounted for approximately 70%, 69%, 67% and 72%, respectively, of our total
revenues. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, CHK accounted for approximately 72%
and 65%, respectively, of our total accounts receivable. If CHK ceases to engage us on terms that
are attractive to us during any future period, our business, financial condition, cash flows and
results of operations would be materially adversely affected during such period.
2. Bankruptcy Proceedings and Related Events
On May 12, 2016, the Company and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Second
Amended and Restated Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Restructuring Support
Agreement”) with (i) certain noteholders of the 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2019 of SSO
and SSF (the “2019 Notes”), (ii) certain lenders under the Company’s Incremental Term
Supplement (Tranche A) loan (the “Incremental Term Loan”), (iii) certain lenders under the
Company’s $400.0 million Term Loan Credit Agreement dated June 25, 2014 (the “Term Loan”),
and (iv) certain noteholders of the 6.50% senior unsecured notes due 2022 of the Company (the
“2022 Notes”).
 
On June 7, 2016, the Debtors filed the Bankruptcy Petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11
in the Bankruptcy Court. The filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default
with respect to the 2019 Notes, the 2022 Notes, the Term Loan (see Note 9) and the Incremental
Term Loan (see Note 9) (collectively, the “Outstanding Debt”) and constituted an event of default
under our pre-petition revolving credit facility. Pursuant to Chapter 11, the filing of the Bankruptcy
Petitions automatically stayed most actions against the Debtors, including actions to collect
indebtedness incurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions or to exercise control over the
Debtor’s property. Accordingly, although the Bankruptcy Petitions triggered defaults under the
Outstanding Debt, creditors were generally stayed from taking action as a result of these defaults.
These defaults were deemed waived or cured upon the Effective Date of the Plan. The Debtors
also filed the Plan and a related solicitation and disclosure statement on June 7, 2016.
On July 14, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order. The Debtors satisfied the
remaining conditions to effectiveness contemplated under the Plan and emerged from Chapter 11
on August 1, 2016 (see Note 21).
The Plan contemplated that we continue our day-to-day operations substantially as currently
conducted and that all of our commercial and operational contracts remain in effect in accordance
with their terms preserving the rights of all parties. The significant elements of the Plan included:
•
•
•
•payment in full in the ordinary course of all trade creditors and other general unsecured creditors;
the exchange of the full $650.0 million of the 2019 Notes into 96.75% of our new common stock
issued in the reorganization (the “New Common Stock”);
the exchange of the full $450.0 million of the 2022 Notes for 3.25% of the New Common Stock
as well as
warrants exercisable for 15% of the New Common Stock at predetermined equity values;
the issuance to our existing common stockholders of two series of warrants exercisable for an
aggregate of 20% of the New Common Stock at predetermined equity values;
the maintenance of our $400.0 million existing secured Term Loan while the lenders holding
Term Loans (i) received (a) payment of an amount equal to 2% of the Term Loans; and (b) as
further security for the Term Loans, second-priority liens and security interests in the collateral
securing the company’s New ABL Credit Facility (as defined herein), which collateral, together
with the existing collateral securing the Term Loans and Tranche A Incremental Term Loans,
shall be governed by an inter-creditor agreement to be agreed by the applicable secured parties;
and (ii) continued to hold Term Loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended to
reflect, among other modifications, the shortening of the maturity date of the Term Loans by one
year and an affirmative covenant by the
•
7
Company to use commercially reasonably efforts to maintain credit ratings for the Term Loans,
which ratings the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain on the Effective
Date of the Plan; and
the payment of a consent fee equal to 2% of the Incremental Term Loan plus $15.0 million of the
outstanding Incremental Term Loan balance, together with the maintenance of the remaining
$84.0 million balance of the Incremental Term Loan on identical terms other than the suspension
of any prepayment premium for a period of 18 months.
•
The Plan effectuated, among other things, a substantial reduction in our debt, including $1.1
billion in the aggregate of the face amount of the 2019 Notes and 2022 Notes.
In accordance with the Plan, on the Effective Date, we issued an aggregate of 22,000,000 shares
of New Common Stock to holders of 2019 Notes and to holders of 2022 Notes.
In accordance with the Plan, on the Effective Date, we entered into a warrant agreement with
Computershare Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as the warrant agent, (the
“Warrant Agreement”) and issued three series of warrants to holders of 2022 Notes and to our
•
existing common stockholders:
We issued Series A Warrants (“Series A Warrants”), which are exercisable until August 1, 2021,
to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,882,353 shares of New Common Stock at an exercise price
of $23.82 per share, to holders of 2022 Notes.
We issued Series B Warrants (“Series B Warrants”), which are exercisable until August 1, 2021,
to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,875,817 shares of New Common Stock at an exercise price
of $69.08 per share, to our existing common stockholders. In addition, we issued Series C
Warrants (“Series C Warrants,” and, together with the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants,
the “Warrants”), which are exercisable until August 1, 2023, to purchase up to an aggregate of
3,195,352 shares of New Common Stock at an exercise price of $86.93 per share, to our existing
common stockholders.
•
All unexercised Warrants will expire, and the rights of the holders of such warrants (the “Warrant
Holders”) to purchase shares of New Common Stock will terminate on the first to occur of (i) the
close of business on their respective expiration dates or (ii) the date of completion of (A) any
Affiliated Asset Sale (as defined in the Warrant Agreement) or (B) a Change of Control (as
defined in the Warrant Agreement). Following the Effective Date, there are 3,882,353 Series A
Warrants, 2,875,817 Series B Warrants and 3,195,352 Series C Warrants outstanding.
The Plan provided that, subsequent to the Effective Date, the Company’s Board of Directors will
adopt and implement a management incentive plan pursuant to which certain officers and
employees of the reorganized SSE will be eligible to receive, in the aggregate, cash and/or
shares and/or options to acquire shares of New Common Stock up to 10% of the Company’s total
outstanding New Common Stock at the discretion of our reorganized Board of Directors.
Successor Issuer
Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), the Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants are deemed to be registered under Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company is deemed to be the successor registrant to the
Company in its state before the Effective Date. Such registration would expire on September 6,
2016, and we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A to effect the registration of the Series B
Warrants and Series C Warrants under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a result, the
Company remains subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act following the
Effective Date.
Delisting from the New York Stock Exchange
On May 17, 2016, the Company was notified by the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that
due to “abnormally low” trading price levels, pursuant to Section 802.01D of the NYSE’s Listed
Company Manual, the NYSE had determined to commence proceedings to delist its common
stock. Trading in the Company’s common stock was suspended immediately prior to the opening
of trading on May 17, 2016. On May 18, 2016, the Company’s common stock began trading on
the OTC Market Group Inc.’s OTC Pink market. The New Common Stock is not traded on a
national securities exchange. The Company can provide no assurance that the New Common
Stock will trade on a nationally recognized market or an over-the-counter market, whether broker-
dealers will provide public quotes of the reorganized Company’s common stock on an over-the-
counter market, whether the trading volume on an over-the-counter market of the Company’s
common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market or whether quotes for the
Company’s common stock may be blocked by the OTC Markets Group in the future.

Senior Secured Debtor-In-Possession Credit Agreement; New ABL Credit Facility
On June 8, 2016, in connection with the filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions, the Company, with
certain of our domestic subsidiaries as borrowers, entered into a senior secured debtor-in-
possession credit facility (the “DIP Facility”) with total commitments of $100.0 million. See Note 9
for additional discussion on the DIP Facility.
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the DIP Facility was amended and restated, and
the outstanding obligations pursuant thereto were converted to obligations under a senior
secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the
“New ABL Credit Facility”).
New Directors
On the Effective Date, in accordance with the Plan and pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement
that we entered into with certain stockholders on the Effective Date, Jerry Winchester and Edward
J. DiPaolo, who were existing directors of the Company, and Andrew Axelrod, Victor Danh,
Steven Hinchman, David King and Doug Wall became members of the Board until the first annual
meeting of the Company’s stockholders to be held in 2017, and their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.
Conversion to Delaware Corporation
Effective July 22, 2016, in accordance with the Plan and with the laws of the State of Delaware
and the State of Oklahoma, we converted our form of organization from an Oklahoma corporation
(the “Oklahoma Predecessor Corporation”) to a Delaware limited liability company and,
immediately thereafter, to a Delaware corporation (the “Delaware Successor Corporation”). As a
result of the conversions, the equity holders of the Oklahoma Predecessor Corporation are now
the equity holders of the Delaware Successor Corporation. The name of the Company remains
“Seventy Seven Energy Inc.”
For purposes of Delaware law, the Delaware Successor Corporation is deemed to be the same
entity as the Company before the conversions, and its existence is deemed to have commenced
on the date of original incorporation of the Company. Furthermore, under Delaware law, the
rights, assets, operations, liabilities and obligations that comprised the going business of the
Company before the conversions remain the rights, assets, operations, liabilities and obligations
of the Company after the conversions.
Accounting Guidance
In connection with filing Chapter 11 on June 7, 2016, we are subject to the requirements of
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
852, Reorganizations, ("ASC 852"). ASC 852 generally does not change the manner in which
financial statements are prepared. However, it does require that the financial statements for
periods subsequent to the filing of the Chapter 11 cases distinguish transactions and events that
are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business.
Revenues, expenses, realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that can be directly
associated with the reorganization of the business must be reported separately as reorganization
items in the consolidated statements of operations beginning in the Current Quarter. The balance
sheet shall distinguish pre-petition liabilities subject to compromise from those that are not, as
well as post-petition liabilities. See Note 3 for further details. Liabilities that may be affected by the
plan of reorganization must be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy
Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts as a result of the plan of reorganization. See
Note 4 for cash paid for reorganization items in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
3. Liabilities Subject to Compromise
As a result of the Chapter 11 filing on June 7, 2016, the payment of pre-petition obligations that
are not fully secured and have at least a possibility of not being repaid at the full claim amount are
considered “subject to compromise” under ASC 852. Pre-petition liabilities that are subject to
compromise are reported on the basis of the expected amount of the total allowed claims, even if
they may be settled for lesser amounts.
On June 8, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved motions that allowed the Company to pay trade
creditors and vendors in the ordinary course of business during the Chapter 11 cases.

5. Sale of Hodges Trucking Company, L.L.C.
On June 14, 2015, we sold Hodges Trucking Company, L.L.C. (“Hodges”), our previously wholly-
owned subsidiary that provided drilling rig relocation and logistics services, to Aveda
Transportation and Energy Services Inc. (“Aveda”) for aggregate consideration of $42.0 million. At
the time of the sale, Hodges owned 270 rig relocation trucks and 65 cranes and forklifts. The sale
did not include the land and buildings used in Hodges’ operations.
The consideration received consisted of $15.0 million in cash and a $27.0 million secured
promissory note due June 15, 2020 (the “Note Receivable”). The Note Receivable bears a fixed
interest rate of 9.00% per annum, which is payable quarterly in arrears beginning on June 30,
2015. Aveda can, at any time, make prepayments of principal before the maturity date without
premium or penalty. The Note Receivable is secured by a second lien on substantially all of
Aveda’s fixed assets and accounts receivable. The Note Receivable is presented in other long-
term assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the Current Quarter, Prior
Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, we recognized interest income of $0.6 million, $0.1
million, $1.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, related to the Note Receivable.
We recognized a loss of $35.0 million on the sale of Hodges in the Prior Quarter. Additionally,
during the Prior Quarter, we recognized $2.1 million of additional stock-based compensation
expense related to the vesting of restricted stock held by Hodges employees and $0.6 million of
severance-related costs.
Hodges was included in our oilfield trucking segment. The sale of Hodges did not qualify as
discontinued operations because the sale did not represent a strategic shift that had or will have a
major effect on our operations or financial results.

6. Change in Accounting Estimate
We review the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment on an ongoing basis. Based
on this review in the first quarter of 2015, we concluded that the estimated useful lives of certain
drilling rig components and certain drilling rigs were shorter than the estimated useful lives used
for depreciation in our consolidated financial statements. We reflected this useful life change as a
change in estimate, effective January 1, 2015, which increased depreciation expense by $1.1
million and $13.1 million during the Prior Quarter and Prior Period. For the Prior Quarter and Prior
Period, these changes increased our net loss by $0.7 million and $8.6 million, respectively, and
increased basic and diluted loss per share by $0.01 and $0.18, respectively.
7. Earnings Per Share
Upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy on August 1, 2016, as discussed in Note 2, the
Company’s then current common stock was canceled and New Common Stock and Warrants
were issued. The earnings per share amounts disclosed below would have been materially
different if the emergence from bankruptcy had occurred before the end of the Current Period.
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding and includes the effect of any participating securities as appropriate.
Participating securities consist of unvested restricted stock issued to our employees and non-
employee directors that provide nonforfeitable dividend rights and are required to be included in
the computation of our basic earnings per share using the two-class method. The two-class
method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock
and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in
undistributed earnings. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
shares outstanding for basic earnings per share, plus the dilutive effect of stock options. The
dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock and stock options is determined using the treasury
stock method, which assumes the amount of unrecognized compensation expense related to
unvested share-based compensation awards is used to repurchase shares at the average market
price for the period.

No incremental shares of potentially dilutive restricted stock awards or units were included for
periods presented as their effect was antidilutive under the treasury stock method.
The exercise price of stock options exceeded the average market price of our common stock
during the Current Period and Prior Period. Therefore, the stock options were not dilutive.

8. Asset Sales and Impairments and Other
Asset Sales
During the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, we sold ancillary
equipment for $0.5 million, $7.9 million, $2.6 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Additionally,
during the Prior Quarter, we sold our water hauling assets, which consisted of property and
equipment that had a total carrying amount of $12.3 million, for $6.5 million. We recorded net
losses on sales of property and equipment of approximately $1.0 million, $9.0 million, $0.6 million
and $13.2 million, respectively, related to these asset sales during the Current Quarter, Prior
Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, respectively.

We recognized $0.3 million and $3.3 million of impairment charges during the Current Period and
Prior Period, respectively, for certain drilling rigs that we deemed to be impaired based on our
assessment of future demand and the suitability of the identified rigs in light of this demand.
Estimated fair value for these drilling rigs was determined using significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3) based on a market approach.
We recognized impairment charges of $2.9 million and $8.7 million during the Current Quarter
and Prior Quarter for drilling-related services equipment that we deemed to be impaired based on
expected future cash flows of this equipment. Estimated fair values for this drilling-related
services equipment was determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) based on a
market approach.
We recognized impairment charges of $0.2 million and $2.7 million during the Prior Quarter and
Prior Period, respectively, for certain trucking and fluid disposal equipment that we deemed to be
impaired based on expected future cash flows of this equipment. Estimated fair values for this
trucking and fluid disposal equipment was determined using significant unobservable inputs
(Level 3) based on an income approach.
We identified certain other property and equipment during the Current Quarter, Current Period
and Prior Period that we deemed to be impaired based on our assessment of the market value
and expected future cash flows of the long-lived assets. We recorded impairment charges of $2.9
million, $2.9 million and $0.4 million during the Current Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period,
respectively, related to these assets. Estimated fair value for this property and equipment was
determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) based on an income approach.
 
The assumptions used in the impairment evaluation for long-lived assets are inherently uncertain
and require management’s judgment. A continued period of low oil and natural gas prices or
continued reductions in capital expenditures by CHK or our other customers would likely have an
adverse impact on our utilization and the prices that we receive for our services. This could result
in the recognition of future material impairment charges on the same, or additional, property and
equipment if future cash flow estimates, based upon information then available to management,
indicate that their carrying values are not recoverable.

Debt Subject to Compromise
The ability of certain creditors to seek remedies to enforce their rights under the pre-petition debt
agreements included in liabilities subject to compromise above was automatically stayed as a
result of the filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions described in Note 2, and the creditors’ rights of
enforcement became subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Due to the
filing of the Chapter 11 cases, the Company’s pre-petition unsecured long-term debt and related
accrued interest are included in liabilities subject to compromise in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet at June 30, 2016. Since June 7, 2016, the Company has not recorded interest
expense on unsecured debt that is subject to compromise.
2019 Senior Notes
In October 2011, we and SSF co-issued $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625%
Senior Notes due 2019. The filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions described in Note 2 constituted an
event of default with respect to the 2019 Notes. The Company did not make the payment of $21.5
million in accrued interest that was due on May 15, 2016. Since June 7, 2016, the Company has
not recorded interest expense on the 2019 Notes. The amount of contractual interest on the 2019
Notes that was not recorded from June 7, 2016 through June 30, 2016 is $2.9 million.
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, all outstanding obligations under the 2019 Notes
were cancelled.
2022 Senior Notes
In June 2014, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due
2022. The filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions described in Note 2 constituted an event of default
with respect to the 2022 Notes. The Company did not make the payment of $14.6 million in
accrued interest that was due on July 15, 2016. Since June 7, 2016, the Company has not
recorded interest expense on the 2022 Notes. The amount of contractual interest on the 2022
Notes that was not recorded from June 7, 2016 through June 30, 2016 is $2.0 million.
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, all outstanding obligations under the 2022 Notes
were cancelled.
During the Prior Quarter, we repurchased and cancelled $40.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of the 2022 Notes for $26.4 million. We recognized gains on extinguishment of debt of
$13.1 million, which included accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.5 million.
13
Term Loans
In June 2014, we entered into a $400.0 million seven-year term loan credit agreement.
Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at our option at either (i) the Base Rate, calculated
as the greatest of (1) the Bank of America, N.A. prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%
and (3) a one-month LIBOR rate adjusted daily plus 1.00% or (ii) LIBOR, with a floor of 0.75%,
plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings is 2.00% for Base
Rate loans and 3.00% for LIBOR loans, depending on whether the Base Rate or LIBOR is used,
provided that if and for so long as the leverage ratio is less than a certain level and the term loans
have certain ratings from each of S&P and Moody’s, such margins will be reduced by 0.25%. As
of June 30, 2016, the applicable rate for borrowing under the Term Loan was 3.75%. The Term
Loan is repayable in equal consecutive quarterly installments equal to 0.25% (1.00% per annum)
of the original principal amount of the Term Loan and will mature in full on June 25, 2021.
Obligations under the Term Loan are guaranteed jointly and severally by all of our present and
future direct and indirect wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries, other than certain
excluded subsidiaries. Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan are secured by liens on all of our
equity interests in our current and future subsidiaries, and all of our subsidiaries’ present and
future real property, equipment (including drilling rigs and frac spread equipment), fixtures and
other fixed assets.
We may prepay all or a portion of our Term Loan at any time. Borrowings under our Term Loan
may be subject to mandatory prepayments with the net cash proceeds of certain issuances of
debt, certain asset sales and other dispositions and certain condemnation events, and with
excess cash flow in any calendar year in which our leverage ratio exceeds 3.25 to 1.00. The
Term Loan contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to (1) enter
into asset sales; (2) incur additional indebtedness; (3) make investments or loans and create
liens; (4) pay certain dividends or make other distributions and (5) engage in transactions with
affiliates.
In May 2015, we entered into an incremental term supplement to the Term Loan and borrowed
$100.0 million in aggregate principal amount and received net proceeds of $94.5 million.
Borrowings under the Incremental Term Loan bear interest at our option at either (i) LIBOR, with a
floor of 1.00% or (ii) the Base Rate, calculated as the greatest of (1) the Bank of America, N.A.
prime rate, (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (3) a one-month LIBOR rate adjusted daily
plus 1.00%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings is
9.00% for LIBOR loans and 8.00% for Base Rate loans, depending on whether the Base Rate or
LIBOR is used. As of June 30, 2016, the applicable rate for borrowing under the Incremental Term
Loan was 10%. The Incremental Term Loan is payable in equal consecutive quarterly
installments equal to 0.25% (1.00% per annum) of the original principal amount of the Incremental
Term Loan and will mature in full on June 25, 2021.
Obligations under the Incremental Term Loan are guaranteed jointly and severally by all of our
present and future direct and indirect wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries, other than
certain excluded subsidiaries. Amounts borrowed under the Incremental Term Loan are secured
by liens on all of our equity interests in our current and future subsidiaries, and all of our
subsidiaries’ present and future real property, equipment (including drilling rigs and frac spread
equipment), fixtures and other fixed assets.
We may prepay all or a portion of our Incremental Term Loan at any time. Borrowings under our
Incremental Term Loan may be subject to mandatory prepayments with the net cash proceeds of
certain issuances of debt, certain asset sales and other dispositions and certain condemnation
events, and with excess cash flow in any calendar year in which our leverage ratio exceeds 3.25
to 1.00. The Incremental Term Loan contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which
limit our ability to (1) enter into asset sales; (2) incur additional indebtedness; (3) make
investments or loans and create liens; (4) pay certain dividends or make other distributions and
(5) engage in transactions with affiliates. All prepayments of the Incremental Term Loan, except
for mandatory prepayments described above, if made on or prior to the 42-month anniversary of
the Incremental Term Loan, are subject to a prepayment premium equal to (i) a make-whole
premium determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the Incremental Term Loan if made on or
prior to the 18-month anniversary of the Incremental Term Loan, (ii) 5.00% of such principal
amount if made after the 18-month anniversary and on or prior to the 30-month anniversary of the
Incremental Term Loan, or (iii) 3.00% of such principal amount if made after the 30-month
anniversary and on or prior to the 42-month anniversary of the Incremental Term Loan.
The filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions described in Note 2 constituted an event of default with
respect to the Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan. Upon the Effective Date of the Plan,
such defaults were deemed cured or waived. As outlined in the Plan, the Incremental Term Loan
prepayment premium was suspended for an 18-month period beginning on the Effective Date of
the Plan.
14
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the Company entered into an amendment to the
Term Loan and related guaranty agreement that, among other things, requires us to use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain credit ratings with Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, restrict our ability to create foreign subsidiaries, and revise
certain provisions to address the granting of new liens on our assets.
In addition, on the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the Company entered into a waiver in
respect of the Incremental Term Loan (the “Incremental Term Loan Waiver”) whereby the
incremental term lenders agreed to waive their right to any prepayment premium that may be
payable in respect of the Incremental Term Loan (other than in connection with a pre-maturity
acceleration of the Incremental Term Loan) for a period of eighteen months following the Effective
Date. The Company also entered into an amendment to the Incremental Term Loan and the
related guaranty agreement to revise certain provisions to address the granting of new liens on
our assets.
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the Company entered into new amended and
restated security documentation in connection with the Term Loan and Incremental Term Loan
that grants liens on and security interests in substantially all of our assets (subject to certain
exclusions). The Company also entered into an inter-creditor agreement with the agents for the
New ABL Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan that will govern the rights
of its lenders with respect to the distribution of proceeds from our assets securing our obligations
under the New ABL Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan.
Senior Secured Debtor-In-Possession Credit Agreement
On June 8, 2016, in connection with the filings of the Bankruptcy Petitions, the Company, with
certain of our domestic subsidiaries as borrowers, entered into a senior secured debtor-in-
possession credit facility with total commitments of $100.0 million. As of June 30, 2016, there
were no borrowings on the DIP Facility and we were in compliance with the covenants.
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the DIP Facility was amended and restated, and
the outstanding obligations pursuant thereto were converted to obligations under the New ABL
Credit Facility.
New ABL Credit Facility
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, certain of our domestic subsidiaries as borrowers
entered into a five year senior secured revolving credit facility with total commitments of $100.0
million. The maximum amount that we may borrow under the New ABL Credit Facility is subject
to the borrowing base, which is based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable, subject to
reserves and other adjustments.
All obligations under the New ABL Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly
and severally by the Company and all of our other present and future direct and indirect material
domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under the New ABL Credit Facility are secured by liens on
substantially all of our personal property, and bear interest at our option at either (i) the Base
Rate, calculated as the greatest of (1) the rate of interest publicly announced by Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, as its “prime rate,” subject to each increase or decrease in such
prime rate effective as of the date such change occurs, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus
0.50% and (3) the one-month LIBOR Rate plus 1.00%, each of which is subject to an applicable
margin, or (ii) LIBOR, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges
from 1.00% to 1.50% per annum for Base Rate loans and 2.00% to 2.50% per annum for LIBOR
loans. The unused portion of the New ABL Credit Facility is subject to a commitment fee that
varies from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum , according to average unused amounts. Interest on
LIBOR loans is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than
quarterly. Interest on Base Rate loans is payable monthly in arrears.
The New ABL Credit Facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our
ability to (1) enter into asset sales; (2) incur additional indebtedness; (3) make investments or
loans and create liens; (4) pay certain dividends or make other distributions and (5) engage in
transactions with affiliates. The New ABL Credit Facility also requires maintenance of a fixed
charge coverage ratio based on the ratio of consolidated EBITDA to fixed charges, in each case
as defined in the New ABL Credit Facility. If we fail to perform our obligations under the
agreement that results in an event of default, the commitments under the New ABL Credit Facility
could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the New ABL Credit Facility may be
declared immediately due and payable. The New ABL Credit Facility also contains cross default
provisions that apply to our other indebtedness.

Other Commitments
Much of the equipment we purchase requires long production lead times. As a result, we usually
have outstanding orders and commitments for such equipment. As of June 30, 2016, we had
$14.0 million of purchase commitments related to future capital expenditures that we expect to
incur in the second half of 2016. These commitments relate primarily to the construction of the
remaining Tier 1 rigs.

Litigation
While the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions automatically stayed certain actions against the
Company, including actions to collect pre-petition indebtedness or to exercise control over the
property of its bankruptcy estates, the Company received an order from the Bankruptcy Court
allowing it to pay all general claims, including claims of litigation counterparties, in the ordinary
course of business in accordance with applicable non-bankruptcy law notwithstanding the
commencement of the Chapter 11 cases. The Plan confirmed in the Chapter 11 cases provides
for the treatment of claims against the Company's bankruptcy estates, including pre-petition
liabilities that have not otherwise been satisfied or addressed during the Chapter 11 cases.
On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the Company, on its behalf and on behalf of its
subsidiaries, entered into a Litigation Trust Agreement (the “Litigation Trust Agreement”) with
Alan Carr (the “Trustee”), pursuant to which the Litigation Trust (the “Trust”) was established for
the benefit of specified holders of allowed claims. Pursuant to the Plan and the Confirmation
Order, the Company transferred specified claims and causes of action to the Trust with title to
such claims and causes of action being free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances, and
interests. In addition, pursuant to the Plan and Confirmation Order, the Company transferred
$50,000 in cash to the Trust to pay the reasonable costs and expenses associated with the
administration of the Trust. The Trustee may prosecute the transferred claims and causes of
action and conduct such other action as described in and authorized by the Plan, make timely
and appropriate distributions to the beneficiaries of the Trust and otherwise carry out the
provisions of the Litigation Trust Agreement. The Company is not a beneficiary of the Trust.
We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes incidental to our business operations, including
commercial disputes, personal injury claims, property damage claims and contract actions. We
record an associated liability when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, management is
of the opinion that no pending or threatened lawsuit or dispute incidental to our business
operations is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The final resolution of such matters could exceed amounts
accrued and actual results could differ materially from management’s estimates.
Self-Insured Reserves
We are self-insured up to certain retention limits with respect to workers’ compensation and
general liability matters. We maintain accruals for self-insurance retentions that we estimate using
third-party data and claims history. Included in operating costs is workers’ compensation expense
of $1.0 million, $2.2 million, $2.0 million and $4.8 million during the Current Quarter, Prior
Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, respectively.
12. Stock-Based Compensation
Upon the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy on August 1, 2016, as discussed in Note 2, the
Company’s current common stock was canceled and the New Common Stock was issued. The
Company’s existing stock-based compensation awards were also either vested or canceled upon
the Company's emergence from bankruptcy. Accelerated vesting and cancellation of these stock-
based compensation awards will result in the recognition of expense, on the date of vesting or
cancellation, to record any previously unamortized expense related to the awards.
Our stock-based compensation program prior to emergence from bankruptcy consisted of
restricted stock available to employees and stock options. The restricted stock awards and stock
options were equity-classified awards. We also recognize compensation expense (benefit)
related to performance share units (“PSUs”) granted by CHK to our chief executive officer.
Included in operating costs and general and administrative expenses is stock-based
compensation expense of $5.3 million, $10.1 million, $11.0 million and $22.6 million for the
Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, respectively.
Equity-Classified Awards
Restricted Stock. The fair value of restricted stock awards was determined based on the fair
market value of SSE common shares on the date of the grant. This value was amortized over the
vesting period.

As of June 30, 2016, there was $26.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
the unvested restricted stock. The cost will be recognized in the third quarter of 2016 as a
reorganization expense as the awards vested prior to emergence from bankruptcy.
Stock Options. CHK granted stock options to our chief executive officer under CHK’s Long-Term
Incentive Plan for incentive and retention purposes. The incentive-based stock options vest
ratably over a three-year period and our retention-based stock options will vest one-third on each
of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date of the original CHK award, in the case
of a replacement award. Outstanding options expire ten years from the date of grant of the original
CHK award, in the case of a replacement award. We have not issued any new stock options,
other than the replacement awards, since the spin-off.

The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the current market value or the
market value upon exercise of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.
As of June 30, 2016, there was $0.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock options. The cost will be recognized in the third quarter of 2016 as a reorganization
expense as the options were cancelled prior to emergence from bankruptcy.
Other
Performance Share Units. CHK granted PSUs to our chief executive officer under CHK’s Long-
Term Incentive Plan that includes both an internal performance measure and external market
condition as it relates to CHK. Following the spin-off, compensation expense is recognized
through the changes in fair value of the PSUs over the vesting period with a corresponding
adjustment to equity and any related cash obligations are the responsibility of CHK. We
recognized expenses (credits) of $0.1 million, ($0.4) million, $0.1 million and ($1.2) million for the
Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period and Prior Period, respectively.
18
13. Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 21%, 35%, 18% and 34% for the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current
Period and Prior Period, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from the Prior
Quarter to the Current Quarter and the Prior Period to the Current Period is primarily due to the tax
benefit at expected rates being offset by an increase in the valuation allowance. Further, our
effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of state income taxes, permanent differences and
changes in pre-tax income.
Based on our anticipated operating results in subsequent quarters, we project being in a net
deferred tax asset position at December 31, 2016. We believe it is more likely than not that these
deferred tax assets will not be realized, and accordingly are recording sufficient valuation
allowance through the effective tax rate to have a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2016.
As of June 30, 2016, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $49.0 million, which reduced our
income tax benefit in the Current Quarter and Current Period.
A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when
it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be
realized. To assess that likelihood, we use estimates and judgment regarding our future taxable
income, as well as the jurisdiction in which such taxable income is generated, to determine
whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial
position, our results of operations, both actual and forecasted, the reversal of deferred tax
liabilities, and tax planning strategies as well as the current and forecasted business economics
of our industry.
The benefit of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return is
recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than
not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Interest and penalties, if
any, related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in interest expense and other expense,
respectively. There were no uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
As described in Note 2, elements of the Plan include that our 2019 Notes and 2022 Notes will be
exchanged for New Common Stock. Absent an exception, a debtor recognizes cancellation of
indebtedness income (“CODI”) upon discharge of its outstanding indebtedness for an amount of
consideration that is less than its adjusted issue price. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (“IRC”), provides that a debtor in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case may exclude CODI from
taxable income but must reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of any CODI realized as
a result of the consummation of a plan of reorganization. The amount of CODI realized by a
taxpayer is determined based on the fair market value of the consideration received by the
creditors in settlement of outstanding indebtedness. Upon emergence from Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings, the CODI may reduce some or all of the amount of prior tax attributes,
which can include net operating losses, capital losses, alternative minimum tax credits and tax
basis in assets. The actual reduction in tax attributes does not occur until January 1, 2017.
The IRC provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax
attributes, as well as certain built-in-losses, against future taxable income in the event of a
change in ownership. Emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings may result in a
change in ownership for purposes of the IRC. However, the IRC provides alternatives for
taxpayers in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings that may or may not result in an annual
limitation. We are in the process of determining which alternatives are most beneficial to us.
14. Equity Method Investment
Effective June 6, 2016, we assigned our 49% ownership of the membership interest in Maalt
Specialized Bulk, L.L.C. (“Maalt”) back to the majority owners. We used the equity method of
accounting to account for our investment in Maalt, which had a carrying value of zero as of June
6, 2016. We recorded equity method adjustments to our investment of $0.1 million and $1.1
million for our share of Maalt’s income for the Prior Quarter and Prior Period, respectively.
We reviewed our equity method investment for impairment whenever certain impairment
indicators existed, including the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the
investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the
carrying amount of the investment. A loss in value of an investment which is other than a
temporary decline should be recognized. We estimated that the fair value of our investment in
Maalt was approximately zero as of December 31, 2015, which was below the carrying value of
the investment and resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $8.8 million as of December 31,
2015. Estimated fair value for our investment in Maalt was determined using significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3) based on an income approach.
19
15. Fair Value Measurements
The fair value measurement standard defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date (referred to as an “exit price”). Authoritative guidance on fair value
measurements and disclosures clarifies that a fair value measurement for a liability should reflect
the entity’s non-performance risk. In addition, a fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes
the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
(Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
Level 1- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date
for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
Level 2- Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either
directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3- Measured based on prices or valuation models that require inputs that are both
significant to the fair value measurement and less observable from objective sources.
Fair Value on Recurring Basis
The carrying values of cash, trade receivables and trade payables are considered to be
representative of their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Fair Value on Non-Recurring Basis
Fair value measurements were applied with respect to our non-financial assets and liabilities
measured on a non-recurring basis, which consist primarily of long-lived asset impairments
based on Level 3 inputs. See Note 8 for additional discussion.
20
Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments
The fair values of the Note Receivable and our debt are the estimated amounts a market
participant would have to pay to purchase the Note Receivable or our debt, including any
premium or discount attributable to the difference between the stated interest rate and market rate
of interest at the balance sheet date. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or average
valuations of similar debt instruments at the balance sheet date for those debt instruments for
which quoted market prices are not available. Estimated fair values are determined by using
available market information and valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market
assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value
amounts.

16. Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of cash and trade receivables. Accounts receivable from CHK and its affiliates were $68.3 million
and $109.6 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, or 72% and 65%, respectively,
of our total accounts receivable. Revenues from CHK and its affiliates were $96.6 million, $203.2
million, $195.4 million and $520.5 million for the Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period,
and Prior Period, or 70%, 69%, 67% and 72%, respectively, of our total revenues. We believe that
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our operating results as there
can be no assurance that replacement customers would be identified and accessed in a timely
fashion. Included in total CHK revenue are amounts related to idle-but-contracted (“IBC”)
payments of $35.3 million, $23.9 million, $71.5 million and $29.5 million, respectively, for the
Current Quarter, Prior Quarter, Current Period, and Prior Period. Excluding the IBC revenues, the
Company has diversified its customer base and increased non-CHK revenue from 29% in the
Prior Period to 44% in the Current Period. See Note 17 for further discussion of agreements
entered into with CHK as part of the spin-off, including a services agreement and rig-specific
daywork drilling contracts.
17. Transactions with CHK
Prior to the completion of our spin-off on June 30, 2014, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of
CHK, and transactions between us and CHK (including its subsidiaries) were considered to be
transactions with affiliates. Subsequent to June 30, 2014, CHK and its subsidiaries are not
considered affiliates of us or any of our subsidiaries. We have disclosed below agreements
entered into between us and CHK prior to the completion of our spin-off.
21
On June 25, 2014, we entered into a master separation agreement and several other agreements
with CHK as part of the spin-off. The master separation agreement entered into between CHK
and us governs the separation of our businesses from CHK, the distribution of our shares to CHK
shareholders and other matters related to CHK’s relationship with us, including cross-indemnities
between us and CHK. In general, CHK agreed to indemnify us for any liabilities relating to CHK’s
business and we agreed to indemnify CHK for any liabilities relating to our business.
On June 25, 2014, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with CHK, which governs the
respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of CHK and us with respect to tax liabilities and
benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax
proceedings, and certain other matters regarding taxes.
On June 25, 2014, we entered into an employee matters agreement with CHK providing that each
company has responsibility for our own employees and compensation plans. The agreement also
contains provisions concerning benefit protection for both SSE and CHK employees, treatment of
holders of CHK stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units,
and cooperation between us and CHK in the sharing of employee information and maintenance
of confidentiality.
On June 25, 2014, we entered into a transition services agreement with CHK under which CHK
provides or makes available to us various administrative services and assets for specified periods
beginning on the distribution date. In consideration for such services, we pay CHK fees, a portion
of which is a flat fee, generally in amounts intended to allow CHK to recover all of its direct and
indirect costs incurred in providing those services. These charges from CHK were $2.7 million
and $8.3 million for the Prior Quarter and Prior Period, respectively. This agreement was
terminated during the second quarter of 2015.
We are party to a master services agreement with CHK pursuant to which we provide drilling and
other services and supply materials and equipment to CHK. Drilling services are typically
provided pursuant to rig-specific daywork drilling contracts similar to those we use for other
customers. The specific terms of each request for other services are typically set forth in a field
ticket, purchase order or work order. The master services agreement contains general terms and
provisions, including minimum insurance coverage amounts that we are required to maintain and
confidentiality obligations with respect to CHK’s business, and allocates certain operational risks
between CHK and us through indemnity provisions. The master services agreement will remain
in effect until we or CHK provides 30 days written notice of termination, although such agreement
may not be terminated during the term of the services agreement described below.
Prior to the spin-off, we were party to a services agreement with CHK under which CHK
guaranteed the utilization of a portion of our drilling rig and hydraulic fracturing fleets during the
term of the agreement. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into new services agreements
with CHK which supplements the master services agreement. Under the new services
agreement, CHK is required to utilize the lesser of (i) seven, five and three of our pressure
pumping crews in years one, two and three of the agreement, respectively, or (ii) 50% of the total
number of all pressure pumping crews working for CHK in all its operating regions during the
respective year. CHK is required to utilize our pressure pumping services for a minimum number
of stages as set forth in the agreement. CHK is entitled to terminate the agreement in certain
situations, including in the event we fail to materially comply with the overall quality of service
provided by similar service providers. Additionally, CHK’s requirement to utilize our services may
be suspended under certain circumstances, such as if we are unable to timely accept and supply
services ordered by CHK or as a result of a force majeure event.
In connection with the spin-off, we entered into rig-specific daywork drilling contracts with CHK for
the provision of drilling services. The drilling contracts had a commencement date of July 1, 2014
and terms ranging from three months to three years. CHK has the right to terminate the drilling
contracts under certain circumstances.
18. Segment Information
As of June 30, 2016, our revenues, loss before income taxes and identifiable assets are primarily
attributable to three reportable segments. During the Prior Quarter, we sold the remaining
business and assets included in the oilfield trucking segment. Our former oilfield trucking
segment’s historical results for periods prior to the sales continue to be included in our historical
financial results as a component of continuing operations as reflected in the tables below.
Each of these segments represents a distinct type of business. These segments have separate
management teams which report to our chief operating decision maker. The results of operations
in these segments are regularly reviewed by the chief
22
operating decision maker for purposes of determining resource allocation and assessing
performance. Management evaluates the performance of our segments based upon earnings
before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization.
Prior to 2016, the information that was regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker
included general and administrative expenses that were allocated to each of our reportable
segments for corporate overhead functions provided by the Other Operations segment on behalf
of our reportable segments. Effective January 1, 2016, we no longer allocate general and
administrative expenses to our reportable segments from the Other Operations segment in the
information that is reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, this change has
been reflected through retroactive revision of the Prior Quarter and Prior Period segment
information.
The following is a description of our segments and other operations:
 
Drilling. Our drilling segment provides land-based drilling services. As of June 30, 2016, we
owned a fleet of 94 land drilling rigs.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Our hydraulic fracturing segment provides land-based hydraulic fracturing
and other well stimulation services. As of June 30, 2016, we owned 13 hydraulic fracturing fleets
with an aggregate of 500,000 horsepower.
Oilfield Rentals. Our oilfield rentals segment provides premium rental tools for land-based drilling,
completion and workover activities.
Former Oilfield Trucking. Our oilfield trucking segment provided drilling rig relocation and
logistics services as well as fluid handling services. During the Prior Quarter, we sold Hodges
and our water hauling assets. As part of the spin-off, we sold our crude hauling assets to a third
party. As of June 30, 2015, there were no remaining assets or operations in the oilfield trucking
segment, although we do have ongoing liabilities, primarily related to insurance claims, whose
income statement impact is charged to general and administrative expense. Our former oilfield
trucking segment's historical results for periods prior to the sale continue to be included in our
historical financial results as a component of continuing operations as reflected in the tables
below.
Other Operations. Our other operations consists primarily of our corporate functions, including (as
of June 30, 2016) our 2019 Notes, 2022 Notes, Term Loans and DIP Facility.

19. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information
In October 2011, we issued and sold the 2019 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of
$650.0 million (see Note 9). Pursuant to the Indenture governing the 2019 Notes, such notes are
fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed by SSO’s parent, SSE, and all of
SSO’s subsidiaries, other than SSF, which is a co-issuer of the 2019 Notes, and certain
immaterial subsidiaries. Each of the subsidiary guarantors is 100% owned by SSO and there are
no material subsidiaries of SSO other than the subsidiary guarantors. SSF and Western
Wisconsin Sand Company, LLC are minor non-guarantor subsidiaries whose condensed
consolidating financial information is included with the subsidiary guarantors. SSE and SSO
have independent assets and operations. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of
SSO or any subsidiary guarantor to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
Set forth below are condensed consolidating financial statements for SSE (“Parent”) and SSO
(“Subsidiary Issuer”) on a stand-alone, unconsolidated basis, and their combined guarantor
subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of
operations, cash flows or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities.

20. Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation,”
which modifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and
classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We are currently
evaluating what impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases,” which modifies the lease
recognition requirements and requires entities to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from
leases on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating what impact
this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall,” which
requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and
requires evaluation of the need for valuation allowance of deferred tax assets related to available-
for-sale securities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 with early adoption not permitted. We are currently evaluating what impact
this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income Taxes," which simplifies the
presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not
expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the
Measurement of Inventory,” which changes inventory measured using any method other than
LIFO or the retail inventory method (for example, inventory measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO)
or average cost) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on
our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements -
Going Concern," which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within
one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable).
ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating what impact
this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,”
which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”
and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the
effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods within that reporting period; the FASB also provided for early
adoption for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently
evaluating what impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
21. Subsequent Events
In connection with the emergence from the Chapter 11 cases, we have determined that we will
qualify for fresh-start accounting as of the Effective Date. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting,
our assets and liabilities will be recorded at their fair value as of the fresh-start reporting date or
Effective Date. The fair values of our assets and liabilities as of that date may differ materially
from the recorded values of our assets and liabilities as reflected in our historical consolidated
financial statements. In addition, our adoption of fresh-start accounting may materially affect our
results of operations following the fresh-start reporting dates, as we will have a new basis in our
assets and liabilities. Consequently, our historical financial statements are not reliable indicators
of our financial condition and results of operations for any period after we adopt fresh-start
accounting. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the fresh-start accounting on our
consolidated financial statements.
35
We cannot currently estimate the financial effect of the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy
on our financial statements, although we expect to record material adjustments related to our plan
of reorganization and also for the application of fresh-start accounting guidance upon emergence.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, as a result of our emergence from Chapter 11, the Company paid
$17.4 million in professional fees as well as $1.2 million in financing costs related to the
conversion of the DIP Facility to the New ABL Credit Facility. In addition, as outlined in the Plan,
the Company made a $15.0 million principal payment on the Incremental Term Loan.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates
to the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 (the “Current Quarter” and “Current Period,”
respectively), the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 (the “Prior Quarter” and “Prior
Period,” respectively), and the three months ended March 31, 2016 (the “Previous Quarter”) and
should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related
notes appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and with our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Overview
We are a diversified oilfield services company providing a wide range of wellsite services to U.S.
land-based E&P customers. We offer services and equipment that are strategic to our customers’
oil and natural gas operations. We conduct our business through three operating segments:
Drilling, Hydraulic Fracturing and Oilfield Rentals. Our operations are geographically diversified
across many of the most active oil and natural gas plays in the onshore United States, including
the Anadarko and Permian Basins and the Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus, Niobrara and
Utica Shales.
Since we commenced operations in 2001, we have actively grown our business and modernized
our asset base. As of June 30, 2016, our marketed rig fleet of 94 all-electric rigs consisted of 37
Tier 1 rigs (including 26 proprietary PeakeRigs™) and 57 Tier 2 rigs. In addition, we had two
PeakeRigs™ under construction, one of which has been delivered and the remaining one is
scheduled to be delivered in the third quarter of 2016. In addition, we also had one rig under
refurbishment, which we expect to deliver in the fourth quarter of 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we
also owned 13 hydraulic fracturing fleets with an aggregate of 500,000 horsepower and a
diversified oilfield rentals business. For additional information regarding our business and
strategies, please read “Business” in Item 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cyclical Nature of Industry
We operate in a highly cyclical industry. The main factor influencing demand for oilfield services
is the level of drilling and completions activity by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely
on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production depletion rates.
Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and is subject to large and rapid fluctuations. When oil
and natural gas price increases occur, producers increase their capital expenditures, which
generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies. The increased
capital expenditures also ultimately result in greater production, which historically has resulted in
increased supplies and reduced prices that, in turn, tend to reduce demand for oilfield services.
For these reasons, our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and from year-
to-year. For instance, the price of crude oil has fallen significantly since mid-year 2014, as a result
of robust non-OPEC supply growth led by unconventional production in the United States,
weakening demand in emerging markets, and OPEC’s decision to raise its production ceiling,
partly in an effort to protect its market share and drive higher cost producers out of the
marketplace.
The sustained decline in commodity prices since mid-2014 has dramatically reduced the level of
onshore United States drilling and completions activity and, consequently, the demand for our
services. The extent and length of the current down cycle continues to be uncertain and is
dependent on a number of economic, geopolitical and monetary policy factors that are outside our
control. Until there is a sustained recovery in commodity prices, we expect that reduced
equipment utilization levels and pricing pressure across each of our operating segments will
persist. If drilling and completions activity remains at depressed levels or worsens, it will likely
have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations.
Bankruptcy Proceedings
On June 7, 2016, the Debtors filed the Bankruptcy Petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11
in the Bankruptcy Court. On July 14, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order.
The Debtors satisfied the remaining conditions to effectiveness contemplated under the Plan and
emerged from Chapter 11 on August 1, 2016. For additional information about our bankruptcy
proceedings, see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
37
Backlog
We maintain a backlog of contract revenues under our contracts for the provision of drilling and
hydraulic fracturing services. Our drilling and hydraulic fracturing backlogs as of June 30, 2016
were approximately $220.1 million and $89.8 million, respectively, with average durations of 11
months and 10 months, respectively. We calculate our drilling backlog by multiplying the day rate
under our contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract. We calculate our
hydraulic fracturing backlog by multiplying the (i) rate per stage, which varies by operating region
and is, therefore, estimated based on current customer activity levels by region and current
contract pricing, by (ii) the number of stages remaining under the contract, which we estimate
based on current and anticipated utilization of our crews. With respect to our hydraulic fracturing
backlog, our contracts provide for periodic adjustments of the rates we may charge for our
services, which will be negotiated based on then-prevailing market pricing and in the future may
be higher or lower than the current rates we charge and utilize in calculating our backlog. Our
drilling backlog calculation does not include any reduction in revenues related to mobilization or
demobilization, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during
periods in which the rig is moving, on standby or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess
of what is permitted under the drilling contract. In addition, many of our drilling contracts are
subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination
payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer. We calculate our
contract drilling early termination value assuming each rig remains stacked for the remainder of
the term of the terminated contract. As a result of the foregoing, revenues could differ materially
from the backlog and early termination amounts presented.
As of June 30, 2016, we expect to recognize revenues from backlog as follows (in millions):

How We Evaluate Our Operations
2016  2017  Thereafter
Our management team uses a variety of tools to monitor and manage our operations in the
following eight areas: (a) segment gross margin, (b) equipment maintenance performance,
(c) customer satisfaction, (d) asset utilization, (e) safety performance, (f) Adjusted EBITDA, (g)
Adjusted Revenues and (h) Adjusted Operating Costs.
Segment Gross Margin. We define segment gross margin as segment revenues less segment
operating costs. We view segment gross margin as one of our key management tools for
managing costs at the segment level and evaluating segment performance. Our management
tracks segment gross margin both as an absolute amount and as a percentage of revenues
compared to prior periods.
Equipment Maintenance Performance. Equipment reliability (“uptime”) is an important factor to the
success of our business. Uptime is beneficially impacted through preventive maintenance on our
equipment. We have formal preventive maintenance procedures which are regularly monitored
for compliance. Further, management monitors maintenance expenses as a percentage of
revenue. This metric provides a leading indicator with respect to the execution of preventive
maintenance and ensures that equipment reliability issues do not negatively impact operational
uptime.
Customer Satisfaction. Upon completion of many of our services, we encourage our customers to
provide feedback on the services provided. The evaluation of our performance is based on
various criteria and our customer comments are indicative of their overall satisfaction level. This
feedback provides us with the necessary information to reinforce positive performance and
remedy negative issues and trends.
 
Asset Utilization. By consistently monitoring our operations’ activity levels, pricing and relative
performance of each of our rigs and fleets, we can more efficiently allocate our personnel and
equipment to maximize revenue generation. We measure our activity levels by the total number of
jobs completed by each of our drilling rigs and hydraulic fracturing fleets on a
38
periodic basis. We also monitor the utilization rates of our drilling rigs. We define utilization of our
drilling rigs as the number of rigs that are operating divided by our marketed rig count.
Safety Performance. Maintaining a safe and incident free workplace is a critical component of our
operational success. Our management team uses both lagging and leading indicators to measure
and manage safety performance. Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”), Lost Time Incident
Rate (“LTIR”) and Motor Vehicle Crash Rate (“MVCR”) are key lagging indicators reviewed by
management. We also review leading indicators such as safety observations, training completion,
and action item completion to enhance our view of safety performance. Safety performance data
is reported, tracked, and trended in a centralized database, which allows us to efficiently focus
our incident prevention efforts.
Adjusted EBITDA. The primary financial and operating measurement that our management uses
to analyze and monitor the operating performance of our business is Adjusted EBITDA, which we
define as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and
amortization, as further adjusted to add back gains on extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on
sale of a business and exit costs, gains or losses on sale of property and equipment, impairments
and other, non-cash stock compensation, severance-related costs, restructuring charges,
reorganization items, interest income, and certain non-recurring items, such as the sale of our
drilling rig relocation and logistics business and the sale of our water hauling assets. The table
below shows our Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
and the three months ended March 31, 2016.

Quarter or Current Period and the allocations for the Prior Quarter and Prior Period have been
retroactively revised in the table above. See Note 18 to our condensed consolidated financial
statements included in Item 1 of this report for further detail.
During the Prior Quarter and Prior Period, general and administrative expenses were allocated
to the Oilfield Rentals segment in the amount of $2.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively, for
corporate functions provided by the Other Operations segment on behalf of the Oilfield Rentals
(c)segment. No allocations were made in the Current Quarter, Previous Quarter or Current Period
and the allocations for the Prior Quarter and Prior Period have been retroactively revised in the
table above. See Note 18 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item
1 of this report for further detail.
Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Operating Costs. Key financial and operating measurements
that our management uses to analyze and monitor our period-over-period operating performance
are “Adjusted Revenues” and “Adjusted Operating Costs”, which we define as revenues and
operating costs before revenues and operating costs associated with our rig relocation and
logistics business and water hauling assets that were sold in the second quarter of 2015.
39
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
“Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Revenues” and “Adjusted Operating Costs” are non-GAAP
financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted revenues and adjusted operating costs as used
and defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other
companies and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Operating Costs should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for revenues and operating costs, respectively, prepared in accordance with GAAP.
However, our management uses Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Operating Costs to evaluate
our period-over-period operating performance because our management believes these
measures improve the comparability of our continuing business and for the same reasons
believes these measures may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance. A
reconciliation of Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Operating Costs to the GAAP measures of
revenues and operating costs, respectively, is provided below in “—Results of Operations” for
each period discussed.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income,
net income or loss, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other
income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, our
management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance and liquidity and believes
Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance and
liquidity because this measure:
•
is widely used by investors in the oilfield services industry to measure a company’s operating
performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can
vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value
of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors;
•
is a financial measurement that is used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate
our creditworthiness; and
•
is used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance of our
operating entities and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.
There are significant limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance,
including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that
materially affect our net income or loss. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA excludes some,
but not all, items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our
industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of
other companies.
On a consolidated basis, the following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the
GAAP financial measures of net loss and cash provided by operating activities. The following
tables also present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP financial measure of net
income or loss for each of our operating segments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We require capital to fund ongoing operations, including operating expenses, organic growth
initiatives, investments, acquisitions and debt service. We expect our future capital needs will be
funded by cash flows from operations, borrowings under our New ABL Credit Facility, access to
capital markets and other financing transactions. We believe we will have adequate liquidity over
the next twelve months to operate our business and meet our cash requirements.
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and short-term investments of $81.4 million and working
capital of $187.9 million. As of August 4, 2016, we had cash and short-term investments of $50.3
million and our New ABL Credit Facility remained undrawn. As of June 30, 2016, we had $14.0
million of purchase commitments related to future capital expenditures that we expect to incur in
the second half of 2016.
We expect that our primary sources of liquidity are from cash on hand, cash from operations and
availability under our New ABL Credit Facility. On the Effective Date, by operation of the Plan, the
DIP Facility was amended and restated, and the outstanding obligations pursuant thereto were
converted to obligations under the New ABL Credit Facility. For additional information about our
bankruptcy proceedings and a description of our New ABL Credit Facility, see Note 2 and Note 9
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Capital Expenditures
Our business is capital-intensive, requiring significant investment to maintain, upgrade and
purchase equipment to meet our customers’ needs and industry demand. Our capital
requirements consist primarily of:
•
•
growth capital expenditures, which are defined as capital expenditures made to acquire
additional equipment and other assets, increase our service lines, expand geographically or
advance other strategic initiatives for the purpose of growing our business; and
maintenance capital expenditures, which are defined as capital expenditures that are necessary
to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and include the replacement of
components and equipment which are worn or obsolete.
44
Total capital expenditures were $76.1 million and $90.7 million for the Current Period and Prior
Period, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, we had $14.0 million of purchase commitments related
to future capital expenditures that we expect to incur in 2016. We currently expect that our total
capital expenditures will be less than $100.0 million for 2016. We may increase, decrease or
reallocate our anticipated capital expenditures during any period based on industry conditions,
the availability of capital or other factors, and a significant component of our anticipated capital
spending is discretionary. In addition, from time to time we may use cash on hand in excess of our
budgeted capital expenditures to repurchase and cancel our outstanding long-term debt.
Cash Flow
Our cash flow depends in large part on the level of spending by our customers on exploration,
development and production activities. Sustained increases or decreases in the price of oil or
natural gas could have a material impact on these activities, thus materially affecting our cash
flows. The following is a discussion of our cash flow for the Current Period and Prior Period.

Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $27.0 million and $159.7 million
for the Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. Changes in working capital items increased
cash provided by operating activities by $28.4 million and $86.4 million, respectively, for the
Current Period and Prior Period. Factors affecting changes in operating cash flows are largely the
same as those that affect net income, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as
depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs, gains or losses on sales
of property and equipment, impairments, non-cash compensation, income or losses from equity
investees and deferred income taxes. Included in operating activities for the Current Period are
DIP Facility financing costs of $0.5 million.
Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $75.2 million and $56.1 million for the
Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. Capital expenditures are the main component of
our investing activities. The majority of our capital expenditures for the Current Period and Prior
Period were related to our investment in new PeakeRigs™. Additionally, we purchased hydraulic
fracturing equipment with an aggregate of 60,000 horsepower, at auction, for $10.6 million during
the Current Period. Cash used in investing activities was partially offset by proceeds from the sale
of Hodges of $15.0 million during the Prior Period and proceeds from asset sales in the amounts
of $2.6 million and $16.4 million for the Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. We also
purchased $6.2 million of short-term investments and received proceeds of $4.5 million from the
sale of short-term investments during the Current Period.
Financing Activities. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was ($2.8) million and
$13.8 million for the Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. During the Prior Period, we
had borrowings and repayments under our credit facility of $160.1 million and $210.6 million,
respectively, and borrowed $100.0 million under the Incremental Term Loan and received net
proceeds of $94.5 million. We also repurchased and cancelled $40.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2022 Notes in multiple transactions for $26.4 million during the Prior
Period. We paid deferred borrowing costs of $0.8 million during the Prior Period. We made term
loan repayments of $2.5 million and $2.3 million during the Current Period and Prior Period,
respectively.

Revenues. Revenues for the Current Quarter decreased $17.2 million from the Previous Quarter
due to decreased utilization and continued pricing pressure during the Current Quarter. The
majority of our revenues have historically been derived from CHK and its working interest
partners. The percentage of our revenues derived from CHK was 70% and 64% for the Current
Quarter and the Previous Quarter, respectively.

Operating Costs. As a percentage of revenues, operating costs were 70% and 69% for the
Current Quarter and Previous Quarter, respectively. Operating costs for the Current Quarter
decreased $10.7 million, respectively, from the Previous Quarter primarily due to a decrease in
labor-related costs and a decrease in product costs in our hydraulic fracturing segment.

Drilling revenues for the Current Quarter decreased $9.1 million, or 13%, from the Previous
Quarter. This decrease was primarily due to an 18% decline in revenue days as the average
active rig count dropped from 19 in the Previous Quarter to 15 in the Current Quarter. Average
revenue per revenue day decreased 6% due to lower spot market rates. Revenues from non-CHK
customers were 37% of total segment revenues in the Current Quarter, compared to 39% for the
Previous Quarter. Included in total revenues are amounts related to idle-but-contracted (“IBC”)
payments from CHK of $35.3 million and $36.2 million, respectively for the Current Quarter and
Previous Quarter. Excluding the IBC revenues, the Company has diversified its customer base in
the drilling segment and increased non-CHK revenue from 79% in the Previous Quarter to 85% in
the Current Quarter.
As a percentage of drilling revenues, drilling operating costs were 37% and 38% for the Current
Quarter and the Previous Quarter, respectively. Drilling operating costs for the Current Quarter
decreased $4.2 million, or 15%, from the Previous Quarter, primarily due to decreases in labor-
related costs. Average operating costs per revenue day in the Current Quarter increased 3% from
the Previous Quarter, primarily due to fewer revenue days. Drilling restructuring charges were
$0.1 million for both the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter, respectively.

pressure continued, and a 4% decline in stages completed during the Current Quarter. Revenues
from non-CHK customers were 21% of total segment revenues in the Current Quarter compared,
to 30% for the Previous Quarter.
As a percentage of hydraulic fracturing revenues, hydraulic fracturing operating costs were 96%
and 92% for the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter, respectively. The increase was due to
continued pricing pressure. Hydraulic fracturing operating costs for the Current Quarter decreased
$5.9 million, or 8% from the Previous Quarter, primarily due to a 5% decrease in
47
operating costs per stage and a 4% decline in stages completed during the Current Quarter.
Hydraulic fracturing restructuring charges were $0.1 million for both the Current Quarter and
Previous Quarter, respectively.

Oilfield rental revenues for the Current Quarter increased $1.3 million, or 18%, from the Previous
Quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase in utilization as the company grows its
exposure in the Permian Basin. As a percentage of total segment revenues, revenues from non-
CHK customers were 48% of total segment revenues in the Current Quarter, compared to 76% for
the Previous Quarter.
As a percentage of oilfield rental revenues, oilfield rental operating costs were 100% and 127%
for the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter, respectively. The decrease was due to increased
fleet utilization. Oilfield rental operating costs for the Current Quarter decreased $0.7 million, or
7%, from the Previous Quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in labor-related costs
and subcontracting services.
Other Financial Statement Items
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the Current Quarter and
Previous Quarter were $69.9 million and $69.6 million, respectively. As a percentage of
revenues, depreciation and amortization expense was 51% and 45% for the Current Quarter and
Previous Quarter, respectively.
General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for the Current
Quarter and Previous Quarter were $39.7 million and $22.3 million, respectively. General and
administrative expenses for corporate functions settled in cash decreased $0.9 million, or 7%,
from $12.7 million in the Previous Quarter to $11.8 million in the Current Quarter, primarily due to
a decrease in consulting fees. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses
settled in cash were 9% and 8% for the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter, respectively.
Additionally, during the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter, we recognized restructuring
charges of $23.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, primarily related to professional fees
incurred prior to the Chapter 11 filing (see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). We
incurred non-cash compensation expenses of $4.1 million and $4.5 million, respectively, during
the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter and severance-related costs of $0.3 million during both
the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter.

Losses (Gains) on Sales of Property and Equipment, Net. We recorded losses (gains) on sales of
property and equipment of $1.0 million and ($0.5) million during the Current Quarter and Previous
Quarter, respectively.
Impairments and Other. During the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter, we recognized
impairments of $5.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively. During the Current Quarter, we
recognized impairment charges of $2.9 million for drilling-
48
related services equipment that we deemed to be impaired based on expected future cash flows
of this equipment. We also identified certain other property and equipment during the Current
Quarter that we deemed to be impaired based on our assessment of the market value of the
related property and equipment and recognized impairment charges of $2.9 million related to this
property and equipment. During the Previous Quarter, we recognized impairment charges of $0.3
million for certain drilling rigs that we impaired based on expected future cash flows of these rigs.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter was $20.5
million and $25.3 million, respectively, related to borrowings under our senior notes, term loans,
and credit facility. Since June 7, 2016, we have not recorded interest expense on the unsecured
debt due to the Chapter 11 cases. Contractual interest expense for the Current Quarter was $25.3
million.
Other Income. Other income was $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the Current Quarter and
Previous Quarter, respectively.
Reorganization items, net. Reorganization items for the Current Quarter totaled $13.4 million.
Subsequent to the Petition Date, we incurred $0.4 million of professional fees associated with the
Chapter 11 filing and fees of $0.5 million in relation to the DIP Facility agreement. Additionally,
during the Current Quarter, we wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the
2019 Notes and 2022 Notes, resulting in a non-cash reorganization charge of $12.5 million.
Income Tax Benefit. We recorded income tax benefit of $23.0 million and $8.1 million for the
Current Quarter and Previous Quarter, respectively. The $14.9 million increase in income tax
benefit recorded for the Current Quarter was primarily the result of an increase in net loss before
taxes of $39.8 million from the Previous Quarter to the Current Quarter. Our effective income tax
rate for the Current Quarter and Previous Quarter was 21% and 12%, respectively.

Revenues. Revenues and Adjusted Revenues for the Current Quarter decreased $157.0 million
and $143.5 million, respectively, from the Prior Quarter. The decrease was primarily due to
decreased utilization and increased pricing pressure. The percentage of our revenues derived
from CHK was 70% and 69% for the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter, respectively. Included in
total CHK revenue are amounts related to IBC payments of $35.3 million and $23.9 million,
respectively, for the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter. Excluding the IBC revenues, the Company
has diversified its customer base and increased non-CHK revenue from 34% in the Prior Quarter
to 40% in the Current Quarter.

Operating Costs. As a percentage of Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Operating Costs were 70%
and 78% for the Current Quarter and Prior Quarter, respectively. The decrease was due primarily
to a higher proportion of IBC rigs, which generate revenue with little associated cost. Operating
costs and Adjusted Operating Costs for the Current Quarter decreased $142.9 million and $124.5
million, respectively, from the Prior Quarter. The decrease was due to declines in labor-related
costs, a decline in utilization in each of our segments and a decrease in product costs in our
hydraulic fracturing segment.

Drilling revenues for the Current Quarter decreased $37.6 million, or 37%, from the Prior Quarter,
primarily due to a 57% decrease in revenue days as the average active rig count dropped from 36
in the Prior Quarter to 15 in the Current Quarter. Average revenue per day for the Current Quarter
decreased 17% from the Prior Quarter primarily due to lower spot market rates. The share of
revenues from non-CHK customers increased to 37% of total segment revenues in the Current
Quarter, compared to 36% for the Prior Quarter. Included in total CHK revenue are amounts
related to IBC payments of $35.3 million and $23.9 million, respectively for the Current Quarter
and Prior Quarter. Excluding the IBC revenues, the Company has diversified its customer base in
the drilling segment and increased non-CHK revenue from 47% in the Prior Quarter to 85% in the
Current Quarter.
As a percentage of drilling revenues, drilling operating costs were 37% and 57% for the Current
Quarter and the Prior Quarter, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a higher
proportion of IBC rigs, which generate revenue with little associated cost. Drilling operating costs
for the Current Quarter decreased $34.2 million, or 60%, from the Prior Quarter, primarily due to a
decrease in labor-related costs and lower fleet utilization. Drilling restructuring charges were $0.1
million in the Current Quarter.

during the Current Quarter, we wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the
2019 Notes and 2022 Notes, resulting in a non-cash reorganization charge of $12.5 million.
Income Tax Benefit. We recorded income tax benefit of $23.0 million and $40.7 million for the
Current Quarter and Prior Quarter, respectively. The $17.7 million decrease in income tax benefit
is primarily the result of an increase in the valuation allowance. We recorded a valuation
allowance of $49.0 million as of June 30, 2016, which reduced our income tax benefit in the
Current Quarter.

Revenues. Revenues and Adjusted Revenues for the Current Period decreased $431.4 million
and $388.7 million, respectively, from the Prior Period primarily due to decreased utilization and
increased pricing pressure. The percentage of our revenues derived from CHK was 67% and
72% for the Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. Included in total CHK revenue are
amounts related to IBC payments of $71.5 million and $29.5 million, respectively, for the Current
Period and Prior Period. Excluding the IBC revenues, the Company has diversified its customer
base and increased non-CHK revenue from 29% in the Prior Period to 44% in the Current Period.

“Adjusted Revenue” is a non-GAAP financial measure of revenues that excludes revenues
associated with our drilling rig relocation and logistics business and water hauling assets that
were sold in the Prior Period. For a description of our calculation of Adjusted Revenues and
the reasons our why management uses this measure to evaluate our business, please read “—
How We Evaluate Our Operations” and “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Operating Costs. As a percentage of Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Operating Costs were 69%
and 76% for the Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to
a higher proportion of IBC rigs, which generate revenue with little associated cost. Operating
costs and Adjusted Operating Costs decreased $367.6 million and $312.9 million, respectively, in
the Current Period compared to the Prior Period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in labor-related costs, a decline in utilization in each of our segments and a decrease in product
costs in our hydraulic fracturing segment.

2019 Notes and 2022 Notes, resulting in a non-cash reorganization charge of $12.5 million.
Income Tax Benefit. We recorded income tax benefit of $31.0 million and $56.9 million for the
Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. The $25.9 million decrease in income tax benefit is
primarily the result of an increase in the valuation allowance. We recorded a valuation allowance
of $49.0 million as of June 30, 2016, which reduced our income tax benefit in the Current Period.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Operating Leases
As of June 30, 2016, we were party to five lease agreements with various third parties to utilize
724 lease rail cars for initial terms of five to seven years. Additional rental payments are required
for the use of rail cars in excess of the allowable mileage stated in the respective agreement. We
account for these leases as operating leases.

we expect to incur in 2016.
Critical Accounting Policies
We consider accounting policies related to property and equipment, impairment of long-lived
assets, goodwill, intangible assets and amortization, revenue recognition and income taxes to be
critical policies. These policies are summarized in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (Commission
File No. 333-187766) filed with the SEC on February 17, 2016.

as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption
permitted. We are currently evaluating what impact this standard will have on our consolidated
financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases,” which modifies the lease
recognition requirements and requires entities to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from
leases on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating what impact
this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall,” which
requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and
requires evaluation of the need for valuation allowance of deferred tax assets related to available-
for-sale securities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017 with early adoption not permitted. We are currently evaluating what impact
this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income Taxes," which simplifies the
presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified
as noncurrent in the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not
expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the
Measurement of Inventory,” which changes inventory measured using any method other than
LIFO or the retail inventory method (for example, inventory measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO)
or average cost) at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on
our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements -
Going Concern," which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a
going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within
one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable).
ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating what impact
this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,”
which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”
and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the
effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods within that reporting period; the FASB also provided for early
adoption for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently
evaluating what impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Historically, we have provided substantially all of our oilfield services to CHK and its working
interest partners. For the Current Period and Prior Period, CHK accounted for approximately 67%
and 72% of our revenues, respectively. The decline in commodity prices since mid-2014 has had
an adverse effect on CHK’s and our other customers’ capital spending, which has adversely
impacted our cash flows and financial position. The extent and length of the current down cycle is
uncertain. If it is prolonged or worsens, it could have a further adverse effect on our customers’
capital spending. This would likely have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and
financial position and could adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenant
under our credit facility and limit our ability to fund our planned capital expenditures.
Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our credit facility and
term loans. We have borrowings outstanding under our term loans and may in the future borrow
under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate risk. For fixed rate
debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our
earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do
not impact the fair value of the debt instrument,
62
but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. Our primary exposure to interest rate risk
results from outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and term loans.
The following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes
in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest
rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at
June 30, 2016.

Our fuel costs, which consist primarily of diesel fuel used by our various trucks and other
equipment, can expose us to commodity price risk and our hydraulic fracturing operations expose
us to risks associated with the prices of materials used in hydraulic fracturing, such as sand and
chemicals. The prices for fuel and these materials can be volatile and are impacted by changes in
supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty and regional shortages. We currently do not
hedge our exposure to these risks.
As discussed in Note 2, upon the effective date of the Plan, the aggregate total of the face amount
of the 2019 Notes and 2022 Notes were cancelled and converted into equity and are no longer
included in the Company’s long-term debt balances.
Item 4.Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the
period. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, and is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of
June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our
most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1.Legal Proceedings
The information set forth under the caption “Legal Proceedings” in Note 11 of the Notes to the
Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 of Part 1 of this report is incorporated by
reference in response to this item.
Item 1A.Risk Factors
Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors
set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K (Commission File No. 333-187766) filed with the
SEC on February 17, 2016, together with other information in this report and other reports and
materials we file with the SEC. We have identified these risk factors as important factors that
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral
forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
We recently emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and
relationships.
It is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our recent emergence from the Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers,
employees and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:
•key suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced
performance;
•the ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;
•the ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely
affected;
employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other
employment opportunities; and
competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may
be negatively impacted.
•
•
The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our
operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to
bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.
Our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our
historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions
contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh-start accounting.
In connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to
consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to
the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our
emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the
bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and
should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected
numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance and with respect to
prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our
control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and
numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive
risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be
wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by
the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.
In addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we will adopt fresh-start accounting.
Accordingly, our future financial conditions and results of operations may not be comparable to
the financial condition or results of operations reflected in the Company’s historical financial
statements. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from
purchasing our common stock.
64
There is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject
to volatility.
Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, our old common stock was cancelled and we issued New
Common Stock. Our common stock is not listed on any national or regional securities exchange
or quoted on any over-the-counter market. The market price of our common stock could be
subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our
common stock may be affected by, numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.
These factors include, among other things, our new capital structure as a result of the transactions
contemplated by the plan of reorganization, our limited trading history subsequent to our
emergence from bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our
common stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh
start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature
and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products,
customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of
the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and
market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in
this Part II, Item 1A of this Report. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop
for the common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock. The
common stock may be traded only infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or
otherwise, and reliable market quotations may not be available. Holders of our common stock
may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active
trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our common stock, or
the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our
common stock. No assurances can be given regarding the Company’s ability to be quoted on one
of the over-the-counter markets or a national exchange in a timely manner or at all.
The ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be
affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.
The success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key
personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently
facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to
changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be
costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated,
or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner
and we could experience significant declines in productivity.
There may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in
conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.
Funds associated with Blue Mountain Capital Management, LLC (“Blue Mountain”), Axar Capital
Management, LLC (“Axar”) and Mudrick Capital Management, LLC (“Mudrick”) (each a “Holder”)
currently own approximately 37%, 16% and 8%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock.
Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or
preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional
shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company
in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common
stock. Furthermore, we have entered into a Stockholder Agreement with the Holders that provides
for certain director nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership. Certain significant
actions by the Company require the consent of one or more of the Holders. These actions
include, but are not limited to, the issuance of equity securities of the Company representing more
than 10% of the shares of New Common Stock issued pursuant to the Plan, the incurrence of
indebtedness under the New ABL Credit Facility in excess of $275 million in the aggregate and
other indebtedness in excess of $550 million in the aggregate, and the consummation of
acquisitions greater than $100 million. In addition, our significant concentration of share
ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may
perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.
Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors changed
significantly.
Pursuant to the Plan, the composition of our Board of Directors changed significantly. Upon
emergence, the Board is made up of seven directors, of which five will not have previously served
on the Board. We are party to a Stockholders Agreement with certain of our significant
stockholders, pursuant to which, among other things, they have the ability to designate for
nomination certain members of the Board. The new directors have different backgrounds,
experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board and,
thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. There
is no guarantee that the new Board will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our current
strategic plans. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially
from those of the past.
65
We do not expect to pay dividends in the near future.
We do not anticipate that cash dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to our
common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt
instruments to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to
receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading
price of our common stock.
Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may make it difficult for
stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage, delay or prevent a
merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.
Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”) and our Bylaws may have the
effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in
control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our
Charter and Bylaws include, among other things, those that:
•
authorize our Board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms,
including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;
•establish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at
stockholder meetings; and
•limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders.
While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the
Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a
transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests
and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.
These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove
our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our
Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.

Item 3.Defaults Upon Senior Securities
As previously disclosed, the filing of the voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company’s obligations
under the following debt instruments:
6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 issued pursuant to that certain indenture, dated as of June 16,
2014, between the Company, as issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee,
in the aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million; and
•
66
•
6.625% Senior Notes due 2019 issued pursuant to that certain indenture, dated as of October 28,
2011, between Seventy Seven Operating LLC and Seventy Seven Finance, Inc., as issuers, and
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, among others, in the aggregate
principal amount of $650.0 million.
As previously disclosed, subject to certain specific exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the
Chapter 11 filings automatically stayed most judicial or administrative actions against the
Company and efforts by creditors to collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with
respect to pre-petition claims. On August 1, 2016, the obligation of the Company and its
subsidiaries with respect to these notes were cancelled.
