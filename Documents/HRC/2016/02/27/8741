<p><b>  Addendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mission to Mongolia (1&#8211;8 October 2009)** 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
The Special Rapporteur on the right to education undertook a mission to Mongolia from 
</p>
<p>1 to 8 October 2009. The Special Rapporteur visited the capital city Ulaanbaatar, and 
<i>soums</i> of the Khovd <i>aimag</i> in the western region. He met with government officials, school 
principals, teachers, education professionals and academics, students, parents and trade 
union representatives, as well as with civil society representatives and the heads of United 
Nations agencies present in Mongolia, and visited numerous schools from kindergartens to 
universities. The objective of the mission was to understand how Mongolia implements the 
human right to education, the measures taken for its successful realization and the obstacles 
encountered. 
</p>
<p>In the present report, the Special Rapporteur analyses the principal characteristics of the 
Mongolian educational system, such as the organization of studies, coverage, infrastructure 
and financing of education, special programmes and adult education. The Special 
Rapporteur then highlights some of the good practices he was able to observe during his 
visit, such as the high enrolment rates and how Mongol society values education; and other 
examples such as the mobile <i>ger</i> kindergartens and school snacks, as well as some 
programmes of education for minorities and incentives for distance education that show 
creativity and adaptation to the vastness of the land and the climatic conditions encountered.

</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur then discusses some of the challenges he has noticed that the 
Mongolian educational system is facing, notably school dropouts and the lack of reliable 
statistics, the infrastructure conditions of schools in respect to access to water and 
sanitation, and the state of the dormitories in rural areas, the phenomenon of internal 
migration to cities that is leading to overcrowding in urban schools and the education of 
children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur then concludes by emphasizing the need to move towards a 
human rights culture and to see education as the vehicle for development and not as a 
service or a commodity, but as a basic human right, and makes specific recommendations 
to overcome the challenges despite the challenges of the landscape, climate and the 
economic downturn.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education undertook a mission to Mongolia 
from 1 to 8 October 2009. The objective of the mission was to understand, in the spirit of 
cooperation and dialogue, how Mongolia endeavours to implement the human right to 
education, the measures taken for its successful realization and the obstacles encountered. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur visited the capital city Ulaanbaatar, including the remote 
district of Nalaih, as well as the Jargalant, Khovd and Myangad <i>soums</i> of Khovd <i>aimag</i> in 
the western region. He met with government officials, including the Minister of Education, 
Culture and Science, the Vice-Minister of Education, directors of the different education 
departments, educational research institutes and centres, and senior officials of the Ministry 
of Social Welfare and Labour and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including the 
Vice-Minister. He also met with the Chief Commissioner of the National Human Rights 
Commission, the Rector and senior officials of the Mongolian State University of 
Education in Ulaanbaatar and of the University of Khovd in Khovd <i>soum</i>, as well as with 
school principals, teachers, education professionals and academics, students, parents and 
trade union representatives.  
</p>
<p>3. In addition, the Special Rapporteur conducted meetings with civil society 
representatives as well as with the different heads of United Nations agencies present in 
Mongolia. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the United 
Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in carrying out a successful visit and to express his 
sincere thanks to all those whom he met. He also expresses his deep appreciation for the 
frankness in the meetings he had and for the constructive self-criticism expressed by some 
of his interlocutors. The different meetings allowed him to appreciate the unequivocal 
commitment of the Government to provide education to all despite the particular situation 
and the challenges encountered. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The right to education: principles, norms and standards 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>4. Mongolia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Furthermore, Mongolia has accepted the optional 
individual complaints mechanisms of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and has ratified the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>5. These key international human rights instruments, together with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, enshrine the right to education. The important 
provisions related to this right that they contain provide a framework for legislation and 
policy at the national level of each State party. Moreover, States party to international 
human rights treaties have an obligation to give effect to the stipulations of the treaties. Of 
particular relevance are the provisions of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, together with general comments Nos. 
11 and 13 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the right to 
education. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13394 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Domestic legal framework and national policies 
</b></p>
<p>6. Mongolia is divided, for political and administrative purposes, into 21 provinces, 
known as<i> aimags</i>, and one municipality or <i>hot</i>, namely the capital, Ulaanbaatar. <i>Aimag 
</i>centres constitute provincial capitals. Each <i>aimag</i> is divided into smaller administrative 
districts or <i>soums</i>, with each <i>soum</i> having a designated centre. Finally, a <i>soum</i> is divided 
into <i>baghs</i>, which are essentially villages. Families all have the right to be represented in 
their respective elected <i>bagh</i> assembly. These assemblies elect the <i>soum</i> assemblies, which 
in turn elect <i>aimag</i> assemblies. An <i>aimag</i> assembly proposes its governor, who must be 
approved by the prime minister before taking office.  
</p>
<p>7. The current Constitution of Mongolia was adopted in January 1992 and amended in 
1999 and 2001. With its introduction, a semi-presidential democratic republic with a 
multiparty system was created. At the same time, a constitutional court was established. In 
its second chapter, the Constitution provides for the protection of numerous rights and 
freedoms. The larger part of these rights and freedoms are of a civil and political nature, 
such as freedom of association, the right to appeal, or freedom of conscience and religion. 
However, certain economic, social and cultural rights are also protected, including the right 
to a healthy and safe environment, the protection of health and medical care, and the right 
to freely engage in creative work in cultural, artistic and scientific fields. 
</p>
<p>8. In accordance with the National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia Act, 
passed by Parliament in December 2000, Mongolia has a national human rights institution 
charged with the protection and promotion of human rights. The National Human Rights 
Commission took up its work in January 2001. It produces a yearly report on the situation 
of human rights and freedoms in the country. 
</p>
<p>9. The Constitution of Mongolia establishes the right to education for all citizens in 
article 16, paragraph 7. It further specifies that the &#8220;State shall provide basic general 
education free of charge&#8221; and also stipulates that &#8220;citizens may establish and operate private 
schools in conformity with the Government requirements&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. More detailed legal provisions regulating the educational sector in Mongolia are 
outlined in the Education Act, which was revised in 1995 and amended in 2002. This law 
reflects the fundamental principles of education, including the principle of equality in 
education and the provision of free and compulsory education. According to the Education 
Act, education aims to equip citizens with the appropriate intellectual, moral and physical 
skills to learn, work and live independently. 
</p>
<p>11. In addition, the Mongolian Parliament has adopted the State Education Policy, the 
Higher Education Act and the Primary and Secondary Education Act. Each of these legal 
acts came into force after 1990, when Mongolia chose to change from a socialist system 
and planned economy to a democratic and market-oriented system. These laws explicitly 
define the policies of democracy and openness in educational administrative structures. 
They also stipulate the decentralization of public-school financing and administration. The 
management of schools is transferred to local governments in each <i>aimag</i>, while colleges 
and universities are given greater autonomy than in the past. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Key features of the Mongolian education system 
</b></p>
<p>12. When considering today&#8217;s educational system in Mongolia, the country&#8217;s history 
and its possible impacts should not be ignored. In pre-modern times, education was 
controlled by Buddhist monasteries and was limited to monks. Soon after the collapse of 
Chinese authority in 1911, secular education began to be introduced. Throughout the 1920s, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13394 
</p>
<p>education slowly expanded. It took until the mid-1940s, however, to completely implement 
a public school system. This system was based on the Soviet model until 1990. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Administration and management of the education system 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science is the key governmental body 
responsible for the country&#8217;s educational system. In relation to education, this Ministry 
deals with almost all publicly financed forms of education, ranging from preschool 
institutions to adult education. Its mandate includes the development of comprehensive and 
suitable education mechanisms for all, which extends to the approval and publishing of 
national textbooks and curricula. It is also responsible for the organization and overview of 
implementation of the related legal mandates. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education, 
Culture and Science coordinates and provides in-service training for all staff engaged in the 
public education sector, which includes all the teachers and educators. 
</p>
<p>14. Although education is centrally coordinated, provincial authorities in Mongolia 
assume responsibility on a more practical and local level. Each of the country&#8217;s 21 <i>aimags</i> 
oversees a social policy department within its local government, which is responsible for 
administrating and managing government policies and services relating to both formal and 
non-formal education. These departments establish, administer and manage (as well as 
fund) kindergartens, primary and secondary schools. They are also responsible for issuing 
local legislation pertaining to education and for such tasks as appointing and discharging 
school principals. 
</p>
<p>15. While a transfer of power from the central to local government authorities is already 
evident at the level of primary and secondary education, it is much more pronounced at the 
post-secondary level. Universities have a great deal of autonomy. Rather than being obliged 
to conform to regulations imposed upon it by the central or local government, a university 
may actively participate in decision-making processes with the Ministry of Education, 
Culture and Science concerning, for example, its own budget. Universities also differ from 
other education institutions in that they are permitted to secure their own, additional 
funding from tuition fee revenues, research grants, or outside donors. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Basic structure of the education system 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Mongolian education system includes non-compulsory pre-education, namely 
kindergarten and nursery school. Basic education in Mongolia, following the amendment to 
the Educational Act of 2002, consists of five years of primary education (7 to 11 year olds) 
followed by four years of lower secondary education (12 to 16 year olds). Thereafter pupils 
may attend two years of upper secondary school and enrol in post-secondary education. In 
the academic year 2008/09, the entry age was lowered from seven to six years and hence an 
additional year of primary school was added. Mongolia therefore now has a 12-year school 
curriculum. Basic education (tuition), at the primary and lower secondary level, is free of 
charge for all. 
</p>
<p>17. Primary and secondary schools are often housed in the same buildings and schools 
up to grade 10 are generally only found in larger towns and cities. <i>Aimag </i>centre schools are 
typically larger than <i>soum</i> centre schools, which in turn are larger than schools found in 
<i>baghs</i>, reflecting the relative population size of each of these administrative divisions. Due 
to Mongolia&#8217;s vast geographical size and its extremely low population density, the 
educational system is dependent on boarding schools for children from the countryside. The 
Mongolian school year consists of 34 teaching weeks at the primary level, 35 weeks at the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13394 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>lower secondary level, and 36 weeks at the upper secondary level. The school year begins 
in September and is divided into two semesters. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Preschool education 
</b></p>
<p>18. Preschool education is optional and caters to children aged over 2 years. Private 
kindergartens are synonymous with day-care centres and exist alongside State 
kindergartens and other preschools. In accordance with the Law of Primary and Secondary 
Education of 1995, State-run kindergartens primarily aim to develop children&#8217;s cognitive, 
physical and socio-emotional development. They do so by teaching the mother tongue, 
mathematics, the arts, physical education, music and movement. Children usually attend 
kindergarten five days a week, with Saturday a half-day when children attend an alternative 
form of training.1 
</p>
<p>19. In recent years much of preschool education has been guided by the National Policy 
on Integrated Early Childhood Development, which was adopted by a joint order of the 
Ministers of Health, Education and Labour and Social Welfare in April 2005. The policy 
aims to strengthen cooperation and collaboration between various actors working in the 
field of early childhood development. It recognizes the importance of adequate and 
effective preparation of children for regular schooling and highlights the different roles 
played by everyone in early childhood development, including those of parents, family 
members and the public and private sectors.2 
</p>
<p>20. In 2007, the gross enrolment ratios in such institutions of preschool education were 
calculated at 58.1 per cent.3 This figure includes the total number of children, regardless of 
their age, as a percentage of the population in the theoretical age group for this level of non-
compulsory education. The Special Rapporteur notes that the gross enrolment ratio for 
Mongolia has greatly increased during the last decade; in 1999, just 25 per cent of children 
were enrolled in preschool education.4 Mongolia is therefore moving away from the Central 
Asian regional average, which was at 28 per cent in 2007, and towards gross education 
ratios as experienced in most industrialized countries, where they are above 80 per cent.5 
The Special Rapporteur praises this positive trend and hopes that the relevant authorities 
will take appropriate action to continue its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Primary education 
</b></p>
<p>21. Primary education is compulsory and now covers a six-year period. Following an 
amendment to the Education Law in 2002, the entry age was lowered from 8 to 7 years. It 
was again lowered in 2008 from 7 to 6 years. 
</p>
<p>22. In the 1999/2000 school year, in the context of the former educational system, there 
were 128 schools offering primary education only. Most of these were located in remote 
rural areas or <i>soums</i>. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that 216 schools offered 
combined primary and lower secondary education, which amounted to eight years and were 
seen as a whole. The full 10 grades were offered by 324 schools.

</p>
<p>23. The Mongolian primary school curriculum includes classes in the Mongolian 
language, mathematics, history and social sciences, natural sciences, music, fine arts and 
physical education. Pupils are automatically promoted from grades one through to four and 
assessment is conducted on a continuous basis. At the end of primary school, children sit 
the school-based examination.6 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur was informed that net primary enrolment rates, where the 
number of pupils in a theoretical age group enrolled is expressed as a percentage of the 
same total population, were more than 90 per cent when last calculated in 2007.7 
Discrepancies between statistics for the male and female population were barely 
distinguishable at the primary level. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Secondary education 
</b></p>
<p>25. Lower secondary education lasts four years and forms the final stage of compulsory 
education. Following educational reforms at the turn of the millennium, lower secondary 
education now encompasses grades 7 to 10 (the general education system is in transition to 
a 12-year system). Upper secondary education comprises grades 11 and 12. Graduates from 
grades 9, 10 and 11 may join technical and vocational training schools. 
</p><p>26. The curriculum for both lower and upper secondary education contains Mongolian 
language, Mongolian literature, foreign languages (English and Russian), mathematics, 
natural sciences, geography, biology, physics, chemistry, history and social studies, music, 
physical education, and art. As is also the case at the primary level, where pupils are subject 
to school-based examinations, students also sit State examinations at the end of both lower 
and upper secondary school. Academic achievement is assessed in each grade and in the 
State exams through use of the A to F marks, as well as an assessment in percentages.8 
</p>
<p>27. As the Special Rapporteur was informed, net enrolment rates at the secondary level 
are lower than those at the primary level. In 2007, of those students aged between 12 and 15 
years, 86.6 per cent were enrolled in secondary education. Females are more likely to 
remain enrolled in secondary education than males, with the statistics revealing net 
enrolment rates of 88.8 and 84.8 per cent, respectively.9 
</p>
<p><b> F. Post-secondary education 
</b></p>
<p>28. Institutions offering post-secondary education in Mongolia include universities, 
colleges and vocational institutes. Bachelor&#8217;s degrees usually last four to five years and 
comprise a minimum of 120 credits, with 30 hours of practical training amounting to one 
academic credit. Master&#8217;s degrees require an additional one and a half to two years of 
study. Doctoral degrees take three to four years, on average, to complete. Vocational 
training courses, consisting of one to three years of study, are offered by some colleges and 
lead to the Higher Education Diploma. 
</p>
<p>29. Many public universities exist, including the National University of Mongolia in 
Ulaanbaatar, which the Special Rapporteur visited. Those in the capital city are usually 
specialized in certain fields, such as medicine, law, education, agriculture, etc. Most 
colleges offering vocational courses are also State-owned. Each of these institutions has, in

<p>recent years, come to enjoy greater autonomy with regards to academic content, the hiring 
of professors and the choice of admission policies. In addition, following the educational 
reforms of the 1990s which permitted the establishment of such institutions, a multitude of 
privately owned higher educational systems operate. In the academic year 2009/10, the 
Special Rapporteur was told that 99 private higher educational institutions existed, 
enrolling some 64,000 students.  
</p>
<p>30. Admission to university and non-university post-secondary programmes is through 
the <i>Gerchilgee</i> diploma, awarded upon successful completion of secondary school. 
However, all tertiary-education institutions also require students to sit a specific 
competitive entrance exam. This is held once a year, usually in either late June or early 
July. The Special Rapporteur learned that, since 1993, tuition at the post-secondary level is 
no longer free. However, the Government provides financial assistance, in the form of 
grants and loans, to students from low-income families and students who demonstrate 
outstanding scholastic achievement. 
</p>
<p>31. The relatively high enrolment rates in Mongolia for higher education indicate that 
the Mongolian society greatly appreciates the value of extensive education. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that 142,411 students were enrolled at a university or similar 
higher education institution in 2007.10 Of these students 1,111 were international students 
from abroad.11 Gross enrolment rates in 2007 were at 48 per cent, twice the regional 
average of 24 per cent. The rates are much higher for female students (around 60 per cent) 
than male students (around 40 per cent).12 Also in 2007, Mongolia saw 25,938 students 
graduate.13 
</p>
<p><b> G. Special education 
</b></p>
<p>32. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the specific educational needs of 
children with physical and mental disabilities could be addressed exclusively in <i>aimag</i> 
centres and larger cities.14 The Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, has six secondary special 
schools (four 9-year secondary special schools and two 11-year secondary special schools). 
The Special Rapporteur has been informed that, in educational districts without special 
schools, students with disabilities do not show up in statistics pertaining to the general 
student body.15 
</p>
<p>33. Nevertheless, official Government sources stress that the Mongolian Constitution 
guarantees the right to education to all citizens, including those with disabilities. The 
enactment and implementation of policies concerning the education and training of children 
with a disability is a State responsibility. For that purpose, the Government has established 
the National Centre of Rehabilitation and Vocational Training for the Disabled. The six 
special secondary schools operating in Ulaanbaatar are all also State-run. In addition, in the 
academic year 2004/05, a special school for blind children was opened.16

</p>
<p><b> H. Adult and non-formal education 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur learned that the concept and practice of continuing 
education was unheard of under the former socialist system. He was made aware that today 
an estimated 100,000 of Mongolia&#8217;s 1.2 million adult population is involved in some form 
of formal education.17 Learning opportunities for citizens outside of the school system were 
first provided by the Government in 1991. Although legal bases have stressed the need for 
and importance of non-formal education, the sector remains relatively unstructured. The 
Non-Formal Education Centre has been formed which aims to coordinate activities on a 
national basis. In 1997, the National Programme of Non-Formal Education Development 
was launched. This was followed, in 2002, by the National Programme for Distance 
Education, which also addresses alternative pathways to education. 
</p>
<p>35. The National Programme of Non-Formal Education Development places particular 
focus on identifying the content, form and methodology of non-formal training that best 
meets the Mongolian population&#8217;s interests and needs. It aims, inter alia, to increase literacy 
and general education levels and enhance professional and vocational skills. In working to 
achieve these aims, government ministries, non-governmental organizations and civil 
society shall actively participate. Close coordination with the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) education development policy for the Asia 
and Pacific region is envisaged, but the content of non-formal education is to be developed 
in a country-specific manner by the Centre for Non-Formal Education.18 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur is aware that frequently identified reasons for possible 
educational insufficiencies in the Mongolian adult population are the accessibility 
challenges due to the immense geographical distances. Therefore, it is only natural that the 
National Programme for Distance Education addresses all levels of education, including 
adult education. Implementation plans for this programme charge the Ministry of 
Education, Culture and Science with management, planning, coordinating and controlling 
of distance education strategies. Reflecting the general educational structure in Mongolia, 
different administrative divisions are nonetheless to be expected to contribute to the overall 
success of the programme.19 The Special Rapporteur was also informed that those who 
attend vocational training receive various kinds of assistance, for example, scholarships, 
allowance, and boarding school charges, which means they are not charged during their 
study period of time. Private vocational training centres receive support from the State 
budget. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Financing of the education system 
</b></p>
<p>37. As is the case in most countries, financing of education in Mongolia results from a 
combination of Government budget allocations, student tuition fees and research grants, 
with the latter two sources being of particular importance at the post-secondary level. With 
the Education Law of 1995, the Government of Mongolia committed to maintaining 
education funding at a 20 per cent share of total Government expenditure.20 The Special 
Rapporteur was informed by Government officials that, in 2008, 24 per cent of the 
Government budget was assigned to education, a figure that represented 7.2 per cent of the 
nation&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP). The breakdown of the educational budget reflects

<p>GE.10-13394 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the country&#8217;s geographic and climatic conditions with heating costs constituting almost 20 
per cent of the total annual budget of approximately Tog 64 million.21 
</p>
<p>38. As a result of the impact of the financial crisis on Mongolia, such budgetary figures 
are expected to have changed and may continue to do so. The Asian Development Fund is 
currently in the process of launching the Education for the Poor &#8211; Financial Crisis Response 
project to ensure that access to and quality of education will be maintained and, where 
possible, enhanced during and beyond the economic and financial crisis. In the context of 
this project, a grant to the value of US$ 17 million has been assigned to Mongolia by the 
Asian Development Bank for the period 2009&#8211;2012. The Government of Mongolia has 
committed to supplementing this amount by US$ 9.36 million.22 
39. Since 2002, as the Special Rapporteur was informed, education financing has been 
centralized across the country, with the exception of the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, where a 
unique and parallel practice exists. A clear overview and understanding of educational 
spending in Mongolia was most recently provided by the 2005 Public Expenditure Tracking 
Survey and the subsequent analysis thereof in a 2006 World Bank report on <i>Public 
Financing of Education in Mongolia: Equity and Efficiency Implications</i>.23 
40. These reports indicate that finances for Mongolian schools are planned and allocated 
based upon a funding formula. This formula differentiates between variable and fixed 
spending. While variable spending is relative to estimated enrolment figures for a given 
academic year, fixed spending is based on past expenditures. The amount of funding 
received by a particular school is also dependent on its status as either a rural or urban 
school, the size of its student body and its type. <i>Aimags</i> may reallocate the total funding 
received, in order to compensate smaller schools.24 
</p>
<p>41. Unique to Mongolia, with reference to education funding, is its system of teacher 
compensation. Teacher salaries are made up of three main parts, namely a base salary, 
salary supplements and bonuses. Base salaries are solely dependent upon experience, while 
salary supplements may be assigned for many different reasons, such as class size, remote 
location, etc. As of early 2010, the average salary rate for school teachers reached US$ 180 
per month. The criteria applied for the awarding of bonuses or making of deductions from a 
teacher&#8217;s salary were unclear to the Special Rapporteur. The 2005 Public Expenditure 
Tracking Survey revealed that teachers in urban schools earn more than those in rural 
schools, mostly because of the class sizes.25 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Educational good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. High enrolment rates and societal value of education 
</b></p>
<p>42. Although conscious of the fact that there is still room for improvement, the Special 
Rapporteur is impressed by the high rates of school enrolment in Mongolia, particularly at 
primary and secondary levels. At the last count, in 2007, net primary enrolment rates were 
at 92.7 per cent for both girls and boys. Enrolment rates at the secondary level are slightly

</p>
<p>lower, but still high, namely, at 86.6 per cent. At this level, females are more likely to be 
enrolled in school than males. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur has seen in Mongolia that significant challenges to the 
widespread and effective provision of education can successfully be overcome. Despite 
living in the most sparsely populated country with extreme weather conditions, the vast 
majority of Mongolian children has access to primary and secondary schooling. 
</p><p>44. These high enrolment rates, together with the recent changes to the school 
curriculum, lead the Special Rapporteur to deduce that the value of education is widely 
accepted in Mongolian society and increasingly so. Starting from the academic year 
2005/06, Mongolian children entered primary school at 7 years of age. In the academic year 
2008/09, the entry age was lowered to 6 years. These changes allow children to benefit 
from schooling at an earlier age. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur also sees the high societal value of education reflected at the 
post-secondary education level. Gross enrolment rates at universities and comparable 
higher education institutions reached 48 per cent in 2007, which is twice the regional 
average. Changes to legislation governing the educational system during the 1990s allowed 
the establishment of new, privately owned higher education institutions in addition to State-
run universities and colleges, which the Special Rapporteur views as a positive 
development. The introduction of tuition fees for tertiary education reflects the practice in 
most developed countries, although the Special Rapporteur warns against increases, 
especially in the present situation of the economic downturn which is affecting Mongolia. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mobile <i>ger</i> kindergartens and school snacks 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur was made aware that, in Mongolia, where around 40 per 
cent of the population resides in rural areas, only 42 per cent of children from rural families 
aged between 2 and 6 have access to preschool services (kindergartens), although the 
number of preschool education educators reached 73.1 per cent in 2008. 
</p>
<p>47. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to hear of creative ideas of the 
Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to increase access and coverage of kindergarten 
facilities in rural areas by establishing the programme of the mobile <i>ger</i> kindergarten, a 
unique initiative to increase the accessibility and quality of preschool education. This 
programme benefits from the support of UNICEF and non-governmental organizations. In 
2008, the initiative helped 21 remote <i>soums</i> establish 38 mobile <i>ger</i> kindergartens in order 
to increase the accessibility and quality of preschool education and 50 other <i>ger</i> 
kindergartens at 50 <i>soums</i> as part of the Education for All Fast Track Initiative. 
</p>
<p>48. In addition, specific training sessions were organized for the mobile kindergarten 
teachers working in remote areas to improve the quality of education services, including 
some with UNICEF support. By being close to rural families, mobile teachers have a better 
opportunity to communicate directly with parents, which enables them to provide important 
information about early childhood development. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur found that kindergartens and mobile teachers were 
instrumental in delivering preschool education to children in isolated areas who are unable 
to access formal preschool services. However, the coverage throughout the country is still 
limited. The Special Rapporteur therefore insists that the capacity of mobile <i>ger</i> 
kindergartens should be increased in order to support early childhood development and 
school preparation within families. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13394 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Education for minorities and other creative initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur had the privilege of visiting the school of Khovd <i>soum</i> 
where the students, teachers and administrative staff were from the Kazakh ethnic 
community &#8211; which is the main minority group in Mongolia and is present especially in the 
western part of the country. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that this 
community enjoys bilingual education (Kazakh-Mongol) at the primary level and that the 
Government is active in the development of curriculum and textbooks in the Kazakh 
language. The Special Rapporteur was also made aware that, although not the case in the 
<i>soum</i> he visited, children and adolescents of the Kazakh community can also follow 
secondary education in the Bayan-Ulgi <i>aimag</i> further west. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur was also made aware that UNICEF plans to develop similar 
programmes to reach the Tuvan indigenous people, a group of nomads living in the 
mountains of the north of the country. This openness on the part of the Government to &#8212; 
and the acceptance by the majority of the population of &#8212; the special educational needs of 
minorities and indigenous populations further demonstrate good practices that should be 
further developed and their outreach extended. 
</p>
<p>52. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur also visited non-formal education centres 
which aim to provide learning opportunities for those who are outside or have dropped out 
of the school system and whose skills are no longer appropriate for daily life or the labour 
market. The Programme for the Promotion of Non-Formal Education started in 1995 and 
the Non-Formal Education Centre was recently created under the Ministry of Education to 
take charge of the national coordination of activities related to non-formal education 
development. The Special Rapporteur was informed of some special programmes that are 
aimed at providing adult education programmes using radio and print materials in 
combination with visiting mobile teachers for rural areas. Such programmes and other 
initiatives rely heavily on the help of outside donors. 
</p>
<p>53. Finally, the Special Rapporteur was made aware of a creative initiative aimed at 
educating young generations for nature protection, as a lack of ecological education 
contributes to environmental degradation. In an effort to restore ecological education and 
awareness among the public, the Government of Mongolia approved the National 
Programme for Public Ecological Education in 1997. The programme includes the 
development of ecological training among the children in secondary schools. With the help 
of outside partners such as the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, children 
are taught in and out of classes to learn more of the nature and environment and its 
interaction with their daily lives. Through a pilot project, 20 teachers &#8212; mainly teaching 
biology and geography &#8212; are involved in development of the curriculum and training on its 
use. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Educational challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. School dropouts and lack of reliable statistics 
</b></p>
<p>54. It is estimated that almost 35 per cent of the Mongolian population is under 18 and a 
quarter of the population is between 10 and 19 years old. Since the collapse of the State-
controlled economy and the rapid transformation towards a market-oriented economy in the 
early 1990s, the country has experienced deepening poverty, increasing unemployment and 
colossal debt servicing. New problems in the education system have also been observed, 
such as poorer school conditions, poorer quality of teaching and learning (especially in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-13394 
</p>
<p>rural schools), inadequate recreational activities for youth outside school and an increase in 
school dropout rates. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that dropout rates were particularly high, 
especially for such a country of young people. It is estimated that school dropout numbers 
increased dramatically in the first years of the economic transition and have since then 
slowly decreased. However, the Special Rapporteur was unable to find reliable statistical 
data that would have provided a clear picture of the magnitude of this phenomenon. 
Furthermore, he was informed that official statistics and records on the dropout rate were 
riddled with inconsistencies. Nevertheless, it was estimated that, in 2001, around 15 per 
cent of children in rural areas did not attend school because they were employed in the 
agriculture sector (herders with their livestock), while in cities this statistic was around 8 
per cent. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the majority of those who leave 
school are boys. It is quite unusual to have more boys than girls drop out of school. The 
Special Rapporteur was made aware that, especially in rural areas, families find it more 
economically rewarding to keep boys in farming rather than send them to school. Reports 
have estimated that, in 2001, the school attendance rate in urban areas among the 
population between 7 and 29 years was 53.6 per cent for males and 59.6 per cent for 
females, whereas in rural areas it was estimated at 32.8 per cent and 39.3 per cent, 
respectively. There is also no clear definition of dropout, which has resulted in the absence 
of reliable data on this issue. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the recent changes in 
the structure of the educational model, from a 6+2+2 model in 1990, to 3+5+2 in 1992, 
4+4+2 in 1998, 5+4+2 in 2002 and the recent move to a 6+4+2 model have also affected 
attendance, as the pupils and their parents have often found the changes confusing. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls upon the Government to look at the 
importance of defining the term &#8220;dropout&#8221; and its consequences. Attention must also be 
given to how records are kept and maintained, especially in rural schools. Teachers and 
social workers should be better trained at keeping and maintaining proper and uniform 
records of attendance and other data collection. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the enforcement of compulsory education in 
Mongolia does not carry any weight, since there are no penalty clauses provided for non-
compliance. As such, it is easy for parents to withdraw their children from school for 
whatever reason. The situation is amplified by the nomadic tradition of most of rural 
Mongolia, the harsh physical conditions of the country and the remoteness of some of the 
settlements.  
</p>
<p><b> B. School infrastructure: access to water and sanitation and state of 
dormitories in rural areas 
</b></p>
<p>59. Low population density and the nomadic lifestyle in many rural areas means that 
boarding schools play an important role in the Mongolian education system. In the school 
year 2008/09, it was estimated that the 492 public and 10 private boarding schools enrolled 
42,086 students (about 8 per cent of the overall student population), of which 36,808 were 
herders&#8217; children. While recognizing that the costs of maintaining small rural schools and 
boarding schools are high, the Special Rapporteur saw himself that often these educational 
institutions are outdated and in serious need of maintenance and renovation. This is most 
accentuated in the remote areas where investments have been slow to arrive. The disparities 
between rural schools and urban schools are striking and need to be addressed urgently by 
the Government.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13394 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur has also noted that the infrastructure facilities in primary 
and secondary schools tend to be outdated, often in a state of disrepair, and that the budgets 
for maintenance and renovation were totally inadequate. The Special Rapporteur calls upon 
the Government to assign funding for improved facilities, better instructional materials and 
teaching resources, better scientific equipment and improved libraries. Also of concern to 
the Special Rapporteur were the hygiene conditions of schools in rural areas which were in 
very poor state and the lack of drinking water and proper access to sanitation facilities in 
many establishments which endangers the health of students and teachers.   
</p>
<p>61. More striking is the absence of toilets in many of the overcrowded schools and 
dormitories, and the difficulties for students to maintain a minimum level of personal 
hygiene. These conditions constitute serious threats to the health of students as well as 
teachers and staff working in the schools and dormitories. It is also clear that poor health 
conditions in the dormitories in rural schools is a factor contributing to students dropping 
out, as many parents are reluctant to send their children to schools without proper sanitation 
facilities, especially in the first year of compulsory primary education. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress to the Government that the lack of proper 
sanitation in schools severely impinges upon the right to education. He recalls the 
observations of the independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation, who noted that the diseases caused by the lack 
of proper access to sanitation resulted in children being sick and had negative impacts on 
their ability to learn.26 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur would like to point out, however, that schools are often a 
determinant factor for initiating change by helping children to develop useful life skills, 
including those concerning health and hygiene. New hygiene behaviours learned at school 
can result in positive habits. Teachers can act as role models, not only for the children but 
also within the community. In turn, children often influence the behaviour of other family 
members, including both adults and younger siblings, and thereby contribute to more 
general changes in hygiene habits.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Migration to cities and overcrowding in urban schools 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur has been made aware of the phenomenon of internal 
migration from rural areas to urban centres, particularly to the capital city and its 
surrounding areas, which has been occurring since the 1990s and the dismantlement of the 
State-planned economy. Such migration has reached new heights since the financial crisis 
hit the country in 2008. Although the exact nature of the consequences of the financial 
crisis has yet to be determined, the Special Rapporteur was informed that price increases in 
basic commodities and school items have been greater in rural than in urban areas. The 
transition to a market economy had also impacted the life of the rural population as it 
resulted in fewer job opportunities, lower productivity in the animal husbandry sector and 
the domination of the service sector. 
</p>
<p>65. All these factors have triggered inward migration to <i>aimag</i> centres and urban areas, 
which in turn created new peri-urban populations. Ulaanbaatar and its surroundings have 
especially felt the impacts of inward migration, with a doubling of its population in recent 
years. At the same time, rural areas are losing their once stable populations. The migration 
to cities has thus brought new challenges to the education sector, by substantially increasing

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-13394 
</p>
<p>demand for school services in urban centres. Some rural schools are now operating below 
capacity as a result of outflows from their catchment areas.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur has further observed that migration from rural to urban areas 
presents additional challenges to the educational authorities. In remote rural areas, schools 
have had to contend with decreasing enrolment and rising per capita costs, while in urban 
areas, notably in Ulaanbaatar and its immediate surroundings, internal migration is placing 
considerable pressure on school infrastructure. Many schools now operate in double or even 
triple shifts and pupil-teacher ratios have been on the rise.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by this overcrowding in urban schools and the 
potential consequences it can have on the learning environment. This, combined with 
limited space in classes and few extra-curricular activities, not only because of capacity but 
also because of climate constraints, further affects the development of a positive learning 
environment. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to expand school 
constructions in urban and peri-urban areas as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Education of children with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur was made aware that 23,969 pupils enrolled in the education 
system present some form of impairment requiring special educational needs. It is estimated 
that 10,921 pupils are affected by visual impairment (of whom 6,337 are girls); 1,862 with 
a mental disability; 4,529 with hearing impediments and 2,575 with various physical needs. 
Secondary School No. 29 in Ulaanbaatar is the leading special school, which is entitled to 
develop the curriculum and instructional materials for the other five secondary special 
schools in Ulaanbaatar. It is estimated that there are around 200 teachers in Mongolia 
trained to cater to special educational needs. In 1994, the Teacher Training College opened 
a faculty for special education teachers. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur noted, however, with great concern, that the educational 
opportunities for pupils with disabilities are still far from being met and realized. He has 
observed and been made aware of the segregation of these students who are being placed in 
non-formal education centres and not in the formal education structure. Although the 
Special Rapporteur identified students with light disabilities in the formal structure, he 
found that teachers generally do not have the skills or capacities to meet special educational 
needs.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was also concerned by an absence of reliable statistics 
pertaining to children with disabilities. This reality not only prevents the identification of 
the number and whereabouts of these persons, but also impedes the development of public 
policies to address their needs, contributing to further segregation and discrimination. The 
Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to move forward in the design and 
implementation of educational programmes that would allow the gradual inclusion of 
students with disabilities in the regular system, reminding it that Mongolia has ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and assumed obligations in this 
regard. These programmes should aim to make physical adjustments in schools, provide 
transport for persons with disabilities and gradually introduce curriculum adaptations and 
teacher training that is required in order to offer quality education to all. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Lack of a human rights culture 
</b></p>
<p>71. Throughout the many meetings conducted and the many schools and other 
educational institutions visited during the mission, the Special Rapporteur noticed a lack of 
participation of women in the public affairs of the country. He also noticed the persistence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13394 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>of certain gender-based stereotypes, such as one of the main characteristics of education in 
Mongolia being its disproportionate female representation, whereby female domination is 
reported throughout the education system. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur also noted that the overrepresentation of women in the 
education system is in contradiction with the lack of participation of women in the public 
affairs of the country.  
</p>
<p>73. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur would like to stress the need to move away 
from traditional gender-based stereotypes and highlight the importance of creating a human 
rights culture, not only in schools, but also among the general population of Mongolia. As 
such, there is a strong need to strengthen the vision of human rights in educational 
programmes. Although some human rights are present in some parts of the curricula, these 
are generally included in a descriptive and superficial manner and limited to three subjects, 
namely social studies, history and civic education. The Special Rapporteur has noted that 
the State University of Education has undertaken valuable initiatives to train teachers in this 
regard, despite limited resources. The lack of literature on human rights available in the 
Mongol language should also draw the attention of the international community and United 
Nations agencies, which should encourage and finance the translation of books on human 
rights into the Mongol language.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur would like to recall his observations in his recent report on 
lifelong and human rights learning where he insisted on the necessity of learning &#8220;to move 
closer to the context of human rights, as this is essential for progression to a society free 
from all forms of prejudice, exclusion and discrimination and the realization of a global 
human rights culture&#8221;.27 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation to the 
Government of Mongolia, civil society and the United Nations agencies for all their 
assistance in carrying out a successful visit. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to 
experience such frankness in all the meetings he had, and appreciated the constructive 
self-criticism expressed by his interlocutors. The Special Rapporteur reminds the 
Government of its unequivocal commitment to providing education to all despite the 
particular situation of the country and the challenges encountered, and reiterates that 
education is the true vehicle for development and should not be seen as neither a 
service nor a commodity, but as a basic human right.

<p>76.<b> The Special Rapporteur has noted with interest the significant determination 
and creativity of a people who have managed to establish and maintain such an 
extensive system and network of schools despite the challenges of the landscape, 
climate and numerous economic difficulties. The high enrolment rates in the primary 
and secondary levels are notable for a country of such a large size with a small 
population and the Government should be commended for this achievement.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Furthermore, recent initiatives taken by the Government, such as the provision 
of free school snacks to all at the primary level, the programme of the mobile <i>ger</i> 
kindergartens and other examples mentioned could be followed by other States and 
reflect the innovation that the Mongol people are capable of showing with regard to 
their commitment to education. This innovation is also reflected in the value and 
importance people attach to education; even in the remotest <i>gers</i>, nomadic families

<p><b>have shared with the Special Rapporteur their wish for their children to pursue 
higher education.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the dropout rates of 
children from the primary and secondary levels, the limited opportunities for 
education for children with disabilities and the absence of reliable statistics to 
document these and other phenomena. The Special Rapporteur also noted the 
outdated and sometimes inadequate conditions of school buildings and dormitories. In 
rural areas, the poor conditions are intensified by problematic access to water and 
sanitation, whereas in urban areas, schools face a situation of overcrowding as a result 
of internal migration move from rural to urban areas. The absence of a human rights 
culture is reflected throughout the public spheres where the active participation of 
women is clearly lacking, especially at decision-making levels. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government of Mongolia and international agencies present in the country: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Secure appropriate investment in education and maintain the necessary funds 
allocated to the budget of the Ministry of Education and Science (equal to a 
minimum of 6 per cent of GDP or 20 per cent of the State expenditures), paying 
particular attention to the importance of maintaining constant and sufficient 
funds despite the economic and financial crises. It is the responsibility of the 
State to adequately finance education and reliance on external donors and 
partners should not be seen to justify less financial involvement of the State. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Urgently address the issue of school infrastructure, especially in rural areas, so 
as to establish a plan of action for renovation of schools, construction of proper 
sanitation facilities with running water and adequate heating. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Encourage initiatives to promote the teaching of useful life skills on health and 
hygiene, as these behaviours learned at school lead to an improved hygiene 
situation for the whole society. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>In urban and peri-urban areas where schools are overcrowded, expand school 
constructions as a matter of priority to meet the needs of the newly settled 
population. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure better statistical data, especially with regard to enrolment and dropout 
rates: better scrutiny needs to be established to properly define &#8220;dropout&#8221; and 
its consequences. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish better policies and guidelines on how records are kept and 
maintained, especially in rural schools. Teachers and social workers should be 
better trained at keeping and maintaining proper and uniform records of 
attendance and other relevant data. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure better identification through more rigorous record-keeping and 
statistics of children with disabilities and their educational needs, such as 
physical adjustments in schools, transport for persons with disabilities and 
teacher training. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Design and implement educational programmes that will allow for the gradual 
inclusion of students with disabilities in the regular system. Mongolia has 
ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and has 
assumed obligations in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Continue with the gradual expansion of the mobile <i>ger</i> kindergarten initiative. 
The Special Rapporteur has found this creative programme well-suited to the </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>reality of the Mongol nomadic and rural population and useful in the 
development of early childhood and school preparation within families. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Implement a gender perspective in education at all levels, including teacher 
training and encouraging women to take up higher decision-making posts in all 
fields, as well as participate in the public and political life of the country. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Develop intercultural linguistic initiatives in all educational centres in Mongolia 
in order to strengthen harmonious coexistence between the Mongol and 
minority communities. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Promote human rights literature and its diffusion throughout educational 
institutions. This initiative should also be encouraged and supported by the 
international community and United Nations agencies, which should contribute 
in the translation of books on human rights into the Mongol language. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur also wishes to recommend that the World Bank 
continue the Fast Track Initiative. Since Mongolia was accepted into the Fast Track 
Initiative in September 2006, it has received a total of US$ 29.4 million in grant 
resources from the initiatives&#8217; Catalytic Fund to be spent on improving the access and 
quality of basic education in Mongolia. Given the impact of the financial crisis, the 
duration of this programme should be extended at minimum until a thorough 
economic recovery is observed.
