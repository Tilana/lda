SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are included throughout
this Quarterly Report, including under “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” When used, statements which are not historical
in nature, including those containing words such as “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “budget,”
“continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,”
“should,” “would,” “will,” “future” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements in this Quarterly Report.
These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are
based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties. You should not place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and
uncertainties described under “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and the following:
·our small number of customers;
 ·credit risks of our key customers and certain other third parties;
 ·reduced expenditures and demand by oil and natural gas exploration and production
companies;
 ·termination or renegotiation of our customer contracts;
 ·general economic conditions and conditions in the oil and gas industry;
 ·competition within our industry;
 ·excess supply of drilling units worldwide;
 ·limited mobility between geographic regions;
 ·operating hazards in the offshore drilling industry;
 ·ability to obtain indemnity from customers;
 ·adequacy of insurance coverage upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event;
 ·operations in international markets;
 ·governmental, tax and environmental regulation;
 ·changes in legislation removing or increasing current applicable limitations of liability;
 ·effects of new products and new technology on the market;
 ·our substantial level of indebtedness;
 ·our ability to incur additional indebtedness;
 ·compliance with restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements;
 ·identifying and completing acquisition opportunities;
 ·levels of operating and maintenance costs;
 ·our dependence on key personnel;
 ·availability of workers and the related labor costs;
 ·increased cost of obtaining supplies;
 ·the sufficiency of our internal controls;
 ·changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations;
 ·applicability of foreign laws, including foreign labor and employment laws;
 ·any non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and
 ·our incorporation under the laws of the Cayman Islands and the limited rights to relief that may
be available compared to U.S. laws.
Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Any, or a combination, of these
factors could materially affect our future financial condition or results of operations and the
ultimate accuracy of the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not
guarantees of our future performance, and our actual results and future developments may differ
materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Management cautions against
putting undue reliance on forward-looking statements or projecting any future results based on
such statements or present or prior earnings levels.
3
In addition, each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement,
and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. We
may not update these forward-looking statements, even if our situation changes in the future. All
forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary
statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in filings we
may voluntarily make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which may be
obtained by contacting us or the SEC. These filings are also available through our website at
www.vantagedrilling.com or through the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis Retrieval
system (EDGAR) at www.sec.gov. The contents of our website are not part of this Quarterly
Report.

VANTAGE DRILLING INTERNATIONAL
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization and Recent Events
Vantage Drilling International (the “Company” or “VDI”), a Cayman Islands exempted company, is
an international offshore drilling company focused on operating a fleet of modern, high
specification drilling units. Our principal business is to contract drilling units, related equipment
and work crews, primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells for our customers.
We also provide construction supervision services for drilling units owned by others. Through our
fleet of drilling units, we are a provider of offshore contract drilling services to major, national and
independent oil and natural gas companies, focused primarily on international markets. The
Company was previously known as Offshore Group Investment Limited and changed its
corporate name to Vantage Drilling International effective February 11, 2016.
Restructuring Agreement and Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11
Proceeding
On December 1, 2015, we and Vantage Drilling Company (“VDC”), our former parent company,
entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Restructuring Agreement”) with a majority of
our secured creditors. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, the Company
agreed to pursue a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the “Reorganization Plan”) under
Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and VDC would commence official
liquidation proceedings under the laws of the Cayman Islands. On December 2, 2015, pursuant
to the Restructuring Agreement, the Company acquired two subsidiaries responsible for the
management of the Company from VDC in exchange for a $61.5 million promissory note (the
“VDC Note”). As this transaction involved a reorganization of entities under common control, it
was reflected in the consolidated financial statements, at carryover basis, on a retrospective
basis. Effective with the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy on February 10, 2016 (the
“Effective Date”), VDC’s former equity interest in the Company was cancelled. Immediately
following that event, the VDC Note was converted into 655,094 new ordinary shares of the
reorganized Company (the “New Shares”) in accordance with the terms thereof, in satisfaction of
the obligation thereunder, which, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $62.0 million
as of such date.
On December 3, 2015 (the “Petition Date”), the Company, certain of its subsidiaries and certain
VDC subsidiaries who were guarantors of the Company’s pre-bankruptcy secured debt, filed the
Reorganization Plan in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (In re
Vantage Drilling International (F/K/A Offshore Group Investment Limited), et al., Case No. 15-
12422). On January 15, 2016, the District Court of Delaware confirmed the Company’s pre-
packaged Reorganization Plan and the Company emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective
Date.
The following table summarizes the components of our pre-bankruptcy debt, all of which was
reflected as Liabilities Subject to Compromise (“LSTC”) in our consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015 (in thousands):
2017 Term Loan and accrued interest
$326,420
2019 Term Loan and accrued interest
344,738
344,738   
2019 Term Loan and accrued interest
7.5% Senior Notes and accrued interest
   1,136,748  
7.125% Senior Notes and accrued interest   736,550   
Pre-petition Credit Agreement
   150,000   
 $2,694,456  
   Liabilities Subject to Compromise
Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Plan, the term loans and senior notes were retired on
the Effective Date by issuing the debtholders Units in the reorganized Company, with each Unit
of securities originally consisting of one New Share and $172.61 of principal of the 1%/12%
Step-Up Senior Secured Third Lien Convertible Notes due 2030 (the “Convertible Notes”),
subject to adjustment upon the payment of interest in kind and certain cases of redemption of
conversion of the Convertible Notes, as well as share splits, share dividends, consolidation or
reclassification of the New Shares.  As of June 30, 2016, taking into account the payment of
interest in kind on the Convertible Notes on such date, each such unit of securities became
comprised of one New Share and $173.28 of principal of Convertible Notes. The New Shares
and the Convertible Notes are issued subject to the terms of an agreement that prohibits the New
Shares and Convertible Notes from being transferred or exchanged separately. For every $1,000
of principal, a note holder received 1.722798 Units for the 2017 Term Loan, 1.725087 Units for
the 2019 Term Loan, 1.786070 Units for the 7.5% Senior Notes, and 1.728569 Units for the
7.125% Senior Notes. In total, these debtholders received 4,344,959 Units under the
Reorganization Plan.
The New Shares issued to these creditors and the Convertible Notes may only be traded
together and not separately. The Convertible Notes are convertible into New Shares in certain
circumstances, at a conversion price (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture for the Convertible Notes) which was $95.60 as of the issue date. The Indenture for the
Convertible Notes includes customary covenants that restrict among other things, the granting of
liens and customary events of default, including among other things, failure to issue securities
upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.
8
Other significant elements of the Reorganization Plan included:
Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company’s pre-petition credit agreement
was amended to (i) replace the $32.0 million revolving letter of credit commitment with a new
$32.0 million revolving letter of credit facility and (ii) repay the $150 million of outstanding
borrowings with (a) $7.0 million of cash and (b) the issuance of $143.0 million initial term loans
(the “2016 Term Loan Facility”).
10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. Holders of the Company’s pre-petition  term loans and
senior notes claims were eligible to participate in a rights offering conducted by the Company for
$75.0 million of the Company’s new 10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2020 (the
“10% Second Lien Notes”). In connection with this rights offering, certain creditors entered into a
“backstop” agreement to purchase 10% Second Lien Notes if the offer was not fully subscribed.
The premium paid to such creditors under the backstop agreement was approximately $2.2
million, paid $1.1 million in cash and $1.1 million in additional 10% Second Lien Notes, resulting
in a total issued amount of $76.1 million of 10% Second Lien Notes, and raising $73.9 million,
after deducting the cash portion of the backstop premium.
The Reorganization Plan allowed the Company to continue business operations during the court
proceedings and maintain all operating assets and agreements. The Company had adequate
liquidity prior to the filing and did not have to seek any debtor-in-possession financing. All trade
payables, credits, wages and other related obligations were unimpaired by the Reorganization
Plan.
Other Events: In July 2015, we became aware that Hamylton Padilha, the Brazilian agent the
Company used in the contracting of the Titanium Explorer drillship to Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.
(“Petrobras”), had entered into a plea arrangement with the Brazilian authorities in connection
with his role in facilitating the payment of bribes to former Petrobras executives. Among other
things, Mr. Padilha provided information to the Brazilian authorities of an alleged bribery scheme
between former Petrobras executives and Mr. Hsin-Chi Su, who was, at the time of the alleged
bribery scheme, a member of the Board of Directors and a significant shareholder of VDC. When
we learned of Mr. Padilha’s plea agreement and the allegations, we voluntarily contacted the
U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC to advise them of these recent developments, as
well as the fact that we had engaged outside counsel to conduct an internal investigation of the
allegations. Our internal investigation is ongoing and we are cooperating with the DOJ and SEC
in their investigation of these allegations. In connection with our cooperation with the DOJ and
SEC, we recently advised both agencies that in early 2010, we engaged outside counsel to
investigate a report of allegations of improper payments to customs and immigration officials in
Asia. That investigation was concluded in 2011, and we determined at that time that no
disclosure was warranted; however, in the abundance of caution, we are reviewing the matter
again in light of the allegations in the Petrobras matter. Although we cannot predict the outcome
of this matter, if the DOJ or the SEC determine that violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (“FCPA”) have occurred, the Company could be subject to civil and criminal
sanctions, including monetary penalties, as well as additional requirements or changes to our
business practices and compliance programs, any or all of which could have a material adverse
effect on our business and financial condition. Additionally, if we become subject to any
judgment, decree, order, governmental penalty or fine, this may constitute an event of default
under the terms of our secured debt agreements and result in our outstanding debt becoming
immediately due and payable.
2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation: The accompanying interim consolidated financial information as of June
30, 2016, for the three months ended June 30, 2016, the periods from February 10, 2016 to June
30, 2016, from January 1, 2016 to February 10, 2016 and the three and six months ended June
30, 2015 has been prepared without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and
includes our accounts and those of our majority owned subsidiaries and VIEs discussed below.
All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. They reflect all
adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and results of operations for the interim periods, on a basis consistent with the
annual audited financial statements (except for the impact of the application of fresh-start
accounting). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the SEC, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to provide
for fair presentation. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 is derived from our December 31,
2015 audited financial statements. These interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 though, as described below, such prior
financial statements may not be comparable to our interim financial statements due to the
adoption of fresh-start accounting upon emergence from bankruptcy. The results of operations for
the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or
any future periods.
In connection with our bankruptcy filing, we were subject to the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 852
Reorganizations (“ASC 852”). All expenses, realized gains and losses and provisions for losses
directly associated with the bankruptcy proceedings were classified as “reorganization items” in
the consolidated statements of operations. Certain pre-petition liabilities subject to Chapter 11
proceedings were considered as LSTC on the Petition Date and just prior to our emergence from
bankruptcy on the Effective Date. The LSTC classification distinguished such liabilities from the
liabilities that were not expected to be compromised and liabilities incurred post-petition.
9
ASC 852 requires that subsequent to the Petition Date, expenses, realized gains and losses and
provisions for losses that can be directly associated with the reorganization of the business be
reported separately as reorganization items in the consolidated statements of operations. We
were required to distinguish pre-petition liabilities subject to compromise from those that are not
and post-petition liabilities in our balance sheet. Liabilities that were subject to compromise were
reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they were
settled for lesser amounts as a result of the Reorganization Plan.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, we adopted fresh-start accounting in
accordance with ASC 852, which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial
reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were
recorded at their fair values as of the Effective Date. The Effective Date fair values of our assets
and liabilities differed materially from the recorded values of our assets and liabilities as reflected
in our historical consolidated balance sheets. The effects of the Reorganization Plan and the
application of fresh-start accounting were reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of
February 10, 2016 and the related adjustments thereto were recorded in our consolidated
statements of operations as reorganization items for the period January 1 to February 10, 2016.
As a result, our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of operations
subsequent to the Effective Date will not be comparable to our consolidated balance sheets and
statements of operations prior to the Effective Date. Our consolidated financial statements and
related notes are presented with a black line division which delineates the lack of comparability
between amounts presented on or after February 10, 2016 and dates prior. Our financial results
for future periods following the application of fresh-start accounting will be different from historical
trends and the differences may be material.
References to “Successor” relate to the Company on and subsequent to the Effective Date.
References to “Predecessor” refer to the Company prior to the Effective Date. The consolidated
financial statements of the Successor have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business.
In addition to the consolidation of our majority owned subsidiaries, we also consolidate variable
interest entities (“VIEs”) when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based on whether an entity has (1) the power
to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (2) the
obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE. Our determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all
relationships between us and the VIE. We consolidated these entities in our Predecessor
consolidated financial statements because we determined that they were VIEs and that we were
the primary beneficiary. These VIEs, who were subsidiaries of VDC, guarantors of our pre-
petition debt and were part of the Reorganization Plan, became our subsidiaries upon
emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date. The following table summarizes the net effect
of consolidating these entities on our Predecessor consolidated statement of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: Includes deposits with financial institutions as well as short-term
money market instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
Inventory: Consists of materials, consumables, spare parts and related supplies for our drilling
rigs and is carried at the lower of average cost or market.
Property and Equipment: Consists of the costs of our drilling rigs, furniture and fixtures, computer
equipment and capitalized costs for computer software. Drilling rigs are depreciated on a
component basis over estimated useful lives ranging from five to thirty-five years on a straight-
line basis as of the date placed in service. Other assets are depreciated upon placement in
service over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years on a straight-line basis.
When assets are sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and a gain or loss is recognized.
We evaluate the realization of property and equipment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when estimated undiscounted
10
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than
its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized would represent the excess of the asset’s
carrying value over the estimated fair value.
Interest costs and the amortization of debt financing costs related to the financings of our drilling
rigs are capitalized as part of the cost while they are under construction and prior to the
commencement of each vessel’s first contract. We did not capitalize any interest for the reported
periods.
Debt Financing Costs: Costs incurred with debt financings are deferred and amortized over the
term of the related financing facility on a straight-line basis which approximates the interest
method. Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented in the
consolidated balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
Revenue: Revenue is recognized as services are performed based on contracted dayrates and
the number of operating days during the period.
In connection with a customer contract, we may receive lump-sum fees for the mobilization of
equipment and personnel or the demobilization of equipment and personnel upon completion.
Mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one geographic market to
another pursuant to a contract are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the term
of such contract, excluding any option periods. Costs incurred to mobilize a rig without a contract
are expensed as incurred. Fees or lump-sum payments received for capital improvements to rigs
are deferred and amortized to income over the term of the related drilling contract. The costs of
such capital improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.
Upon completion of drilling contracts, any demobilization fees received are recorded as revenue.
We record reimbursements from customers for rebillable costs and expenses as revenue and the
related direct costs as operating expenses.
Rig and Equipment Certifications: We are required to obtain regulatory certifications to operate
our drilling rigs and certain specified equipment and must maintain such certifications through
periodic inspections and surveys. The costs associated with these certifications, including
drydock costs, are deferred and amortized over the corresponding certification periods.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are provided for based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the
countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned. Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of
assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts and are based on
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred
income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We recognize interest and penalties
related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense.
We early adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-17 effective January 1, 2016 and have
retrospectively applied its provisions to all periods presented in our Consolidated Financial
Statements. ASU 2015-17 requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as
non-current on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and non-
current amounts. Application of ASU 2015-17 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
Concentrations of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a significant
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and
accounts receivable. We maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of
federally insured limits. We monitor the credit ratings and our concentration of risk with these
financial institutions on a continuing basis to safeguard our cash deposits. Some of our restricted
cash is invested in certificates of deposit. We have a limited number of key customers, who are
primarily large international oil and gas operators, national oil companies and other international
oil and gas companies. Our contracts provide for monthly billings as services are performed and
we monitor compliance with contract payment terms on an ongoing basis. Outstanding
receivables beyond payment terms are promptly investigated and discussed with the specific
customer. We did not have an allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2016 or
December 31, 2015.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to property and
equipment, income taxes, insurance, employee benefits and contingent liabilities. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The fair value of our short-term financial assets and liabilities
approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet principally due to the short-
term nature or floating rate nature of these instruments. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of
the 7.125% Senior Notes and the 7.5% Senior Notes was approximately $15.7 million and $23.5
million, respectively, based on quoted market prices, a Level 1 measurement. These notes are
classified as LSTC as of December 31, 2015 and were discharged under the Reorganization
Plan on the Effective Date. See “Note 5. Debt” for the fair value of our post-petition bankruptcy
debt.
Recent Accounting Standards: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes most of the existing revenue
recognition requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific
11
guidance. The ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when an entity transfers
promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also
requires significant additional disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
years, using either a full or a modified retrospective application approach.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): Amendments to the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification, to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements. Under these amendments, lessees are required to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases under ASC
840. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation
(Topic 718). The pronouncement was issued to simplify the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic
326). ASU No. 2016-13 was issued to provide more decision-useful information about the
expected credit losses on financial instruments and changes the loss impairment methodology.
ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 using a
modified retrospective adoption method. A prospective transition approach is required for debt
securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the
effective date.
We are evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02, ASU No. 2016-09, ASU No. 2016-13 and
ASU No. 2014-09 and have not yet determined the impact of these ASUs on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
3. Fresh-Start Accounting
Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with
ASC 852. We qualified for fresh-start accounting because (i) the reorganization value of our
assets immediately prior to the confirmation was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed
claims and (ii) the holders of existing voting shares of the Predecessor company received less
than 50% of the voting shares of the post-emergence Successor entity.
Reorganization Value: Reorganization value represents the fair value of the Successor’s total
assets and is intended to approximate the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets
immediately after restructuring. Under fresh-start accounting, we allocated the reorganization
value to our individual assets based on their estimated fair values.
Our reorganization value is derived from an estimate of enterprise value. Enterprise value
represents the estimated fair value of an entity’s long term debt and shareholders’ equity. The
estimated enterprise value of the Company of approximately $954.2 million represents
management’s best estimate of fair value on the Effective Date and the value contemplated by
the Bankruptcy Court in confirmation of the Reorganization Plan after extensive negotiations
among the Company and its creditors. The estimated enterprise value, after adding cash plus the
estimated fair values of all of the Company’s non-debt liabilities, is intended to approximate the
reorganization value. A reconciliation of the reorganization value is provided in the table below:
(in thousands)
Enterprise value
 $954,242  
Plus: Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash   250,046  
 
Plus: Working capital surplus
   712
   80,284
Plus: Current liabilities
 
Reorganization value of Successor assets
 $1,285,284
Reorganization value and enterprise value were estimated using numerous projections and
assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and resolution of
contingencies that are beyond our control. Accordingly, the estimates set forth herein are not
necessarily indicative of actual outcomes, and there can be no assurance that the estimates,
projections or assumption will be realized.
In order to estimate the enterprise value of the Company, we used a discounted cash flow
methodology. The discounted cash flow analysis estimates the value of a business by
calculating the present value of expected future unlevered after-tax free cash flows to be
generated by such business. This analysis is supported through a comparison of indicated
values resulting from the use of other valuation techniques including: (i) a comparison of financial
multiples implied by the estimated enterprise value to a range of multiples of publicly held
companies with similar characteristics, and (ii) an analysis of comparable valuations indicated by
precedent mergers or acquisitions of such companies.
12
The financial projections used to estimate the expected future unlevered after-tax free cash flows
were based on our 5-year forecast. The projections were prepared by management and are
based on a number of estimates including various assumptions regarding the anticipated future
performance of the Company, industry performance, general business and economic conditions
and other matters, many of which are beyond our control. The discounted cash flow method also
includes assumptions of the weighted average cost of capital (the “Discount Rate”) as well as an
estimate of a residual growth rate used to determine the enterprise value represented by the time
period beyond the 5-year plan. The Discount Rate was calculated using the capital asset pricing
model and resulted in a Discount Rate of 15.2%. The estimated residual growth rate was
developed considering the long-term economic outlook of the industry and geographical regions
that the Company operates in and resulted in an estimated rate of 2.0%.
13
Consolidated Balance Sheet: The adjustments set forth in the following condensed consolidated
balance sheet reflect the effect of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Reorganization Plan (reflected in the column “Reorganization Adjustments”) as well as fair value
adjustments as a result of the adoption of fresh-start accounting (reflected in the column
“Fresh-Start Adjustments”). The explanatory notes highlight methods used to determine fair
values or other amounts of the assets and liabilities as well as significant assumptions or inputs.

Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company entered into the 2016 Term
Loan Facility providing for (i) a $32.0 million revolving letter of credit facility to replace the
Company’s existing $32.0 million revolving letter of credit commitment
16
under its pre-petition credit facility and (ii) $143.0 million of term loans into which the claims of the
lenders under the Company’s pre-petition credit facility were converted. The lenders under the
Company’s pre-petition credit facility also received $7.0 million of cash under the Reorganization
Plan. The obligations under the 2016 Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by substantially all of
the Company’s subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions, and secured on a first priority basis by
substantially all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ assets, including ship mortgages on all
vessels, assignments of related earnings and insurance and pledges of the capital stock of all
guarantors, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.
The maturity date of the term loans and commitments established under the 2016 Term Loan
Facility is December 31, 2019. Interest is payable on the unpaid principal amount of each term
loan under the 2016 Term Loan Facility at LIBOR plus 6.5%, with a LIBOR floor of 0.5%. The
initial term loans are currently bearing interest at 7.1%. The 2016 Term Loan Facility has
quarterly scheduled debt maturities of $357,500 commencing in March 2016.
Fees are payable on the outstanding face amount of letters of credit at a rate per annum equal to
5.50% as such rate may be increased from time to time pursuant to the terms of the 2016 Term
Loan Facility.
The 2016 Term Loan Facility includes customary representations and warranties, mandatory
prepayments, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including covenants that,
among other things, restrict the granting of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness, the making of
investments and capital expenditures, the sale or other conveyance of assets, including vessels,
transactions with affiliates, prepayments of certain debt and the operation of vessels. The 2016
Term Loan Facility also requires that the Company maintain $75.0 million of available cash
(defined to include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus undrawn commitments).
10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. The Company engaged in a rights offering for $75.0
million of new 10% Second Lien Notes for certain holders of its secured debt claims. In
connection with this rights offering, certain creditors entered into a “backstop” agreement to
purchase 10% Second Lien Notes if the offer was not fully subscribed. The premium paid to such
creditors under the backstop agreement was approximately $2.2 million, paid $1.1 million in cash
and $1.1 million in additional 10% Second Lien Notes, resulting in a total issued amount of $76.1
million of 10% Second Lien Notes, and raising approximately $73.9 million in proceeds to the
Company, after deducting the cash portion of the backstop premium.
The 10% Second Lien Notes were issued at par and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed
(except for customary release provisions), on a senior secured basis, by all of the subsidiaries of
the Company. The 10% Second Lien Notes mature on December 31, 2020, and bear interest
from the date of their issuance at the rate of 10% per year. Interest on outstanding 10% Second
Lien Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on June 30, 2016. Interest is
computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The 10% Second
Lien Notes rank behind the 2016 Term Loan Facility as to collateral.
The Indenture for the 10% Second Lien Notes includes customary covenants and events of
default, including covenants that, among other things, restrict the granting of liens, restrict the
making of investments, restrict the incurrence of indebtedness and the conveyance of vessels,
limit transactions with affiliates, and require that the Company provide periodic financial reports.
1%/12% Step-Up Senior Secured Third Lien Convertible Notes. The Company issued 4,344,959
New Shares and $750.0 million of the Convertible Notes to certain creditors holding
approximately $2.5 billion of pre-petition secured debt claims. The New Shares issued to the
creditors and the Convertible Notes may only be traded together and not separately. The
Convertible Notes mature on December 31, 2030 and are convertible into New Shares, in certain
circumstances, at a conversion price (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture for the Convertible Notes) which was $95.60 as of the issue date.
The Company’s obligations under the Convertible Notes are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed (except for customary release provisions), on a senior secured basis, by all of the
subsidiaries of the Company, and the obligations of the Company and guarantors are secured by
liens on substantially all of their respective assets. The guarantees by the Company’s
subsidiaries of the Convertible Notes are joint and several. The Company has no independent
assets or operations apart from the assets and operations of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Any
subsidiaries of the Company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor. In addition, there are
no significant restrictions on the Company’s or any subsidiary guarantor’s ability to obtain funds
from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan. The Indenture for the Convertible Notes includes
customary covenants that restrict the granting of liens and customary events of default, including,
among other things, failure to issue securities upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.
Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears commencing June 30, 2016
as a payment in kind, either through an increase in the outstanding principal amount of the
Convertible Notes or, if the Company is unable to increase such principal amount, by the
issuance of additional Convertible Notes.  Interest is computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months at a rate of 1% per annum for the first four years and then
increasing to 12% per annum until maturity.
In connection with the adoption of fresh-start accounting, the Convertible Notes were recorded at
an estimated fair value of approximately $603.1 million. The difference between face value and
the fair value at date of issuance of the Convertible Notes was recorded as a debt discount and is
being amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the Convertible Notes using the
effective interest rate method.
17
The principal balance of the Convertible Notes (including payment in kind interest thereon) is
convertible into New Shares at a conversion rate based on an initial price per share of $95.60 per
New Share, subject to adjustment, as described in the Indenture for the Convertible Notes. The
Convertible Notes are convertible only (a) prior to the third anniversary of the issue date
(February 10, 2016), (i) upon the instruction of holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Convertible Notes or (ii) upon the full and final resolution of all potential Investigation Claims (as
defined below), as determined in good faith by the board of directors of the Company (the
“Board”) (which determination shall require the affirmative vote of a supermajority of the non-
management directors), and (b) from and after February 10, 2019 through their maturity date of
December 31, 2030, upon the approval of the Board (which approval shall require the affirmative
vote of a supermajority of the non-management directors). For these purposes, (i) “supermajority
of the non-management directors” means five affirmative votes of non-management directors
assuming six non-management directors eligible to vote and, in all other circumstances, the
affirmative vote of at least 75% of the non-management directors eligible to vote and
(ii) “Investigation Claim” means any claim held by a United States or Brazilian governmental unit
and arising from or related to the procurement of that certain Agreement for the Provision of
Drilling Services, dated as of February 4, 2009, by and between Petrobras Venezuela
Investments & Services B.V. and Vantage Deepwater Company, as amended, modified,
supplemented, or novated from time to time.
In the event of a change in control, the holders of our Convertible Notes have the right to require
us to repurchase all or any part of the Convertible Notes at a price equal to 101% of their
principal amount. We assessed the prepayment requirements and concluded that this feature met
the criteria to be considered an embedded derivative and must be bifurcated and separately
valued at fair value due to the discount on the Convertible Notes at issuance. We considered the
probabilities of a change of control occurring and determined that the derivative had a de minimis
value at June 30, 2016.
Upon the occurrence of specified change of control events or certain losses of our vessels in the
agreements governing our 10% Second Lien Notes, Convertible Notes or 2016 Term Loan
Facility, we will be required to offer to repurchase or repay all (or in the case of events of losses
of vessels, an amount up to the amount of proceeds received from such event of loss) of such
outstanding debt under such debt agreements at the prices and upon the terms set forth in the
applicable agreements. In addition, in connection with certain asset sales, we will be required to
offer to repurchase or repay such outstanding debt as set forth in the applicable debt agreements.
6. Shareholders’ Equity
We have 50,000,000 authorized ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share. Upon emergence
from bankruptcy, we issued 5,000,053 ordinary shares in connection with the settlement of LSTC
and the VDC Note. As of June 30, 2016, 5,000,053 ordinary shares were issued and
outstanding.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company was a 100% owned subsidiary of VDC and did not have
any equity incentive plans of its own. VDC had the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan under which
time-vested and performance units were awarded to officers and employees of the Company and
related share compensation expense was recognized. The vesting of outstanding equity awards
provided by VDC was suspended prior to December 31, 2015 as the trading value of the shares
of VDC was below the administrative costs of vesting the awards. Outstanding share awards at
December 31, 2015 were cancelled due to VDC’s liquidation filing in the Cayman Islands. We
recognized share compensation expense allocated from VDC of $1.6 million and $3.4 million for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
On February 10, 2016, the Company adopted the 2016 Management Incentive Plan (the “2016
MIP”). Pursuant to the 2016 MIP, the Compensation Committee may grant to executive officers
and certain other employees determined by the Compensation Committee, stock options,
restricted stock or restricted stock units of the Company, subject to time based vesting and
performance based vesting, as determined by the Compensation Committee. As of the Effective
Date, the Company established a pool of restricted stock units for issuance by the Compensation
Committee.  No grants from the 2016 MIP have been made to date.
7. Income Taxes
We are a Cayman Islands entity. The Cayman Islands does not impose corporate income taxes.
Consequently, we have calculated income taxes based on the laws and tax rates in effect in the
countries in which operations are conducted, or in which we and our subsidiaries are considered
resident for income tax purposes. We operate in multiple countries under different legal forms. As
a result, we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and foreign tax authorities, as
well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Tax rates vary between
jurisdictions, as does the tax base to which the rates are applied. Taxes may be levied based
on net profit before taxes or gross revenues. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction
requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and
assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of
deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and
character of income and tax credits. Our income tax expense may vary substantially from one
period to another as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, foreign
currency exchange restrictions, rig movements or our level of operations or profitability in each
tax jurisdiction. Furthermore, our income taxes are generally dependent upon the results of our
operations and, when we generate significant revenues in jurisdictions where the income tax
liability is based on gross revenues or asset values, there
18
is no correlation between our operating results and the income tax expense. Furthermore, in
some jurisdictions we do not pay taxes or receive benefits for certain income and expense items,
including interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and write-off of development costs.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We provide for
deferred taxes on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates which are expected to apply to taxable income
when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are also provided
for certain tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax
assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.
In certain jurisdictions we are taxed under preferential tax regimes, which may require our
compliance with specified requirements to sustain the tax benefits. We believe we are in
compliance with the specified requirements and will continue to make all reasonable efforts to
comply; however, our ability to meet the requirements of the preferential tax regimes may be
affected by changes in laws, our business operations and other factors affecting our company
and industry, many of which are beyond our control.
Our periodic tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in
which we operate in accordance with the normal statute of limitations in the applicable
jurisdiction. These examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved
with the authorities or through the courts. Resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and
there are no assurances as to the outcome. Our tax years 2008 and forward remain open to
examination in many of our jurisdictions and we are currently involved in several tax
examinations in jurisdictions where we are operating or have previously operated. As information
becomes available during the course of these examinations, we may increase or decrease our
estimates of tax assessments and accruals.
8. Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to litigation, claims and disputes in the ordinary course of business, some of
which may not be covered by insurance. Management does not believe any of these matters will
have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
There is an inherent risk in any litigation or dispute and no assurance can be given as to the
outcome of any claims.
In July 2015, we became aware that Hamylton Padilha, the Brazilian agent the Company used in
the contracting of the Titanium Explorer drillship to Petrobras, had entered into a plea
arrangement with the Brazilian authorities in connection with his role in facilitating the payment of
bribes to former Petrobras executives. Among other things, Mr. Padilha provided information to
the Brazilian authorities of an alleged bribery scheme between former Petrobras executives and
Mr. Hsin-Chi Su who was, at the time of the alleged bribery scheme, a member of the Board of
Directors and a significant shareholder of VDC. When we learned of Mr. Padilha’s plea
agreement and the allegations, we voluntarily contacted the DOJ and the SEC to advise them of
these recent developments, as well as the fact that we had engaged outside counsel to conduct
an internal investigation of the allegations. Our internal investigation is ongoing and we are
cooperating with the DOJ and SEC in their investigation of these allegations. In connection with
our cooperation with the DOJ and SEC, we recently advised both agencies that in early 2010, we
engaged outside counsel to investigate a report of allegations of improper payments to customs
and immigration officials in Asia.  That investigation was concluded in 2011, and we determined
at that time that no disclosure was warranted; however, in the abundance of caution, we are
reviewing the matter again in light of the allegations in the Petrobras matter. Although we cannot
predict the outcome of this matter, if the DOJ or the SEC determine that violations of the FCPA
have occurred, the Company could be subject to civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary
penalties, as well as additional requirements or changes to our business practices and
compliance programs, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business
and financial condition. Additionally, if we become subject to any judgment, decree, order,
governmental penalty or fine, this may constitute an event of default under the terms of our
secured debt agreements and result in our outstanding debt becoming immediately due and
payable.

10. Business Segment and Significant Customer Information
We aggregate our contract drilling operations into one reportable segment even though we
provide contract drilling services with different types of rigs, including jackup rigs and drillships,
and in different geographic regions. Our operations are dependent on the global oil and gas
industry and our rigs are relocated based on demand for our services and customer
requirements. Our customers consist primarily of large international oil and gas companies,
national or government-controlled oil and gas companies and other international exploration and
production companies.
We also provide construction supervision services for drilling units owned by others. In
September 2013, we signed an agreement to supervise and manage the construction of two
ultra-deepwater drillships for a third party. We receive management fees and reimbursable costs
during the construction phase of the two drillships, subject to a maximum amount for each
drillship. This business represented approximately 3.5%, 3.4% , 3.2%, 0.9% and 0.9% of our total
revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016, for the periods from February 10, 2016 to
June 30, 2016, from January 1, 2016 to February 10, 2016 and for the three and six months
ended June 30 2015, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the majority of our revenue was from
countries outside of the United States. Consequently, we are exposed to the risk of changes in
economic, political and social conditions inherent in foreign operations. Three customers
accounted for approximately 52%, 19% and 19% of consolidated revenue for the three months
ended June 30, 2016. Three customers accounted for approximately 50%, 19% and 18% of
consolidated revenue for the period from February 10, 2016 2016 to June 30, 2016.  Three
customers accounted for approximately 47%, 20% and 17% of consolidated revenue for the
period from January 1, 2016 to February 10, 2016.  Three customers accounted for approximately
28%, 26% and 24% of consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2015. For the
six months ended June 30, 2015 three customers accounted for approximately 28%, 24% and
23% of consolidated revenue.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position at June
30, 2016 and our results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016, for the periods
from February 10 to June 30, 2016 (the “Successor Period”) and from January 1 to February 10,
2016 (the “Predecessor Period”) and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The
Successor Period and the Predecessor Period referred to in the results of operations are two
distinct reporting periods as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy on February 10, 29016.
The discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results
of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the
full fiscal year or any future periods. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation.
Overview
We are an international offshore drilling company focused on operating a fleet of modern, high

Reorganization
On the Petition Date, we filed a reorganization plan in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Delaware (In re Vantage Drilling International (F/K/A Offshore Group Investment
Limited), et al., Case No. 15-12422). On January 15, 2016, the District Court of Delaware
confirmed the Company’s pre-packaged reorganization plan and we emerged from bankruptcy
effective on the Effective Date.
Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Plan, the term loans and senior notes were retired on
the Effective Date by issuing the debt holders Units in the reorganized Company, with each Unit
of securities originally consisting of one New Share and $172.61 of principal of the Convertible
Notes, subject to adjustment upon the payment of interest in kind and certain cases of
redemption of conversion of the Convertible Notes, as well as share splits, share dividends,
consolidation or reclassification of the New Shares. As of June 30, 2016, taking into account the
payment of interest in kind on the Convertible Notes on such date, each such unit of securities
became comprised of one New Share and $173.28 of principal of Convertible Notes. The New
Shares and the Convertible Notes are issued subject to the terms of an agreement that prohibits
the New Shares and Convertible Notes from being transferred or exchanged separately. For
every $1,000 of principal, a note holder received 1.722798 Units for the 2017 Term Loan,
1.725087 Units for the 2019 Term Loan, 1.786070 Units for the 7.5% Senior Notes, and 1.728569
Units for the 7.125% Senior Notes. In total, the debt holders received 4,344,959 Units under the
Reorganization Plan.
Other significant elements of the Reorganization Plan included:
Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company’s pre-petition credit agreement
was amended to (i) replace the $32.0 million revolving letter of credit commitment under its pre-
petition facility with a new $32.0 million revolving letter of credit facility and (ii) repay the $150
million of outstanding borrowings under its pre-petition facility with (a) $7.0 million of cash and (b)
the issuance of $143.0 million initial term loans.
10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. Holders of the Company’s pre-petition  secured debt
claims were eligible to participate in a rights offering conducted by the Company for $75.0 million
of the Company’s 10% Second Lien Notes. In connection with this rights offering, certain
creditors entered into a “backstop” agreement to purchase 10% Second Lien Notes if the offer
was not fully
23
subscribed. The premium paid to such creditors under the backstop agreement was
approximately $2.2 million, paid $1.1 million in cash and $1.1 million in additional 10% Second
Lien Notes, resulting in a total issued amount of $76.1 million of 10% Second Lien Notes, and
raising $73.9 million, after deducting the cash portion of the backstop premium.
VDC Note. Effective with the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy, VDC’s former equity
interest in the Company was cancelled. Immediately following that event, the VDC Note was
converted into 655,094 New Shares in accordance with the terms thereof, in satisfaction of the
obligation thereunder, which, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $62.0 million as of
such date.
The Reorganization Plan allowed the Company to maintain all operating assets and
agreements.  All trade payables, credits, wages and other related obligations were unimpaired by
the Reorganization Plan.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, we adopted fresh-start accounting in
accordance with ASC 852, which resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial
reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start accounting, our assets and liabilities were
recorded at their fair values as of the Effective Date. The Effective Date fair values of our assets
and liabilities differed materially from the recorded values of our assets and liabilities as reflected
in our historical consolidated balance sheets. The effects of the Reorganization Plan and the
application of fresh-start accounting are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of June
30, 2016 and the related adjustments thereto were recorded in our consolidated statements of
operations as reorganization items.
Business Outlook
Expectations about future oil and natural gas prices have historically been a key driver of
demand for our services. The International Energy Agency estimates that demand will increase
by approximately 1.4 million barrels per day or 1.5% in 2016 and increase by approximately 1.3
million barrels per day or 1.3% in 2017. While this represents favorable growth in demand, it has
not been enough to offset surplus production and high inventories which continues to depress oil
prices.
In response to the significant decline in oil prices, exploration and development companies have
been significantly reducing capital expenditure budgets for 2016 and beyond. Analyst mid-year
surveys of exploration and production spending indicate that oil and gas companies continue to
reduce capital expenditures and have been releasing rigs and significantly reducing equipment
orders. Accordingly, we anticipate that our industry will experience depressed market conditions
through the remainder of 2016 and 2017.
In addition to the reduction in demand for drilling rigs, additional supply of newbuild rigs is further
depressing the market.  There are currently 116 jackups and 43 deepwater floaters on order at
shipyards with scheduled deliveries extending out to 2020.  While 48 jackups and 13 floaters are
scheduled for delivery during the remainder of 2016, it is unclear when these drilling rigs will
actually be delivered as many rig deliveries have already been deferred to later dates and some
rig orders have been canceled. In response to the oversupply of drilling rigs, a number of
competitors are removing older, less efficient rigs from their fleets by either cold stacking the
drilling rigs or taking them permanently out of service. This process takes time as many of the
drilling rigs are still working for customers on contracts. Accordingly, while we believe this is an
important element in bringing the supply of drilling rigs back into balance with demand, it will not
be sufficient to materially improve market conditions in 2016.

(1)Available days are the total number of rig calendar days in the period.  
 (2)Utilization is calculated as a percentage of the actual number of revenue earning days divided
by the available days in the period. A revenue earning day is defined as a day for which a rig
earns dayrate after commencement of operations.
(3)Average daily revenues are based on contract drilling revenues divided by revenue earning
days. Average daily revenue will differ from average contract dayrate due to billing
adjustments for any non-productive time, mobilization fees and demobilization fees.

Revenue: During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the Successor Period, the
Aquamarine Driller and the Topaz Driller worked throughout both of these periods. The Topaz
Driller completed its contract in early July 2016 and is currently warm stacked. Additionally, the
Sapphire Driller worked approximately 31 days during these periods on a short-term contract in
West Africa. These three rigs generated average daily revenue of approximately $88,450 per day
and $89,549 per day, in the respective periods. Deepwater utilization for both the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and the Successor Period averaged 33% as only the Tungsten Explorer
worked during these periods. Neither of our other two ultra-deepwater drillships worked during
the Successor Period as the Platinum Explorer completed its initial 5-year contract during the
fourth quarter of 2015 and the Titanium Explorer drilling contract was cancelled by the operator in
August 2015. Average daily revenue declined for both jackups and drillships because drilling
contractors have reduced dayrates in an effort to keep their rigs working in a market where the
supply of drilling rigs continues to exceed demand for the rigs. Although we are marketing all of
our rigs only one drillship and one jackup are currently operating and are forecasted to operate in
the second half of 2016.
In the Predecessor Period, we had two jackups working at an average daily revenue of
approximately $88,347 per day as the Sapphire Driller completed its contract in November 2015
and did not work during the Predecessor Period and the Emerald Driller completed its contract in
early January 2016. Deepwater utilization for the Predecessor Period averaged 33%, with the
Tungsten Explorer operating throughout the period.
In the second quarter of 2015, six of our seven rigs were operating under contracts with
customers at substantially higher dayrates than in the Successor second quarter of 2016. During
the three months ended June 30, 2015, the utilization of our four jackups averaged approximately
75% with average daily revenue of $137,461, while our three drillships had average utilization of
98% with average daily revenue of $617,115.
Management fees for both the Predecessor and Successor Periods averaged approximately
$18,800 per day as the construction oversight contracts have established billing rates.
Reimbursable revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the Sucessor Period was
$5.9 million and $10.7 million, respectively, and there were four rigs working during the period.
Reimbursable revenue for the Predecessor Period was $1.9 million when three rigs worked for
the entire period.
26
Operating costs: Operating costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 were approximately
$35.0 million, including $6.3 million of reimbursable costs, with three rigs operating throughout
the period. Operating costs for the Successor Period were approximately $62.4 million, including
$8.5 million of reimbursable costs. For the Predecessor Period, operating costs were $25.2
million or approximately $90,000 per day based on total available days. Operating costs for the
three months ended June 30, 2015 were approximately $94.7 million, including $6.2 million of
reimbursable costs, with six rigs operating throughout the period. Operating costs for the six
months ended June 30, 2015 were approximately $190.1 million, including $12.4 million of
reimbursable costs. The reduction in operating costs reflects reduced costs associated with idled
rigs as well as cost saving initiatives implemented in 2016 for both operating and stacked rigs.
General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 includes professional fees incurred in connection with our registration
statement on Form S-1 that was filed in June 2016 and increased legal expenses associated
with our Petrobras investigation. Included in general and administrative expenses for the
Successor Period are severance costs of $4.5 million incurred in connection with the resignation
of our former Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Administrative Officer and our former
General Counsel, in addition to normal recurring general and administrative expenses. There
were no similar charges incurred in the Predecessor Period or for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015.
Depreciation expense: For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and the Predecessor
Period, depreciation expense is based on the historical cost basis of our property and equipment.
Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we applied the provisions of fresh-start accounting and
revalued our property and equipment to fair value which resulted in a significant decrease in
those values. Depreciation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the
Successor Period is based on the reduced asset values of property and equipment as a result of
the adoption of fresh-start accounting.
Interest expense and other financing charges: Interest expense for the three months ended June
30, 2016 and for the Successor Period is calculated on the debt that was issued in connection
with our emergence from bankruptcy on February 10, 2016. Interest expense is recorded post-
petition if it will be paid during the bankruptcy proceedings or it is probable that the bankruptcy
court will allow it as claim. Interest expense for the Predecessor Period is calculated on the old
credit agreement as provided for in the Reorganization Plan and on the VDC Note issued in
connection with the Reorganization Plan. Interest expense for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015 is calculated on the outstanding debt during that period, which was significantly
higher than the post-petition debt.
Gain on extinguishment of debt: During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we repurchased in
the open market, at a discount to face value, $31.8 million of our 7.5% Senior Notes and $7.5
million of our 2017 Term Loan and recognized gains of $9.3 million and $1.5 million,
respectively, including the write-off of deferred financing costs of $1.0 million.
Reorganization items: In the Predecessor Period, we incurred $22.7 million of post-petition
professional fees associated with the bankruptcy cases. Additionally, we incurred non-cash
charges of $2.06 billion in fresh-start accounting adjustments, offset by a $1.63 billion non-cash
gain on settlement of LSTC. We have continued to incur professional expenses in connection
with our bankruptcy during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the Successor Period.
Income tax expense: Our estimated annualized effective tax rates for the Successor Period and
Predecessor Period were negative 9.4% and our estimated annualized effective tax rate for the
six months ended June 30, 2015 was positive 42.0%, based on estimated annualized loss or
profit before income taxes in each respective period, excluding income tax discrete items. For the
2016 Successor and Predecessor Periods, we had a loss before income taxes resulting in
negative tax rates. Our income taxes are generally dependent upon the results of our operations
and the local income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Decreases in taxes in the
Successor and Predecessor Periods in 2016 are primarily due to decreases in income before
income taxes due to the nonoperational status of the majority of the rigs in 2016. In some
jurisdictions we do not pay taxes or receive benefits for certain income and expense items,
including interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and reorganization expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2016, we had working capital of approximately $281.4 million, including
approximately $240.5 million of cash available for general corporate purposes. Additionally, we
have posted $4.2 million of cash as collateral for bid tenders and performance bonds. We
anticipate our sustaining capital expenditures through 2017 to be approximately $2.5 to $3.1
million primarily for fleet capital spares. Scheduled principal debt maturities and interest
payments from June 30, 2016 to December 31, 2017 are approximately $29.1 million. We expect
to fund our capital expenditures and debt related payments through 2017 from our available
working capital and cash flow from operations. As our currently warm stacked rigs obtain new
contracts, we could incur reactivation and mobilization costs for these rigs, as well as customer
requested equipment upgrades. These costs could be significant and may not be recoverable
from the customer. We currently have $25.2 million available for the issuance of letters of credit
under our revolving letter of credit facility.

Changes in cash flows from operating activities for the Successor and Predecessor Periods are
driven by changes in net income (see discussion of changes in net income in “Results of
Operations” above) and significant collections from our customers during the period. Changes in
cash flows used in investing activities are dependent upon our level of capital expenditures,
which varies based on the timing of projects. Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $8.0
million in the Successor Period. In the six months ended June 30, 2015 we made debt payments
of $54.6 million, including both scheduled maturities and discretionary open market purchases of
pre-bankruptcy debt. In the Successor Period, we made scheduled maturity payments on post-
bankruptcy debt totaling $0.7 million.
The significant elements of our post-petition debt are described in “Note 5. Debt” to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business for office space, housing,
vehicles and specified operating equipment. Some of these leases contain options that would
cause our future cash payments to change if we exercised those options. We are subject to
litigation, claims and disputes in the ordinary course of business, some of which may not be
covered by insurance. There is an inherent risk in any litigation or dispute and no assurance can
be given as to the outcome of any claims. We do not believe the ultimate resolution of any
existing litigation, claims or disputes will have a material adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
In July 2015, we became aware that Hamylton Padilha, the Brazilian agent the Company used in
the contracting of the Titanium Explorer drillship to Petrobras, had entered into a plea
arrangement with the Brazilian authorities in connection with his role in facilitating the payment of
bribes to former Petrobras executives. Among other things, Mr. Padilha provided information to
the Brazilian authorities of an alleged bribery scheme between former Petrobras executives and
Mr. Hsin-Chi Su who was, at the time of the alleged bribery scheme, a member of the Board of
Directors and a significant shareholder of VDC. When we learned of Mr. Padilha’s plea
agreement and the allegations, we voluntarily contacted the DOJ and the SEC to advise them of
these recent developments, as well as the fact that we had engaged outside counsel to conduct
an internal investigation of the allegations. Our internal investigation is ongoing and we are
cooperating with the DOJ and SEC in their investigation of these allegations. In connection with
our cooperation with the DOJ and SEC, we recently advised both agencies that in early 2010, we
engaged outside counsel to investigate a report of allegations of improper payments to customs
and immigration officials in Asia.  That investigation was concluded in 2011, and we determined
at that time that no disclosure was warranted; however, in the abundance of caution, we are
reviewing the matter again in light of the allegations in the Petrobras matter. Although we cannot
predict the outcome of this matter, if the DOJ or the SEC determine that violations of the FCPA
have occurred, the Company could be subject to civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary
penalties, as well as additional requirements or changes to our business practices and
compliance programs, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business
and financial condition. Additionally, if we become subject to any judgment, decree, order,
governmental penalty or fine, this may constitute an event of default under the terms of our
secured debt agreements and result in our outstanding debt becoming immediately due and
payable.
Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. While management believes current estimates are appropriate and reasonable, actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the policies below as
critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial operations.
Fresh-start Accounting: Effective with our bankruptcy filing on December 3, 2015, we were
subject to the requirements of ASC 852. All expenses, realized gains and losses and provisions
for losses directly associated with the bankruptcy proceedings were classified as “reorganization
items” in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain pre-petition liabilities subject to
Chapter 11 proceedings were considered liabilities subject to compromise on the Petition Date
and just prior to our emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date. The LSTC classification
distinguished such liabilities from the liabilities that were not expected to be compromised and
liabilities incurred post-petition.
28
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh-start accounting, which resulted in the
Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Upon adoption of fresh-start
accounting, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair values as of the Effective Date.
The Effective Date fair values of our assets and liabilities differed materially from the recorded
values of our assets and liabilities as reflected in our historical consolidated balance sheets. The
effects of the Reorganization Plan and the application of fresh-start accounting are reflected in
our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 and the related adjustments thereto were
recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as reorganization items for the period
January 1 to February 10, 2016.
Property and Equipment: Our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of the values of our drilling
rigs, are the most significant amount of our total assets. We make judgments with regard to the
carrying value of these assets, including amounts capitalized, componentization, depreciation
and amortization methods, salvage values and estimated useful lives. Drilling rigs are
depreciated on a component basis over estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as of the
date placed in service. Other assets are depreciated upon placement in service over estimated
useful lives on a straight-line basis.
We evaluate the realization of property and equipment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying
amount. Any impairment loss recognized would be computed as the excess of the asset’s
carrying value over the estimated fair value. Estimates of future cash flows require us to make
long-term forecasts of our future revenues and operating costs with regard to the assets subject to
review. Our business, including the utilization rates and dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs,
depends on the level of our customers’ expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration,
development and production expenditures. Oil and natural gas prices and customers’
expectations of potential changes in these prices, the general outlook for worldwide economic
growth, political and social stability in the major oil and natural gas producing basins of the world,
availability of credit and changes in governmental laws and regulations, among many other
factors, significantly affect our customers’ levels of expenditures. Sustained declines in oil and
natural gas prices, worldwide rig counts and utilization, reduced access to credit markets and any
other significant adverse economic news could require us to evaluate the realization of our
drilling rigs.
Revenue: Revenue is recognized as services are performed based on contracted dayrates and
the number of operating days during the period.
In connection with a customer contract, we may receive lump-sum fees for the mobilization of
equipment and personnel. Mobilization fees and costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one
geographic market to another are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the term
of such contract, excluding any option periods. Costs incurred to mobilize a rig without a contract
are expensed as incurred. Fees or lump-sum payments received for capital improvements to rigs
are deferred and amortized to income over the term of the related drilling contract. The costs of
such capital improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.
Deferred revenues under drilling contracts were $0.0 million and $20.2 million at June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. Deferred revenue is included in either accrued liabilities or
other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, based upon the initial term of the
related drilling contract.
Rig and Equipment Certifications: We are required to obtain regulatory certifications to operate
our drilling rigs and certain specified equipment and must maintain such certifications through
periodic inspections and surveys. The costs associated with these certifications, including
drydock costs, are deferred and amortized over the corresponding certification periods.
Income Taxes: Income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in
the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement basis and tax
basis of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts and are
based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We recognize interest
and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense.
Recent Accounting Standards: See “Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting
Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our rigs operate in various international locations and thus are sometimes subject to foreign
exchange risk. We may from time to time also be exposed to certain commodity price risk, equity
price risk and risks related to other market driven rates or prices. The risks associated with
foreign exchange rates were not significant in the first six months of 2016 as all of our drilling
contracts have been primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not enter into derivatives or
other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The significant decline in
worldwide exploration and production spending as a result of the decline in oil prices has
negatively impacted the offshore contract drilling business as discussed in “Item 2.Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
29
Interest Rate Risk: As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $142.3 million face amount of
variable rate debt outstanding under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. Under the 2016 Term Loan
Facility, interest is payable on the unpaid principal amount of each term loan at LIBOR plus 6.5%,
with a LIBOR floor of 0.5%. As of June 30, 2016, the 3-month LIBOR rate was 0.65% and the
current interest rate on the 2016 Term Loan Facility is 7.15%. Increases in the LIBOR rate would
impact the amount of interest that we are required to pay on these borrowings. For every 1%
increase in LIBOR (above the LIBOR floor) we would be subject to an increase in interest
expense of $1.4 million per annum based on June 30, 2016 outstanding principal amounts. We
have not entered into any interest rate hedges or swaps with regard to either of the term loans.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. As we operate in international areas, we are exposed to
foreign exchange risk. Our primary foreign exchange risk management strategy involves
structuring customer contracts to provide for payment in both U.S. dollars, which is our functional
currency, and local currency. The payment portion denominated in local currency is based on
anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term. Due to various factors, including
customer acceptance, local banking laws, other statutory requirements, local currency
convertibility and the impact of inflation on local costs, actual foreign exchange needs may vary
from those anticipated in the customer contracts, resulting in partial exposure to foreign exchange
risk. Fluctuations in foreign currencies have not had a material impact on our overall results. If we
find ourselves in situations where payments of local currency do not equal local currency
requirements, foreign exchange derivative instruments, specifically foreign exchange forward
contracts, or spot purchases, may be used to mitigate foreign currency risk. A foreign exchange
forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies
at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent U.S. dollar payment
equal to the value of such exchange. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative
purposes. As of June 30, 2016, we did not have any open foreign exchange derivative contracts
or material foreign currency exposure risk.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we voluntarily file or submit
to the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods required
by our debt agreements.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Office of the
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on that evaluation, such officers have concluded that the design and operation of these
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016 to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed on our reports filed or submitted under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) was (1) accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Office of the Chief Executive and Chief
Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and (2) recorded,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-
15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
