<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 13/11, the Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) &#8220;to prepare a study to enhance awareness of the role played 
by international cooperation in support of national efforts for the realization of the purpose 
and objectives of the Convention, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including 
States, regional organizations, including regional integration organizations, the Special 
Rapporteur on Disability of the Commission for Social Development, civil society 
organizations, including persons with disabilities, and national human rights institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. As a first step in implementing the mandate, OHCHR sent a note verbale to States 
and a letter to national human rights institutions, civil society organizations, United Nations 
agencies and to the Special Rapporteur on Disability, seeking contributions to the study.  
As a result, OHCHR received 43 responses from States, eight from inter-governmental 
organizations and regional organizations, 15 from national human rights institutions, 11 
from civil society organizations, a contribution from the Global Partnership for Disability 
and Development, and a submission from the Special Rapporteur on Disability.  Annex 1 
sets out a full list of respondents and all submissions are available on the OHCHR website1  
</p>
<p><b> II. International cooperation and the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>3. International cooperation is an important element in realizing the full enjoyment of 
human rights.  United Nations Member States under the Charter have committed to achieve 
international cooperation to promote and encourage respect for human rights2 and treaties 
such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child oblige States parties to those instruments to take 
steps, using the maximum available resources, individually and through international 
cooperation to realize economic, social and cultural rights3 . 
</p>
<p>4. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also recognizes that 
international cooperation has a role in promoting, protecting and ensuring the rights of 
persons with disabilities.  The preamble refers to the &#8220;importance of international 
cooperation for improving the living conditions of persons with disabilities in every 
country, particularly in developing countries&#8221;.  In its operative paragraphs, the Convention 
stipulates with regard to economic, social and cultural rights that &#8220;each State Party 
undertakes to take measures to the maximum of its available resources and, where needed, 
within the framework of international cooperation, with a view to achieving progressively 
the full realization of these rights, without prejudice to those obligations contained in the 
present Convention that are immediately applicable according to international law&#8221;4.  
Article 32 of the Convention goes further and includes a stand-alone article on international 
cooperation, underlining the importance of international cooperation and development to 
the full realization of the rights of persons with disabilities5.   
</p>
<p>  
 1 See www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/disability/submissions_study.htm.  
 2 United Nations Charter, arts. 1, para.3, 55 and 56. 
 3 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art. 2(1); Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child, arts. 4 and 23(4).  
 4 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, art. 4(2). 
 5 Ibid, art. 32. </p>


<p>5. There are several elements of the approach of the Convention to international 
cooperation which it is relevant to highlight for a clearer understanding of the nature and 
scope of international cooperation under the Convention. First, the importance of 
international cooperation and its promotion is recognized in the context of its support of 
national efforts for implementing the Convention and international cooperation is to be 
directed towards &#8220;the realization of the purpose and objectives of the present Convention&#8221;6.  
The purposes and objectives of the Convention are &#8220;to promote, protect and ensure the full 
and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with 
disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity&#8221;7.  This suggests that 
international cooperation goes beyond the traditional focus on economic, social and cultural 
rights under previous instruments and includes cooperation in the field of all rights 
including civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>6. Second, the Convention identifies with greater clarity than other human rights 
instruments the main actors involved in international cooperation by stipulating that &#8220;States 
parties &#8230;. will undertake appropriate and effective measures [of international cooperation] 
between and among States and, as appropriate, in partnership with relevant international 
and regional organizations and civil society, in particular organizations of persons with 
disabilities&#8221;8.  The article refers initially to State-to-State cooperation which, according to 
the Preamble, should, in particular, benefit persons with disabilities in developing countries.  
International cooperation in article 32 is not limited to cooperation between developed and 
developing countries and could include not only north-south, but also north-north and 
south-south cooperation.  While recognition of the importance of international cooperation 
has legal ramifications for States Parties to the Convention, the article refers to cooperation 
&#8220;among States&#8221; and so does not only refer to international cooperation between States 
parties but includes States more broadly. 
</p>
<p>7. Further, international cooperation goes beyond States and includes other actors such 
as international, regional and civil society organizations.  Consequently, international 
cooperation might be through or in cooperation with international and regional 
organizations such as the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the African 
Union or the Council of Europe inter alia or indeed with civil society organizations.  The 
reference to civil society organizations, and in particular organizations of persons with 
disabilities, recalls the underlying principles of the Convention such as full and effective 
participation and inclusion9 as well as the motto of civil society organizations during the 
drafting of the CPRD: &#8220;nothing about us without us&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. Third, unlike other human rights instruments, the Convention sets out the four 
overlapping modalities most relevant to international cooperation to support the realization 
of disability rights, namely10 : 
</p>
<p>(a) Inclusive and accessible international cooperation, including international 
development programmes, inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities;  
</p>
<p>(b) Capacity-building, including sharing and exchange of information, 
experience, training programmes and best practices;  
</p>
<p>(c) Cooperation in research and access to scientific and technical knowledge; 
and, 
</p>

 7 Ibid, art. 1 
 8 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, art. 32(1). 
 9 Ibid<i>.</i>, art. 3. 
 10 Ibid., art. 32(1)(a) - (d). </p>


<p>(d) Technical and economic assistance, including access to and sharing of 
accessible and assistive technologies and through technology transfer. 
</p>
<p>9. In doing so, the Convention provides guidance and information to States parties on 
the forms of international cooperation they should undertake in order to meet their 
responsibilities under the Convention. 
</p>
<p>10. Fourth, according to the first modality of cooperation, international cooperation 
should be both &#8220;inclusive&#8221; and &#8220;accessible&#8221;11.  Inclusion is a broad concept that requires, on 
the one hand, that persons with disabilities and their representative organizations not be 
excluded from development programming, implementation or monitoring and evaluation 
and, on the other hand, that active steps be taken to consult with and ensure the effective 
and meaningful participation of persons with disabilities in such processes.  In keeping with 
the purpose of the Convention, inclusive development cooperation should pay due attention 
to all persons with disabilities, whether physical, mental, intellectual or sensory12.  
Accessibility is likewise a broad concept and, in line with the Convention, covers access for 
persons with disabilities to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and 
communications and other facilities and services open to the public13.  
</p>
<p>11. Inclusive and accessible international cooperation is relevant for persons with 
disabilities in order to address the marginalization of persons with disabilities in society 
generally and in international cooperation more specifically: overcoming barriers, 
particularly social ones, is only possible if there is a proactive effort to include persons with 
disabilities14.  Moreover, inclusive and accessible international cooperation provides a 
means through which to empower persons with disability and helps to ensure that 
cooperation meets the other principles such as non-discrimination, equality of opportunity 
and respect for inherent dignity. 
</p>
<p>12. In practice, inclusive and accessible international cooperation requires what is 
referred to as a &#8220;twin-track&#8221; approach to development cooperation comprising, on the one 
hand, disability-specific development programmes and, on the other hand, the 
mainstreaming of disability rights into broader development cooperation15.  This is of 
particular relevance considering that an estimated 80 per cent of persons with disabilities 
live in developing countries, many in conditions of poverty, and persons with disabilities 
are often disproportionately represented among the poor16.  Consequently, ensuring 
inclusive and accessible international cooperation is imperative to the success of such 
cooperation.  Indeed, without the inclusion of persons with disabilities, development 
objectives, in particular the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), cannot be achieved17. 
</p>
<p>13. Fifth, international cooperation, while explicitly including international development 
programmes, is also broader and could include other forms of cooperation such as 
international humanitarian assistance. Interpreting international cooperation widely is 
important if it is to support the full implementation of the Convention which requires, inter 
alia, that States parties take all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of

<p>persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, 
humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters18.  As a logical consequence, all phases of 
humanitarian operations &#8211; from disaster preparedness to the transition phase to handover 
from relief operations &#8211; should also be inclusive of and accessible to persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>14. Sixth, the Convention promotes a rights-based approach to international cooperation.  
Article 32 recognizes international cooperation as a support for the realization of the 
purpose and objectives of the Convention; requires international cooperation to respect the 
underlying principles of the Convention, most specifically by being inclusive and 
accessible; and promotes capacity-building.  These factors reflect three underlying 
principles of a rights-based approach to development, namely: all international cooperation 
should further the realization of human rights, including those in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and other human rights instruments; human rights standards and 
principles should guide development cooperation and programming in all sectors and stages 
of the programming process &#8211; such as the design, implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation of development programmes; and international cooperation should contribute to 
capacity-building of duty-bearers to meet their obligations and rights-holders to claim their 
rights19. 
</p>
<p>15. Finally, the Convention clearly specifies that international cooperation, while 
important, is nonetheless complementary to the legal obligations on individual States to 
respect, protect and fulfil the rights of persons with disabilities.  The Convention explicitly 
recognizes international cooperation as a support to national efforts for the realization of 
disability rights and, moreover, stipulates that international cooperation is &#8220;without 
prejudice to the obligations of each State Party to fulfil its obligations&#8221; under the 
Convention20.  Consequently, States remain the primary duty-bearers in relation to the 
Convention and therefore ultimately responsible for implementation of its provisions, 
although international cooperation has an important role to play in ensuring full realization 
of the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Examples of international cooperation related to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Cooperation among States 
</b></p>
<p>16. Cooperation between States, whether north-south, south-south or north-north, is a 
significant focus of article 32 and a potentially important way to realize the rights of 
persons with disabilities.  Such cooperation can play several roles, including, inter alia: 
providing a means to share experiences on implementation of the Convention; allowing 
countries to catch up with those countries with greater experience in promoting and 
protecting disability rights while avoiding pitfalls and challenges that have previously 
occurred; providing economic and technical assistance to poorer countries which can be 
particularly important in implementing the cost-intensive aspects of the CPRD, such as 
progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights or in the context of a 
humanitarian emergency; and helping countries to benefit from innovations such as

<p>assistive technologies which can help persons with disabilities live independently in the 
community. 
</p>
<p>17. North-South cooperation has been a particularly common model of international 
cooperation in the submissions for the present study, covering development cooperation, 
capacity-building and the sharing of information.  Spain, for example, has been assisting 
Mexico in the area of capacity-building and information sharing.  Germany has supported 
Chile in making the country&#8217;s early education system inclusive of children with disabilities 
and, as a result, approximately 2,200 children with disabilities are now attending regular 
kindergarten.  Similarly, the Czech Republic has promoted inclusive education of children 
with disabilities in the Republic of Moldova.  Cyprus, which has signed but not yet ratified 
the Convention, has established a database for the assessment of disability through bilateral 
aid from the European Social Fund.  Indonesia has held a dialogue with Sweden on the 
rights of persons with disabilities.  Furthermore, Indonesia, in cooperation with Australia, 
carried out capacity-building on disability-inclusive gender and development programmes 
directed at persons with disabilities and people working with them.  Jordan signed a joint 
Memorandum of Understanding with the Higher Council for the Affairs of Persons with 
Disabilities and with the British Council in order to &#8220;enhance the effective participation of 
persons with disabilities and integrate them into Jordanian society on the basis of equality 
and equal opportunities&#8221;.  Pursuant to this Memorandum, a non-official network entitled 
Opportunity for All was established, consisting of representatives of 101 civil society 
organizations and governmental bodies concerned with issues of disability21. Austria has 
made the reintegration of persons with disabilities in society one of its priorities in the 
cooperation with Serbia. 
</p>
<p>18. While less prevalent in the submissions to the present study, South&#8211;South 
cooperation is also relevant for assisting countries in the promotion of disability rights, for 
example through the sharing of experiences between countries with similar histories, 
experiences or level of development or through regional leaders supporting neighbours to 
implement the Convention.  International cooperation between Mexico and several Latin 
American States has sought to promote access for persons with disabilities to sports and 
build capacity of staff in rehabilitation centres22.  Brazil has provided bilateral support to 
Haiti in the area of rehabilitation of persons with disabilities after the earthquake of January 
</p><p>2010.  Mauritius has signed a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation on disability 
issues with India and South Africa, and Cuba has supported Nicaragua in carrying out a 
national study on the causes of disability in 2009, with the aim of applying public policies 
for persons with disabilities in a more targeted manner.  
</p>
<p>19. The Asia-Pacific region&#8217;s commitment to South-South cooperation was reaffirmed 
at the Senior Officials&#8217; Meeting on South-to-South Cooperation on Disability in August 
</p><p>201023.  The meeting adopted the Bangkok Statement on South-South-Cooperation on 
Disability, which includes a recommendation to support the establishment of a new regional 
decade on disability in the Asia and Pacific region from 2013 to 2022, a recommendation 
for Governments to ratify and implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with

 23 The Senior Officials&#8217; Meeting was attended by senior Government focal points on disability and 
</p>
<p>business representatives from the region of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and 
implementers of community-based rehabilitation from 19 countries in Asia and the Pacific 
participating in the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-
ESCAP)/Asia-Pacific Development Center on Disability (APCD). See 
www.apcdfoundation.org/?q=content/bangkok-statement-south-south-cooperation-disability.  </p>


<p>Disabilities, and to promote disability-inclusive development24.  The meeting further 
recognized the need to strengthen collaboration between the United Nations Economic and 
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) and the Asia-Pacific 
Development Center on Disability (APCD), promising stronger international cooperation 
between multiple actors to implement the Convention25.  The key role of the private sector 
to promote a &#8220;socially inclusive business development&#8221; during the next disability decade 
(2013-2022) was highlighted at the meeting on South-South cooperation, indicating that 
non-State stakeholders are gaining importance in implementing the Convention through 
international cooperation.  
</p>
<p>20. With a view to promoting international cooperation that conforms to the standards 
and principles of the Convention, several States have issued guidelines on how to design 
and implement disability-inclusive and accessible development programmes and policies. 
An example is New Zealand&#8217;s aid programme, which advocates for the active participation 
of persons with disabilities in public policy dialogue, development and implementation in 
all relevant areas.  The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (BMZ) has produced a policy paper setting out the principles of a human 
rights-based approach to disability in development and promotion of a &#8220;twin-track 
approach&#8221; to development stipulating the need both for specific projects and cross-sectoral 
inclusion of persons with disabilities in development cooperation. The Austrian 
Development Agency (ADA) developed internal guidelines to recognize the rights of 
persons with disabilities in its programming.  The Austrian Development Agency (ADA) 
has developed internal guidelines to recognize the rights of persons with disabilities in its 
programming.  
</p>
<p>21. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) began a process of 
international consultation with organizations of persons with disabilities (DPOs) in 2008 
following intense lobbying by disability aid organizations and national DPOs.  The 
consultations actively sought the views and opinions of DPOs from around the world.  In 
2002 Italy issued guidelines &#8211; updated in 2010 &#8211; on disability in development cooperation 
which are based on the social model of disability.  Norway is preparing a regulation 
requiring that all non-governmental development projects receiving government support 
must be disability inclusive. A similar regulation for bilateral government aid is also under 
consideration. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation in partnership with international organizations 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Convention also recognizes the role of international and regional 
intergovernmental organizations in cooperating to promote the Convention.  
Intergovernmental organizations at the international and regional level have a role in 
gathering and disseminating information on the Convention, in providing States and civil 
society with guidance, expertise and experience on practical implementation of the 
Convention through technical and development cooperation and humanitarian assistance.  
Furthermore, regional and international organizations play a role in the transfer of 
knowledge, harmonization of terminology and concepts, consensus building, dissemination 
of good practice, and promotion and coordination of research.  Such organizations can also 
formulate recommendations and develop standards related to international cooperation.  At 
both the international and regional levels, these organizations have the role of providing 
forums for States and civil society organizations to share experiences of international

<p>cooperation related to the Convention and to identify challenges and best practices.  The 
rest of this subsection provides some examples of international cooperation in partnership 
with United Nations agencies while the following subsection focuses on regional-level 
cooperation.   
</p>
<p>23. The International Labour Organization (ILO) applies a &#8220;tripartite-plus approach&#8221; in 
cooperating with and supporting governments, social partners and DPOs.  It is involved, for 
example, in the Promoting the Employability and Employment of People with Disabilities 
through effective Legislation (PEPDEL) project, which is active in China, Ethiopia, 
Uganda, Tanzania, Thailand, Viet Nam and Zambia.  The project strengthens national 
capacity, building tools to increase capacity of constituents regarding law-making and 
policy design, as well as strengthening implementation.  Supported by the PEPDEL project, 
a Centre for Disability Law and Policy (CDLP) has been established at the University of the 
Western Cape, South Africa, to act as a regional resource of information on disability 
rights.  The University carries out research and organizes training courses, and it will offer 
a Master&#8217;s course in disability law and policy from 2011.  
</p>
<p>24. The ILO, in cooperation with the Irish Aid Partnership Programme, has 
implemented the technical cooperation programme Promoting Decent Work for People 
with Disabilities through a Disability Inclusion Support Service (INCLUDE) since 2008.  
The project is ongoing in Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos, Uganda, Tanzania, Viet Nam 
and Zambia and aims to bring about greater inclusion of women and men with disabilities 
in mainstream small enterprise development, microfinance, vocational training, 
employment promotion, poverty reduction and rural development programmes through 
sensitizing policymakers and service providers to disability rights and through changing 
attitudes to persons with disabilities through disability equality training.   
</p>
<p>25. The World Health Organization (WHO) was actively involved in the first Asia 
Pacific Congress on Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR), held in Bangkok in February 
</p><p>2009.  It brought together representatives of CBR projects in 51 countries to foster 
information sharing, research and development on CBR.  The WHO Regional Office for the 
Western Pacific developed a Regional Framework for Action on CBR, which contains 
recommendations for key areas identified in the Bangkok Declaration issued at the 
Congress.  The WHO Pacific Islands Mental Health Network (PIMHnet) brings together 16 
nations to work on advocacy, human resources and training, mental health policy, planning, 
legislation, and service development.  PIMHnet has forged strategic partnerships with 
NGOs and other regional agencies to reduce the existing fragmentation of activities for 
mental health and address the treatment gap. 
</p>
<p>26. In the first semester of 2009, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 
facilitated two meetings of a Stakeholder&#8217;s Platform between rights-holders and 
representatives from organizations of persons with sensory disabilities in order to explore 
how best to increase the access of persons with sensory disabilities to documents.  The 
Platform includes stakeholders from different regions and encompasses three working 
subgroups, on trusted intermediaries, technology and capacity building.  One of the major 
achievements of the Platform so far has been the preparation of a Pilot Project of Trusted 
Intermediaries to facilitate the cross-border transfer of copyright works in accessible 
formats among various national institutions serving the blind and visually impaired 
community.  Another area of international cooperation is the current negotiation of a new 
treaty led by WIPO on copyrights exemptions to allow access to copyrighted contents by 
persons with disabilities via digital means.   
</p>
<p>27. Submissions also revealed cooperation delivered through international organizations 
at the country level.  In Moldova, the United Nations Country Team has prioritized 
assistance to implement the Convention: before the State ratified the Convention in July 
2010, an inter-agency team worked on clarifying the conceptual and legal elements of the </p>


<p>Convention for Government, the national human rights institutions and civil society.  
Currently, implementation is supported by the same team.  In Egypt, a United Nations Joint 
Programme &#8211; consisting of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), WHO, 
ILO and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) &#8211; is providing technical assistance 
to the Government and works with experts from the region on the development of a 
National Action Plan for the implementation of the Convention.  UNDP has been 
supporting the Government of Albania &#8211; which has signed but not ratified the Convention &#8211; 
in aligning its National Strategy to Convention standards.  National capacity has been 
strengthened regarding access to employment, inclusive education, access to quality 
support services, independent living in the community and accessibility to the environment 
and to ICT.   
</p>
<p>28. In Burkina Faso, UNICEF and Handicap International supported the Government in 
developing a National Policy Framework on Disability and a three-year programme 
strategy in 2009.  In Montenegro, a partnership of national and international actors 
comprised of the Government, UNICEF, UNDP and the European Union, a comprehensive 
project on social inclusion has been developed26.  In Ukraine, the ILO, UNDP and the 
Government cooperated to implement a project in the Ukraine to promote inclusive 
employment services through access to Employment, co-funded by UNDP and ILO.  In 
Haiti, OHCHR led the Protection Cluster in where it &#8211; in cooperation with Handicap 
International and other actors &#8211; advocated for mainstreaming disability issues into all 
phases of the disaster relief and reconstruction process. 
</p>
<p>29. UNDP organized the Second Regional Workshop on Persons with Disabilities &#8211; the 
Role of UNDP in Montenegro in April 2009.  The workshop aimed at exchanging 
information on inclusive programming and at exploring potential for joint programming.  It 
brought together UNDP Country Office Focal Points for persons with disabilities from the 
Western Balkans and the UNDP Bratislava Regional Center, as well as OHCHR, UNICEF, 
UNHCR, and national stakeholders from Montenegro.  UNDP is also supporting the Arab 
Organization for Disabled People (ADOP)27 in promoting a dialogue amongst activists, 
media and government officers over the Convention.  OHCHR has carried out capacity-
building and awareness-raising activities on the Convention, for example in Yaound&#233;, in 
November 2010:  the seminar aimed at promoting ratification of the Convention in the 
Central African region and was attended by governmental authorities, representatives of 
national human rights institutions, national parliaments and civil society organizations.  <b>

<p>30. With a view to ensuring that United Nations efforts related to the Convention are 
consistent and complementary, the Inter-Agency Support Group (IASG) on the 
Convention28 has sought to coordinate United Nations efforts in support of the Convention 
and has recently developed a Guidance Note for United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) 
and implementing partners on Including the rights of persons with disabilities in United 
Nations programming at country level within the framework of the United Nations 
Development Group29. The Guidance Note is intended to help UNCTs and implementing 
partners to mainstream the rights of persons with disabilities in United Nations country

</p>
<p>to represent and promote the rights of disabled people in the region, to network in the Arab world and 
internationally, and to help disabled people to better represent themselves in their national countries. 
</p>
<p> 28 The Inter-Agency Support Group to the CRPD was established soon after the entry into force of the 
CRPD (in 2006) and brings together around 25 United Nations specialized agencies, funds and 
programmes.

coordination at country level to assist Member States, contribute to the coherence of United 
Nations work, and help members of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) to 
provide more targeted support to UNCTs.

<p><b> C. Cooperation in partnership with regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p>31. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-
ESCAP) supports members and associate member Governments on developing approaches 
that promote the participation of persons with disabilities in the development process30.  
This support is provided through operational activities, encouragement of networking and 
collaborative action, identification of good practice, and advisory services on the 
implementation of the Agenda for Action for the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled 
Persons, specifically the second Decade (2003-2012)31.  In this context, the Biwako 
Millennium Framework for Action towards an Inclusive, Barrier-free and Rights-based 
Society for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific (BMF) was adopted in 2002 as 
a regional policy guideline for the second Decade.  The Framework for Action recognized 
the Asia-Pacific Development Center on Disability (APCD) &#8211; a joint collaboration of the 
Thai Government with multi-stake holders such as the Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA), UN-ESCAP and non-governmental organizations &#8211; as a coordinating 
agency which provides capacity building of persons with disabilities, community-based 
rehabilitation and accessibility to information and communication technologies (ICT).  The 
APCD also facilitates interregional cooperation between the Asia-Pacific region, the 
African region, the Arab region, and the Latin American and Caribbean countries. 
</p>
<p>32. The African Union declared the first decade of the new millennium (1999-2009) the 
African Decade of Disabled Persons (ADDP).  In 2001 the Labour and Social Affairs 
Commission of the African Union along with its African Rehabilitation Institute and the 
ILO developed a Continental Plan of Action (CPOA) to guide the Member States of the 
African Union on how to implement the African Decade. The adoption of the ADDP placed 
responsibility on African States to implement Decade Program activities.  In October 2008, 
the ADDP was extended until 201932.  The ADDP&#8217;s Secretariat works in partnership with 
African governments, civil society organizations and DPOs.  The Secretariat has worked on 
the formulation of disability indicators, the development of a training manual for disability 
research and research reports in the field of health, education, HIV/AIDS, training for 
journalists, the development of resources to benefit the work of DPOs in the area of 
disability law and policy and a digital story workshop for participants including parents and 
youth from nine countries.  The African Decade has also promoted the establishment of 
disability networks between continental DPOs of previously marginalized disability 
groups33.  The African Union, the Pan African Parliament and Parliamentarians in different 
countries placed the disability agenda at the centre of policy making34.

<p>33. The Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) declared the 
period 2003-2014 the Arab Decade of Persons with Disabilities in 200435.  In the context of 
poverty reduction, the Arab Decade identifies the following objectives: (a) reducing 
unemployment among people with disabilities; (b) intervening to limit poverty through 
poverty reduction strategies and ensuring that the incidence of disability does not increase 
due to poverty; (c) implementing rehabilitation programmes in poor areas to help low-
income families deal positively with persons with disabilities and working towards 
developing and improving the intellectual abilities and skills of persons with disabilities; 
(d) offering loans to persons unable to work and to those with severe disabilities to ensure a 
dignified existence, and financial assistance to those who can work until they find 
employment36. 
</p>
<p>34. The European Commission (EC) seeks to apply a twin-track approach in its 
development cooperation efforts related to disability.  The European Action Plan 2008-
2009 established the responsibility for improving the mainstreaming of disability issues in 
development aid.  The European Commission addresses disability and development on the 
basis of its <i>Guidance Note on Disability and Development</i>, which provides advice on how 
to address disability within the context of development cooperation.  It explicitly recognizes 
that poverty reduction goals &#8220;cannot be met without considering the needs of disabled 
people&#8221;37.  However, its implementation remains a challenge38.  The EC co-financed a 
project on &#8220;Mainstreaming Disability in Development Cooperation&#8221; comprising 
cooperation with 12 non-governmental organizations, DPOs, local entities and the Italian 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Since 2000, it has targeted 82 partner countries.  Currently, 
the EC is preparing a new European Disability Strategy, the main objective of which is to 
implement the Convention in Europe.  
</p>
<p>35. The Council of Europe is implementing its Disability Action Plan 2006-2015 
(CAHPAH).  The fundamental goal is to help Member States reinforce anti-discriminatory 
measures in order to enhance equal opportunities and independent living for persons with 
disabilities and guarantee their freedom of choice, full citizenship, and active participation 
in the life of the community, among other goals39.  The Council of Europe has also 
published about 60 reports and comparative analyses, providing useful instruments for the 
transfer of knowledge and for social benchmarking40. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Cooperation in partnership with civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>36. Organizations of persons with disabilities should be actively consulted in the area of 
international cooperation and have the possibility of participating meaningfully and 
effectively in international cooperation efforts41.  Further, States and intergovernmental 
organizations have a role in assisting DPOs to build the capacity of persons with disabilities 
to claim their rights under the Convention. Civil society organizations themselves have a

<p>role in providing international cooperation, either to States or to intergovernmental 
organizations and to other civil society organizations, given their specific knowledge and 
understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the implementation of the 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>37. Information provided in the submissions indicates that States have cooperated with 
and channelled funds through civil society organizations in support of disability projects.  
Germany, for example, has supported DPOs and their active participation in national 
poverty reduction strategy plans in Cambodia, Viet Nam and Tanzania.  Similarly, the 
United Kingdom has supported the participation of persons with disabilities to engage with 
the constitutional reform processes in Nigeria.  Norway has also contributed to 
strengthening DPOs in developing countries.  Finland and the World Federation of the Deaf 
conducted a needs assessment in four countries in order to develop sign language education 
for children and youth42.  
</p>
<p>38. Denmark supports disability rights in development cooperation through Danish civil 
society organizations, such as through the umbrella organization Danish Disabled People&#8217;s 
Organisations - Denmark (DPOD).  Among other initiatives, DPOD supported the Africa 
Disability Decade Programme.  Due to these efforts, the work of the Decade Steering 
Committee in Rwanda led to the development of a national programme in 2009, which 
aimed at improving the quality of life of persons with disabilities (2010-2019)43. Measures 
have been adopted in the field of rehabilitation and programmes for persons with sensory 
disabilities have been put in place, among other steps taken44. Another example of such 
bilateral aid to strengthen local capacities is the partnership between the Danish Association 
of Laryngectomees (DLFL) and the disability umbrella organization, the National 
Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN).  The initiative included capacity-building of 
NFDN volunteers and staff in relation to lobbying and advocacy for Conventionratification 
in Nepal.  Through this cooperation, several members of the Constitutional Assembly were 
trained as advocates supporting ratification of the Convention, and as a result of these and 
other factors, Nepal ratified the Convention in May 201045.  These international cooperation 
efforts can make a valuable contribution to strengthening the capacity of DPOs to claim 
their rights as stipulated by the Convention at the local level.  
</p>
<p>39. International cooperation between States and civil society organizations occurs at 
the regional level.  An EU co-financed project called Mainstreaming Disability in 
Development Cooperation, implemented from 2006-2008, brought together 12 European 
civil society organizations including DPOs46.  The projects, implemented by NGOs, DPOs, 
local entities and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) collected relevant data and 
created an accessible database.  This made it possible to identify the actors in the 
development cooperation field and evidenced the need for better coordination.  The follow-
up to this project is being financed by the EU for the period 2010-2012.  The new project is 
run by 11 partners, among European NGOs and DPOs47 and aims at promoting consistent 
implementation of the Convention through development cooperation.

<p>40. International cooperation also occurs between civil society organizations and 
between civil society organizations and research institutes and universities.  In Italy, civil 
society organizations such as the Associazione Italiana Amici de Raoul Follereau (AIFO) 
and Disabled Peoples&#8217; International (DPI) have promoted the inclusion of a focus on 
persons with disabilities in master&#8217;s courses on development.  As a result, several Italian 
universities have adopted specific training modules on the rights of persons with 
disabilities48.  AIFO and DPI have carried out a research project assessing the impact of 10 
years of two Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) programmes in Mandya District, 
India, reaching out to more than 22,000 persons with disabilities.  This research project 
involves DPOs, federations and university academics as well as local communities and it 
takes a quantitative and a qualitative approach.  Persons with disabilities and local groups 
control and decide the research priorities and assess the impact of CBR from their own 
point of view, with technical support from DPI and disabled university academics. 
</p>
<p>41. Another example of civil society actors cooperating internationally is the joint 
initiative between the Mental Disability Advocacy Center (MDAC) and the Central 
European University, which organized a summer school on &#8220;mental disability law in 
practice&#8221;, focusing on the Convention. Through presentations, moot courts and other 
methodologies, capacity of practising lawyers, activists and academics from Europe and 
Africa was strengthened in the field of mental health and disability rights.  Some of the 
participants are continuing to work with MDAC to advance the rights of persons with 
intellectual disabilities and persons with psychosocial disabilities in their countries.  
Similarly, MDAC held a workshop for litigators from European countries to build their 
capacity on the individual complaints procedure under the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention. MDAC is currently in the process of developing a network of lawyers 
interested in working on mental disability law. 
</p>
<p>42. Finally, international cooperation takes place between civil society organizations 
and international and regional organizations.  The ILO, UNESCO and the International 
Disability and Development Consortium (IDDC), in close consultation with other key 
stakeholders on disability and development, produced the Community-based rehabilitation 
guidelines (CBR)49. The guidelines &#8211; which had been in preparation since 2004 &#8211; are 
designed to empower persons with disabilities by supporting their inclusion in health, 
education, employment, social skills training and other community services. They were 
launched at the fourth CBR Africa Network Conference (CAN) in October 2010 in 
Nigeria50.   
</p>
<p>43. Similarly, the World Bank established the Global Partnership for Disability and 
Development (GPDD), as a global alliance composed of national governments, 
development banks, United Nations agencies, DPOs, NGOs, universities, foundations, and 
enterprises, all committed to the GDPP objective to combat the social and economic 
exclusion and impoverishment of persons with disabilities and their families in developing 
countries51.  This initiative is also an international forum for exchange and sharing of 
practices; it facilitates learning and cooperation, including South-North exchanges, and 
stimulates donor coherence in the implementation of the Convention.  The World Bank is 
supporting GPDD through a Development Grant Facility and a Multi-Donor Trust Fund 
(MDTF) established by Italy, Finland, and Norway.  GPDD and the World Bank have 
implemented a number of activities supported by MDTF, including: (a) a study on

strategies; (c) a regional seminar on Accessibility of the Environment, Universal Design, 
Tourism and Development; (d) a working group on Haiti Reconstruction, which was 
created to ensure that reconstruction efforts after the Haiti earthquake involved people with 
disabilities during all stages and that all rebuilt and newly built infrastructure was fully 
accessible to and usable by people with disabilities52.  The GPDD and the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) co-organized a meeting on Reconstruction in Haiti and 
Innovative Universal Design in March 201053. 
</p>
<p>44. The Global Initiative for Inclusive Information and Communication Technologies 
(G3ict), a flagship advocacy initiative of the United Nations Global Alliance for 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Development.  G3ict is a public-
private partnership dedicated to facilitating the implementation around the world of the 
Digital Accessibility Agenda defined by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities.  It fosters harmonization and standardization by facilitating ongoing 
discussions with the participation of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute (ETSI), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the 
Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory Committee 
(TEITAC) and other leading standards development organizations via forums and Web-
based activities54.  G3ict and the ITU, for example, jointly produced an e-Accessibility 
Policy Toolkit for Policy Makers, which was developed in cooperation with over 60 experts 
from industry, NGOs, Governments and academic institutions from around the world55.  
The ITU, in cooperation with G3ict, is promoting systematic capacity-building programmes 
on all continents on how to align requirements for accessible broadcasting and 
telecommunications services.  This sector represents an opportunity for short-term results 
for persons with disabilities since in most countries one single entity controls a few 
operators serving the entire population.  It is also worth noting that regulatory authorities 
exist in most countries today. 
</p>
<p>45. The Digital Accessibility &amp; Inclusion Index for Persons with Disabilities was 
developed with the support of Disabled People's International (DPI) and the American law 
firm Powers Pyles Sutter &amp; Verville PC.56.  Coordination of public procurement &#8211; ICT 
devices for governments &#8211; has been informally established by the United States Access 
Board which invited international participants to its TEITAC sessions, a multi-stakeholder 
committee charged with the definition of public procurement ICT standards including the 
European Commission, Japan, Canada and Australia.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Challenges facing international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>46. The submissions to the present report indicate that many States and other actors are 
actively involved in promoting international cooperation to support the implementation of 
the Convention and to realize the rights of persons with disabilities.  In spite of this growing 
</p>
<p>

<p>body of good practice, it is relevant to note that efforts to date have faced challenges and 
shortcomings. 
</p>
<p>47. First, submissions focused predominantly on disability-specific cooperation and 
there was less information related to the mainstreaming of disability into other areas of 
international cooperation. The shortcomings related to mainstreaming are sometimes due to 
a lack of relevant policies and guidelines, in spite of some good examples in this regard.  
Moreover, according to the International Disability Alliance submission, where guidelines 
and policies on mainstreaming disability into development cooperation exist, they are often 
not fully implemented for various reasons: submissions revealed that States as well as 
international organizations often have limited or no dedicated staff and programmes to 
promote the Convention, which has directly affected capacity to implement not only 
specific programmes on persons with disabilities but also to mainstream disability into 
cooperation efforts.  Further, according to the Special Rapporteur on Disability, there is still 
insufficient awareness of disability mainstreaming and of inclusive development.  The 
Special Rapporteur indicated the need to monitor systematically the implementation of 
guidelines and policies on mainstreaming disability into development cooperation 
constitutes an additional challenge.   
</p>
<p>48. Second, submissions highlight that international cooperation in the disability field is 
not always consistent with the norms and standards of the CPRD.  Some civil society 
submissions indicated that a &#8220;charity&#8221; approach to disability continues to be applied in 
development cooperation instead of the rights-based approach promoted by the CPRD.  
Further, development programmes are often negotiated bilaterally between governments, 
without direct participation of civil society actors such as DPOs, indicating a lack of 
inclusiveness and accessibility with the result that State structures are strengthened but the 
effects are not necessarily so positive for persons with disabilities or their representative 
organizations.  The International Disability Alliance notes that international cooperation 
projects continue to finance public transport and buildings, communication infrastructure, 
employment and vocational training services that are not designed in an accessible or 
inclusive way, thus excluding most people with disabilities.  In the area of education, 
submissions indicate that certain development agencies continue to fund segregated 
education programmes in contravention of the principle of inclusive education in the 
Convention.  
</p>
<p>49. Third, in spite of the many positive examples of international cooperation, 
submissions indicated a lack of coordination between and among actors involved in 
development projects57.  At times this has led to fragmented and unsustainable cooperation 
efforts.  Furthermore, insufficient national ownership in several projects implemented 
within the framework of international cooperation has been noted, with a consequence that 
in several projects implemented in Eastern Europe, for example, &#8220;the international 
community has failed to effectively influence national authorities in the process of 
transition from institutional to community-based care, allowing preservation of institutional 
systems and replication of its culture into the new services58.   
</p>
<p>  
 57 See, for example, submission of DRI at 
</p>
<p>www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/disability/docs/study/SERBIA_Investments_Gone_Wrong_Internatio
nal.pdf.  
</p>
<p> 58 Idem. IDA is equally critical of the fact that financial support is still too often provided for the 
establishment or refurbishment of institutions, instead of using this funding to establish services to 
support independent living in the community as provided in art. 19 of the CRPD (see 
www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/disability/docs/study/International_Disability_Alliance.doc). </p>


<p>50. Fourth, submissions suggested that international cooperation at times focuses on 
persons with disabilities as a monolithic group.  For example, there is only a weak focus by 
international cooperation actors on gender issues and an insufficient awareness of the 
connection between gender and disability.  As women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s experience of disability 
is context specific and varies greatly according to sex, ethnicity, age, class, the environment 
and socio-economic status, actors engaging in international cooperation need to be aware 
that persons with disabilities are not a homogenous group and that therefore, gender issues 
need to be considered.  Further, the submissions suggest that international cooperation has 
focused less on persons with sensory and intellectual disabilities.  A stronger engagement 
of the international community in this area would be key in order to promote the 
implementation of the Convention with regard to all disability constituencies in all regions 
of the world. 
</p>
<p>51. Fifth, State parties &#8211; particularly developing countries &#8211; often face challenges in 
fully implementing the Convention due to economic and technical resource constraints. 
These challenges can be eased by international cooperation through States having the 
necessary means.  
</p>
<p>52. Finally, an overwhelming focus of submissions was on development cooperation, 
including economic and technical assistance, and capacity-building, including through the 
sharing of experiences and information and through training. However, submissions 
revealed relatively little information on international cooperation in the fields of research or 
on transfer of technology, such as assistive technologies, in spite of these also being 
included in the terms of article 32.  Moreover, almost no information was available on 
international cooperation in the field of humanitarian assistance, in spite of the potentially 
important role that international cooperation can and needs to play in this field. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The submissions providing the basis of the present Study illustrate a significant 
amount of international cooperation to support national efforts to promote, protect 
and ensure the rights of persons with disabilities.  International cooperation occurs 
between States as well as in partnership with international and regional organizations 
and with civil society organizations, including DPOs.  International cooperation is not 
limited to North-South cooperation but includes significant amounts of South-South 
and interregional cooperation.  The present Study has focused primarily on the 
submissions provided to OHCHR: undoubtedly, many other examples of international 
cooperation exist. 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>In spite of the significant amount of international cooperation in this field, 
challenges remain.  International cooperation does not appear to have consistently 
applied a &#8220;twin-track&#8221; approach as cooperation focuses overwhelmingly on disability-
specific projects and less on mainstreaming disability rights into broader international 
cooperation.  Given the disproportionate representation of persons with disabilities 
among the poor, a failure to mainstream could diminish the likelihood of meeting 
international development goals such as the MDGs.  Similarly, many of the 
submissions made to the report focused on disability projects generally and not 
necessarily on implementation of the Convention which, in some cases, has resulted in 
projects not necessarily conforming to Convention standards, for example, 
maintaining a charity approach, promoting segregation over inclusion or treating 
persons with disabilities as a monolithic group without taking into account gender 
differences or the diversity of disability.  Moreover, international cooperation is not 
always coordinated among States, international and regional organizations and civil 
society organizations including DPOs.  Finally, international cooperation has focused </b></p>


<p><b>more on capacity-building, information sharing, training and development 
cooperation and less on other possible areas of cooperation such as research, 
technology transfer and humanitarian assistance. </b></p>
