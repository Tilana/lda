<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Whereas a series of incidents related to freedom of expression continue to polarize 
societies, some ambiguities seem to exist with regard to the demarcation line between freedom of 
expression and hate speech, especially in relation to religious issues. Against this background, 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights decided to convene an expert meeting 
to address freedom of expression in the context of advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence within the framework of articles 19 and 20 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The objective of the expert seminar was 
twofold: to address the underlying human rights concerns behind the concept of &#8220;defamation of 
religions&#8221;, presenting an approach based on human rights law; and to ensure a sound legal 
interpretation of articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant. The expert seminar was tasked to explore 
the legal limitations to freedom of expression and the mandatory prohibition of advocacy of 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, as a means to 
protect individuals and groups. As a result, the seminar should offer guidance on how to address 
these issues in increasingly multicultural societies and to provide information on best practices 
and comparative legislative and judicial approaches. The approach was to focus the debate on a 
human rights law perspective. 
</p>
<p>2. The expert seminar, held in Geneva on 2 and 3 October 2008, was attended by 12 experts 
and over 200 observers, including from Governments, United Nations agencies, regional 
organizations, the media and non-governmental organizations.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>3. The High Commissioner for Human Rights opened the expert seminar on 2 October 2008 
by referring to the forthcoming sixtieth anniversaries of both the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. 
She emphasized that the historical circumstances under which provisions on freedom of 
expression and its limitations were developed in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights highlighted the need to devise forms of protection against incitement to 
discrimination and violence. While the existence of carefully defined limitations in international 
human rights law was indisputable, ambiguities over their precise meaning and concrete 
application remained. The High Commissioner recalled that, in many parts of the world, freedom 
of expression unfortunately remained a distant dream and that this right had all too often been 
denied to those most vulnerable to arbitrary excesses of power, such as members of religious 
minorities. Without the freedom to openly profess one&#8217;s religious affiliation, the ability to 
honour religious traditions and transmit them from one generation to another was curtailed. She 
emphasized that freedom of expression and freedom of religion were not contradictory but 
interdependent. Likewise, freedom of expression was essential to creating an environment in 
which a constructive though sometimes critical discussion about religious matters could be held. 
In the era of globalization, ever-increasing migration and intersection of cultures, freedom of 
expression was the best defence against the enemies of diversity. In international law, as in the 
jurisprudence of most national courts, it was clearly stated that well-defined and narrowly

</p>
<p>limited classes of speech, such as the hate messages transmitted in Rwanda by Radio Mille 
Collines, could be legitimately restricted to safeguard against these transgressions. The High 
Commissioner stressed the importance of focusing on these types of extreme cases, but 
acknowledged that problems of interpretation lie in less clear-cut situations. Defining the line 
that separates protected from unprotected speech was ultimately a decision that was best made 
after a thorough assessment of the circumstances of each case. This decision should always be 
guided by well-defined criteria and in accordance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>4. After concluding her initial remarks, the High Commissioner gave the floor to the 
Chairperson of the expert seminar, Bertrand Ramcharan. The Chairperson welcomed the experts 
and observers and gave the floor to H.E. Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibhi, President of the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>5. The President of the Council recalled that the issue of &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; had been 
raised many times in the Council in recent years. It had been the subject of many resolutions, 
reports and studies and diverging views, and concerns had been expressed each time. He 
acknowledged the need to address the issue outside the Council so that it could be dealt with in a 
more appropriate manner in the Council. Mentioning the proposal to shift the present discussion 
from &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; to the legal concept of &#8220;incitement to religious hatred&#8221;, the 
President noted the possible emergence of a positive convergence of views regarding the overall 
contours of this discussion, with general acceptance of a focus on the latter concept. He raised 
the questions of how to combat incitement to religious hatred without jeopardizing freedom of 
expression and the role of media and civil society organizations in ensuring interfaith dialogue 
and cooperation. He referred to initiatives by the Alliance of Civilization; lastly, he emphasized 
that many steps had to be taken to promote dialogue in a number of areas, such as education. 
</p>
<p>6. The Chairperson read the address of the United Nations High Representative for the 
Alliance of Civilizations, H.E. Jorge Sampaio. The Alliance was launched to stave off the threat 
of polarization and extremism by promoting cooperation across religious and cultural divides. 
While political conflicts could only be solved through political negotiations, the High 
Representative stated that it was equally true that peace agreements rarely held if they were not 
strongly backed by the communities involved. Creating the necessary conditions for sustainable 
peace required efforts of a different kind, to generate a mindshift in divided communities. 
Furthermore, when the peaceful coexistence of different communities was threatened by 
simmering tensions, these efforts could help prevent conflicts developing in the first place. The 
Alliance also acknowledged the constructive role of religious communities in mediation and 
conflict resolution. Addressing prejudice and stereotypes, which increase polarization among 
cultures, was equally important. As an initiative with a global scope, the Alliance aimed at 
consolidating its role within the United Nations Global Agenda as its pillar for good governance 
of cultural diversity and as a tool for conflict prevention and peacebuilding. 
</p>
<p>7. Before the opening of the first thematic discussion, the Chairperson asked each of the 
experts to provide a brief biographical background (see annex). The Chairperson then introduced 
the topic, emphasizing the need to approach the discussion from a human rights law perspective. 
Since an important part of the discussion referred to the interpretation of certain provisions of the 
Covenant, he recalled articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties on the 
general rule and supplementary means of interpretation of treaties. </p>

<p><b>I. THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND THE 
INTERRELATEDNESS BETWEEN ARTICLES 19 AND 20 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND 
POLITICAL RIGHTS AND STATES&#8217; OBLIGATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>8. Frank La Rue, made a presentation concerning the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and how limitations to this right should be applied.<b>2</b> He referred to the context in 
which the right to freedom of expression had been formally recognized, with particular emphasis 
on the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the underlying principle that 
the coexistence of divergent opinions could only be accommodated if everyone&#8217;s right to hold 
and express these opinions was protected. He added that the main challenge ahead was to 
recognize freedom of expression as the main mechanism to fight authoritarianism and 
dictatorship. 
</p>
<p>9. Mr. La Rue stated that, when the Covenant was drafted, it was clear that all human rights 
had to be managed with responsibility. However, specific criteria needed to be followed when 
considering limitations to freedom of expression: (a) these limitations must be established by 
law; (b) they should refer to the protection of the rights of others or public order; and (c) they 
must prohibit any advocacy of violence, based on racism, racial or religious discrimination. He 
argued that there was a need today to harmonize freedom of expression, without censorship and 
impositions from the State, with the fight against all forms of violence, including child 
pornography and incitement to hatred or war. 
</p>
<p>10. Mr. La Rue explained that the right to freedom of expression could be exercised passively, 
but required a permanent commitment by States. He highlighted two basic premises for the 
exercise of this right. First, the precondition to invoke any limitations to freedom of expression 
was to permanently guarantee the full scope of this right. Second, expressions of hatred and 
violence needed to be clearly understood and defined. Mechanisms for criticism, particularly of 
political leaders, were deemed important so that leaders were held to account. Freedom of 
expression was not limited to statements considered appropriate or beneficial; limitations needed 
to be strictly limited to the wording of the Covenant. Definitions of hate speech had to recognize 
that incitement must be directly related to individuals or groups. In particular, the targeting of 
State symbols or subjective values could not be regarded as hate speech. In his view, the basic 
principle was respect for the rights of others. Freedom of expression was the manifestation of 
cultures, cultural diversity, religion and ideologies. Therefore, it was important to approach the 
right to freedom of expression with the positive understanding of defending it. 
</p>
<p>11. Agn&#232;s Callamard then discussed the role of law and of criminalization in combating hatred 
and hate speech.<b>3</b> She explained that, owing to the historical context after the Second World

</p>
<p>War, non-discrimination was a cross-cutting issue in most treaties. The central role played by 
freedom of expression in the international human rights regime came from the recognition that 
humanity&#8217;s greatest calamities, including genocide, had required full control over expression, 
opinion and conscience. She added that the courts had highlighted that freedom of expression 
was not only a right on its own, but also a cornerstone or empowerment right protecting the 
exercise of other rights. 
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Callamard also stated that, while article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights was fundamental, it was not an absolute right. The restrictions enumerated under 
article 19 were optional, not compulsory. They therefore offered a margin of appreciation for 
States as to how far they may go in limiting the right. She suggested that restrictions on speech 
should follow strict parameters, and pass a three-part test: (a) the restriction must be provided for 
by law; (b) it must pursue a legitimate aim; and (c) it must be necessary and proportionate to 
secure one of those aims. Governments must emphasize their responsibility to provide equal 
treatment, for example in education, health and housing. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding article 20 of the Covenant, Ms. Callamard recalled that the limitations were 
mandatory; it was therefore the duty of States to protect against incitement to hatred. However, 
she pointed to a large variation of interpretations among Member States of how article 20 
should be implemented, for example with regard to the motivation or the medium through which 
hate speech was made. In particular, she recalled the views of the Human Rights Committee in 
<i>Ross v. Canada</i>,<b>4</b> in which the Committee recognized that articles 19 and 20 should be read 
together. In this regard, Ms. Callamard concluded that the above-mentioned test should also be 
applied to limitations invoked under article 20. 
</p>
<p>14. Ms. Callamard emphasized that criminalization of hate speech should be but one of the 
tools. Furthermore, she argued that there was little evidence that strong hate speech regulations 
resulted in better protection and enforcement of the principle of equality. She emphasized the 
need to look at the panoply of options rather than concentrate on any single legislative option. 
She highlighted the importance of minority media as a fundamental element, mentioning that 
minorities had often been silenced by their exclusion from mainstream media. 
</p>
<p>15. Nazila Ghanea continued with the discussion on the international legal framework and the 
interrelatedness between articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant and States&#8217; obligations, in particular 
regarding the protection provided by international law on this issue and its interpretation by 
international, regional and national bodies.<b>5</b> She argued that, while article 19 did not establish an 
absolute right, case law and literature did not indicate that sanctioning hate speech necessarily 
meant prohibiting such expressions from taking place. States were required to justify why any 
withdrawals of expression would be necessary.

page 8 
 
</p>
<p>16. Regarding article 20 (2), Ms. Ghanea stated that the reference to &#8220;advocacy&#8221; meant that 
private speech could not be sanctioned; a public element should be present. Furthermore, the 
speech had to reach a certain level of gravity for it to be prohibited. She explained that this 
condition meant that hate speech had to incite to discrimination, hostility or violence for it to be 
prohibited. She noted that discrimination was very different from hostility and violence, 
therefore different thresholds applied. Furthermore, discrimination was covered also by 
provisions in the Covenant, for example in article 26. Ms. Ghanea argued that States should 
therefore show that the harm of discrimination could not be ameliorated by means other than 
suppressing the expression deemed hateful. She also argued that there was less clarity regarding 
the definitions of &#8220;hostility&#8221; and &#8220;hatred&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;violence&#8221;, which was more readily 
defined. She recommended an approach that looked at the historical context and asked what were 
the likely &#8220;soft targets&#8221;. In this sense, a history of violence or persecution against a particular 
ethnic or racial group could be a meaningful indicator of the vulnerability of such groups, 
pointing to the need for a context-specific approach. In this regard, she emphasized that the legal 
framework of minority rights could be helpful in these discussions, for example the degree of 
access by minorities to public positions, their standing in courts or involvement in public life. 
With regard to the question of subsuming &#8220;hostility and violence&#8221; under the term &#8220;violence&#8221;, 
Ms. Ghanea pointed out that the existence of hatred needed to be demonstrated first, then 
prohibited only if it incited to discrimination, hostility or violence, and not the reverse. 
</p>
<p>17. Ms. Ghanea drew five preliminary conclusions: (a) the discussion on limitations to 
freedom of expression could not be dissociated from the overall obligations under the Covenant 
as a whole, such as full equality before the law, due process and rights of minorities; (b) random 
or orchestrated acts of violence that have no reasonable link to expression should not justify 
limitations to freedom of expression; (c) where hatred itself incited to violence, it showed a 
broader pattern of violations; triggering article 20 demonstrated a failure of the State to 
guarantee the right to non-discrimination under article 26; (d) article 20 also required a careful 
and calibrated range of sanctions; at a minimum, it should not infringe expression itself and at a 
maximum it could trigger sanction; care had to be taken for the limitations not to have a chilling 
effect on freedom of expression in general; and (e) other actions in the national sphere were 
needed. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Expert discussion 
</b></p>
<p>18. Most experts concurred that legal measures, in particular criminalization of hate speech, 
should be seen as only one specific tool in an array of policy options available to address the 
phenomenon. In this regard, the role of education, including intra- and inter-religious education, 
was highlighted. Some experts, expressing a different view, pointed to the important educational 
effect of criminalizing hate speech, in particular its role in deterring it. Others emphasized that 
the prohibition of hate speech did not necessarily lead to the eradication of discrimination, as 
evidenced by the situation in countries with very robust hate speech legislation. A plethora of 
options was discussed, including education, strengthening the professionalism of the media and 
its ability to self-regulate. 
</p>
<p>19. Most experts also supported the view that it was inaccurate to refer to a conflict between 
the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of religion, emphasizing the principle 
of universality and indivisibility of all human rights. Attention was also called to the difficulty of </p>

<p> A/HRC/10/31/Add.3 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>interpreting or judging cultural particularities and religious sensitivities. The need for attention to 
be paid to the specific context and the vulnerability of particular communities was also raised. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  General discussion 
</b></p>
<p>20. The expert discussion was followed by a general debate, during which observers took the 
floor. Some States expressed the view that protection against incitement to racial and religious 
hatred was needed and highlighted that hate speech was targeting specific communities, 
particularly Muslims, since 11 September 2001. It was also emphasized that most States agreed 
that freedom of expression was not unlimited, which had been reinforced in recent debates at the 
Human Rights Council. One State suggested that an optional protocol to the International 
Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination should be envisaged to protect human 
dignity against hate speech. 
</p>
<p>21. Other States expressed the view that the elimination of religious hatred and intolerance 
required a global approach, emphasizing action in the realm of dialogue, education and 
pluralism. It was also stated that articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant constituted an important 
legislative framework to prevent advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence, and that it was essential that States fulfilled their obligations 
in this regard. 
</p>
<p>22. A number of States also called attention to the difficulties in interpreting and assessing 
allegations of defamation of religions and cultures. In particular, a question was raised as to who 
should decide whether a given statement was defamatory. While recognizing the need to protect 
cultural rights and religious freedom, observers also pointed to the fact that these arguments may 
be used in a protectionist manner to stifle criticism. 
</p>
<p><b>II. LIMITS TO THE RESTRICTIONS TO FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION: CRITERIA AND APPLICATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>23. Asma Jahangir pointed out that the State had an obligation to act in cases of advocacy of 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.<b>6</b> Advocacy of 
religious hatred already existed before 11 September 2001, including against religious minorities 
and between religious factions. She cautioned that, in a heightened state of tension, solutions 
should not be rushed. Each particular case could only be adjudicated according to its specific 
circumstances. She also emphasized that Governments had several tools at their disposal to 
counter discrimination based on religion or belief and to lower the temperature of the debate, for 
example via inter-religious and intra-religious dialogue or education. 
</p>
<p>24. Ms. Jahangir stressed that violent acts perpetrated in the name of religion must not enjoy 
any form of impunity and that the role of the judiciary was vital in providing legal redress. She 
cautioned against excessive or vague legislation on religious issues, which could create tensions 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>and problems rather than solve them. She argued that States had a delicate role to play and that 
any legislation or policies designed to combat religious discrimination had to be all-inclusive, 
carefully crafted and implemented in a balanced manner to achieve their objectives. She added 
that reference to cultural particularities was often made to undermine the rights of women and 
religious minorities. She questioned whether the genocide in Rwanda had taken place for lack of 
legislation or rather due to a lack of action, judicial or otherwise. The basic lesson was not to 
divide the world in discourses of &#8220;us against them&#8221;. Lastly, she pointed to important differences 
between race and religion and asked whether these would have any legal implications. 
</p>
<p>25. Abdelfattah Amor presented a paper dealing mainly with article 19 (3) of the Covenant.<b>7</b> 
He discussed the scope of freedom of expression and legitimate ways to restrict it. He argued 
that article 19 (3) was reinforced by article 20; however, there was incertitude and a lack of clear 
interpretation. He referred to the need for clarification of the provisions in article 19 (3) and the 
question of who should define them. Furthermore, he argued that these provisions included 
responsibilities and duties of individuals and groups which opened the door for States to interpret 
article 19 (3) to impose restrictions. 
</p>
<p>26. Mr. Amor emphasized that these responsibilities and duties had to comply with the desired 
objective so as to promote freedom of expression. He demonstrated that article 19 (3) provided 
exactly the grounds for restrictions. Restrictions, however, must not be imposed in general but 
had to be proportional, exceptional and born out of necessity, such as national security, public 
order and public health or morals. He added that the meaning of &#8220;necessity&#8221; was influenced by 
the context and varied from State to State and between cultures. Looking at the scope of 
restrictions possible under article 19 (3), he argued that restrictions were not as far-reaching as 
they appeared. 
</p>
<p>27. Mogens Schmidt examined article 19 of the Covenant with special reference to the 
UNESCO mandate to enhance mutual understanding, ensure peace, freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion, expression and opinion.<b>8</b> He noted the interdependence between 
freedom of expression and freedom of the press. He also stated that censorship would undermine 
the fundamentals of democracy. In this regard, respect for freedom of expression and respect for 
religious beliefs and symbols were two inseparable principles that went hand in hand to build 
peace and established a dialogue among cultures, civilizations, religions and peoples. 
</p>
<p>28. Mr. Schmidt stated that any restriction of the freedom of the press stemming from civil or 
criminal law had to meet two conditions: the limitations had to be provided by law and should be 
necessary to protect a number of public areas as well as the rights of others. They also had to be 
clearly and narrowly defined and must be applied by an independent body. He also argued that 
restrictions had to respect the principle that no one must be penalized for statements that were 
true, and that nobody should be penalized for the dissemination of hate speech unless it had been 
proven that they did so with the intention of inciting discrimination, hostility or violence. He 
added that prior censorship should not be used as a tool to restrict the room for debate and

<p>discussion and that care should be taken to apply the least intrusive measures to minimize any 
deterrent to freedom of expression. He finally urged the need of capacity-building so as to 
empower civil society organizations, and in particular journalists. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Expert discussion 
</b></p>
<p>29. In the ensuing discussion, one expert expressed concern at the prevailing trend of 
highlighting the exceptional nature of restrictions, overlooking the fact that the Covenant struck 
a careful balance between freedom of expression and other rights. In particular, the political 
context in which the discussions about hate speech were taking place was considered to be 
highly relevant, particularly since 11 September 2001. The scope of actors involved in such a 
discussion should be expanded, involving not only legal experts but also, for example, media 
professionals, politicians and religious leaders. Other experts believed that, while the political 
context might be a significant indicator, it was important to approach the issue within a human 
rights and legal framework. Yet others questioned the idea of &#8220;new manifestations&#8221; in the 
aftermath of 11 September 2001, arguing that those forms of discrimination, which were 
heightened after 9/11, had already existed. 
</p>
<p>30. Some experts made reference to the need to differentiate between racial and religious 
hatred, highlighting the differences between the concepts of &#8220;race&#8221; and &#8220;religion&#8221;. Others 
deemed it possible to draw parallels between any form of discrimination against a group of 
individuals if these were clearly identifiable as a group and were discriminated against as such. 
</p>
<p>31. Several experts highlighted that there was a high threshold for restrictions to freedom of 
expression, such as grave or imminent threat or peril. Different views were expressed among the 
experts regarding how to determine what was &#8220;necessary&#8221; under article 19 (3) of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  General discussion 
</b></p>
<p>32. Some observers expressed the view that additional protection against incitement to 
religious hatred was warranted since new forms of discrimination now exist. Such a view raised 
the concern of other observers, who saw no need to adopt complementary standards to existing 
international norms, which already offered adequate protection against hate speech. 
</p>
<p>33. In addition to legal measures, there was agreement on the importance of having a wider 
strategy to include cross-cultural education, intercultural dialogue and promotion of tolerance of 
diversity. In this regard, limitations to freedom of expression should be seen as just one of many 
alternatives to deal with this phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>34. One observer argued that restrictions to freedom of expression to combat incitement to 
religious hatred could not be considered a &#8220;necessary evil&#8221;, as they were designed to uphold the 
full range of human rights. Other observers noted that the use of subjective and overly broad 
limitations could deter freedom of expression and that the focus should remain on the full 
promotion of this right rather than on its possible limitations. </p>

<p><b>III. ANALYSIS OF THE NOTION OF ADVOCACY OF 
RELIGIOUS HATRED THAT CONSTITUTES 
INCITEMENT TO DISCRIMINATION, HOSTILITY 
OR VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>35. Vitit Muntarbhorn made a presentation on the criteria that should be used to define the 
notion of advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence.<b>9</b> He insisted on the relationship between the notions of freedom of expression and 
religion, stressing that freedom of religion or belief depended on freedom of expression and that 
elements of &#8220;expression&#8221; were externalized by the manifestation of a religion. Both freedoms 
also depended on a degree of tolerance, mutual respect and diversity inherent in human 
existence, including non-believers. He added that the notion of freedom of expression was linked 
to respect for a variety of different opinions and the ways through which they were 
communicated, and that such plurality should not be diluted. He explained that any attempt to 
analyse the relationship between expression and religion must take into consideration 
historiography, implying an understanding of &#8220;who writes history and for whom&#8221;, and that there 
should be no monopoly of sources in that regard. That the originator of a religion or belief may 
have had a very broadminded approach, but not the subsequent interpretation of the said religion 
or belief, should also be taken into consideration. 
</p>
<p>36. Mr. Muntarbhorn, noting the debate on &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221;, stressed that, at the 
national level, the common term used was &#8220;blasphemy&#8221;. He emphasized that many countries had 
had laws prohibiting blasphemy for centuries and that, in recent years, some countries had 
reformed or repealed such laws while others continued to use them. The various applicable 
human rights provisions should be read together, bearing in mind the cross-cutting principle of 
equality and non-discrimination. He also stated that limitations to the manifestation of religion 
and expression should remain the exception, not become the rule. Adding that prevention was 
better than cure, he stressed the importance of multicultural and intercultural education. In the 
context of the United Nations, it was necessary to clarify the relationship between freedom of 
religion and freedom of expression by means of general comments from the Human Rights 
Committee. 
</p>
<p>37. Lastly, Mr. Muntarbhorn indicated that various parameters should be taken into 
consideration to clarify the content of article 20 (2) of the Covenant; in particular, the 
interconnection between articles 19 and 20 had to be recognized. Article 20 must also be read in 
a holistic manner, taking into consideration human rights law as a whole, including the principle 
of due process and non-derogable rights, and all its elements that provided for high thresholds. 
This was the case in particular of the term &#8220;incitement&#8221;, which was close to the concept of 
&#8220;public provocation&#8221;, and the term &#8220;hatred&#8221;, which did not mean &#8220;dislike&#8221; but rather a &#8220;high 
degree of opprobrium&#8221;. Among the concepts of discrimination, violence and hostility, the latter 
opened the door to more interpretation and carried the notion of &#8220;enemies&#8221;. Furthermore,

</p>
<p>according to Mr. Muntarbhorn the prescriptive element included in article 20 should not lead to 
automatic criminalization although he acknowledged the value of legal deterrence. 
Criminalization required the existence of the element of intent by the author of the crime, 
although evolution of international law brought some degree of objectification in this respect. 
Mr. Muntarbhorn also stated that, under article 20, prohibition also meant accountability and 
combating impunity. 
</p>
<p>38. Patrice Meyer-Bisch then presented his analysis of the notion of advocacy of religious 
hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.<b>10</b> He indicated that 
various sanctions of a criminal, civil and social nature were available to combat such acts. When 
criminal law was used, the publicity given to the law was important. Sanctions had not only to 
impede illegal acts, but also remedy the harm done to mutual trust. Underlining the adoption by 
UNESCO of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity in 2001 and of the Convention on 
the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions in 2005, he stated that 
tolerance entailed respect. Tolerance also implied more, not less, freedom, as each human right 
involved the notions of both freedom and responsibility. The issue was not to restrict freedoms 
but to develop their indivisible substance. 
</p>
<p>39. Mr. Meyer-Bisch also insisted on the notion of &#8220;respectful criticism&#8221; of persons on the one 
hand, and of religious diversity, which was part of the common heritage of humanity, on the 
other. According to Mr. Meyer-Bisch, cultural freedom cannot be achieved when cultural 
resources are under attack, while criticism should always be possible, provided it was respectful 
of persons and acquired knowledge, and grounded on the principle of good faith. Religions 
themselves were places of interpretation, since no human being can assert the definitive meaning 
of a religious text. 
</p>
<p>40. Mr. Meyer-Bisch also emphasized the cultural content of freedoms. Strict interpretation of 
articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant did not mean that only these provisions should be looked into; 
other provisions were also relevant, such as article 27 of the Covenant, and articles 13 to 15 of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Freedom of expression 
must be understood in relation to the issue of access to cultural heritage and resources. The 
cultural content of the twin rights to education and information must also be elucidated. To this 
end, one should take into consideration article 15 (2) of the latter Covenant, which called for 
steps for the conservation, development and dissemination of science and culture. Lastly, he 
called for the development of national observatories to gather information on the respect for 
cultural rights and cultural diversity, including diversity of religions and convictions, and 
proposed that national human rights institutions address the issue of cultural rights, perhaps 
through a national monitoring scheme. 
</p>
<p>41. Mohamed Saeed M. Eltayeb made a presentation on the admissible scope of limitations on 
critical thinking on religious issues.<b>11</b> The main premise, he proposed, was to frame the debate

</p>
<p>on the complementarity of freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief in 
consideration of context, local conditions and political tensions, rather than presenting the issue 
as an inherent conflict between two freedoms. He stated that it was necessary that an approach 
that endorsed the principle of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of these two 
interconnected and interdependent freedoms, on the one hand, and to strike the balance and 
complementarity between them, on the other, be adopted. He added that freedom of religion or 
belief did not protect religions or beliefs per se; however, this was not to suggest that the 
protection of religious symbols from insult and denigration did not fall within the scope of 
freedom of religion. In his view, the question whether criticism, derogatory comment, insults or 
ridicule of a religion encroached on the believer&#8217;s right to freedom of religion or belief could 
only be determined by examining whether such acts negatively affected the various aspects of 
religious freedom of the believer. 
</p>
<p>42. According to Mr. Eltayeb, the definition of the scope of limitation of critical thinking of 
religious issues must take into consideration articles 18 to 20 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. While deciding which forms of expression amounted to acts that 
should be prohibited under article 20 was a contextual question, it was important that general 
criteria or parameters be defined. In particular, Mr. Eltayeb pointed to the need to distinguish 
between speeches that advocate religious hatred that constituted incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence, and those that did not. He added that guaranteeing both freedoms of 
expression and of religion or belief should be a prerequisite to implementing restrictions on those 
freedoms. It was also important to identify potential abuse by Governments when invoking 
article 20 of the Covenant, the main objective of which is to protect minorities. A broad 
application of article 20 may have far-reaching implications, not only on freedom of expression 
but also on freedom of religion or belief, for example with regard to honest debate and research 
on religious issues. Lastly, an independent judiciary was crucial in the process of effectively 
assessing cases related to incitement to religious hatred according to article 20. 
</p>
<p>43. In his concluding remarks, Mr. Eltayeb emphasized that article 20 of the Covenant was not 
self-executing and that States parties had to enact appropriate laws. Stressing that article 20 
could be used as a pretext for persecuting and oppressing religious minorities, he stated that 
alternatives to the use of criminal law in order to implement article 20 may be more suitable. The 
implementation of human rights required different kinds of strategies, and legal measures might 
be seen as part of wider strategies. Mr. Eltayeb concluded that new standards were not required, 
but the development of the interpretation of existing standards was needed; the Human Rights 
Committee might therefore revisit its general comment on article 20.

<p><b>B.  Expert discussion and general discussion 
</b></p>
<p>44. Owing to time constraints, the discussion of topics III and IV was held at the end of the 
seminar. </p>

<p> A/HRC/10/31/Add.3

</p>
<p><b>IV. ANALOGIES AND PARALLELS WITH OTHER 
TYPES OF &#8220;INCITEMENT&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Expert presentations 
</b></p>
<p>45. In his presentation, Doudou Di&#232;ne analysed the issue of analogies between advocacy of 
racial and religious hatred, with particular emphasis on the underlying political context in which 
such violations take place.<b>12</b> He called for the debate on freedom of expression to be put in the 
context of dialogue of civilizations. Mr. Di&#232;ne made reference to the intellectual context in 
which discussions of hate speech were taking place, recalling the controversial publication of the 
cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. He warned against a Manichean approach, for example, of 
artificially distinguishing between regions of the world where freedom of expression was 
defended and others where obscurantism and intolerance reigned. 
</p>
<p>46. Mr. Di&#232;ne argued that the debate on limitations to freedom of expression should be located 
within the present context. In particular, he referred to an ideological reading of human rights 
since 11 September 2001, with the tendency to give primacy to freedom of expression. In his 
view, this ideological capture was a cause of the present tension. He argued that one cannot 
approach freedom of expression without analysing discrimination. He stated that a number of 
countries had been able to find legal strategies against discrimination but had failed to address 
the root causes of a racist and discriminatory mentality. He argued that the fight against racism 
had to go beyond non-discrimination and should promote interaction among communities. This 
would allow for the emergence of more pluralistic concepts of national identities, which were 
closely linked to the exercise of freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>47. Mr. Di&#232;ne also made reference to what he saw as three trends in racism: (a) the surge in 
racist violence and discrimination, including the joint increase of anti-Semitism and 
Islamophobia; (b) the political instrumentalization of racism by political parties in democratic 
societies; and (c) the intellectual and scientific legitimization of racism. Regarding possible 
solutions, Mr. Di&#232;ne recommended that the amalgamation of race, religion and culture should be 
addressed. He also called for the debate to be resituated in the framework of human rights and 
the Covenant, in particular with regard to the notion of incitement to racial and religious hatred. 
He argued that freedom of expression would be strengthened if the limitations were respected. 
</p>
<p>48. Patrick Thornberry then made a presentation on forms of hate speech and the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.<b>13</b> He explained that the 
Convention had emerged in a different historical environment, as it was drafted in the light of 
Nazi practices, and forged in the area of the cold war as well as the struggle against apartheid 
and colonialism. The Convention, to which 173 States are today party, is the result of the 
decision of the General Assembly to separate the drafting of legal instruments on racial and 
religious discrimination.

<p>A/HRC/10/31/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>49. Mr. Thornberry indicated that, although the five grounds of discrimination set out in 
article 1 of the Convention - race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin - did not specify 
religion, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination searched for elements of 
&#8220;intersectionality&#8221; between racial and religious discrimination when considering individual 
cases. Furthermore, article 5 of the Convention called for the enjoyment, without discrimination, 
of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In consequence, the Committee had 
made numerous references in its concluding observations to phenomena such as Islamophobia, 
discrimination against Jews and Sikhs, discrimination against indigenous religions, desecration 
of sacred sites and other cases where it had sensed an overlap or intersection between religion 
and ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>50. Mr. Thornberry stated that article 4 of the Convention, which addresses the issues of hate 
speech and the banning of racist organizations, had triggered a large number of reservations by 
States parties. The Committee, which regarded this provision as central, had made use of 
article 4 by for example recommending that the crime of incitement cover offences motivated by 
religious hatred against immigrant communities or by recommending that religious hatred be 
designated as aggravating circumstances. He added that the basic principles of criminal liability 
in many - if not most - jurisdictions would be violated if hate speech was penalized even when 
no intention to incite could be shown. 
</p>
<p>51. Mr. Thornberry stated that the Convention was a living instrument that could take into 
consideration new conceptions of rights. Noting that there seemed to be a move away from the 
concept of &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221;, he stressed that the Convention and the Committee aimed 
at protecting individuals and communities. Finally, noting the proposal for an optional protocol 
to the Convention on religion, he stressed that the practice of the Committee had already resulted 
in extensive coverage of discrimination against religious communities. 
</p>
<p>52. Nat&#225;n Lerner made a presentation on analogies and parallels to be drawn from situations 
where limitations were imposed to freedom of expression to protect against incitement to, or 
advocacy of, hate crimes, and the applicability of such limitations to advocacy of religious 
hatred.<b>14</b> He stressed that freedom of expression was a fundamental right that may be subject to 
limitations determined by law in a democratic society. No new international standards were 
necessary, since articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant, article 4 of the International Convention on 
the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and article 3 of the Genocide Convention 
provided sufficient protection and were compatible with freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>53. According to Mr. Lerner, some terminology needed to be clarified, such as the words 
&#8220;intolerance&#8221;, &#8220;hate speech&#8221; and &#8220;hostility&#8221;, and suggested that the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Human Rights Committee might wish to 
re-examine their relevant general recommendations or general comments to further the 
understanding of the legal provisions. Mr. Lerner preferred to use &#8220;respect&#8221; instead of negative 
terms such as &#8220;intolerance&#8221;. 
</p>

<p> A/HRC/10/31/Add.3 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>54. Mr. Lerner explained that there should be no distinction in the treatment of incitement to 
national, racial or religious hatred and the protection afforded by the law. He argued that 
abundant jurisprudence already existed on these matters, and that religious groups could invoke 
protection against racist acts because of the close relationship between the concepts. He also 
stated that criminal law had a powerful educational impact and could lead to changes in attitudes 
on types of speech. However, societies should be careful when distinguishing between criminal 
activities against religious groups and criticism of religion, which could be seen as offensive. 
&#8220;Defamation of religions&#8221; was a term that should be re-examined and Mr. Lerner recommended 
that its use be avoided. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Expert discussion 
</b></p>
<p>55. One expert mentioned the experience of UNESCO in setting up community media as a 
positive way to respond to mainstream media. In defence of the Internet, the expert recalled the 
many opportunities it offered and argued that its misuse by a small number should not detract 
from its benefits. 
</p>
<p>56. In relation to so-called &#8220;hate media&#8221;, another expert added that the example of Rwanda, 
where there had been clear incitement to violence, was not about freedom of expression being 
instrumentalized but rather about the violation of this freedom in practice. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  General discussion 
</b></p>
<p>57. Freedom of expression was characterized by most observers as not the problem but rather 
part of the solution; it was felt that free confrontation of ideas and exposure of intolerance should 
prevail over prohibition and censorship. There was broad consensus that the concepts of 
&#8220;incitement&#8221; and &#8220;discrimination&#8221; were preferable to the notion of &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221;. 
The re-examining and strengthening of legislation at the national level were deemed important, 
especially with regard to the right of reply for minority groups targeted by slander. Lack of or 
insufficient national legislation could sometimes be compensated by referring cases to regional 
mechanisms that had the capacity to adjudicate rapidly. 
</p><p>58. Some States expressed their concern that a number of countries applied double standards 
when advocating for freedom of expression while having enacted &#8220;denial laws&#8221; that curtailed 
freedom of expression on historical events. Several speakers referred to the idea of a new 
international norm, and preferred clarifying existing norms rather than drafting new standards. 
</p>
<p>59. A call was made to follow-up with another meeting to strengthen the implementation and 
protection of freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUDING SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>60. At the conclusion of the seminar, the Chairperson invited the experts to summarize their 
main ideas and comments on the substantive issues discussed. 
</p>
<p>61. Mr. La Rue stated that limitations under articles 19 and 20 were clear and should be 
implemented accordingly. He stressed the importance of prevention through education and by 
promoting ethical values for journalists on a voluntary basis. In particular, he argued that 
dialogue and mutual comprehension were the long-term solution to the problem. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/31/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>62. Ms. Callamard expressed the hope that the seminar had helped to depolarize the debate on 
the issues it tackled. She suggested further follow-up events of this nature, specifically referring 
to the need to discuss the issue of Islamophobia. A number of questions, complexities and cases 
of polarization remained; consequently, a technical, non-political setting might allow for a better 
understanding of this phenomenon. In the context of the relationship between freedom of 
expression and the fight against discrimination, she recommended that the European Court of 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Committee consider the need to unpack some of the key 
concepts and terminology contained in the relevant legal instruments. 
</p>
<p>63. Ms. Ghanea recommended that a victim-centred approach be adopted in all circumstances 
leading to the enjoyment of all human rights for all. She suggested that any follow-up activities 
should be based on three premises: (a) actual instances of incitement to religious hatred should 
be acted upon when channelled by civil society rather than by States; (b) local remedies needed 
to be exhausted first; and (c) existing international mechanisms, such as under the universal 
periodic review, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and inter-State 
mechanisms, needed to be exhausted before considering new standards. 
</p>
<p>64. Ms. Jahangir affirmed that more consultation was needed, especially concerning the 
implementation of existing standards at the domestic level. She suggested that the Human Rights 
Committee, whenever it saw fit, could revisit its general comment No. 11 (1983) on article 20 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Implementation of specific national 
legislation had often fostered more polarization rather than protect religious minorities. She 
recommended that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) should consider organizing regional workshops in order to explore this issue also at 
the grass-roots levels. She concluded by stating that international human rights instruments were 
designed to protect individuals and groups. 
</p>
<p>65. Mr. Schmidt suggested a peer-reviewed analysis of regional and international case law on 
incitement to religious hatred. He expressed the commitment of UNESCO to continue focusing 
on these issues. He further pointed to the importance of keeping the debate as open and 
constructive as possible. 
</p>
<p>66. Mr. Amor proposed for follow-up that (a) an inventory of national legislation and policies 
to identify best practices be conducted; (b) another international consultative conference on 
freedom of expression and the fight against intolerance, which could draw from the experience 
of the 2001 Madrid conference on school education in relation to freedom of religion or belief, 
tolerance and non-discrimination, be convened; (c) the Human Rights Committee be encouraged 
to consider updating its general comments on articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights; and (d) OHCHR capacity to work on &#8220;communication and culture&#8221; to 
monitor and raise alarm on tensions that could lead to crisis be strengthened. 
</p>
<p>67. Mr. Muntarbhorn recommended various forward-looking, mutually respective dialogues, 
including consultations with national human rights institutions, civil society and the media; 
inter-denominational consultations; consultations between treaty bodies and special procedures; 
Internet dialogues, including engagement with software and hardware manufacturers and Internet 
service providers; and identification, compilation and sharing of programmes for cross-cutting 
understanding. </p>

<p> A/HRC/10/31/Add.3 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>68. Mr. Meyer-Bisch emphasized the issue of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, 
for example based on religion, race and gender. He also underlined the importance of bearing in 
mind the implications of discrimination related to poverty. 
</p>
<p>69. Mr. Eltayeb highlighted that existing international norms were adequate, although a review 
of their interpretation was needed. In this regard, the role of the Human Rights Committee was 
crucial. In addition, he expressed his agreement with the shifting of the debate from the notion of 
&#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; to the legal concept of &#8220;incitement to religious hatred&#8221;. As a follow-up 
initiative, he suggested considering the establishment of an expert working group on the links 
between articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>70. Mr. Di&#232;ne affirmed that to face the present-day challenges of conflict among civilizations, 
it was important that freedom of expression be strengthened while respecting the delicate balance 
between freedom of expression and its limitations and restrictions. Finally, he proposed that the 
current debate be enlarged to involve other stakeholders, such as political and religious leaders 
and media representatives. 
</p>
<p>71. Mr. Thornberry stated that new challenges were emerging, for example in the context of 
immigration. He contended that an adaptive and evolving interpretation of international norms 
was needed. In this context, suggestions for revisiting interpretations by treaty bodies were valid 
when circumstances required. He emphasized the importance of multiculturalism and 
recommended that follow-up activities should involve civil society organizations as well as 
minorities and other affected communities. 
</p>
<p>72. Mr. Lerner affirmed that the expert seminar showed that there was a basis for common 
understanding of key concepts. He further recommended that OHCHR take the lead by 
producing a manual on legislation related to racial or religious discrimination. </p>
