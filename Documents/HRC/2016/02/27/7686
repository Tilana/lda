</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, Farida Shaheed, submits the 
present report in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 19/6. 
 In the report, the Special Rapporteur addresses memorialization processes of the 
events of the past in post-conflict and divided societies, with a specific focus on memorials 
and museums of history/memory. 
 States exiting conflicts or periods of repression are increasingly propelled to engage 
in active memorial policies as a means of ensuring recognition for the victims, as reparation 
for mass or grave violations of human rights and as a guarantee of non-recurrence. The 
Special Rapporteur stresses the significance of actions in the cultural field for achieving the 
overall societal goals of transitional justice, while noting that entire cultural and symbolic 
landscapes are designed through memorials and museums, which both reflect and shape, 
negatively or positively, social interactions and people&#8217;s cognition of identities &#8211; their own 
as well as that of others. 
</p>
<p> Addressing some difficult challenges encountered in memorializing the past, the 
Special Rapporteur makes a number of recommendations grounded in the principle that 
memorialization should be understood as a process that provides to those affected by 
human rights violations the spaces necessary to articulate their narratives. Memorial 
practices should stimulate and promote civic engagement, critical thinking and discussion 
regarding the representation of the past, but equally the contemporary challenges of 
exclusion and violence.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is the second of two consecutive studies by the Special Rapporteur on 
historical and memorial narratives in divided and post-conflict societies. The first report, 
dealing with the issue of the writing and teaching of history, with a particular focus on 
history textbooks was submitted to the General Assembly in 2013 (A/68/296) and sought to 
identify the circumstances in which historical narratives promoted by States in schools may 
become problematic from a human rights perspective. This second report addresses 
memorialization processes, with a specific focus on memorials and museums, and tackles 
the wider processes of collective memorialization undertaken by various actors, both 
governmental and non-governmental. 
</p>
<p>2. Cultural rights have an important role to play in transitional justice and 
reconciliation strategies: &#8220;To be successful, criminal and restorative justice must be 
integrated into a larger process&#8221;, including in particular cultural rights1 that can help to 
transform institutions and stimulate changes in both cultural practices and individual 
outlooks.2 Collective reparations for mass or grave violations of human rights can take the 
form of legal but also non-legal measures, the latter entering the field of symbolism and 
memory, which is too often overlooked. The ways in which narratives are memorialized 
have consequences far beyond the sole issue of reparations. Entire cultural and symbolic 
landscapes are designed through memorials and museums reflecting, but also shaping 
negatively or positively, social interactions and people&#8217;s self-identities, as well as their 
perception of other social groups. Sometimes, the past defines people rather than informs 
them.  
</p>
<p>3. The present report tries to elucidate the responsibilities of States and other 
stakeholders in the field of memorialization, in view of the fact that memory, like history, is 
never immune from political influence and debate. The rising trend of memorialization 
processes today makes discussing these issues both urgent and necessary.  
</p>
<p>4. In 2013, the Special Rapporteur convened two meetings on these issues. The first 
was held from 1 to 3 July 2013 in Derry/Londonderry, United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland (see A/68/296, paragraph 8, and annex). A second expert meeting was 
organized on 7 and 8 October 2013 in Geneva, in cooperation with the research team 
PIMPA (Politics of Memory and Art Practices) of the Geneva University of Art and 
Design. On 5 July 2013, the Special Rapporteur convened open consultations in Geneva in 
order to offer an opportunity to States, national human rights institutions and non-
governmental organizations to present their views. The Special Rapporteur thanks all 
participants for their valuable contributions.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Processes of memorialization: goals and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>5. For the purpose of this report, the Special Rapporteur refers to memorials, 
understood as physical representation or commemorative activities, located in public 
spaces, that concern specific events regardless of the period of occurrence (wars and

<p>conflicts, mass or grave human rights violations), or the persons involved (soldiers, 
combatants, victims, political leaders or activists for example).3  
</p><p>6. Memorial expressions are extremely diverse. Major forms include authentic 
sites (for example concentration camps, former torture and detention centres, sites of mass 
killings and graves and emblematic monuments of repressive regimes); symbolic sites (such 
as permanent or ephemeral constructed monuments carrying the names of victims, renamed 
streets, buildings or infrastructure, virtual memorials on the Internet and museums of 
history/memory); and activities (such as public apologies, reburials, walking tours, parades 
and temporary exhibits). In addition, although outside the scope of this report, various 
cultural expressions (artworks, films, documentaries, literature and sound and light shows 
addressing a tourist audience, etc.) also contribute to memorialization processes.  
7. Memorials thus encompass all kinds of engagements specifically designed to 
remember the wrongs of the past. This allows for diversity in approaches, as constructed 
monuments do not always correspond to the wishes or culture of the communities 
concerned. 
</p>
<p><b> A. An evolution of expectations regarding memorialization 
</b></p>
<p>8. The purpose of memorials has changed dramatically over time. In ancient Greek city 
states, battlefield memorials were deliberately constructed of wood to enable erosion, 
opening possibilities for reconciliation between former enemies.4  
</p>
<p>9. With the passage of time, memorials have shifted from honouring soldiers dying in 
the line of duty to a victims&#8217; perspective and new visions of reconciliation. Starting in the 
1980s, the creation of memorials has become linked to the idea that ensuring public 
recognition of past crimes is indispensable to the victims, essential for preventing further 
violence and necessary for redefining national unity. Memorialization is often a demand of 
victims and society at large5 and the path to national reconciliation is seen to pass through 
not only legal reparations, but also symbolic reparations such as memorials. 
</p>
<p>10. The memorial injunction &#8220;Never again&#8221;, born after the First World War, was framed 
in the late 1990s through the transitional justice paradigm, whereby the rule of law and 
promoting democratic cultures are societal guarantees to protect against further tragedies. 
With the recognition that civilians bear the main brunt of atrocities, memorialization has 
become a political and sociocultural imperative in reconciliation processes.  
</p>
<p>11. Contributing to the rise of memorialization was the emergence in the 1980s of the 
controversial concept<b> </b>of<b> </b>the &#8220;duty of remembrance&#8221;6 of mass crimes, such as the 
destruction of European Jews by the Nazis, the slave trade and the violence perpetrated 
against indigenous peoples. This concept asserts the legitimacy of seeking reparation and 
drawing lessons even centuries after the actual events.

<p>12. The understanding that memorialization should be a means of combating injustice 
and promoting reconciliation was expressed in the Durban Declaration of the World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in 
which States emphasized &#8220;that remembering the crimes or wrongs of the past, wherever and 
whenever they occurred, unequivocally condemning its racist tragedies and telling the truth 
about history are essential elements for international reconciliation and the creation of 
societies based on justice, equality and solidarity&#8221;.  
</p><p>13. The goals assigned to memorialization processes are thus multi-faceted and, 
regardless of diversity in form and shape, memorials have both private/reflective and 
public/educative purposes.7 They are geared not only towards the past (recalling events, 
recognizing and honouring victims and enabling stories to be related), but equally to the 
present (healing processes and rebuilding of trust between communities) and the future 
(preventing further violence through education and awareness-raising). Memorialization 
processes can promote a culture of democratic engagement by stimulating discussion 
regarding the representation of the past and contemporary challenges of exclusion and 
violence.  
</p>
<p>14. The multiplicity of memorial entrepreneurs means that memorialization may focus 
more on one goal rather than another, in some cases heightening or leading to tensions and 
mutual suspicion. Other goals may also be pursued, more or less openly, such as nation-
building and constructing national identities, or, worryingly, as a tool to affirm 
predominance over a territory, gather people around one emphasized identity and justify 
various political agendas. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Critically assessing memorialization policies and practices 
</b></p>
<p>15. The question is whether memorials do and can fulfil the purposes assigned to them 
as described in paragraph 13 above and, if so, under which conditions?8 In the last 20 years, 
more memorials and museums (of history/memory) were established than in the previous 
two centuries, suggesting the need to undertake a broader, more detailed analysis of the 
issue.  
</p>
<p>16. While memorialization processes mark the recognition of victims, the will to ensure 
reparation for mass or grave violations of human rights and non-recurrence, they can also 
amount to memorial tyrannies. This occurs when continuously multiplying memorials do 
not take into account alternative voices or suffer questions, enclose people within their past 
and leave little space for the remembrance of other events and relations between groups of 
people.9  
</p>
<p>17. On the whole, the worldwide trend of greater memorialization can be seen as 
positive. However, too much memory, especially if presented in the form of irreconcilable 
versions of the past, might hurt rather than help a society.10 All post-conflict and divided 
societies confront the need to establish a delicate balance between forgetting and 
remembering. It is crucial that memorialization processes do not function as empty rhetoric 
commemorating the dead, while losing sight of the reasons and the context for past 
tragedies and obscuring contemporary challenges.

<p><b> C. Political agendas in the battlefield of memory 
</b></p>
<p>18. The commemoration of tragic events, during or following conflict, including long 
afterwards, involving public art and the mobilization of collective memory, can convey 
messages of peace, recognition, reconciliation and community solidarity, but also in too 
many cases self-victimization, thirst for revenge and martyrdom. The political, educational 
and even aesthetics challenges are significant. 
</p>
<p>19. Memorials address issues that can be very divisive. States and other stakeholders 
must decide which particular narrative to promote (specific/exclusive or inclusive of plural 
narratives); at which point in time (immediately following events or after several 
generations) and for how long; where exactly (an authentic site, a public place visible to all 
on a daily basis or in a less central area requiring a proactive decision to pay a visit); and 
for which purpose and following which process (who should be consulted and on what 
exactly, who funds the project, how much autonomy should designers enjoy). Such issues 
may be particularly controversial in societies which have seen international or internal 
conflicts; post-colonial societies, including those which have experienced slavery; societies 
challenged by divisions based on ethnic, national or linguistic backgrounds, religion or 
political ideology; and societies in which indigenous peoples, minorities or other groups 
have been excluded from the memorialization processes.  
</p>
<p>20. These matters can only be decided on a case-by-case basis. From a human rights 
perspective, what counts is creating conditions that allow a &#8220;broadly located, mobile, multi-
layered and interactive dialogical truth&#8221;11 to emerge, meaning a debate on past events and 
actions that enables society to overcome &#8220;completely separate and unrecognized accounts 
of what happened&#8221;12 so as to move forward and develop more peaceful relationships. 
Narratives, whether historical or memorial, are always a viewpoint and communities are 
never monolithic blocs. The central issue is how to ensure that people hear the story of 
others and learn to recognize their common humanity. 
</p>
<p>21. In memorialization processes, some actors may use the battlefield of memory to 
further their own agendas, imposing definitions of perpetrators and heroes and establishing 
categories of victims. This often leaves some victims in the shadow; it can create victim 
hierarchies, carries the risk of generating a competition in victimhood and may also provide 
some contemporary groups with &#8220;an endless line of credit&#8221;.13  
</p>
<p>22. Memorials may be deployed to mobilize against the enemies of today and of the 
future, for example nationalist propaganda that manipulates symbols and revitalizes 
emotions from the past in which &#8220;memories of humiliation inspire the desire for revenge 
and are used to justify further aggression based on any historical or ancestral right.&#8221;14 
Examples of such political manipulation around memorialization abound. In many regions, 
memory has become an intense battlefield, with opposing sides investing heavily in 
memorialization to justify their moral, legal and ideological superiority. 
</p><p>23. Memorials may also serve as places of pride and celebration of past crimes for 
radical groups. This can be the case, for example, of burial sites of war criminals, in 
particular when no reference, explanation or historical perspective is provided in relation to 
the crimes committed, through a plaque or nearby museum. Such cemeteries become 
further politicized by visits of high-ranking governmental officials.

<p>24. Positive initiatives exist, however, such as Chancellor Willy Brandt kneeling at the 
monument to the Warsaw Ghetto in 1970, or President Nelson Mandela visiting the 
Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria &#8211; often seen as embodying the policy of apartheid &#8211; in 
</p><p>2002. Integrated into a broader political strategy, memorialization can help to transform 
political realities, catalysing needed social debate on past crimes or events.  
</p>
<p><b> III. A normative framework: the emergence of memorialization 
standards  
</b></p>
<p>25. The increasing trend in memorialization became institutionalized between 1997 and 
2005, involving many actors in different forums and propelling States exiting conflicts or 
periods of repression to engage in active memorial policies, using increasingly similar 
modalities. Western memorial models commemorating the victims of Nazism, while not 
always the most adequate or appropriate, have become a template or at least a political and 
aesthetic inspiration for the representation of past tragedies or mass crimes.  
</p>
<p>26. Alongside official, usually top-down, memorials are initiatives driven from below 
by artists, political groups or communities determined to publicly recall the memory of 
victims overlooked or denied by State policies. For example, this bottom-up trend led to the 
creation of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience in 1999. There are countless 
grassroots and civil society memorial initiatives on all continents that may complement, 
react to, or even directly oppose representations of official historiography. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The Joinet-Orentlicher and the Van Boven-Bassiouni Principles 
</b></p>
<p>27. At the international level, two sets of basic principles have been developed in the 
area of reparations and the fight against impunity, which must be taken into consideration.  
</p>
<p>28. First, Louis Joinet, the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on 
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, listed a Set of Principles for the 
protection and promotion of human rights through actions to combat impunity, focused on 
four pillars of transitional justice: the rights to know, to justice and to reparation and 
guarantees of non-recurrence (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1). The right to know is defined 
not only as the right of individual victims or close relatives to know what happened (the 
right to truth), but also as a &#8220;collective right, drawing upon history to prevent violations 
from recurring in the future&#8221; (Ibid., para. 17). According to Principle No. 2, &#8220;A people&#8217;s 
knowledge of the history of its oppression is part of its heritage and, as such, must be 
preserved by appropriate measures in fulfilment of the State&#8217;s duty to remember. Such 
measures shall be aimed at preserving the collective memory from extinction and, in 
particular, at guarding against the development of revisionist and negationist arguments.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>29. Mr. Joinet affirmed the need for actions based on memorialization: &#8220;On a collective 
basis, symbolic measures intended to provide moral reparation, such as formal public 
recognition by the State of its responsibility, or official declarations aimed at restoring 
victims&#8217; dignity, commemorative ceremonies, naming of public thoroughfares or the 
erection of monuments, help to discharge the duty of remembrance&#8221; (Ibid., para. 42). Mr. 
Joinet&#8217;s Set of Principles was expanded upon by Diane Orentlicher, the independent expert 
appointed to update the Set of Principles, to become the Updated Set of Principles for the 
protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity, with similar 
elements on the duty to preserve memory (E/CN.4/2005/102 and Add.1).  
</p>
<p>30. Principles developed in other reports by the Special Rapporteur of the Sub-
Commission, Theo van Boven (E/CN.4/1997/104), and the Special Rapporteur of the </p>


<p>Commission on Human Rights, Cherif Bassiouni (E/CN.4/2000/62), formed the basis for 
the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims 
of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law, adopted by the General Assembly in resolution 60/147. 
</p>
<p>31. In that resolution, the General Assembly reiterated that memorial processes are part 
of the broader issue of reparations and recognized that satisfaction should include, where 
applicable and amongst other important elements such as verification of the facts and full 
and public disclosure of the truth, an official declaration or a judicial decision restoring the 
dignity, the reputation and the rights of the victim and of persons closely connected with 
the victim; a public apology, including acknowledgement of the facts and acceptance of 
responsibility; commemorations and tributes to the victims and inclusion of an accurate 
account of the violations that occurred in international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law training and in educational material at all levels. 
</p>
<p>32. United Nations mechanisms have not yet undertaken a global study to examine 
memorial practices in the light of these principles. However, some United Nations reports 
relating to specific country contexts usefully draw attention to this subject. For example, the 
mapping report of 2010 on human rights abuses committed between 1993 and 2003 in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo forcefully stresses the need to preserve the memory of 
the violations and, examining concrete examples, points out the danger of memorialization 
inciting revenge.15 Similarly, the report of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances on its mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina concluded that the issue of 
memorials had caused much controversy and unhappiness in the country 
(A/HRC/16/48/Add.1, para. 48). The Working Group also carefully considered the 
implementation of the recommendations of the Equity and Reconciliation Commission of 
Morocco regarding community reparations, including the conversion of former detention 
centres into memorials (A/HRC/13/31/Add.1, paras. 56-66). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Diplomatic conferences 
</b></p>
<p>33. Major conferences on the Holocaust in the 1990s and 2000s in London, Washington, 
D.C. and Stockholm contributed to firmly establishing symbolic reparation as an integral 
part of the international agenda. Participants shared a commitment to commemorate the 
victims, to honour those who stood against the Holocaust and to encourage appropriate 
forms of Holocaust remembrance in their countries.16 
</p>
<p>34. The gap in memorialization regarding slave trades and colonization was addressed at 
the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related 
Intolerance in 2001. In the Durban Declaration, States acknowledged and profoundly 
regretted the massive human suffering and the plight of millions of men, women and 
children caused by slavery, the slave trade, including the transatlantic slave trade, apartheid, 
genocide and colonialism. They called upon the States concerned to honour the memories 
of the victims of past tragedies. Noting that some had taken steps expressing regret, 
remorse or apologies, they called on all those who had not yet contributed to restoring the 
dignity of the victims to find appropriate ways to do so. The deliberations were particularly 
stormy, as some Western countries feared that an obligation to express repentance would 
lead to claims for financial compensation.

<p>35. Memorialization is now part of the international agenda, as is also evident in 
international days recalling past wrongs. One still has to enquire, however, how effective 
those international days are and whether they have a powerful societal resonance in those 
States and societies that celebrate such commemorative days.

<p>36. The trend of memorialization has influenced judicial processes, especially in Latin 
America, with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordering the construction of 
public memorials for past crimes in several judgments. 
</p><p>37. In its ruling on a monument dedicated to the victims of the Peruvian civil war, the 
Court stipulated that Peru &#8220;must guarantee, within a one-year period, that all persons 
declared as deceased in the present Judgment are represented in the monument called The 
Eye that Cries&#8221;.17 Similarly, the verdict of the Court on the killing of 19 traders in 
Colombia stated the need for the State to proceed with the construction of a memorial.18 In 
its judgment on the Rio Negro massacre in Guatemala, the Court requested the 
establishment of a museum to honour the victims of the internal armed conflict. 19  
</p>
<p>38. Thus, courts may also see their role as memorial facilitators and national authorities 
may see their approach contested by new actors actively engaged in shaping the memorial 
landscape. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Recommendations of truth and reconciliation commissions 
</b></p>
<p>39. An exhaustive list of all truth and reconciliation commissions that have advocated 
the construction of memorials is beyond the scope of this document. Nevertheless, one 
should mention the recommendations of the truth and reconciliation commissions in El 
Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Peru, Morocco and South Africa and the commission of 
inquiry in Chad, even though not all their recommendations were implemented. 
</p>
<p>40. The Commission on the Truth for El Salvador clearly called in its report for the 
construction of a national monument in El Salvador bearing the names of all victims of the 
conflict, recognition of their good name and the serious crimes of which they were the 
victims and the institution of a national holiday in memory of the victims of conflict as a 
symbol of reconciliation (S/25500, p. 186). 
</p><p>41. Similarly, the Commission for Historical Clarification in Guatemala recommended, 
among other things, that monuments and parks be constructed and the names of victims 
assigned to public buildings and highways in memory of the victims.20 The Commission 
stated that &#8220;the historical memory, both individual and collective, forms the basis of 
national identity. Remembrance of the victims is a fundamental aspect of this historical 
memory and permits the recovery of the values of, and the validity of the struggle for, 
human dignity.&#8221; Specific attention was drawn to the need to take into consideration the 
multicultural nature of the Guatemalan nation and to promote and authorize the raising of 
monuments and the creation of communal cemeteries in accordance with the forms of 
Mayan collective memory.

<p>42. Departing from the norm of physical monuments, some commissions have 
sponsored artistic events. For example, the commissions in Peru and Timor-Leste organized 
photo and poster exhibitions.21 
</p>
<p>43. Many commissions have recommended transforming places of detention into places 
of memory or, alternatively, called for the construction of memorials. However, national 
authorities have not always complied with such recommendations. For example, one of the 
first commissions of inquiry in Africa, in Chad from 1990 to 1992, called for the building 
of a memorial to the victims of repression under Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233; and required that the 
second Sunday of December be declared a day of prayer and contemplation for those 
victims. It also recommended that the former headquarters of the <i>Direction de la 
Documentation et de la S&#233;curit&#233;</i> (the political police) be transformed by making the 
underground prison into a museum to remember the dark reign.22 In Morocco, the Equity 
and Reconciliation Commission in its final report recommended the transformation of the 
old centres of illegal confinement or detention into productive projects, able to preserve 
memory.23  
</p>
<p>44. Recommendations by truth and reconciliation commissions are important 
landmarks, helping civil society organizations to keep memorial issues on the agenda. 
Those recommendations often limit the choice of action by a Government, which might 
otherwise be tempted to destroy places of suffering and, in doing so, erase the memories 
attached to it. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The cultural rights angle  
</b></p>
<p>45. Civil and political rights are the human rights mostly referred to in the development 
of transitional justice policies and memorialization processes. This may be due to the fact 
that the violations mostly invoked through memorial practices relate to the right to life, 
physical integrity and liberty. Memorialization processes also involve exercising the rights 
to freedom of opinion and expression, religion and belief, peaceful assembly and 
association (articles 18 to 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). 
</p><p>46. Such a distinction between categories of rights is always misleading, however. 
Gross violations of human rights during conflicts include violations of economic, social and 
cultural rights. The particular targeting of schools, cultural institutions, cultural symbols 
and cultural heritage during wartime is to be recalled. Moreover, insofar as the broader and 
cultural norms also play a role in enabling systematic violations of human rights, their role 
must also be addressed.24 
</p>
<p>47. Actions in the field of culture have an unparalleled potential to contribute 
significantly to transitional processes precisely by enabling spaces where identities can be 
tried out, including the identity of a rights claimant.25 Cultural interventions help to make 
the victims visible by providing safe spaces for articulating their experiences.26 Memories 
are subjective processes anchored in experiences and the material and symbolic markers of

<p>specific cultural interpretative frameworks.27 Hence, actions in the cultural sphere facilitate 
cultural interaction and understanding and can help design new cultural landscapes, 
encompassing and reflective of the plurality of culturally diverse perspectives. 
</p>
<p>48. Transitional justice strategies and reconciliation policies in divided societies should 
therefore not ignore cultural rights, as enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. All persons have the right to access, participate 
in, enjoy and contribute to culture, and in particular cultural heritage, which encompasses 
both history and memory (see A/HRC/17/38, paras. 5 and 8). Artists should be able to 
articulate their voices; the right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity must be 
fully respected and protected (see A/HRC/23/34). More widely, cultural rights call for the 
implementation of policies promoting cultural interaction and understanding between 
people and communities, the sharing of perspectives about the past and the design of a 
cultural landscape that is reflective of cultural diversity. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Memorialization practices: specific challenges 
</b></p>
<p>49. Governments play a key role in framing the perception of the past. Unfortunately, 
too frequently they initiate top-down projects resulting in the imposition of unilateral or 
partial visions of history.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Victims, perpetrators and heroes 
</b></p>
<p>50. Following conflict, the definition of victims and perpetrators is a major political and 
symbolic issue. Because memorialization is the site of conflicting narratives, it is important 
to guard against black and white definitions of victims and perpetrators. There are often 
dissenting voices within groups of victims, especially when groups of victims also killed 
each other. In addition, perpetrators tend to be somewhat invisible or at least minimally 
defined on many sites.28 Moreover, when invited into the discussion, perpetrators too adopt 
the position of a victim.  
</p>
<p>51. The debate concerning The Eye that Cries monument in Lima, which lists the names 
of victims of the civil war, is emblematic. The question arose as to whether 41 jailed 
members of the Shining Path, considered by a significant part of the population to be 
terrorists, who were killed in the repression of a prison riot, could be classified as victims. 
The controversy was intense. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights considered that, 
in accordance with international human rights law, those killed extrajudicially, including 
criminals, should be considered victims. Ironically, the 41 names had already been included 
on the monument, but no one took any notice before the  ruling of the Court. Sharply 
polarized opinions regarding whose names should be included halted the completion of the 
monument. 
</p>
<p>52. Some memorialization processes do promote a plurality of narratives within the 
same monument or history museum. For instance, the Museum of Medellin in Colombia, 
which is nearing completion, aims to present a history of massive violations of human 
rights, regardless of which groups perpetrators belonged to: guerrillas, paramilitaries, drug 
traffickers or the army.

</p>
<p>28
 Bickford,&#8220;Memoryworks/memory works&#8221;. </p>


<p>53. Memorialization processes that only identify one group as victims while obliterating 
serious crimes committed against other parties in the conflict are of concern. When, for 
example, after a civil war memorials are erected that are devoted to the victims of one 
ethnic group without consideration for others, this may heighten sectarian tensions, fuel an 
&#8220;ethnicization&#8221; of the victims and lead to further violence. In the most acute cases, when 
memorials bear symbols exclusively associated with one community, be it ethnic, religious, 
linguistic or political, they delimit communities, drawing boundaries between people, 
including by marking territorial borders within and between States. Such delimitations 
impact the freedom of movement of people who may feel uncomfortable in a specific 
cultural and symbolic landscape. Consequently, memorials can contribute to continuing 
ethnic cleansing started during the war.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. Memorialization processes are emancipatory only when all sides, the political 
sequences and consequences of events are remembered and when the community and 
especially key stakeholders are able to have a voice in crafting the development of 
transitional justice strategies.29 It is crucial to open safe public spaces that allow the 
participation of all in the discussion and ensure the credibility of the process, as well as its 
ownership by people: in the end, it is the process itself, i.e. the conversation about the past, 
more than the end result, be it a monument or a performance, that is most beneficial. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. One imperative is to avoid a flattening of all situations, which is conducive to 
denying past wrongs. There are often various circles of victims and there is not necessarily 
a moral and political equivalence between the conflicting parties.30 Moreover, one cannot 
always insert the viewpoint of the perpetrators within the  narratives of the victims. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>56. Tragedies also produce heroic figures who become subjects of memorialization. In 
the 1950s, the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel was the first dedicated space recognizing 
people who risked their own life to save people from persecution. Thereafter, similar 
initiatives were undertaken in other countries (Armenia, Burundi, Rwanda and the former 
Yugoslavia). In relation to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, shedding light on such 
people and their actions operates a shift in the memorialization process, helping to counter 
the belief that people&#8217;s actions are predetermined by national or ethnic affiliations: 
communities are never the monoliths the conflict tries to establish. Solidarity, not only 
violence, occurs during war. Such recognition carries moral and educational meaning, 
demonstrating that, despite risks, choice, disobedience and resistance are possible paths.31  
</p>
<p><b> B. The issue of temporality 
</b></p>
<p>57. When should memorialization processes start and for how long should they 
continue? Memorialization may seem to start too soon, just after or even during a conflict, 
not allowing the process of reflection to come to maturity, but the absence of 
memorialization may be a cause of further suffering for victims and their families. In any 
event, when State authorities are unwilling to initiate memorialization processes, such 
processes do nonetheless commence, initiated by civil society or victims, but also by 
conflicting parties. State authorities, therefore, have no choice but to step in. <b>

<p>58. In numerous instances, new inscriptions keep being added to the same memorial, 
interposing layers of stories and complexity. 
</p>
<p><b> C. &#8220;Illegal&#8221; memorials 
</b></p>
<p>59. Various groups, including families of victims, often create their own memorials, 
especially in the absence of initiatives by State authorities. Quicker to establish their 
memorials, these groups may act outside the law. In response, other communities may then 
create alternative memorials with other narratives. For example, communities in Northern 
Ireland use murals to express divergent perspectives of the Troubles. Such situations can be 
seen as fuelling tensions between communities, or as the medium for people to express their 
voices through non-violent means, raising the question of how this can be regulated. 
</p>
<p>60. In some instances, unauthorized monuments are tolerated by the authorities and 
society, either because the initiative is seen as a positive step or because removing a 
memorial may exacerbate tensions between communities. The risk is that such memorials 
may become cultural and political symbols that, rather than help reconciliation, intensify 
divisions which are sometimes imposed on local inhabitants in their own neighbourhoods, 
including inside or in front of schools. Furthermore, such processes tend to use symbols and 
memory to depict or refer to communities as monoliths.32 
</p>
<p><b> D. Monuments and sites of past oppressive regimes 
</b></p>
<p>61. Authoritarian and totalitarian regimes control memory not only for propaganda 
purposes but also as a tool to homogenize society in all aspects of life: this provides a 
strong argument for considering people&#8217;s access to a pluralistic memory as a human right. 
</p>
<p>62. The question is how to manage an architectural legacy with strong symbolic 
connotations when oppressive regimes collapse. Should a new democratic Government 
destroy, conserve or transform these legacies? Answers vary from situation to situation, 
frequently giving rise to intense controversy, including amongst victims. Striking examples 
include debates in Spain over the memorial in <i>Valle de los caidos</i> (the Valley of the Fallen) 
where Franco is buried, in Bulgaria over the mausoleum of former communist leader 
Georgy Dimitrov, which was finally destroyed, and in Germany over Hitler&#8217;s bunker, now 
located beneath a parking lot in the centre of Berlin, marked only by a small sign. 
</p>
<p>63. The choice to conserve, transform or destroy always carries meaning and so needs to 
be discussed, framed and interpreted. For example, the destruction and transformation of 
such monuments may be interpreted as a willingness to erase one part of history or a 
specific narrative.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Promoting critical thinking and civic engagement 
</b></p>
<p>64. As part of the symbolic-cultural landscape, memorials impact on people&#8217;s 
perspectives and understanding of past events but equally of contemporary issues. Hence, 
they must be critically assessed. This is particularly important when people, including 
children, live under the shadow of numerous, repetitive images and symbols, such as 
murals and statues. Developing partnerships with artists may be particularly beneficial, as 
</p>

Margriet van der Waal, eds. (Groningen, Netherlands, University of Groningen, 2011), p. 307. </p>


<p>artists are often able to introduce elements that spark discussions; educators are also key 
stakeholders. Positive processes of memorialization encourage critical thinking around 
history and in a variety of contexts, memorials can use creative ways to catalyse this civic 
engagement by opening new opportunities for dialogue about threats to human rights and 
what people can do to address them.33 
</p>
<p>65. In several countries, secret places of torture have been converted into public places 
embodying the aspirations for justice and democracy that provide people with opportunities 
to exercise their own critical thinking and revisit the accepted interpretation of the past. For 
example, in Italy, the Monte Sole Peace School was built on the site where SS troops killed 
770 civilians. The school invites young people from conflict-affected societies to gather and 
reflect on the past in order to prevent further atrocities.34 The role of the State is to ensure 
that sites of atrocities become sites of knowledge; too often, however, such sites are closed 
to the public, or destroyed along with the evidence documenting the atrocities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. The role of artists 
</b></p>
<p>66. The form of a monument is a crucial factor in determining its social impact and 
many artists have worked on the conjunction of aesthetics and ideology.35 Hence, artists, 
especially those commissioned to work on monuments, may be significant actors in 
memorialization processes. Their capacity to shed new light on the past and to enhance the 
ability of people to &#8220;imagine&#8221; the other enables artists to play a crucial role in 
memorialization processes.36 Focusing on &#8220;concrete others&#8221;, artistic expressions can make 
victims visible: &#8220;they can raise awareness of the depth, breadth and effects of rights 
violations in a way that other forms of communication can hardly aspire to, including not 
only cold statistical data but also official truth commission reports.&#8221;37  
</p>
<p>67. Involving artists offers opportunities to widen the debate regarding the meaning, and 
hence all other aspects, of a memorial. For example, the anti-monument movement was a 
radical attempt by some artists to deal with the issue of representing mass human right 
violations after 1945. Seeking a form opposed to the monumental architecture of the fascist 
regimes, one emblematic realization was the anti-fascist monument near Hamburg by 
Jochen and Esther Gerz. Built in 1986, this 12 metre-high column was designed to 
gradually sink into the ground as visitors signed their names or embellished it with graffiti. 
Finally buried in 1993, the column was intended to convey a simple message: only people &#8211; 
not memorials &#8211; can resist the resurgence of fascism. 
</p>
<p>68. Some artists find it difficult to engage in commissioned art for memorials because 
they seek to build memorials from the viewpoint of the subjugated, not those in power. 
Their dilemma is whether to negotiate with State authorities over the meaning and form of a 
specific memorial, or simply use public space to counter an official or dominant narrative. 
Today, many memorials draw on avant-garde notions of the role of art and the artist in

<p>challenging authority, such as the authority of official history.38 In doing so, they contribute 
greatly to the promotion of critical thinking and civic engagement. 
</p>
<p>69. Interesting experiences include those of artists questioning public calls for 
memorials on specific events and the ideologies these carry, thereby opening space for 
public debate and empowering victims. For example, the Monument Group, led by artist 
Milica Tomi&#263;, initiated a public discussion after the city of Belgrade launched a 
competition in 2002 for a memorial to the fallen fighters and victims of the 1990&#8211;1999 
wars in the territory of former Yugoslavia, which led to the City cancelling the competition. 
Continuing its discussions, the Group declared that each public event and discussion on 
past events was in itself a monument. Discussions involving artists, professional experts 
and students, but also victims and associations, succeeded in opening avenues for victims to 
express themselves and create their own performances and commemorations, for example 
in Omarska. Victims thus became the primary actors in constructing their own memorial.  
</p>
<p>70. Artists too have diverging perspectives of the past and may reinforce the dominance 
of one narrative, incessantly reiterated through theatre, poetry, film and painting. Such 
artistic creations can be used to support the belief systems of those who maintain the 
barriers of difference in societies emerging from conflict. This makes it vital for cultural 
workers to be engaged in critically analysing the information that exists and to develop 
meaningful collaborations and relationships with historians and academics so as to 
challenge and develop the story beyond the confines of a single narrative.  
</p>
<p>71. Interesting initiatives undertaken in this respect include, for example, a series of 
walks across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, involving 
meetings among artists, schools and community groups, culminating with the artists 
inviting the public to rewrite the narrative and re-present this as publications, performances 
or exhibitions. Attention is focused on memorial sites and cultural venues, with a view to 
reclaiming them for pedagogical purposes &#8211; in essence a critical pedagogy of memorial and 
remembrance. Another initative is a plan to produce a major new mural in Belfast to 
commemorate the First World War, with a view to opening a critical dialogue with the past 
that will challenge existing positions and narratives.  
</p>
<p>72. For such initiatives to emerge, the right of each person to the freedom of artistic 
expression and creativity must be respected and protected, in accordance with international 
standards (A/HRC/23/34). With regard to displaying artistic expressions in the public 
space, the State has a specific role in ensuring that space is made available for a plurality of 
narratives and multiplying opportunities for such narratives to engage with each other. 
Promoting the notion that the public sphere has to be inclusive, egalitarian and guided by 
issues that revolve around the common good, rather than the promotion of particular 
interests, helps to identify the conditions necessary to ensure that a democratic debate takes 
place amongst citizens.39 
</p>
<p>73. While the commissioning of a monument implies a dialogue between politicians and 
artists, it is important to widen such a debate to include the communities concerned and 
society at large, including those living near monuments and memorials. The message 
conveyed by the artist should also be explained and introduced to the population.

<p><b> G. Museums of history/memory 
</b></p>
<p>74. As they are able to recreate displays and exhibits from a collection of items that can 
be reinterpreted, museums of history/memory have greater flexibility for addressing the 
complexities of narratives and for integrating various perspectives.  
</p>
<p>75. Museum collections are the result of selections. As most museums are perceived to 
speak with an authoritative voice, they too may be used to promote political agendas or to 
defend community interests through the presentation of a particular narrative. A positive 
development is that more exhibitions today are authored and personalized, stressing that the 
curator&#8217;s narrative is a viewpoint rather than an objective truth. Museums and curators may 
face particular difficulties when they are subject to political control and financial pressure 
and it is crucial to ensure their independence within the framework of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, as set out in articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>76. The manner in which museums refer to the past varies significantly. While history 
museums are expected to address the past, following the deontology of their academic 
discipline, putting events and people into a wider perspective and context, memory 
museums are expected to focus on celebrating events and paying tribute to people, 
including victims. No clear-cut distinction seems possible however, and history/memory 
museums and memorials have become more and more intertwined. One trend is to create 
museums and documentation centres near memorials to provide additional information on 
the context and/or more space for victims to express their own perspective or exhibit 
specific (personal) items. All such initiatives usefully contribute to providing a plurality of 
complementary viewpoints on the past. 
</p>
<p>77. Some curators see their work as curating stories for the people themselves 
concerned, who participate in the design of exhibitions. Allowing those concerned to 
participate in historical research and writing is to be welcomed and promoted. The 
collection by peace museums of testimonies and items from people who felt uncomfortable 
testifying before a truth and reconciliation commission is one example of how museums 
can facilitate the emergence of additional stories.  
</p>
<p>78. One difficulty is when museums emphasize trauma as a perspective on world events, 
resorting to personalization, psychologizing and emotion. The haze of emotionality through 
which individual stories are filtered makes it difficult to understand the larger political 
context.  
</p>
<p>79. A specific issue needing attention is when, to evoke deeper emotions, the 
authenticity of exhibits has been jeopardized. For example, in one case, it has been reported 
that a false floor was fabricated underneath hundreds of victims&#8217; shoes to leave a greater 
impression. For its part, the authenticity of the famous door of no return of Gor&#233;e Island, 
Senegal, presented as the door through which slaves would walk to be boarded on ships, is 
disputed by historians.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Managing the remains 
</b></p>
<p>80. After the killing of more than 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica in July 1995, the 
international community made a major effort to develop techniques of DNA identification 
of bodies. Today, the remains of more than 70 per cent of the thousands missing in the wars 
of the former Yugoslavia have been identified and returned to their families. However, in 
many countries, where a large number of people have died in wars or internal conflicts, 
sometimes decades ago, applying such cutting edge techniques is financially or otherwise 
unfeasible. Consequently the default policy has been to do nothing. </p>


<p>81. The issue cannot always be ignored, however, as mass graves continue to be found, 
for example when constructing new roads or buildings. Authorities are torn between the 
imperative of development and the building of a memorial, the respect due to the dead, the 
obligation to treat the place as a crime scene and the need to search for the perpetrators (or 
the fear of seeing them publicly identified should they hold public office). In some 
instances, the families of missing people themselves reject proposals for the construction of 
memorials, fearing that this may serve as an excuse not to open the mass graves. Adamantly 
opposed to their demands for exhumation being buried beneath some symbolic concrete, 
they consistently demand the physical return of the remains of their loved ones.  
</p>
<p>82. Ethical issues also arise when remains are exhibited in museums. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Memorialization of slave trades 
</b></p>
<p>83. One of the most important and sensitive examples of memorialization concerns the 
centuries-long African slave trade.  
</p>
<p>84. Most societies, especially in Western countries, have started to grasp the magnitude 
of the tragedy of the transatlantic slave trade, in which they had the main share of 
responsibility. Of note are the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool, United Kingdom 
and in France, the <i>M&#233;morial pour l&#8217;abolition de l&#8217;esclavage</i> in Nantes and the Sch&#339;lcher 
Museum in Guadeloupe, in addition to a number of museums in the United States of 
America. Many historians have been researching this topic and in the last 30 years it has 
become embodied in different memorials, in particular along the coastline of West Africa, 
such as the one on Gor&#233;e Island.  
</p>
<p>85. At the same time, it seems that there is no monument in Africa recalling the fate of 
the captives enslaved for the intra-Africa slave trade, or the trans-Saharan and eastern slave 
routes. Some African historians have denounced this reading of events, where the logic of 
victimhood absolves local actors and ignores the mechanisms of domination, power and 
exploitation within African societies.40 
</p>
<p><b> J. Memorializing the histories of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>86. Indigenous peoples are amongst those engaging their respective Governments to 
establish memorials of past genocides and/or to acknowledge their histories and 
contributions to societies. 
</p>
<p>87. Some countries have adopted positive steps. Memorials have been established in 
recognition of the contributions of ancestors, or the ancestors of part of the population, 
which suffered greatly, for example in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 
(A/HRC/23/34/Add.2, para. 29).  
</p><p>88. Many museums, in particular history museums, recall the culture, past suffering and 
continuing presence of indigenous peoples. This is the case of the Museum of New Zealand 
Te Papa Tongarewa, where curators consciously seek to be facilitators of memory rather 
than repositories of memorabilia, allowing memorialization processes to take place, 
including through cultural expressions and spiritual rituals. This presents its own

<p>challenges, since communities themselves are never monoliths. It is therefore essential to 
diversify the platforms and spaces for the many voices of history to be heard.  
</p>
<p>89. Recognition through memorials of the participation of indigenous soldiers during the 
two World Wars continues to be debated, especially in North America. In Canada, a 
memorial to indigenous veterans from the First World War was built at the request of 
indigenous peoples, integrating many elements of indigenous cultures. This recognition 
took place at a later stage in history, however, and in a different venue to the main 
memorial established for other Canadian soldiers. Commemoration projects are also taking 
place in Canada regarding the history of Indian residential schools. 
</p>
<p><b> K. The role of external actors  
</b></p>
<p>90. External actors can play an important role in memorialization. Most often, 
interventions stimulate memorial initiatives, seeking to bring about social changes through 
a deliberate strategy of utilizing and funding memorials, in particular when the State 
concerned lacks either the political will or financial power to do so. For instance, the 
Srebrenica-Potocari Memorial was financed through private and governmental funds, 
including from the United States of America. In the Middle East, the initiators of the art 
gallery, Um-el-Fahm, who want to convert this space into the first Palestinian museum in 
Israel, partly depend on donors in Europe and the United States. On a visit to Peru in 2008, 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered $2 million for a museum of memory there.  
</p><p>91. The role of external actors in shaping memorial landscape has been transformed by 
the use of information technology. The Internet has led to the internationalization of 
memory processes, an evolution epitomized by the memorialization of the Gulag.41  
</p>
<p>92. These examples demonstrate the proliferation of memorial entrepreneurs. The 
previous system of State-sanctioned, top-down memorials now competes with non-State 
local and international initiatives. This internationalization of the memory process can lead 
to very different results, ranging from a vision of history imported, or even imposed, by 
powerful outside actors, to initiatives which truly help marginalized groups to articulate 
their history. 
</p>
<p><b> L. The recipients of memorial initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>93. New forms of tourism have developed in places of suffering and a large number of 
tourists visit, for example, the concentration and extermination camps in Germany and 
Poland, places directly related to atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, 
Gor&#233;e Island in Senegal, Robben Island in South Africa, the International Red Cross and 
Red Crescent Museum in Switzerland and the National September 11 Memorial in the 
United States. 
</p>
<p>94. Visits to these sites of conscience and memorials raise several questions. Who are 
they intended for? For students? For victims and their family? For society at large? For 
tourists? Usually, they are directed at the widest audience possible, with certain groups 
accorded priority: the victims and their families, the communities directly affected and 
youth.  
</p>
<p>95. The key issue is the ownership of the memorial and/or the museum by the 
communities concerned, including especially those in which they are located. The South

<p>African Truth and Reconciliation Commission rightly stressed that the victims and society 
are not only recipients but also active agents in the process of memorialization: &#8220;Symbolic 
reparations such as monuments and museums are important, but should ideally be linked 
with endeavours that improve the everyday lives of the victims and their communities. One 
way of combining the two aims is to involve victims prominent in the design and/or 
manufacture of monuments&#8230;&#8221;.42 
</p>
<p>96. The decision-making process is as important as the memorial itself. The 
memorialization process, even before the concrete realization of the work, is a decisive step 
in generating a feeling of community ownership. The Museum of Memory in Rosario, 
Argentina, is a positive example of how to include different groups and keep the museum 
relevant through time.43 The museum includes an archive centre and a library that connects 
the site and people with the local memory of repression and with a broader reading of the 
crimes of States. According to the director, the goal of the museum is to &#8220;create historical 
consciousness&#8221;, which also allows for the evolution of the themes of the museum towards 
contemporary concerns regarding respect for human rights. Similarly, soon to be opened is 
the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
</p>
<p>97. Of crucial importance is empowering victims. This means promoting their 
recognition not only as victims but as full actors of their rehabilitation and important 
contributors to wider societal actions to overcome the tragedies of past events. All too 
frequently, once their testimonies have been gathered, victims receive no feedback on 
decisions taken and are left within their victim status, rather than being empowered through 
actively participating in establishing the memorial. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>98. <b>Victims of tragic events or mass or grave violations of human rights often call 
for justice and for a form of memorialization: both are necessary and complementary, 
one cannot replace the other. However, while the legal aspect of reparations has 
attracted considerable interest, memorialization is rarely integrated into broader 
strategies for building democracy and post-conflict transitional strategies.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Memorial dynamics are always political processes. Memorializing the past 
evolves within particular political, social and cultural contexts and is modulated by 
different political forces, the weight of lobbies, the evolving concerns of society and the 
interests of key stakeholders. Some monuments are met with indifference, others 
become places of crystallized emotions and tension and some are removed as a 
tangible sign of a new era. The principle questions to be asked and debated in the 
public sphere each time are: what are the specific intended goals of the memorial? 
Who is it made for? What will be its likely sociopolitical impact? Who participates in 
its establishment, including in the design, execution and stewardship? Does it include 
plurality of narratives? 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>An essential element for successful memorialization is collaboration between 
the authorities, citizens and civil society, especially representatives of those directly 
affected by past events. Authorities have a key role to play: they have the 
responsibility of managing the public space and the capacity to maintain monuments

<p><b>and museums and develop national strategies across a territory and over the long 
term, taking into consideration a wide array of narratives. Civil society has the 
capacity to mobilize groups of population, grant popular legitimacy, organize events 
and generate public debates.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The complementarity of the various actors is often difficult to put into practice, 
however. The authorities may be tempted to obtain short-term political gains by 
building monuments that will have little discursive impact for society as a whole, but 
will &#8220;close the book&#8221; &#8211; or so it is hoped. Victims and memorial entrepreneurs from 
civil society may disagree among themselves as to who and what to commemorate. 
The dangers are manifold, but the synergy between different actors is essential for 
fostering a broad debate on the representation of the past and related democratic 
issues and crucial for effective long-term reconciliation. Memorialization as a 
contribution to guarantees of non-recurrence demands that the past inform the 
present and facilitate the understanding of contemporary issues relating to 
democracy, human rights and equality. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Memorial practices concerning mass crimes involve a complex equilibrium 
between the personal emotions arising from evocations of the past and a removed 
historical narrative that can potentially enable reflection about resistance and civil 
disobedience. However difficult, the cohabitation between the emotional dimension 
and a distanced analysis is indispensable. Without emotional charge, the account of 
tragic events has little impact; without perspective, the risk is great of cultivating a 
victimized memory that loses sight of the need to prevent further violence. To reach 
such equilibrium, memorial practices, while giving space to the emotional dimension, 
must be informed and framed by rigorous historical research and study. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States and other stakeholders 
support victims and families of victims of mass or grave human rights violations, or 
traumatic events, seeking to commemorate the past. Memorialization should be 
understood as processes that provide the necessary space for those affected to 
articulate their diverse narratives in culturally meaningful ways. Such processes 
encompass a variety of engagements which do not necessarily become concretized 
through the erection of physical monuments, but can also take the form of numerous 
activities and cultural expressions.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Goals assigned to memorials should be debated and decided upon on a case-by-
case basis. States and other stakeholders should refrain from using memorialization 
processes to further their own political agendas and ensure that memorial policies 
contribute to, in particular:  
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> Overcoming denials that fuel hatred, resentment and violence; 
 </b>(b)<b> Providing symbolic reparation and public recognition to the victims in 
ways that respond to the needs of all victims oppressed in a recent or distant past and 
contribute to their healing; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> The development of reconciliation policies between groups that were 
opposed during conflicts, through a process of official and public recognition of 
crimes committed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> A policy of prevention through pedagogical action and cultural 
interventions to reduce the risk of further violence between groups opposed in the 
past; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e</b>)<b> Redefining national identity by a policy of pluralism that acknowledges 
different communities and recognizes the crimes committed by all parties; </b></p>


<p><b> </b>(f)<b> Promoting civic engagement, critical thinking and stimulating 
discussions on the representation of the past, as well as contemporary challenges of 
exclusion and violence. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>In this endeavour, States and other stakeholders should be cautious of 
watertight definitions between victims and perpetrators and ensure sufficient space 
for various narratives and perspectives to be expressed. However, they should neither 
engage in nor support policies of denial that prevent the construction of memorials or 
memorialization processes, nor should they build, support or finance works that may 
incite violence.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>States and relevant stakeholders should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> Implement the memorial recommendations made by truth and 
reconciliation commissions, in accordance with international standards, 
provide technical expertise to national authorities when needed and include 
interested groups in discussions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> Ensure the transparency of memorialization processes and 
promote civil society participation at all stages, including in the decision-
making process leading to the memorials. Memorialization processes should 
be centred on the victims and designed to empower them; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> Promote critical thinking on past events by ensuring that 
memorialization processes are complemented by measures fostering 
historical awareness and support the implementation and outreach of high-
quality research projects, cultural interventions that encourage people&#8217;s 
direct engagement and educational initiatives;  
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> Respect the freedom of opinion and expression of curators and 
refrain from imposing political control and putting financial pressure on 
them; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(e)<b> Respect the right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity in 
addressing memorialization issues and collaborate with artists. States should 
ensure the availability of public spaces for a diversity of narratives conveyed 
in artistic expressions and multiply opportunities for such narratives to 
engage with each other; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(f)<b> Encourage the memorialization of those who refused to participate 
in mass or grave violations of human rights, resisted oppression and helped 
each other across community divides; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(g)<b> Take into consideration the cultural dimension of memorial 
processes, including when repression has targeted indigenous peoples; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(h)<b> Address the need for memorialization for the victims of slavery, 
especially in places where they were taken captive and in places of 
destination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(i)<b> Carefully weigh interventions by external actors to avoid the 
imposition of an external memory, while encouraging carefully planned 
interventions that can help groups emerge from vulnerability and 
acknowledge the wrongs of the past; 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(j)<b> Map the country&#8217;s memorial landscape, adopting a collaborative 
approach with civil society, critically assess how past events and past 
oppressive regimes are remembered, inform the public about the symbolic </b></p>


<p><b>places built by regimes responsible for serious human rights abuses and 
engage people, in particular youth, in constructing new narratives of peace;  
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(k)<b> Judiciously consider the cultural and symbolic landscape being 
built or reconstructed following conflict, to ensure that it is reflective of the 
various aspirations and perspectives of people and enables critical thinking, 
historical awareness and mutual understanding between communities.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States adopt legislation setting out 
guidelines regarding memorialization processes, in accordance with international 
standards and taking into consideration the conclusion and recommendations above. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>States and other stakeholders should provide information to relevant 
mechanisms, including the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of 
non-recurrence, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and its consequences, as well as 
treaty bodies, about the challenges and steps achieved through memorialization 
practices.

<p>109. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that a compendium be prepared on 
good memorialization practices, highlighting difficulties encountered and results 
achieved.  </b></p>
