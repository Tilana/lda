The Law and the Analysis of the Evidence

The prosecution in this case needed to prove the following elements of indecent assault laid against the accused:

(a) Sakaraia Raiqavi, (the person in the charge and appearing in court  identification)

(b) assaulted, M R (the complainant), and

(c)the assault was unlawful and indecent, that is morally offensive.

The Court in this case notes the ruling of the Supreme Court in Eliki Mototabua v- The State, Criminal Appeal No. CAV0004 of 2005S (Date of Judgment 29th February 2008) where Mason, Handley and Weinberg JJ stated (In paragraph 39):

" & First, it has never been the law that actual corroboration is required in cases involving sexual offence. There was only a requirement, at common law, that a warning be given of the dangers of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of complainant. Second, it has been held by the Court of Appeal that that rule of practice no longer exists in Fiji: See Sereima Balelala v- The State at p.19."

This Court takes notes of and heed of the comments by the Supreme Court Justices. 

Identification 

One of the elements that the prosecution needed to prove in order to prove its case was the identity of the accused. The identity of the accused is established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The victim correctly identified the accused in court as the one whom she alleged indecently assaulted her near the creek.

Analysis of Evidence

The evidence of the victim, who was 9 years old at the time of the alleged incident, is that the accused called her when she came to wash hands at the creek on 26th October 2007. She was with other girls who returned and she was alone. The accused asked her to take out her panty. He asked her to lie down on the ground and when she did not lie down the accused forcefully laid her on the ground and started to play with her vagina. The accused was feeling his penis and playing with her vagina. 

The statement of Sereana Tagive, a school teacher was tendered by consent of the prosecution and the defence counsel. The statement was given to police by Ms Tagive on 13th March 2008. The statement evidence is as follows: "She (meaning the victim) said that she had c[o]me from Naimasimasi village with her grandmother on Friday evening 26/10/07 and in the dark, her grandmother asked her to get water from a tank beside another house. She said she was returning when Mana pulled her to a nearby bush and removed her panty and tried to insert his penis into her vagina and later let her go. The second time was on the following morning she was sent to fetch for dried coconuts. While she was at the bush collecting coconuts, she met Mana again and Mana did the same thing to her. These were the two incidents that M R told me. She is a very slow student and I knew that this might be why she did not tell me the incident by the river. On that day I was questioning her&"

The other statement that was tendered was tendered by consent of the prosecution and the defence counsel was the statement of Salote Waqabaca, the grandmother of the victim. Ms Waqabacas statement was as follows: "on Monday 29th November 2007 at about 6pm I was at home and realized that my granddaughter still hasnt arrived at home. Then I went to the main road and I was on my way to school when I met the Head Master of Tai District School namely, Master Atu then he asked me if I knew anything happened to Marica but I told him no, then he informed me to see Mrs Sereana (MRs teacher). I went up to Sereanas house and she asked me if I knew anything that happened to Marica on Friday 26/10/07 then I told her no." This statement was given by Ms Waqabaca on 1st October 2007. 

The Court notes that in Cross Examination the victims responses were as follows:

Q: After that bad thing happened at 3.30pm on 26th October 2007. Did you tell anyone on that day?
A: I told my teacher.

Q: Did you tell your grandmother?
A: yes.

Q: on the same day?
A: yes in the afternoon.

Q: There were 5 other children with you?
A: yes.

Q: Sure told grandmother?
A: yes.

Firstly, the statements of the two prosecution witnesses (Ms Waqabaca and Ms Tagive) do not support the evidence of the victim. The victim did not give any evidence of the two incidents related to by the school teacher. In fact the Court notes that the School Teacher is also talking of an incident on 26th October 2007 at night but it is not related to what the victim is saying. Secondly, the victim in cross examination maintained that she told her teacher and grandmother about the incidents at the creek. In fact the statements by the two do not support her version. The victims grandmother came to know of the incidents from the teacher. The victims teacher states in her statement that the "victim is a slow student and I knew this might be why she did not tell me the incident by the river." From this statement the Court can deduce that the Teacher herself came to know of the incident of by the river/creek from someone else and not from the victim as the victim has told the court in her evidence. These contradictions do not support the prosecution case. 

The victim is 9 years old and her teacher cites her to be a slow learner. The Court in its own assessment found the victim to be competent witness. The victim knew the importance of telling the truth and the reason and importance of taking oath. The victim gave sworn evidence. The Court acknowledges the need to protect our children who are vulnerable and tender. However the court is governed by law, practice and procedures and it can only rule on the evidence that comes before it. It cannot take extraneous issues or fill in the evidence. The evidence from the prosecution case has left doubts in the Courts mind and the evidence is not as strong against the accused as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence of course it is possible but not in the least probable. A number of contradictions are in the way of the prosecution case. The case against the accused is not proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The accused is acquitted of the offence he is charged with. 

28 days to appeal.
