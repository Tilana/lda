8.      
Tariff for the offence of theft was discussed in State vs Chaudhry HAC 69 of 2007 as 2 to 12 months imprisonment.

9.      
State Counsel draws the attention of section 10 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and moves the Court to declare the Accused as a habitual offender.

10.     
Section 10 of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree states as follows:

"This Part applies to a court when sentencing a person determined under section 11 to be a habitual offender for  

(a) a sexual offence;

(b) offences involving violence;

(c) offences involving robbery or housebreaking;

It will be appropriate to consider the record of previous convictions of the Accused. CRO F/98541 dated 5/9/2010 reproduced for easy reference.

12.     
Considering offences committed after 18/01/2002 it appears that the Accused had committed 12 offences out of which 7 offences comes under section 10 (c) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

13.     
Section 11 (1) of the said decree states as follows:

"A judge may determine that an offender is a habitual offender for the purposes of this Part 

(a) when sentencing the offender for an offence or offences of the nature described in section 10; 

(b) having regard to the offender's previous convictions for offences of a like nature committed inside or outside Fiji; and

(c) if the court is satisfied that the offender constitutes a threat to the community."

14. Considering the above section I am convinced that the Accused constitute a theft to the community therefore I declare the Accused as a habitual offender.

15.     
Since the Accused is declared as a habitual offender I consider section 12 of the said decree.

"Where any court is proposing to impose a sentence of imprisonment on a person who has been determined to be a habitual offender under section 11 for an offence of a nature stated in section 10, the court, in determining the length of the sentence  

(a)     
shall regard the protection of the community from the offender as the principal purpose for which the sentence is imposed; and 

(b)     
may, in order to achieve that purpose, impose a sentence longer than that which is proportionate to the gravity of the offence".

16.     
Considering the protection of the community from the Accused I commence the sentence at 14 years imprisonment.

17.     
Now I consider the aggravating factors.

(i)     
You impersonated as a law enforcement officer namely as a police officer.

(ii)    
The robbery was committed in the broad day light.

(iii)   
You had invaded a factory.

(iv)    
You have stolen a mobile phone. For most of the business people mobile phone is an essential equipment. Further they have all their contacts and business details in the phone memory.

(v)     
You had no regards to others life and livelihood.

(vi)    
Robbery in a business place will not only affect the victim but the business at large which finally destroys the economy of the country.

Considering all above factors I increase 6 years of your sentence. Now your sentence is 20 years imprisonment.

18.     
Considering the mitigating circumstances.

(i)     
Your period spent in remand.

(ii)    
You are the sole breadwinner of your family.

(iii)   
Your wife and 2 children are depending on you.

(iv)    
You claim you came from unfortunate background where your parents were separated when you are 3 years.

(v)     
Your Counsel ask for a partial custodial sentence.

Considering all mitigating circumstances I reduce 6 years from your sentence. Now your sentence is 14 years imprisonment.

19.     
Considering the offence of theft I impose a sentence of 2 years imprisonment.

20.     
Since the offence of theft was committed in the same course of transaction I order to implement the sentence concurrent to the above sentence.

21.     
Section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree states as follows:

"Subject to sub-section (2), when a court sentences an offender to be imprisoned for life or for a term of 2 years or more the court must fix a period during which the offender is not eligible to be released on parole."

22. I act under section 18 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree and impose 11 years as non parole period.

23.     
Summary of your sentence is as follows:

1st Count 14 years imprisonment.
2nd Count 2 years imprisonment.
Both sentence to run concurrently with 11 years as non parole period.

24.     
You have 30 days to appeal.
