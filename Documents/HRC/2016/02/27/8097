<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth session from 
21 May to 4 June 2012.  The review of the Netherlands was held at the 15th meeting on 31 
May 2012. The delegation of the Netherlands was headed by Liesbeth Spies, Minister of 
Interior and Kingdom Relations. At its 18th meeting held on 4 June 2012, the Working 
Group adopted the report on the Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Netherlands: Benin, the Russian 
Federation and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1<b> </b>and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to Council resolution 16/21 of 25 March 2011, the following documents were 
issued for the review of the Netherlands: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/13/NLD/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/NLD/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/NLD/3 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Norway, the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland, Slovenia and Sweden was transmitted to the Netherlands 
through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Firstly, the national report of the Netherlands was introduced by the Minister of the 
Interior and Kingdom Relations of the Netherlands, Liesbeth Spies, who reported that it 
was the first time that all four countries of the Kingdom had been represented, namely 
Aruba, Cura&#231;ao, Sint Maarten and the Netherlands. Ms. Spies noted the great importance 
that the Netherlands attached to promoting, protecting and upholding human rights, as 
demonstrated by the Dutch candidature to the Human Rights Council for the 2015&#8211;2017 
term. She also highlighted the new developments since the last UPR, such as the 
establishment of the National Human Rights Institute in accordance with the principles 
relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights<b> </b>(Paris Principles) and the establishment, in 2011, of the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>6. Ms. Spies emphasized the important role that numerous organizations, beside the 
Government, Parliament and judiciary, played in supervising observance of human rights. 
The expertise of academics and representatives of human rights organizations was often 
requested in order to establish a constructive dialogue. UPR was a notable example of that 
dialogue. 
</p>
<p>7. In addition, Ms. Spies explained that, in April 2012, the Coalition Government of 
the Netherlands had resigned. Therefore, the current Government, although officially not in </p>


<p>function, would continue its work on the implementation of the main policy measures to 
endorse full respect of human rights, inter alia: guaranteeing the equality of every citizen, 
promoting integration, fighting domestic violence by punishing perpetrators and protecting 
victims, combating the trafficking of human beings, protecting refugees and asylum 
seekers, promoting social acceptance of LGBT people in society and human rights 
education in the Dutch school. 
</p>
<p>8. According to Ms. Spies, regularly policy measures or legislation did<b> </b>limit human 
rights, e.g. in the interest of public safety of for the prevention of disorder or crime. That 
was inevitable and sometimes even required by human rights in the case of positive 
obligations. In the view of the delegation, the need to strike a balance between different 
interests had sometimes been extensively debated in the Dutch political arena, as it had 
been in the context of privacy measures and draft legislation limiting privacy. The 
compatibility of that legislation with the human right standards was of outmost importance. 
It required a thorough scrutiny test, which was guaranteed by the Dutch professionals and 
institutions. Improvements in that regard had been made, especially in the starting phase of 
new draft legislation. It had been done in the field of privacy, where establishing privacy 
impact assessments describing the modalities for the planned processing of personal data 
was compulsory nowadays. 
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Spies also stressed that the Netherlands was strongly committed to the UPR 
process, having voluntarily submitted a mid-term review in 2010 and constructively 
contributing to UPR sessions of other Member States. She emphasized that the Netherlands 
would take the recommendations put forward during the second UPR cycle very seriously 
and ensure serious and transparent follow up to the recommendations and willingness to 
answer all questions. 
</p>
<p>10. Secondly, a representative from Aruba referred to the new Ordinance on 
Compulsory Education, which would guarantee access to the education system to all 
children, irrespective of their legal status, to illustrate that efforts had been made to 
harmonize legislation with the human rights instruments. Reference was also made to the 
new juvenile justice system in the new Criminal Code, which provided the court with a 
wider range of sanctions, including placement in a juvenile detention centre and training 
orders, to make the transition back into society as smooth as possible and offer them a 
better chance for the future. 
</p>
<p>11. Thirdly, a representative from Cura&#231;ao stated that the universal rights and 
fundamental freedoms are duly respected and protected in Cura&#231;ao. It mentioned that 
Cura&#231;ao would establish a human rights institute, spearheaded by the Treaty Section of the 
Directorate of Foreign Relations. Furthermore the representative stressed the political 
participation of women. 
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Spies thanked the delegations of Sweden, Slovenia and the United Kingdom for 
their advanced written questions. In relation to the questions related to the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), she proudly announced that the 
Government of the Netherlands was preparing for approval and the draft act for ratification 
would be submitted during the course of 2012. 
</p>
<p>13. Concerning the question related to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT), Ms. 
Spies explained that the Netherlands did not limit the scope of application to people 
deprived of liberty solely on the basis of criminal law; the ground of deprivation was 
irrelevant. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation noted that the Government of the Netherlands gave high priority to 
combating discrimination, and an anti-discrimination action plan had been sent to the 
House of Representatives in 2010 and in 2011. </p>


<p>15. In relation to identity theft and data protection, Ms. Spies stated that the Netherlands 
was currently working on a legislative proposal on data breach notification. The proposal 
would require those responsible for personal data to notify the data protection authorities in 
case of &#8220;leakage&#8221; of personal data with specific risks for privacy, including identity theft. 
The initiative was expected to be tabled in the second half of 2012. 
</p>
<p>16. Ms. Spies responded to the question on freedom of religion reporting that a bill on 
the ban of ritual slaughter had been initialized by the Parliament. That bill was still pending 
in Senate, and no majority was expected. Concerning the bill on face-covering garments, 
the Government was of the opinion that the bill would indeed limit the freedom of religion 
or belief; however, there were reasons for the bill in line with the limitation clauses of the 
freedom of religion or belief, which was not an absolute right. 
</p>
<p>17. In response to the remarks on the importance of facts and figures in the debate on 
migration, Ms. Spies referred to the so-called Dutch Migration Chart, containing factual 
analyses, useable in the public debate on migration. 
</p>
<p>18. The Minister informed that the Government of the Netherlands had recently made 
some progress on the issue of prostitution. Regulation and monitoring of that sector was 
reasonably successful. A law proposition was currently under way, with the primary goals 
being to reduce the local and regional disparities, get more insight into the escort sector and 
further facilitate regulation and monitoring. 
</p>
<p>19. Finally, concerning the question about the lessons learnt from the non-governmental 
organization (NGO) consultations in the process of the preparations for UPR, Ms. Spies 
emphasized the importance and relevance of the consultation process as such, and the 
relevance of being in dialogue. The Netherlands had learned about the concerns expressed 
by many NGOs regarding the human rights situation in the Netherlands, which had helped 
the Netherlands to get a better understanding of their concerns and the focus of the 
concerned NGOs. That had helped the Government in the drafting of its report. Ms. Spies 
expressed the hope that NGOs and institutions were also fed by the platform offered by the 
Netherlands and that she had the impression that was rightly the case. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, 49 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>21. Egypt<b> </b>noted the Dutch decision to establish a national human rights institution. It 
expressed concern about the legalization of prostitution, the existence of child sex tourism, 
rights of migrants and national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, racism and 
xenophobia from, among others, extreme political parties. It requested information on the 
promotion of tolerance and non-discrimination. Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Estonia congratulated the Netherlands on the inclusion of civil society and other 
stakeholders in the preparation of its UPR report. Estonia commended the creation of a 
Children&#8217;s Ombudsman, the country&#8217;s policies on LGBT rights, the protection of privacy 
and individual data and its role as a driver in the Internet freedom agenda. Estonia 
encouraged the Netherlands to continue its combat on incitement against minority groups. 
Estonia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. France<b> </b>welcomed the ratification by the Netherlands of the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances (CPED) and OP-CAT. It 
commended the establishment of a national human rights institution and the Children&#8217;s 
Ombudsman, requesting information on mechanisms envisaged to align the Dutch Antilles 
with these two initiatives. It noted concern over persistent discrimination of women, </p>


<p>particularly migrant women, and the propagation over Internet of racist and anti-Semitic 
views. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Germany commended the country&#8217;s implementation of a significant number of 
recommendations from the first UPR, its combat against human trafficking, particularly 
through the renewal of the mandate of the Task Force on Human Trafficking and approval 
of its 2011&#8211;2014 action plan. Germany welcomed the drafting of an action plan to combat 
child abuse. Germany asked about the parliamentary process to ratify CRPD, and when the 
National Institute for Human Rights would be operational.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>25. Greece noted with satisfaction the Dutch efforts to promote women&#8217;s rights but 
expressed concern that women still earned less than men and requested information on 
measures to combat that issue. Greece also requested information on the functioning of 
detention centres vis-&#224;-vis the treatment of migrants in line with the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Greece 
made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>26. Guatemala expressed concern about administrative and criminal measures used in 
the Netherlands that could place migrants in situations of vulnerability, such as limited 
access for undocumented migrants to basic services, and that illegal residence was 
described in the Penal Code as an offence, which penalized migrants seeking to improve 
their conditions of existence. Guatemala noted with interest the establishment of Municipal 
Anti-Discrimination Services requesting further information on the implementation, 
functioning and development of those services. Guatemala made a recommendation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>27. Poland congratulated the Netherlands on the significant developments achieved in 
its human rights infrastructure. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. India welcomed the country&#8217;s establishment of a national human rights institution 
(NHRI). India expressed concern about the increase in reports of racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and ethnic profiling and encouraged the Netherlands to intensify efforts to 
combat discrimination. India highlighted the Dutch efforts to address violence against 
women, and noted its position as premier donor State to OHCHR funds. India made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Indonesia congratulated the country&#8217;s establishment of a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. It welcomed the renewal of the Task 
Force on Human Trafficking mandate but expressed concern about the levels of 
discrimination and xenophobia in the Netherlands, particularly anti-Muslim speeches made 
by political and public figures and the media. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern on human rights violations, cited in 
the OHCHR report, by the Government of the Netherlands, particularly racial and religious 
discrimination, discrimination against Muslims, migrants, asylum seekers, people of 
African descent and other minority groups. The Islamic Republic of Iran made 
recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>31. Malaysia observed with concern the incidence of racist and xenophobic speeches, 
particularly against Muslims, made by the media, influential political and public figures, as 
well as racism directed at ethnic minorities during election campaigns. Malaysia asked if 
any measures had been taken to address this issue. It also referred with concern to 
observations of discrimination toward ethnic minorities made by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Malaysia made recommendations.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>32. Mexico noted with satisfaction measures taken by the Netherlands to guarantee the 
rights of asylum seekers, such as the replacement of the 48-hour accelerated procedure. 
Mexico welcomed the establishment of an NHRI in accordance with the Paris Principles, 
the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman and the introduction of Municipal Anti-Discrimination </p>


<p>Services, as well as the progress and good practice achieved in Aruba, Cura&#231;ao and Sint 
Maarten. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Morocco applauded the establishment of a national human rights institution, the 
Children&#8217;s Ombudsman and the Municipal Anti-Discrimination Services. It requested 
further information on particularly the impact of the &#8220;Eigen Kracht&#8221; programme, the 
success experience of Aruba in the combat against human trafficking and measures taken 
by the Netherlands to ensure the respect of privacy through the secure use of personal data. 
Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Mozambique commended the Netherlands on its many initiatives undertaken to 
promote human rights, particularly efforts to reduce human trafficking and the 
establishment of an NHRI in accordance with the Paris Principles. Mozambique welcomed 
the ratification of the CPED, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT) and Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC) and was encouraged by the announcement of pending 
approval of CRPD and its Optional Protocol. Mozambique urged the Netherlands to 
consider withdrawing its reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). 
</p>
<p>35. Despite existing anti-discrimination measures, Nicaragua noted the continuation of 
discrimination of ethnic minorities in the Netherlands mainly due to the lack of a 
comprehensive plan of action targeting that social problem. As a result, those affected, 
particularly migrant women and minority groups, were prevented from enjoying social, 
economic and cultural rights. Nicaragua made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Norway welcomed the establishment of an NHRI and Children&#8217;s Ombudsman. 
Norway requested information on the views of the Netherlands on the suggestion by civil 
society to formalize human rights education in order to increase awareness. Norway made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Pakistan commented on the adverse effects of individual freedoms practised in the 
Netherlands, stating that absolute freedom could impinge the rights and freedoms of others 
through insult, incitation of hatred and discrimination. It referred to concerns vis-&#224;-vis 
racist and xenophobic speeches made by extreme Dutch political parties and expressed 
regret at the Dutch decision not to appeal the verdict of the Geert Wilders case. Pakistan 
asked the Netherlands how it intended to stop Wilders&#8217; campaign of Islamophobia. Pakistan 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Paraguay welcomed the establishment of an NHRI in accordance with the Paris 
Principles and the creation of a Children&#8217;s Ombudsman, expressing its hope that those 
institutions could fully undertake activities to investigate, provide information about the 
human rights situation and cooperate systematically with civil society, as well as with 
national, European and other institutions engaged in the protection of human rights. 
Paraguay voiced concern over migrants&#8217; human rights, particularly reports that migrants 
</p>
<p>were exposed to marginalization. Paraguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. The Philippines welcomed the establishment of the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman but 
noted an apparent absence of a consolidated national action plan for human rights in the 
countries that comprised the Kingdom of Netherlands. The Philippines appreciated the 
frank assessment presented by the Netherlands regarding challenges in the implementation 
of the right to privacy, particularly the protection of personal data. The Philippines made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Ms. Spies expressed appreciation for the interventions noting the progress made in 
the Kingdom of the Netherlands. She reiterated that the Netherlands was currently 
evaluating the consequences of the ratification of CRPD. The preparations before the </p>


<p>approval were lengthy, due to the large scope of the Convention. The draft act would be 
submitted before the summer 2012. The question on signing and ratifying its Optional 
Protocol was thus premature. 
</p>
<p>41. The Netherlands remarked that the provision of article 26 of CRC would not grant to 
children an independent right to social security. Children benefited from social security 
through their parents. Therefore, the Netherlands maintained its reservation to article 26. 
The Netherlands had further considered that issue; however, it had concluded that the same 
arguments still applied. 
</p>
<p>42. The Netherlands would not accede to the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW), on the 
ground of its national policy regarding social provision. The Netherlands objected to the 
section which set out that provisions should be equally accessibly to migrant who were not 
lawfully present within the territory of the country of their destination and/or were 
unlawfully employed. While their stay was unlawful, such person paid neither taxes nor the 
contributions used to fund these services. They should not have equal social and economic 
rights. Exceptions were made for the education of children who were of compulsory school 
age and acute medical emergencies, and legal assistance. 
</p>
<p>43. Regarding non-discrimination, its ban was enshrined in article 1 of the Constitution. 
The Netherlands was highly committed to combating discrimination and racism. It rejected 
any form of discrimination, be it on the grounds of race, descent, religion, belief, gender, 
sexual orientation, handicap or any other ground. Discrimination was at odds with 
citizenship and impeded them from taking part in their community. The Minister stated that 
the Government of the Netherlands did not pursue specific policies targeting specific types 
of discrimination. She referred to bodies to prevent and combat discrimination, like the 
anti-discrimination bureaus, the Equal Treatment Commission and the police, which were 
accessible to everyone. In addition, in 2010, a National Action Plan to Combat 
Discrimination had been enacted. In 2011, further measures had been put in place to 
combat discrimination, including school programmes. 
</p>
<p>44. The Netherlands also had a very comprehensive legal framework to combat the 
incitement to hatred and was party to all relevant international instruments. Regarding the 
question posed about the author of the film <i>Fitna</i>, Ms. Spies reported that the member of 
the House of Representatives had been acquitted by the Criminal Court of the charges of 
public insults and incitement to hatred. The Prosecutor decided not to lodge an appeal. 
Dutch society was characterized by freedom of speech for politicians. These liberties were 
established in the Constitution and human rights instruments. However, the police and the 
judiciary acted against statements that were incompatible with legal provisions regarding 
freedom from discrimination. 
</p>
<p>45. Hate crimes on the Internet were investigated and prosecuted by the police 
specialized in cybercrime. Several cases had been brought before criminal courts resulting 
in convictions. Ms. Spies also referred to the Dutch Complaint Bureau for Discrimination 
on the Internet, which had the function of alerting and preventing discrimination, and 
contributed to criminal law enforcement. 
</p>
<p>46. Regarding preventative searches, the delegation stated that two studies had been 
completed and recommendations made to develop further criteria, guidelines and practices 
to avoid discrimination. The Ombudsman in the Netherlands had also investigated the 
manner in which the preventive searches were applied and made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>47. Ms. Spies also referred to the municipal antidiscrimination services which 
strengthened the anti-discrimination infrastructure and were mandated to carry out statutory 
tasks and provide assistance in dealing with discrimination complaints. She highlighted the </p>


<p>fact that the Netherlands was the first country in Europe that regulated municipal anti-
discrimination policy by law. 
</p>
<p>48. The Netherlands were in favour of improving regulation on ethnic data using 
personal data. Rules and procedures in that regard had been issued. The Netherlands 
endorsed the need for adopting clear legislation to address the issue. 
</p>
<p>49. The representative of Cura&#231;ao stated that it was an autonomous country of the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands and reiterated the decision of Cura&#231;ao to establish a human 
rights institution. 
</p>
<p>50. Hungary praised the substantial financial contribution by the Netherlands to 
OHCHR, the establishment of a national human rights institution in accordance with the 
Paris Principles, the appointment of a Children&#8217;s Ombudsman and the enactment of the 
</p>
<p>Municipal Anti-Discrimination Act. It requested information on the effects and benefits of 
that Act. Hungary also requested clarification on the Netherlands&#8217; plan to address 
discriminatory statements by public institutions. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Qatar congratulated the Netherlands on achievements made at legislative and 
institutional levels since the first UPR. Qatar welcomed the establishment of the Children&#8217;s 
Ombudsman, an NHRI in accordance with the Paris Principles, accession to many 
international conventions on human rights, and measures taken to combat human 
trafficking. Qatar made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Romania congratulated the Netherlands on its presentation of a mid-term progress 
report in 2010. It welcomed the establishment of an information system to monitor 
developments on a regular basis in, among others, discrimination. Romania made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>53. The Russian Federation expressed concern that the NHRI was not accessible to 
inhabitants of the overseas territories where many suffered from low standards of living and 
ill-developed health system. The Russian Federation voiced concern over the increase of 
xenophobic and racist views, the discriminatory situation of religious, national and ethnic 
minorities, women, the persons with disabilities and migrants, the situation in the judiciary 
and prison systems, the stiffening of immigration policy and the conditions in which 
asylum seekers were kept. It regretted the decision to maintain reservations to CRC. The 
Russian Federation made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Slovakia<b> </b>welcomed in particular the establishment of a national human rights 
institution in accordance with the Paris Principles, the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman and the 
</p>
<p>introduction of the Municipal Anti-Discrimination Services. It also commended the 
ratification by the Netherlands of CED and OP-CRC-AC and progress towards ratification 
of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (OP-
CRPD). Slovakia commended the new &#8220;Children Safe&#8221; action plan to address child abuse. 
Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Slovenia commended the Netherlands for its high level of respect for human rights. 
Nevertheless, it was concerned that the number of child abuse cases was not decreasing, 
that corporal punishment was not prohibited in Aruba and that insufficient progress had 
been made in combating structural inequality. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Spain congratulated the Netherlands for its integration and assistance policies to 
immigrants over the last few years. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Sweden commended the establishment of an ombudsman for children, and 
welcomed the ratification of OPCAT and welcomed the clarification regarding the criteria 
for applying OPCAT, which was applicable regardless of the grounds of detention.  It also </p>


<p>noted with satisfaction that national plans to combat discrimination had been put forward in 
the last years. Sweden made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>58. Thailand<b> </b>asked the Dutch delegation if there was a plan to set up appropriate 
institutions for the protection of human rights of the citizens of its overseas territories and, 
if not, what existing mechanism could be used to provide appropriate redress for violation 
of human rights of these people. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Turkey was concerned by the measures implemented to restrict the rights of 
migrants living in the Netherlands. Turkey welcomed the abolition of the precondition of 
passing the Dutch language before admittance in the country, but noted that Turkish mother 
tongue teaching was no longer offered during primary education since 2004. Furthermore, 
Turkey referred to the case of the Turkish singer, Arif Sag, who was allegedly interrogated 
unfairly for hours before being admitted into the country. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Ukraine commended progress achieved in implementing recommendations received 
in 2008. Furthermore, it encouraged the Government of the Netherlands to take further 
measures to combat disadvantages experienced by women in the labour market. Ukraine 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>61. The United Kingdom asked if the Dutch Government would take further action to 
ensure that all asylum claimants received a timely hearing, that all citizens had ready access 
to the legal system, and that migrants and ethnic minorities received equal treatment in the 
workplace. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. The United States of America remained concerned about the enforcement of laws 
designed to counteract societal animosity toward racial and religious minorities, the turning 
down of the majority of asylum requests made by children outside the country who wanted 
to join their parents, vulnerability of women in the labour market and number of child 
abuses. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Uruguay welcomed the establishment of the National Institute for Human Rights, 
the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman and Municipal Anti-Discrimination Services. However, it was 
concerned over sex tourism involving children, in which Dutch nationals were 
participating. Uruguay noted racist speeches from political parties and manifestations of 
intolerance against ethnic minorities. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Uzbekistan was concerned about ongoing forms of discrimination on the grounds of 
ethnic origin and information on increasingly broad use by the police of racist profiling. It 
also expressed concern over rejections by the State regarding proposals about 
discrimination policies and suggestions to combat Islamophobia. Uzbekistan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Viet Nam noted results made in education, social welfare, gender equality and 
establishment of new human rights mechanisms, as well as challenges such as racial 
discrimination, child abuse and violence against women and migrant women remained. Viet 
Nam made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Algeria asked about the measures planned to step up efforts to combat the diffusion 
of racist ideas over Internet and other media. It also would wish measures to be taken 
regarding the low participation of women in public life, pay gap between men and women, 
underrepresentation of women in the labour market and their concentration in part-time 
work. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Argentina congratulated the Netherlands for the creation of the National Institute for 
Human Rights, the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman, and the ratification of CPED. Argentina made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>68. Australia noted that Cura&#231;ao and Sint Maarten&#8217;s new status as independent countries 
in the Kingdom brought human rights challenges, including that of establishing their own 
national human rights institutions. While welcoming the establishment of the Children&#8217;s 
Ombudsman, it recognized the challenge of implementing human rights education; such 
education helped safeguards the rights of the next generation. Australia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. According to Ms. Spies, all people need to be proactive and involved to live in a 
society with harmony. Integration was important to both migrants and the society at large. 
An essential knowledge of Dutch language was an essential condition for participation. 
Poor languages skills, low level of education and unfamiliarity with Dutch institutions 
posed a risk for equal opportunities. 
</p>
<p>70. In relation to court fees, Ms. Spies stated that a Parliament decision in that regard 
was expected. 
</p>
<p>71. The delegation referred to the asylum procedure adopted in 2010, which was an 
improvement and benefited vulnerable groups. It did not result in all asylum claims being 
settled within eight days. Under that procedure, more time was given to legal and medical 
assistance. Detention was a measure of last resort and alternatives were available for 
families with under-age children. The Government of the Netherlands was experimenting 
with other alternatives to migrant detention, which would be evaluated next year. She 
further mentioned that a report was sent to the Parliament announcing decriminalization of 
irregular adult migrants. A decision of Parliament was expected. She added that migrant 
children had access to education, accommodation and necessary medical treatment. The 
best interest of children in procedures related to migration was taken into account, and their 
right to family life was also protected. Ms. Spies indicated that long-term residents without 
a permit were undesirable and the Netherlands was seeking to prevent long procedures 
which would not necessarily result in the issuance of resident permits. 
</p>
<p>72. Ms. Spies further mentioned that minorities, including women belonging to 
minorities, were encouraged to take part of the public life. To that end, they were also 
encouraged to take Dutch-language courses. The Netherlands was working on a more 
flexible dialogue with minorities. 
</p>
<p>73. Ms. Spies also indicated that lessons in Turkish were a choice of the parents, and 
there was an adequate supply of Turkish lessons and culture. 
</p>
<p>74. In connection with juvenile justice, the Netherlands reported that it would maintain 
its reservations to CRC. Juveniles would continue to be tried under regular criminal law, 
since it was an important means of preventing any necessity to introduce disproportional 
heavier sentences. However, children were protected under regular criminal law. They had 
the right to legal aid regardless the nature of the crime. Alternatives to depravation of 
liberty also existed. 
</p>
<p>75. In addition, Ms. Spies referred to the plan &#8220;Children Save&#8221; aimed to combat abuse 
and which included prevention using a multidisciplinary approach. The Netherlands would 
report on the implementation of that plan. She also mentioned that there was legislation in 
place to combat sex abuse in the context of tourism, with extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>76. The representative of Aruba indicated that task forces had been established to 
protect the victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation, and provide assistance, such as 
free legal aid and health care. They had produced positive results. If victims were in Aruba 
illegally, they were not detained but treated as victims. Return to their country was also 
facilitated, or assistance to adapt in the society, if necessary. 
</p>
<p>77. The representative stated that corporal punishment was prohibited by law in schools 
in Aruba and legislation to extend the prohibition to the family setting was expected in </p>


<p>2012. Regarding the remarks on the issue of a human rights institution, Aruba would be 
working together with Cura&#231;ao and the Netherlands in creating a similar type of institution 
on the island to guarantee information, education and protection of human rights in their 
community. 
</p>
<p>78. The representative of Cura&#231;ao stated that corporal punishment was prohibited by law 
in Cura&#231;ao. She also referred to an amendment of the Civil Code which defined parents&#8217; 
role as caretakers and educators and explicitly stated that parents were not allowed to 
employ either emotional nor physical violence or any other form of humiliating treatment 
against children. 
</p>
<p>79. Cura&#231;ao was a party to six major human rights instruments and its Constitution 
covered all the rights. However, the situation on the ground was not fully in conformity 
with the treaties. The National Human Rights Institution must work towards that and was 
not only expected to promote and protect human rights, but also to play an important role in 
human rights education. Cura&#231;ao was conscious of its shortcomings in respect to human 
rights institutions, law and policies. A seminar of experts was being prepared for June 2012, 
which would be used to design the national human rights policy. 
</p>
<p>80. Azerbaijan asked about the efforts undertaken by the Government of the Netherlands 
to establish national human rights institutions compliant with the Paris Principles. 
Azerbaijan remained concerned about the persistence of gender-role stereotypes, in 
particular about migrant women and men. Furthermore, Azerbaijan welcomed the 
introduction of compulsory education and measures to give all children access to school 
and reduce dropout rates. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. While understanding the importance of integration of migrants into the society of a 
destination country, Bangladesh emphasized the importance of ensuring the social and 
cultural rights of migrants equally. Regarding fundamental freedoms, it asked about 
instances where the Criminal Code had been applied to restrict freedom of expression to 
uphold freedom of others. Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. Belarus appealed the Netherlands to step up its interaction with the special 
procedures. Belarus mentioned reports that migrants and ethnic minorities were subjected 
to various forms of discrimination. Belarus underlined concerns of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child over the scale of child sex tourism with participation of Dutch citizens, 
and the lack of appropriate reaction to this phenomenon. Belarus made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Botswana commended the ratification of the OP-CAT, OP-CRC-AC and CPED as a 
follow-up to the first-cycle UPR. While welcoming the constitutional and institutional 
reforms taken, including the 2010 referendum granting Cura&#231;ao and Sint Maarten the 
autonomy as States, and the establishment of the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman in 2011, 
Botswana asked how the Dutch Government intended to address that the fact that the 
administrative apparatus of Cura&#231;ao had not yet established. Botswana made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>84. Brazil welcomed the progress made concerning LGBT rights, especially promoting 
the safety of LGBT persons, and also commended the Netherlands for its measures 
regarding women&#8217;s rights. Furthermore, Brazil asked the Dutch delegation about statistics 
on the number of asylum seekers who had effectively been granted refugee status in the 
country in the last five years. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. Canada asked for information on when the Netherlands plans to ratify CRPD and 
OP-CRPD. Canada made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>86. With regards to achievements and best practices, Chile stressed the establishment of 
the National Institution for Human Rights, Children&#8217;s Ombudsman and Municipal Anti-</p>


<p>Discrimination Services, institutions which would help consolidate achievements and carry 
out new activities in relevant areas. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>87. China appreciated the efforts of the Government of the Netherlands to protect the 
rights of vulnerable groups. However, it noted with concern that phenomena of racism, 
xenophobia and religious intolerance still existed and that there were hate speeches against 
Muslims on the Internet. It also underlined that women and minorities were still 
discriminated against. China made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. Costa Rica welcomed the establishment of the National Human Rights Institution 
and the Children&#8217;s Ombudsman and the abolition of death penalty in Cura&#231;ao. It asked how 
the Dutch authorities monitored, regulated and prevented incitement to hatred speech on the 
Internet and how the best interest of the child was taken into account in cases of migration 
expulsion. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. Cuba was concerned about the proliferation of incidents related to racism and 
xenophobia, particularly with the use of Internet and other media. It noted that violence 
against women was growing and cases of child abuse had not decreased. In that regard, 
necessary services must be more effective in reaching victims. Cuba also underlined reports 
on very difficult conditions of detention and mistreatment by the police. Cuba made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>90. Despite progress made in fighting discrimination and racism, Ecuador was 
concerned over complaints of mistreatment by police against irregular migrants and policies 
which criminalized migration. It asked about measures taken to reduce the number of 
migrants under detention, especially families with children and non-accompanied children, 
and what were the alternatives to detention for migrants, their use and results if any. 
Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. The Representative of Cura&#231;ao referred to the development of the administrative 
apparatus of Cura&#231;ao and its implications in the implementation of human rights 
recommendations. Cura&#231;ao was an autonomous country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, 
and was fully responsible for its internal affairs, including the organization and 
development of its public service. She added that Cura&#231;ao benefited from collaborating 
with its partners of the Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>92. Regarding the abolishment of life imprisonment of children, the delegation 
mentioned that, child imprisonment had not been practised for many years and, in 2008, 
had been removed from the Dutch Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>93. Ms. Spies indicated that the discussion of ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-CESCR) would 
continue after the elections in September 2012. Regarding the recommendations to enhance 
the participation of women in public functions, she stated that one of the main activities of 
the last years has been to raise more awareness and provide tools for the public sector. She 
added that there were only small disparities between men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s pay, which were 
explained by the fact that almost 70 per cent of the women worked part-time. The 
Netherlands had carried out extra promotional activities and would also support the 
combination work and provide more opportunities for women, such as flexible working 
hours. In addition, the Cabinet would continue developing community schools that offered 
full working day-care schemes. Moreover, a number of programmes would be developed to 
empower women at every level and all sectors of the economy. 
</p>
<p>94. According to Ms. Spies, many ethnic minorities in the Netherlands did not possess a 
good working knowledge of Dutch. Therefore, they had less chances of finding good 
opportunities on labour market. The low level of education of migrants had the 
consequence that they occupied more temporary positions than others. School dropout, in </p>


<p>particular, worsened that situation. The Netherlands was making an effort to promote 
school participation. The sensitivity of different sectors of economic crisis had provoked 
increasing of unemployment in specific sectors, such as the construction sector. 
</p>
<p>95. The Netherlands was also taking more action against human trafficking. In 2009, 
penalties for trafficking in human beings had increased. Early in 2012, a legislative 
proposal to increase the penalties in that regard had been send to Parliament. A national 
prosecutor and 90 prosecutors specialized in human trafficking had been appointed. Almost 
all police forces had supervision teams at their disposal and one of the main achievements 
was the establishment of close supervision by local authorities in the prostitution sector. 
</p>
<p>96. Ms. Spies reported that, since 2002, a policy to combat domestic violence had been 
implemented. The evaluation made in 2011 showed achievements. Domestic violence had 
been placed on the agenda of public administration. The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had given 
instructions for that crime to be investigated and the maximum penalty therefor had been 
increased. 
</p>
<p>97. In her closing remarks, Ms. Spies indicated that the Netherlands would further study 
the different recommendations and questions and report on them before September 2012. 
She reaffirmed the position that every country had room for improvement when it came to 
human rights. The Netherlands and the other countries of the Kingdom were not excluded 
therefrom. The upholding of human rights should never be considered as self-evident. 
</p>
