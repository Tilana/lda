<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>In its resolution 26/22, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights  to consult with States and relevant stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>develop concrete options and proposals to inform a decision on whether to create a global 
</p>
<p>fund to enhance the capacity of stakeholders to implement the Guiding Principles on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights, and to submit a report thereon to the Council at its twenty-
</p>
<p>ninth session. 
</p>
<p>The present report, prepared pursuant to that request, provides a summary of 
</p>
<p>stakeholder views on issues relating to the scope and structure of such a fund. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner recommends further steps for consideration by the Council and proposes 
</p>
<p>that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights be mandated 
</p>
<p>to develop a pilot project to test the viability of a capacity-building fund in this area, 
</p>
<p>subject to available resources. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 21/5, the Human Rights Council recognized the importance of 
</p>
<p>building the capacity of all actors to better manage challenges in the area of business and 
</p>
<p>human rights and requested the Secretary-General to undertake a study to explore the 
</p>
<p>feasibility of establishing a global fund to enhance the capacity of stakeholders to advance 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>2. The main findings of the feasibility study were included in the report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on the challenges, strategies and developments with regard to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of resolution 21/5 by the United Nations system, including programmes, 
</p>
<p>funds and agencies (see A/HRC/26/20, paras. 61&#8211;80). As a result of the consultations 
</p>
<p>undertaken for the feasibility study, it was found that there was broad consensus among 
</p>
<p>Governments and business and civil society representatives on a new fund to support the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Guiding Principles and that such a fund would be a useful 
</p>
<p>mechanism.  
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 26/22, the Council welcomed the report of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>and requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consult with 
</p>
<p>States and relevant stakeholders to develop concrete options and proposals to inform a 
</p>
<p>decision on whether to create such a fund, and to submit a report thereon to the Council at 
</p>
<p>its twenty-ninth session. The present report was prepared pursuant to that request and 
</p>
<p>should be read in conjunction with the feasibility study (A/HRC/26/20/Add.1). In the 
</p>
<p>preparation of the present report, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR) invited all Member States and relevant stakeholders to provide 
</p>
<p>views and recommendations on possible options for a new capacity-building fund to 
</p>
<p>advance the implementation of the Guiding Principles. OHCHR also presented an overview 
</p>
<p>of responses received and discussed potential options for next steps at an informal 
</p>
<p>consultation with Member States on 9 April 2015.  
</p>
<p>4. With respect to the scope of a potential fund, OHCHR requested stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>provide views on the relative importance of initial priorities identified in the first round of 
</p>
<p>consultations, including on: (a) providing support to civil society, human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>and organizations that assist those whose human rights are affected by business activities to 
</p>
<p>build their capacity to advocate effectively at the international, national and local levels and 
</p>
<p>to assist victims in accessing remedy; (b) providing support to States with limited capacity 
</p>
<p>to implement the Guiding Principles, including, for example, by supporting government 
</p>
<p>processes to develop national action plans on business and human rights; and (c) providing 
</p>
<p>support to civil society, business networks, trade unions, think tanks, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and other organizations that conduct awareness-raising and training activities.  
</p>
<p>5. On the matter of the potential structure of a new fund, OHCHR requested views on 
</p>
<p>options that could most effectively advance implementation and meet capacity-building 
</p>
<p>needs concerning the Guiding Principles at all levels of governance and across all relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholder groups, as recommended in the feasibility study. Fund models for consideration 
</p>
<p>could include: (a) a structure similar to other voluntary trust funds on human rights issues to 
</p>
<p>be administered by the Secretary-General, with OHCHR providing secretariat services, 
</p>
<p>including by pre-screening applications, monitoring and evaluating the use of grants and 
</p>
<p>providing support to the board of trustees; (b) a multi-party trust fund structure with a 
</p>
<p>policy body comprising national authorities from different regions, OHCHR and other 
</p>
<p>relevant United Nations agencies, to set priorities and take decisions on grants to be 
</p>
<p>awarded and administered through the Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme; and (c) establishment of a legally independent </p>


<p>organization with international, non-profit status or an existing organization tasked with 
</p>
<p>administering the fund. Such an  organization would be accountable to the Secretary-
</p>
<p>General and would establish a multi-stakeholder board comprising representatives from 
</p>
<p>donor and recipient countries, as well as the private sector and civil society, which would 
</p>
<p>be responsible for setting priorities and awarding grants, as well as for overseeing and 
</p>
<p>monitoring programme implementation. The multi-stakeholder board would also be 
</p>
<p>responsible for securing effective secretariat support for project screening, funds 
</p>
<p>disbursement, monitoring and evaluation, and legal and financial management.  
</p>
<p>6. The present report seeks to advance consideration by the Human Rights Council on 
</p>
<p>whether to create a new capacity-building fund for the implementation of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles. The following section summarizes the perspectives of stakeholders who 
</p>
<p>provided written submissions for the most recent consultation process. Based on those 
</p>
<p>submissions as well as on the Secretary-General&#8217;s feasibility study, the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>proposes further steps for consideration by the Human Rights Council at its twenty-ninth 
</p>
<p>session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of stakeholder views 
</b></p>
<p>7. Only a small number of responses were received in this round of consultations (four 
</p>
<p>from States and two from civil society, one of which was a joint submission). It should be 
</p>
<p>recalled that, although the consultations for the feasibility study had indicated wide support 
</p>
<p>for the establishment of a new fund for the implementation of the Guiding Principles and 
</p>
<p>that such a fund could be a useful mechanism, there was also a diversity of views 
</p>
<p>concerning the priorities and governance arrangements for such a fund. The current 
</p>
<p>consultations therefore sought to elicit additional views on issues relating to the scope and 
</p>
<p>structure of a new fund. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Stakeholder views on the scope of a new fund 
</b></p>
<p>8. In the feasibility study it was noted that, given the importance placed by all actors on 
</p>
<p>the interrelated nature of the three pillars of the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Framework, it seemed evident that the mandate for such a fund should be broad, with the 
</p>
<p>ability to support projects to advance the implementation of and the capacity-building needs 
</p>
<p>concerning the Guiding Principles at all levels of governance and across all relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholder groups. It was also noted that there appeared to be a widely shared view that a 
</p>
<p>new fund should be designed in a way that would encourage further multi-stakeholder 
</p>
<p>cooperation (see A/HRC/26/20/Add.1, para. 50). In the consultation process undertaken for 
</p>
<p>the feasibility study, there was broad consensus among stakeholders that a new fund should 
</p>
<p>not prioritize the provision of resources directly to the United Nations Secretariat and 
</p>
<p>agencies to carry out capacity-building activities in the area of business and human rights. 
</p>
<p>While support to civil society actors was widely viewed as being a key priority, there was a 
</p>
<p>much broader range of views concerning other potential actors and activities that such a 
</p>
<p>fund might support.  
</p>
<p>9. Those views were broadly reaffirmed in the most recent stakeholder submissions, 
</p>
<p>which offered a number of additional recommendations as well. In one submission, it was 
</p>
<p>proposed that a new fund should allow sufficient scope for the identification of regional 
</p>
<p>priorities. It was suggested that stakeholders in some regions might benefit more from 
</p>
<p>activities such as awareness-raising or capacity-building, for example, to advise small and 
</p>
<p>medium-sized businesses on corporate human rights due diligence processes, whereas other 
</p>
<p>regions might view the provision of support to communities in defending their rights vis-&#224;-
</p>
<p>vis companies as a more immediate priority. In another submission, it was suggested that a </p>


<p>fund in the area of business and human rights should be flexible enough to allow for the 
</p>
<p>development of region-specific tools for enhancing corporate human rights due diligence, 
</p>
<p>as well as support communities that have been negatively affected by corporate activities. 
</p>
<p>In yet another submission, it was proposed that a fund should support implementation 
</p>
<p>activities linked to the establishment of national action plans on business and human rights, 
</p>
<p>while noting that civil society activities were, in some cases, part of such initiatives. 
</p>
<p>10. In other submissions, specific priorities were proposed, including: (a) increasing the 
</p>
<p>capacity of indigenous peoples and other marginalized stakeholders on issues relating to 
</p>
<p>business and human rights; (b) facilitating greater access to relevant reports and documents, 
</p>
<p>including through translation into national and indigenous languages; and (c) ensuring 
</p>
<p>broader participation of indigenous peoples and marginalized groups at relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations and related meetings. In one submission, the importance of supporting human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders in carrying out their work was reiterated, in particular with regard to 
</p>
<p>documenting the impact of corporations and ensuring access to effective remedies.  
</p>
<p>11. Some stakeholders proposed that a new fund should prioritize strengthening the 
</p>
<p>capacities of the most disadvantaged groups, including indigenous peoples, through 
</p>
<p>activities such as: (a) training for indigenous peoples and disadvantaged groups on the 
</p>
<p>contents and utilization of the Guiding Principles; (b) activities, designed in partnership 
</p>
<p>with indigenous peoples, for State and private actors relating to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights 
</p>
<p>in the context of the business activities that have an impact on them; (c) research on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Guiding Principles, including with a view to reviewing and 
</p>
<p>improving existing implementation mechanisms; and (d) monitoring and documentation of 
</p>
<p>cases of business activities that have had an impact on the rights of indigenous peoples and 
</p>
<p>dissemination of reports for awareness-raising and advocacy purposes.  
</p>
<p>12. With respect to the duration of the project, funds and recipient profiles, in one 
</p>
<p>submission it was proposed that the fund should prioritize multi-year capacity-building 
</p>
<p>projects rather than shorter term, one-off projects or activities, and suggested that the fund 
</p>
<p>could establish a budget range of $10,000&#8211;$50,000 for projects, including multi-year 
</p>
<p>projects of one to three years&#8217; duration. In another submission, it was stressed that the fund 
</p>
<p>should be accessible to a wide variety of organizations, including, as proposed in the 
</p>
<p>feasibility study, civil society organizations, business networks, trade unions, think tanks, 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions and other organizations that conduct awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>and training activities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Stakeholder views on the structure of a new fund 
</b></p>
<p>13. The consultations undertaken for the feasibility study highlighted a diversity of 
</p>
<p>stakeholder views on the most effective structure of a fund aimed at building capacity in the 
</p>
<p>area of business and human rights. As noted in the study, in a large majority of submissions 
</p>
<p>it was indicated that OHCHR should be a key actor in administering such a fund. Some 
</p>
<p>stakeholders stated that the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational 
</p>
<p>corporations and other business enterprises should play a central role in shaping the fund&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>strategic approach. In a number of submissions, the importance of ensuring an efficient 
</p>
<p>governance structure and limiting administrative costs was stressed (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/26/20/Add.1, para. 39).  
</p>
<p>14. Similarly, the consultation process for the present report did not result in a clear 
</p>
<p>consensus on the most desirable governance arrangement for a fund in the area of business 
</p>
<p>and human rights. For example, although some States indicated a preference for a 
</p>
<p>traditional voluntary trust fund that relied on existing structures, others focused on the 
</p>
<p>importance of simple and effective procedures that would not discourage potential 
</p>
<p>applicants, in particular civil society representatives, from seeking support through such a </p>


<p>fund. One State suggested that a public-private partnership model, supported by oversight 
</p>
<p>from international human rights bodies or expert teams, could be more flexible, encourage 
</p>
<p>multi-stakeholder cooperation and effectively manage the fund. Another State favoured a 
</p>
<p>structure wherein governance would be provided by involving national authorities from all 
</p>
<p>regions, as well as OHCHR and other United Nations bodies.  
</p>
<p>15. Civil society representatives suggested that a board of trustees on which rights 
</p>
<p>holders would be represented  and that would be administered by OHCHR would be most 
</p>
<p>appropriate for a new fund in the area of business and human rights. In a joint civil society 
</p>
<p>submission, it was noted that experience with existing funds, such as the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples, indicated that fund governance should, in this case, 
</p>
<p>focus on: (a) establishing a procedure for the selection of the members of a board of 
</p>
<p>trustees to ensure familiarity with potential applicants within their constituency, while 
</p>
<p>safeguarding the independence of collective decision-making on grant approvals; (b) 
</p>
<p>developing and publishing eligibility criteria on who may seek support through the new 
</p>
<p>fund &#8212; in that context, it was suggested that organizations and groups, in particular 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples, should not be required to be legally registered in their countries of 
</p>
<p>origin in order to obtain funds; and (c) ensuring that an effective pre-screening procedure is 
</p>
<p>in place to review the legitimacy and past performance of eligible organizations. 
</p>
<p>16. One civil society stressed the importance of establishing a governance structure that 
</p>
<p>would help secure local and multi-stakeholder support for fund-related activities. It was 
</p>
<p>suggested, in that context, that an independent organization with a multi-stakeholder board 
</p>
<p>responsible for setting priorities, awarding grants, and overseeing and monitoring 
</p>
<p>programme implementation would represent the structure most likely to effectively advance 
</p>
<p>implementation and meet capacity-building needs concerning the Guiding Principles at all 
</p>
<p>levels of governance and across all relevant stakeholder groups.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>17. <b>In the light of the foregoing summary of stakeholder views, the High 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commissioner provides the following conclusion and makes recommendations on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>next steps to be considered by the Human Rights Council during its twenty-ninth 
</b></p>
<p><b>session.  
</b></p>
<p>18. <b>Firstly, the High Commissioner wishes to stress that any decisions taken by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council on this issue should be made in the light of broader human rights capacity-
</b></p>
<p><b>building and technical assistance trends, as well as the current overall funding 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of OHCHR and the wider United Nations human rights system. In that 
</b></p>
<p><b>context, it should be recalled that demands for human rights assistance continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase exponentially, yet, owing to a lack of resources, OHCHR has been obliged to 
</b></p>
<p><b>significantly reduce its programme of activities for 2015. That reality clearly needs to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be considered in further discussions by the Council on the viability of a new fund to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen the capacity of stakeholders to implement the Guiding Principles on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Business and Human Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>Secondly, the High Commissioner wishes to stress that, as noted in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>feasibility study, any decision concerning a new fund in the area of business and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights should be made in coordination with the Working Group on the issue of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. Given its 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate to identify, exchange and promote good practices and lessons learned on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the Guiding Principles, as well as its role in providing support for 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts to promote capacity-building and the use of the Guiding Principles by all </b></p>


<p><b>actors, it would be important to involve the Working Group in shaping the strategic 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach of a new fund.  
</b></p>
<p>20. <b>Thirdly, the High Commissioner wishes to reiterate that there appears to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>broad agreement among all stakeholders that a new fund would be a useful 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism to advance the implementation of the Guiding Principles, and that such a 
</b></p>
<p><b>fund should be able to accept financial contributions from any actor, including States, 
</b></p>
<p><b>businesses, philanthropic organizations and individuals. Equally important, and as 
</b></p>
<p><b>noted in the conclusions to the feasibility study, is the broad consensus on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>importance of establishing appropriate safeguards for the legitimacy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence of any new funding arrangement in this area, including by ensuring full 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparency of donors and the allocation of resources to individual projects.  
</b></p>
<p>21. <b>Those points of consensus constitute a useful foundation upon which further 
</b></p>
<p><b>actions by the Council can be taken. However, there remains a diversity of views on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the priority actors and activities to be supported by a new fund, as well as the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective structure for ensuring maximum impact. With those aspects in mind, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>addition to the current financial challenges noted above, it would appear that a useful 
</b></p>
<p><b>next step would be to create the conditions for multi-stakeholder testing of how 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building support in this area could be delivered in practice. Such a step 
</b></p>
<p><b>would encourage further dialogue and the collection of additional information, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including with respect to the degree of donor interest in supporting capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p><b>in this area on a more permanent basis. 
</b></p>
<p>22. <b>Given the above considerations, the High Commissioner recommends that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council consider the following:  
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>In order to further inform the Council</b>&#8217;s<b> decision on whether to create a 
</b></p>
<p><b>permanent mechanism to support stakeholder capacity for implementing the Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles on Business and Human Rights, OHCHR should be requested to develop a 
</b></p>
<p><b>pilot project to test the viability of a capacity-building fund in this area. It should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>stressed, however, that a pilot project can only be implemented if sufficient resources, 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be determined by OHCHR, are received; 
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> As part of the pilot project, OHCHR should be mandated, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>collaboration with the Working Group on human rights and transnational 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporations and other business enterprises and other relevant United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p><b>partners, to provide financial support, subject to available resources, for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>representative number of pilot capacity-building projects concerning implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Guiding Principles, and to report to the Council in three years on the findings 
</b></p>
<p><b>arising from and the lessons learned from the pilot project; 
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> The High Commissioner should be invited to consult with a multi-
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholder group of individuals and organizations representing all relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>constituencies to provide OHCHR with strategic guidance during the pilot project, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in the development of eligibility criteria for pilot capacity-building projects. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Such consultations could be initiated during the fourth annual Forum on Business and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights, to be held in November 2015 and to be organized in coordination with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Working Group. Individuals and organizations involved in the consultations 
</b></p>
<p><b>should not have authority with respect to decision-making on which projects to 
</b></p>
<p><b>support or on matters relating to who can contribute or benefit from funding. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Equally, private and public donors to the pilot capacity-building projects should not 
</b></p>
<p><b>have a direct role in decisions concerning which projects to support, so as to avoid any 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict of interest. 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>Given the results of the consultations to date and the importance that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>partners have placed on the interrelated nature of the three pillars of the </b>&#8220;<b>Protect, </b></p>


<p><b>Respect and Remedy</b>&#8221;<b> Framework and the Guiding Principles, the Council should 
</b></p>
<p><b>confirm that the mandate for a pilot project should be broad, with the ability to 
</b></p>
<p><b>support projects to advance the implementation and meet capacity-building needs 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning the Guiding Principles at all levels of governance and across all relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholder groups, excluding United Nations agencies or programmes. Priority 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be given to all key stakeholder groups in developing countries, for example, by: 
</b></p>
<p>(a)<b> Supporting civil society organizations with limited resources to increase 
</b></p>
<p><b>the capacity of local communities and marginalized stakeholders on issues relating to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the implementation of the Guiding Principles; 
</b></p>
<p>(b)<b> Developing multi-stakeholder cooperation focusing on assisting small 
</b></p>
<p><b>and medium-sized companies in implementing their responsibilities in accordance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the Guiding Principles;  
</b></p>
<p>(c)<b> Assisting Governments that are developing national business and human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights action plans. 
</b></p>
