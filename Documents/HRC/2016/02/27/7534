</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The International Court of Justice has stated that &#8220;wrongfully to deprive human 
beings of their freedom and to subject them to physical constraint in conditions of hardship 
is in itself manifestly incompatible with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
as well as with the fundamental principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights&#8221;.1 In 1991, the Commission on Human Rights established the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention to investigate detention imposed arbitrarily and 
inconsistently with international standards in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and legal instruments accepted by the States concerned (E/CN.4/RES/1991/42). The 
Working Group is the only Charter-based (or non-treaty-based) mechanism whose mandate 
expressly provides for consideration of individual complaints. Its actions are based on the 
right of petition for individuals anywhere in the world. The opinions of the Working Group 
are reported to the Human Rights Council, which urges Member States to cooperate and 
comply with the Working Group and its opinions, and where States make statements about 
international and domestic law, and human rights obligations in conventions and customary 
international law, and their own and other States&#8217; compliance with these. 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 20/16, encourages all States to &#8220;respect 
and promote the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to bring 
proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the 
lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful, 
in accordance with their international obligations&#8221; (A/HRC/RES/20/16, para. 6 (d)). The 
Council requested the Working Group to prepare, and to present to it before the end of 
2015, draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies and procedures to assist Member 
States with their compliance (ibid., para. 10).  
</p><p>3. The Working Group was directed to seek the views of States, United Nations 
agencies, intergovernmental organizations, treaty bodies, particularly the Human Rights 
Committee, other special procedures, national human rights institutions, non-governmental 
organizations and other stakeholders. In 2013, the Working Group distributed a 
questionnaire on the treatment of the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before 
court in the respective legal frameworks. It received responses from 44 States, 20 national 
human rights institutions, eight non-governmental organizations, five special procedures 
mandate holders, three regional entities and one of the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>4. The report is divided into three sections. The first section sets out the international 
human rights treaties, standards, and reports and jurisprudence of international mechanisms 
on the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court. The second section sets 
out the regional legal framework, including treaties, standards and jurisprudence of regional 
mechanisms relating to the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court. The 
third section, which constitutes the annex to the report, presents, in tabular format, national 
legal provisions relating to the right to a court review, as submitted by Member States to the 
Working Group. 
</p>
<p>5. The report does not attempt to be exhaustive in its citation of relevant legal 
instruments and jurisprudence but rather to show the general practice accepted as law in the 
international practice, representations by states and universal adoption of legal guarantees 
for the procedural right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to challenge the lawfulness 
of his or her detention.

<p><b> II. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. Although article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights establishes that 
&#8220;no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile&#8221;, persons deprived of their 
liberty are frequently unable to benefit from legal resources and guarantees that they are 
entitled to for the conduct of their defence as required by law in any judicial system and by 
applicable international human rights instruments (A/HRC/10/21, para. 45). A defining 
element of the deprivation of liberty is the inability of those who are in detention to defend 
and protect themselves, as their daily life is largely dependent on the decisions taken by the 
staff at the detention facilities (ibid., para. 46). In such an environment, persons deprived of 
their liberty not only have difficulties in verifying the lawfulness of their detention, but also 
find themselves subjected to a lack of an effective control of their other rights (ibid., para. 
47). Nonetheless, the right to bring such proceedings before court is well enshrined in treaty 
law and customary international law and constitutes <i>jus cogens</i>, as observed by the 
Working Group in its deliberation No. 9 (2013) concerning the definition and scope of 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary international law (A/HRC/22/44). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Uniform adoption of the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention 
before court 
</b></p>
<p>7. The right to challenge the lawfulness of detention is set out in a number of the core 
international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (of 1951) and 
the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees (of 1967), the International Convention on 
the Protection the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>8. In addition, there are several non-binding international human rights instruments 
including the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of 
Detention or Imprisonment, the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles 
Deprived of Their Liberty, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules), and the Guidelines on the Applicable 
Criteria and Standards relating to the Detention of Asylum Seekers and Alternatives to 
Detention. They provide valuable guidance in interpreting and implementing the 
requirements of the core human rights treaties and customary international law and are 
often relied upon by special procedures and treaty bodies in their work.  
</p>
<p>9. Other international human rights mechanisms than the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention have clarified the scope and content of the right to challenge the lawfulness of 
detention before court. Treaty bodies, in particular the Human Rights Committee, the 
Committee Against Torture, the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families and the Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities have all addressed this right in their concluding observations, individual 
communications or general comments. The Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has addressed the right in its 
country visit reports, annual reports and statements. Observations on the exercise of the  
right have also featured in the annual, country visit or joint reports of several special 
procedures mandate holders, including the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or </p>


<p><b> 5</b> 
</p>
<p>punishment, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants.  
</p>
<p>10. The right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court and to a remedy 
follow from the combined reading of articles 8 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, whereby &#8220;everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent 
national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution 
or by law&#8221; and &#8220;no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile&#8221;. A 
comprehensive articulation of that right is found in article 9, paragraph 4, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that &#8220;anyone who is 
deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a 
court, in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention 
and order his release if the detention is not lawful&#8221;. Where persons deprived of liberty are 
not able to exercise this right, such as in cases of suspected enforced disappearance, the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, in 
article 17, paragraph 2 (f), obligates State parties to &#8220;guarantee that &#8230; any persons with a 
legitimate interest, such as relatives of the person deprived of liberty, their representatives 
or their counsel, shall, in all circumstances, be entitled to take proceedings before a court, in 
order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty 
and order the person&#8217;s release if such deprivation of liberty is not lawful&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>11. Principles 4, 11 and 32 of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons 
under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment make a significant contribution. Principle 4 
states that &#8220;any form of detention or imprisonment and all measures affecting the human 
rights of a person under any form of detention or imprisonment shall be ordered by, or be 
subject to the effective control of, a judicial or other authority&#8221;. In respect to the prescribed 
mechanism for such proceedings, principle 11 states: &#8220;1. A person shall not be kept in 
detention without being given an effective opportunity to be heard promptly by a judicial or 
other authority. A detained person shall have the right to defend himself or to be assisted by 
counsel as prescribed by law. 2. [&#8230;] 3. A judicial or other authority shall be empowered to 
review as appropriate the continuance of detention.&#8221; The accessibility of such proceedings 
is set out in principle 32: &#8220;1. A detained person or his counsel shall be entitled at any time 
to take proceedings according to domestic law before a judicial or other authority to 
challenge the lawfulness of his detention in order to obtain his release without delay, if it is 
unlawful. 2. The proceedings &#8230; shall be simple and expeditious and at no cost for detained 
persons without adequate means. The detaining authority shall produce without 
unreasonable delay the detained person before the reviewing authority.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>12. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Human Rights Committee have 
delivered extensive guidance on the scope and content of this right. The Committee against 
Torture, the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances have highlighted the importance of the procedural guarantee 
in their general comments, public statements, and country visit or annual reports.  
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has consistently maintained that the 
right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court is a self-standing human right, 
the absence of which constitutes a human rights violation per se (A/HRC/19/57, para. 61). 
The right to challenge the lawfulness of detention is frequently denied in circumstances 
where a detainee has never been formally charged or brought before a judge, has been held 
incommunicado or in solitary confinement, or has been denied an effective possibility or 
remedy to challenge his or her detention (Working Group opinions 33/2012 and 38/2012). 
The obstacles observed by the Working Group in mounting such a challenge include the </p>


<p>inability to access legal counsel or any source of information on commencing the 
procedure, the high cost of filing an application, lengthy court reviews, the inability to 
access evidence, the inability to appear before the court, and prolonged custody 
(A/HRC/19/57, para. 63). Violation of procedural guarantees often occurs in administrative 
detention and in rehabilitation centres (Working Group opinions 19/2012 and 22/2012). 
The detainee may have been ordered to be released following a successful challenge, yet 
remains in detention (see, for example, Working Group opinions 08/2011 and 14/2011). 
Where due process rights are denied, a State cannot rely on the excuse of lack of 
administrative capacity (Working Group opinions 21/2004 and 46/2006).  
</p><p>14. The Human Rights Committee has interpreted the content and scope of the right to 
challenge the lawfulness of detention in its general comment no. 8 (1982) on article 9 (right 
to liberty and security of persons) and in its jurisprudence. The objective of the procedural 
right is release from ongoing unlawful detention. &#8220;Unlawful detention&#8221; includes both 
detention that violates domestic law and detention that is incompatible with the 
requirements of article 9, paragraph 1, or with any other relevant provision of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.2 Unlawful detention may have been 
lawful at its inception but has become unlawful, because the individual has completed a 
sentence of imprisonment, or because the circumstances that justify the detention have 
changed.3  
</p>
<p>15. The Human Rights Committee has clarified the universal application of the right to 
challenge the lawfulness of detention before court, which extends to all situations of 
deprivation of liberty, including detention for the purposes of criminal proceedings, military 
detention, security detention, counter-terrorism detention, involuntary hospitalization, 
immigration detention, detention for extradition, wholly groundless arrests, house arrest, 
solitary confinement, administrative detention, detention for vagrancy or drug addiction, 
detention of children for educational purposes, and other forms of administrative detention.4 
No category of detainees may be denied taking such proceedings.5 
</p>
<p>16. The right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court applies from the 
moment of arrest, and there should be no substantial waiting before bringing a first 
challenge.6 Proceedings may be commenced by either the detainee or his or her 
representative, and do not require an automatic initiation of review by the authorities

<p>detaining the individual.7 Detainees should be informed, in a language that they understand, 
of their right to take proceedings for a decision on the lawfulness of their detention and 
should be afforded prompt and regular access to counsel.8  
</p>
<p>17. A &#8220;court&#8221; must be established by law, and must either be independent of the 
executive and legislative branches or must enjoy judicial independence in deciding legal 
matters in proceedings that are judicial in nature.9 In general, the detainee has the right to 
appear in person before the court, and the court must have the power to order the detainee 
to be brought before it. The adjudication of the case should take place as expeditiously as 
possible.10  
</p>
<p>18. The Committee against Torture, in its general comment no. 2 (2008) on the 
implementation by States parties of article 2 of the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, has listed guarantees for all 
persons deprived of their liberty, including the right to challenge the legality of their 
detention or treatment. In its country reports, the Committee considers that a &#8220;State party 
must also adopt the measures necessary to guarantee the right of any person who has been 
deprived of their liberty to have access to an immediate remedy to challenge the legality of 
their detention&#8221; (CAT/C/CUB/CO/2, para. 8). 
</p><p>19. The Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture has adopted a provisional statement on 
the role of judicial review and due process in the prevention of torture in prisons 
(CAT/OP/2). The Subcommittee sets out requirements that must be observed so that 
individuals can defend themselves properly against any act by the State that might affect 
their rights, noting that &#8220;judicial intervention during the period of confinement, by judges 
other than those who determined the criminal charges, goes hand in hand with due process&#8221; 
(para. 14). The Subcommittee recommends that &#8220;States parties should consider effective 
judicial review and due process during the detention of individuals in criminal proceedings 
as a prerequisite for the prevention of ill-treatment or torture of persons deprived of their 
liberty and as a means of conferring legitimacy on the exercise of criminal justice&#8221; 
(para. 19). In its country reports, the Subcommittee has characterized the right to challenge 
the lawfulness of detention before court as a &#8220;fundamental safeguard against torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8221;, requiring the senior 
authorities in the institutions responsible for implementing habeas corpus to take the 
requisite steps to ensure the effectiveness of that right (CAT/OP/HND/1, para. 137).  
20. Recalling article 13 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, which provides that an investigation should be conducted for as 
long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains unknown, the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has reinforced the importance of 
guaranteeing the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court to clarify past 
cases of enforced disappearances (A/HRC/4/41/Add.1, paras. 61&#8211;63). It has recommended 
that &#8220;habeas corpus procedures that have been suspended in contradiction to the 
Declaration should be reopened and investigations should be effortlessly continued in order 
to endeavour to clarify past cases of enforced disappearances&#8221; (para. 108). In relation to the 
issue of deprivation of liberty, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances has emphasized the importance of the constitutional, legal and regulatory

<p>framework being in full conformity with international standards in order to protect against 
secret detention or disappearance (A/HRC/22/45/Add.2, para. 91). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-derogability of the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention 
before court 
</b></p>
<p>21. In its deliberation No. 9, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stated that the 
prohibition on arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and the right of anyone deprived of his or her 
liberty to bring proceedings before court in order to challenge the lawfulness of the 
detention, are non-derogable, under both treaty law and customary international law 
(A/HRC/22/44, para. 47). That view is consistent with the conclusions of a number of 
human rights mechanisms, as illustrated in the following section which deals with non-
derogability of the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention in the contexts of an armed 
conflict, states of emergency, and counter-terrorism measures. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Non-derogability in armed conflict  
</b></p>
<p>22. International human rights law, and the rights related to liberty and security of the 
person in particular, apply everywhere and at all times, both in peace and in armed conflict, 
at home and abroad. There is agreement that the norms of international human rights 
instruments and customary international law protecting individuals against arbitrary 
detention shall be complied with by Governments in situations of armed conflict 
(A/HRC/16/47, para. 51).11 International human rights law against arbitrary detention 
applies in parallel with the rules of international humanitarian law. International human 
rights law and the law of international armed conflict provide protection for individuals, 
and are complementary in nature. Neither provides authority for detention, and legality 
requires that the grounds (and procedure) be established by national law, in compliance 
with the further requirements of international law. That legal basis must satisfy the 
requirement of non-arbitrariness, and be proportionate, predictable and fair. These human 
rights law channels are not offered by the law of international armed conflict. This is 
particularly manifest given that human rights instruments set up supervisory organs with 
jurisdiction to provide adequate remedies to victims of breaches. When the laws of armed 
conflict were codified in the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the most common type of 
conflict was international armed conflict between States. Non-international armed conflicts 
between a State and non-State armed group, or between two or more non-State armed 
groups, are now the most common form of conflict. The treaty provisions relating to armed 
conflict that are applicable in such conflicts are minimal, and international human rights 
law provides important additional protections, as is clarified in the constant jurisprudence 
of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>23. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) refers to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as one of three instruments binding the States that 
are Parties to them.12 Article 75, paragraph 4, of Protocol I reproduces most of the fair trial 
guarantees provided for in international human rights instruments. As noted in ICRC&#8217;s 
commentaries, in each of these treaties there is a clause permitting derogations from the 
articles in question in times of war.13 Article 75 is not subject to any possibility of 
derogation or suspension and these provisions will play an important role in armed

<p>conflict.14 In Protocol II, it is emphasized in the preamble that &#8220;international instruments 
relating to human rights offer a basic protection to the human person&#8221;. ICRC notes that this 
provision establishes the link between Protocol II and the international instruments on 
human rights.15 
</p>
<p>24. In its advisory opinion of 8 July 1996 on the <i>Legality of the Threat or Use of 
Nuclear Weapons</i>, the International Court of Justice affirmed the applicability of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights during armed conflicts, save through 
the effect of provisions for derogation of any kind to be found in article 4 of the Covenant. 
The Court confirmed its view in its advisory opinion of 9 July 2004 on the<i> Legal 
Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</i> 
(para. 106), and in its judgment of 19 December 2005 on the <i>Case Concerning Armed 
Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo </i>v.<i> Uganda)</i> 
(para. 216). The complementary application of the Covenant and of international 
humanitarian law was addressed by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment 
No. 31 (2004) on the nature of the general legal obligation imposed on States parties to the 
Covenant (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, para. 11; A/HRC/16/47, paras. 39 and 40) and in the 
constant jurisprudence of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-derogability in states of emergency 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention attaches particular importance to 
effective internal control mechanisms over the legality of detention. The remedy of habeas 
corpus is one of the most effective means of preventing and combating arbitrary detention. 
Procedural guarantee must not be suspended or rendered impracticable in states of 
emergency (A/HRC/7/4, para. 64; E/CN.4/1995/31, para. 25 (d)). The Subcommittee on 
Prevention of Torture has recommended that &#8220;the effectiveness and absolute non-
derogability of habeas corpus be guaranteed in states of emergency&#8221; (CAT/OP/HND/1, 
para. 137). In addition, the Committee on Enforced Disappearances has recommended the 
adoption of &#8220;the necessary measures to establish that the right to apply for habeas corpus 
may be neither suspended nor restricted under any circumstances, even when a state of 
emergency or siege has been declared, and to guarantee that any person with a legitimate 
interest may initiate the procedure&#8221; (CED/C/ESP/CO/1, para. 26).  
</p><p>26. The Working Group has, in its constant jurisprudence, adopted the legal analysis in 
the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 29 (2001) on states of emergency 
(article 4), paragraphs 11 and 16. In addition to those rights enumerated in article 4, 
paragraph 2, of the Covenant, certain other rights are non-derogable even during a state of 
emergency, including the right to take proceedings before a court to enable the court to 
decide without delay on the lawfulness of detention. These non-derogable guarantees are 
customary international law binding on States that are not parties to the Covenant, and are 
also peremptory norms of international law.  
</p>
<p>27. In 2006, a report on the situation of detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay was jointly issued 
by a group of special procedures mandate holders, including the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health (E/CN.4/2006/120). The group examined, 
inter alia, whether the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention may be limited,

<p>restricted or derogated from in the context of public emergencies or armed conflict. Relying 
on the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice and on the Human Rights 
Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 29 in which it is stated that &#8220;procedural safeguards may 
never be made subject to measures that would circumvent the protection of non-derogable 
rights&#8221;, it determined that the main elements of article 9 of the Covenant, such as habeas 
corpus, must be fully respected even during states of emergency (E/CN.4/2006/120, 
para. 14).  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Non-derogability and counter-terrorism measures 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Working Group has expressed its concern about the frequent use of various 
forms of administrative detention, entailing restrictions on fundamental rights 
(E/CN.4/2005/6, para. 61). It has noted a further expansion of some States&#8217; recourse to 
emergency legislation diluting the right of habeas corpus or amparo and limiting the 
fundamental rights of persons detained in the context of the fight against terrorism by 
means of new anti-terror or internal security legislation allowing detention for an unlimited 
time or for very long periods, without charge, without the detainees being brought before a 
judge, and without a remedy to challenge the legality of the detention (ibid.). The Working 
Group has observed that this kind of administrative detention, which often is also secret, 
aims at circumventing the legal time limits governing police custody and pretrial detention 
and at depriving the persons concerned of the judicial guarantees recognized to all persons 
suspected or accused of having committed an offence (ibid.). 
</p><p>29. Although it is acknowledged that counter-terrorism measures might require the 
adoption of specific measures limiting certain guarantees, including those relating to 
detention and the right to a fair trial, in a very limited manner, the Working Group has 
repeatedly stressed that in all circumstances deprivation of liberty must remain consistent 
with the norms of international law (E/CN.4/2004/3, para. 84). The right of anyone 
deprived of his or her liberty to bring proceedings before a court in order to challenge the 
legality of the detention is a personal right, which must &#8220;in all circumstances be guaranteed 
by the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts&#8221; (ibid., para. 85). 
30. In numerous cases presented before it in recent years, as well as through information 
received from non-governmental organizations working in the field and national human 
rights institutions, the Working Group has noticed the continued practice by some States of 
using deprivation of liberty without charges or trial or other applicable procedural 
guarantees against persons accused of terrorist acts, contrary to international human rights 
instruments (A/HRC/10/21, para 52). The Working Group has adopted a list of principles 
based on articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and on articles 9 
and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ibid., para. 53). These 
principles guarantee that persons detained under charges of terrorist activities shall enjoy 
the effective right to habeas corpus following their detention. The exercise of the right to 
habeas corpus does not impede on the obligation of the law enforcement authority 
responsible for the decision for detention or maintaining the detention, to present the 
detained person before a competent and independent judicial authority within a reasonable 
time period (ibid., para. 54 (f)). 
31. In the report on the situation of detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay (E/CN.4/2006/120), 
the group of special rapporteurs recalled the jurisprudence of the International Court of 
Justice on the complementarity of international humanitarian law and human rights law as 
well as the affirmation by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 31 
(2004). The group of special rapporteurs stated that &#8220;international obligations regarding the 
struggle against terrorism might make the apprehension and detention of some of these 
persons a duty for all States&#8221; (ibid., para. 26). Drawing on its finding that such deprivation 
of liberty is governed by human rights law, and specifically articles 9 and 14 of the </p>


<p><b> 11</b> 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, this includes the right to challenge the 
legality of detention before a court in proceedings affording fundamental due process 
rights. It concluded that &#8220;any person deprived of his or her liberty must enjoy continued and 
effective access to habeas corpus proceedings, and any limitations to this right should be 
viewed with utmost concern&#8221; (ibid.). 
</p><p>32. More recently, a joint study on global practices in relation to secret detention in the 
context of countering terrorism was prepared by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the Vice-Chair of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention (A/HRC/13/42). They concluded that secret detention was 
irreconcilably in violation of international human rights law, including during states of 
emergency and armed conflict, and in violation of international humanitarian law during 
any form of armed conflict. Secret detention violates the right to personal liberty and the 
prohibition of arbitrary arrest or detention. No jurisdiction should allow for individuals to 
be deprived of their liberty in secret for potentially indefinite periods, outside the reach of 
the law, without the possibility of resorting to legal procedures, including habeas corpus 
(A/HRC/16/47, para. 54). The group of experts underlined the centrality of &#8220;effective 
habeas corpus reviews by independent judicial bodies&#8221; to ensuring respect for the right to 
personal liberty (A/HRC/13/42, para. 292 (b)). The group recommended that &#8220;domestic 
legislative frameworks should not allow for any exceptions from habeas corpus, operating 
independently from the detaining authority and from the place and form of deprivation of 
liberty &#8230; The law should foresee penalties for officials who refuse to disclose relevant 
information during habeas corpus proceedings&#8221; (ibid.). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Exercise of the right by vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>33. Further to the procedural guarantees that apply to all persons deprived of their 
liberty, additional safeguards are necessary for the exercise of the right to challenge the 
lawfulness of detention by particular vulnerable groups, including by child detainees, by 
detained migrants, including asylum seekers, and by persons detained involuntarily on 
health grounds. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Child detainees 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, in article 37 (b), obligates State parties 
to ensure that &#8220;no child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. The 
arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be 
used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time&#8221;. It 
guarantees to every child deprived of his or her liberty &#8220;the right to prompt access to legal 
and other appropriate assistance, as well as the right to challenge the legality of the 
deprivation of his or her liberty before a court or other competent, independent and 
impartial authority, and to a prompt decision on any such action&#8221; (art. 37 (d)).  
</p><p>35. Rule 13 of the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their 
Liberty, on the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention, guarantees that &#8220;juveniles 
deprived of their liberty shall not for any reason related to their status be denied the civil, 
economic, political, social or cultural rights to which they are entitled under national or 
international law, and which are compatible with the deprivation of liberty.&#8221; Rule 7.1 of the 
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice 
(Beijing Rules) calls for the guarantee of basic procedural safeguards at all stages of the 
proceedings, including the right to appeal to a higher authority. The issue of release is to be 
considered by a judge or other competent official or body without delay (rule 10.2). In the </p>


<p>commentary to the Beijing Rules, &#8220;other competent official or body&#8221; is defined as any 
person or institution in the broadest sense of the term, including community boards or 
police authorities having the power to release an arrested person. Rule 20.1 provides that 
&#8220;each case shall from the outset be handled expeditiously, without any unnecessary delay&#8221;. 
The commentary highlights as a paramount concern &#8220;the speedy conduct of formal 
proceedings in juvenile cases&#8221;.  
</p><p>36. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has interpreted the procedural guarantees 
in article 37 (d) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in its general comment No. 10 
(2007) on children&#8217;s rights in juvenile justice. The Committee specifies that the right to 
challenge the legality of the deprivation of liberty includes not only the right to appeal, but 
also the right to access the court, or other competent, independent and impartial authority or 
judicial body, in cases where the deprivation of liberty is an administrative decision. The 
right to a prompt decision means that a decision must be rendered as soon as possible, 
within or not later than two weeks after the challenge is made&#8221; (para. 84). With regard to 
the time limit between the commission of the offence and the decision by the court or other 
competent judicial body, the Committee stipulates that this should be much shorter than 
those set for adults, without compromising the full respect for the human rights of the child 
and legal safeguards (para. 52). The Committee regularly stresses the need for effective 
complaint procedures in general, and calls for the establishment of an &#8220;independent, child-
sensitive and accessible complaint system for children&#8221; within the context of the 
administration of juvenile justice (CRC/C/15/Add.193, para. 62 (j); CRC/C/15/Add.198, 
paras. 51 and 53).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Detained asylum seekers and migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, of 1951, and its 1967 protocol, 
lay down basic minimum standards for the treatment of refugees, including free access to 
the courts of law on the territory of States parties and the ability to submit evidence to clear 
himself, and to appeal to and be represented for the purpose before competent authority or a 
person or persons specifically designated by the competent authority (arts. 16 and 32 (2) of 
the Convention).  
</p><p>38. The Guidelines on the Applicable Criteria and Standards relating to the Detention of 
Asylum Seekers and Alternatives to Detention, of 2012, published by the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees, include respect for the detainee&#8217;s right, either personally 
or through a representative, to challenge the lawfulness of detention before a court of law at 
any time (guideline 7). The guideline places the burden of proof for establishing the 
lawfulness of the detention on the authorities in question and requires that authorities 
establish the legal basis for the detention and justify it according the principles of necessity, 
reasonableness and proportionality, showing that less intrusive means of achieving the 
same objectives have been considered in the individual case (para. 47 (v)). 
39. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has devoted particular attention to the 
situation of detained migrants, including migrants who are undocumented or in an irregular 
situation, asylum seekers awaiting the outcome of their asylum application and failed 
asylum seekers awaiting removal (Working Group opinions 55/2011 and 14/2011). 
Through its annual reports and in its deliberation no. 5 (1999) concerning the situation of 
immigrants and asylum seekers, the Working Group has set out a number of procedural 
guarantees for migrants in detention. In the case of absence, violation, circumvention or 
non-implementation of such procedural guarantees, the Working Group may conclude that 
the custody is arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>40. Procedural guarantees for detained migrants include notification of the custodial 
measure in writing, in a language understood by the asylum seeker or immigrant, stating the 
grounds for the measure, and setting out the conditions under which the asylum seeker or </p>


<p><b> 13</b> 
</p>
<p>immigrant must be able to apply for a remedy to a judicial authority, which shall decide 
promptly on the lawfulness of the measure and, where appropriate, order the release of the 
person concerned (E/CN.4/2000/4, principle 8). Detention must be ordered or approved by 
a judge or a body affording equivalent guarantees of competence, independence and 
impartiality (E/CN.4/1999/63, para. 69). The procedural guarantee of article 9, paragraph 4, 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that migrant detainees 
enjoy the right to challenge the legality of their detention before a court. There should be 
automatic, regular and judicial, not only administrative, review of detention in each 
individual case. Review should extend to the lawfulness of detention and not merely to its 
reasonableness or other lower standards of review. A maximum period of detention must be 
established by law, and upon expiry of that period, the detainee must be automatically 
released (A/HRC/13/30, para. 61). Established time limits for judicial review must be 
obtained in &#8220;emergency situations&#8221; when an exceptionally large number of undocumented 
immigrants enter the territory of a State.  
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group (A/HRC/13/30/Add.2) and the Committee against Torture 
(CAT/C/MRT/CO/1) have called on States parties to provide access to effective judicial 
remedies to challenge the legality of administrative decisions on detention. 
</p>
<p>42. The Human Rights Committee has reiterated its view that the enjoyment of 
Covenant rights is not limited to citizens of States Parties but must also be available to all 
individuals, regardless of nationality or statelessness, such as asylum seekers, refugees, 
migrant workers and other persons who may find themselves in the territory or subject to 
the jurisdiction of the State Party. This is articulated in general comments No. 8 (1982) on 
the right to liberty and security of persons, No. 15 (1986) on the position of aliens under the 
Covenant, and No. 31 (2004) on the nature of the general legal obligation imposed on 
States parties to the Covenant (HRI/GEN/1/Rev.9 (Vol. I) p. 179, paras. 1 and 7; p. 189, 
para. 2; and p. 245, para. 10). The Committee affirmed that &#8220;every decision to keep a 
person in detention should be open to review periodically so that the grounds justifying the 
detention can be assessed&#8221; (CCPR/C/59/D/560/1993, para. 9.4).  
</p><p>43. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, in his 2012 annual report 
on the detention of migrants in an irregular situation (A/HRC/20/24), recalled the statement 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that there should be automatic, regular and 
judicial, not only administrative, review of detention in each individual case, and that 
review should extend to the lawfulness of detention and not merely to its reasonableness or 
other lower standards of review (ibid., para. 23). The Special Rapporteur recommended that 
Governments ensure that procedural safeguards and guarantees established by international 
human rights law and national law are applied to any form of detention (ibid., para. 72 (a)). 
Further, all migrants deprived of their liberty should be informed in a language they 
understand, if possible in writing, of the reasons for the detention and be entitled to bring 
proceedings before a court, so that the court can decide on the lawfulness of the detention. 
Migrants in detention shall be assisted, free of charge, by legal counsel and by an 
interpreter during administrative proceedings. 
</p>
<p>44. Article 16 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families sets out the right to liberty and security of 
person for migrant workers and members of their families and the right not to be subjected 
individually or collectively to arbitrary arrest or detention (paras. 1 and 4). It articulates that 
migrant workers and members of their families who are deprived of their liberty by arrest or 
detention are entitled to take proceedings before a court, in order that that court may decide 
without delay on the lawfulness of their detention and order their release if the detention is 
not lawful (para. 8). In attending such proceedings, they are entitled to have cost-free 
assistance to an interpreter if they cannot understand or speak the language used (ibid.). 
Where it has been determined that migrant workers and members of their families have </p>


<p>been victims of unlawful arrest or detention, the Convention guarantees an enforceable 
right to compensation (para. 9). 
</p><p>45. The Committee on Migrant Workers has elaborated on the content of article 16 of 
the International Convention in its general comment no. 2 (2013) on the rights of migrant 
workers in an irregular situation and members of their families. The Committee has stated 
that the scope of the judicial review cannot be confined to a formal assessment of whether 
the migrant worker concerned entered the State party without a valid entry permit, without 
the possibility of release if the detention is not established by law (ibid., para. 32). Further 
reviews of the continued necessity and lawfulness of the detention should be carried out at 
regular intervals by a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power. 
The burden of proof rests on the detaining authorities to demonstrate that the presumption 
in favour of liberty should be displaced. The migrant worker must have access to legal 
representation and advice, if necessary free of charge, to challenge the lawfulness of 
detention, and have timely access to effective legal remedies (ibid., para. 33; 
CMW/C/BIH/CO/2, para. 26). A claim for compensation may be made where the arrest or 
detention is found unlawful under national or international law and States parties must 
ensure that the right to compensation can be effectively enforced before the competent 
domestic authority (CMW/C/GC/2, para. 35). The Committee cautions States parties to 
ensure that migrant workers and members of their families are not expelled while their 
claim is being considered. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Involuntary detention of persons with a disability 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in article 14, requires 
States Parties to &#8220;ensure that persons with disabilities &#8230; are not deprived of their liberty 
unlawfully or arbitrarily, and that any deprivation of liberty is in conformity with the 
law &#8230; If persons with disabilities are deprived of their liberty through any process, they 
are, on an equal basis with others, entitled to guarantees in accordance with international 
human rights law&#8221;. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in its general 
comment No. 1 on article 12 of the Convention regarding equal recognition before the law, 
has affirmed that respecting the right to legal capacity of persons with disabilities on an 
equal basis includes respecting the right of persons with disabilities to liberty and security 
of the person (paras. 40 and 41). It has drawn attention to the problem of denial of the legal 
capacity of persons with disabilities and their detention in institutions against their will, 
without their consent or with the consent of a substitute decision-maker. This constitutes 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty and violates articles 12 and 14 of the Convention. The 
Committee requires States to refrain from such practices and to establish a mechanism to 
review cases of placement in a residential setting without specific consent. 
</p>
<p>47. The Committee has consistently held that disability is not a legitimate ground under 
international law for depriving persons of their liberty (CRPD/C/SLV/CO/1, paras. 31 and 
32) and that deprivation of liberty solely on the basis of disability is contrary to and violates 
article 14 of the Convention (CRPD/C/PER/CO/1, paras. 28 and 29). Involuntary committal 
or institutionalization on the grounds of disability, or perceived disability, particularly on 
the basis of psychosocial or intellectual disability or perceived psychosocial or intellectual 
disability, is not in compliance with the Convention, and the Committee has called upon 
States to amend laws and to adopt measures to prohibit involuntary committal or 
internment, and to design and implement de-institutionalization strategies 
(CRPD/C/ARG/CO/1/ para. 23; CRPD/C/CHN/CO/1 paras. 25 and 26). The Committee 
has emphasized that no individual can be deprived of his or her liberty against his or her 
will in any kind of mental facility and that States parties are required to ensure that all 
mental health services are provided on the basis of the free and informed consent of the 
person concerned (CRPD/C/AUT/CO/1, paras. 29&#8211;31). States need to provide due process 
of law guarantees and appropriate judicial review to persons with disabilities deprived of </p>


<p><b> 15</b> 
</p>
<p>their liberty as a result of a process in which they have been declared exempt from criminal 
responsibility (CRPD/C/ARG/CO/1, paras. 25 and 26). 
</p><p>48. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has in its constant jurisprudence stated 
that all persons deprived of their liberty on health grounds must have judicial means of 
challenging their detention (E/CN.4/2004/3, para. 87). In its deliberation No. 7 on issues 
related to psychiatric detention, the Working Group stated that preventing mentally 
disabled persons from leaving may, in principle, amount to deprivation of liberty 
(E/CN.4/2005/6, para. 51). When assessing whether the measures taken are in compliance 
with international standards, the vulnerable position of persons affected by (alleged) illness 
has to be duly taken into consideration (E/CN.4/2005/6, para. 57). The Working Group 
applies the following criteria: Article 9, paragraph 4, of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights shall be applied to anyone confined by a court order, administrative 
decision or otherwise in a psychiatric hospital or similar institution on account of his mental 
disorder. In addition, the necessity whether to hold the patient further in a psychiatric 
institution shall be reviewed regularly at reasonable intervals by a court or a competent 
independent and impartial organ, and the patient released if the grounds for his detention do 
not exist any longer. In the review proceedings, his vulnerable position and the need for 
appropriate representation must be taken into consideration (E/CN.4/2005/6, para. 58 (e)).16  
</p>
<p><b> III. Regional legal frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>49. The right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court is enshrined in all of 
the major regional human rights treaties, including the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the Arab Charter on Human 
Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. It is also captured in non-binding 
regional instruments, such as the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and 
Legal Assistance in Africa, the Guidelines on Conditions of Police Custody and Pretrial 
Detention in Africa, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, the 
Principles and Best Practices on the Protection of Persons Deprived of Liberty in the 
Americas, and the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. Furthermore, it been the subject of 
interpretation by the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and 
the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Africa 
</b></p>
<p>50. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, in article 7 (1) (a), guarantees 
&#8220;the right to an appeal to competent national organs against acts violating his fundamental 
rights as recognized and guaranteed by conventions, laws, regulations and customs in 
force&#8221;. In its jurisprudence, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has 
pronounced that &#8220;the writ of habeas corpus was developed as the response of common law 
to arbitrary detention, permitting detained persons and their representatives to challenge 
such detention and to demand that the authority either release or justify all imprisonment&#8221; 
(143/95-150/96: Constitutional Rights Project and Civil Liberties Organization &#8211; Nigeria, 
para. 23). At its fifty-fifth session, the African Commission adopted the Guidelines on 
Conditions of Police Custody and Pre-Trial Detention in Africa (2014);17 under article 
5 (h), upon arrest, persons must be informed of the right to challenge their detention.

<p>51. The Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in 
Africa, adopted by the African Commission in 2003, closely follows article 9, paragraph 4, 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in section M. It details the 
components necessary in order to ensure exercise of the procedural guarantee, including the 
necessity for States to enact legislation to ensure the right. It stipulates that &#8220;anyone 
concerned or interested in the well-being, safety or security of a person deprived of his or 
her liberty has the right to a prompt and effective judicial remedy as a means of 
determining the whereabouts or state of health of such a person and/or identifying the 
authority ordering or carrying out the deprivation of liberty&#8221;. It entrusts judicial bodies to, 
at all times, hear and act upon petitions for habeas corpus, amparo or similar procedures, 
and states that no circumstances whatever must be invoked as a justification for denying the 
right to habeas corpus, amparo or similar procedures. These are defined as &#8220;a legal 
procedure brought before a judicial body to compel the detaining authorities to provide 
accurate and detailed information regarding the whereabouts and conditions of detention of 
a person or to produce a detainee before the judicial body&#8221; (section S (m)).

<p>52. The American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (1948) establishes that 
&#8220;every individual who has been deprived of his liberty has the right to have the legality of 
his detention ascertained without delay by a court, and the right to be tried without undue 
delay or, otherwise, to be released&#8221; (article XXV). Article 7, paragraph 6, of the American 
Convention on Human Rights provides: &#8220;Anyone who is deprived of his liberty shall be 
entitled to recourse to a competent court, in order that the court may decide without delay 
on the lawfulness of his arrest or detention and order his release if the arrest or detention is 
unlawful. In States Parties whose laws provide that anyone who believes himself to be 
threatened with deprivation of his liberty is entitled to recourse to a competent court in 
order that it may decide on the lawfulness of such threat, this remedy may not be restricted 
or abolished. The interested party or another person in his behalf is entitled to seek these 
remedies.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>53. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in advisory opinion OC-8/87 
(30 January 1987) on habeas corpus in emergency situations, stated that the protection is 
among &#8220;those judicial remedies that are essential for the protection of various rights whose 
derogation is prohibited by article 27 (2) and that serve, moreover, to preserve legality in a 
democratic society&#8221;. It is &#8220;a judicial remedy designed to protect personal freedom or 
physical integrity against arbitrary detentions by means of a judicial decree ordering the 
appropriate authorities to bring the detained person before a judge so that the lawfulness of 
the detention may be determined and, if appropriate, the release of the detainee be ordered.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>54. In its jurisprudence, to which the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention gives great 
weight in its own jurisprudence, the Inter-American Court has affirmed &#8220;that the authority 
which decides on the legality of an arrest or detention must be a judge or court; article 7, 
paragraph 6 of the Convention is therefore ensuring judicial control over the deprivation of 
liberty&#8221;.18 &#8220;The review by a judge or a court is a fundamental requirement to guarantee 
adequate control and scrutiny of the administrative acts which affect fundamental rights&#8221;. 
Remedies under article 7, paragraph 6, of the Convention &#8220;must not only exist formally in 
law but must be effective; in other words, they must comply with the objective of obtaining, 
without delay, a decision on the lawfulness of the arrest or detention.&#8221;19 &#8220;Migratory

<p>regulations which did not establish remedies to contest the lawfulness of the arrest and 
detention &#8230; but only established the possibility for the detainee to &#8216;refute the charges&#8217; on 
which his or her deportation was based or to be &#8216;heard regarding the charges indicated in 
the arrest warrant&#8217; or to &#8216;provide evidence opposing the deportation&#8217; are in violation of 
article 7, paragraph 6&#8221;.20 
</p>
<p>55. The Principles and Best Practices on the Protection of Persons Deprived of Liberty 
in the Americas, approved by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2008, 
guarantee that &#8220;all persons deprived of liberty shall have the right, exercised by themselves 
or by others, to present a simple, prompt, and effective recourse before the competent, 
independent, and impartial authorities, against acts or omissions that violate or threaten to 
violate their human rights&#8221; (Principle V). Further, &#8220;persons deprived of liberty shall have 
the right of individual and collective petition and the right to a response before judicial, 
administrative, or other authorities. This right may be exercised by third parties or 
organizations, in accordance with the law&#8221; (Principle VII). 
</p><p>56. The Inter-American Commission stated that it &#8220;cannot overemphasize the 
significance of ensuring effective supervisory control over detention as an effective 
safeguard&#8221;. It noted that the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court 
plays a fundamental role in protecting against arbitrary arrest, clarifying the situation of 
missing persons, and preventing the use of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment as an &#8220;effective assurance that the detainee is not exclusively at the mercy of the 
detaining authority&#8221;. The Commission concluded that &#8220;the requirement that detention not 
be left to the sole discretion of the State agents responsible for carrying it out is so 
fundamental that it cannot be overlooked in any context&#8221; and the procedural guarantee &#8220;is 
not susceptible to abrogation. It applies in all situations of deprivation of liberty&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>57. The Inter-American Commission set out the procedural requirements of the right: a 
judicial authority or a &#8220;quasi-judicial&#8221; board that decides petitions, not an administrative 
body, must have the power to order the detainee to be produced and also to release him or 
her. It must be impartial and different from the authority ordering and implementing the 
detention. A detained person has the right to petition &#8220;at all times&#8221; and the proceedings 
must comply with the fundamental rules of procedural fairness, including &#8220;an opportunity 
to present evidence and to know and meet the claims of the opposing party&#8221;. The detainee 
must have an &#8220;opportunity to be represented by counsel or some other representative&#8221;. The 
proceedings must occur &#8220;without delay&#8221; and &#8220;as soon as practicable&#8221;. The decision to 
detain must be reviewed at regular intervals. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Arab region 
</b></p>
<p>58. Article 14, paragraph 6, of the Arab Charter on Human Rights (2004) guarantees 
that &#8220;anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to petition 
a competent court in order that it may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his arrest 
or detention and order his release if the arrest or detention is unlawful&#8221;. Any victim of 
unlawful arrest or detention is entitled to compensation (art. 14 (7)). The legal protections 
provided for in article 14 of the Charter cannot be derogated from, not even in in times of 
public emergency (art. 4 (1 and 2)).

<p><b> D. ASEAN region 
</b></p>
<p>59. The ASEAN Human Rights Declaration (2012) guarantees the right to personal 
liberty and security and to be free from arbitrary arrest, search, detention, abduction or any 
other form of deprivation of liberty (article 12). In the Phnom Penh Statement adopting the 
Declaration, ASEAN and its member States reiterated their commitment to, inter alia, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments to 
which ASEAN member States are parties.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Europe 
</b></p>
<p>60. Article 5, paragraph 4, of the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) 
provides that &#8220;everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be 
entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided 
speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful&#8221;. Victims of 
unlawful arrest or detention have an enforceable right to compensation (art. 5 (5)). The 
European Court of Human Rights has clarified the right to court review in its extensive 
jurisprudence, to which the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention continues to give great 
weight in its own jurisprudence. The Court has stated that the purpose of article 5, 
paragraph 4, is to grant persons deprived of liberty the right to challenge the interference 
with that right through rapid, effective judicial review of the legality of the measure. The 
right to court review of detention in domestic legislation must be effective and real, 
allowing for accessibility and certainty. The procedure is to be guided by the adversarial 
principle and equality of arms. Generally, this requires a hearing of the detainee before the 
judicial organ, a body independent of the executive, with a guarantee of impartiality and the 
force to implement its decisions. Legal counsel is mandatory in cases of minors, internment 
in psychiatric centres, and cases concerning discretional life sentences. A decision should 
be attained in the shortest time possible. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
European Union recognizes, in article 6, the right to liberty and security, among a range of 
personal, civil, political, economic and social rights of European Union citizens and 
residents, and enshrines them into European Union law.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. National legal frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>61. The 44 responses to the Working Group&#8217;s questionnaire from United Nations 
Member States and the 18 from national human rights institutions are posted on the 
Working Group&#8217;s webpage. A catalogue of Member States&#8217; relevant legal frameworks is 
replicated in tabular format in the annex to the present report. The prohibition of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty and the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to bring 
proceedings before a court in order to challenge the legality of the detention are uniformly 
and generally adopted in the domestic legislation of States, usually in constitutional 
provisions or otherwise recognized to be of a fundamental nature in the domestic legal 
order. The States expressly declare in their replies to the questionnaire that they comply 
with international law, as they do in their reporting to other United Nations human rights 
bodies and in statements in the Human Rights Council and other United Nations organs. In 
these contexts, and in the different forms of State-to-State peer review, it is made clear that, 
whether or not they have ratified the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, 
they regard themselves bound by international law on court review of detention. 
</p>
<p>62. The responses submitted by non-State stakeholders are also posted on the Working 
Group&#8217;s website. These contributions have been taken into account in preparing the draft 
principles and guidelines on the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention. The </p>


<p><b> 19</b> 
</p>
<p>Working Group would like to acknowledge the very comprehensive contribution made by 
Oxford Pro Bono Publico at the University of Oxford, which submitted &#8220;Remedies and 
procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to 
bring proceedings before a court: a comparative and analytical review of State practice&#8221; 
(April 2014). This has been of particular assistance to the Working Group in establishing 
State practice and the requisite <i>opinio juris</i>. 
63. The Working Group recalls the statement by the International Court of Justice in 
<i>Jurisdictional Immunities</i>: &#8220;It is of course axiomatic that the material of customary 
international law is to be looked for primarily in the actual practice and <i>opinio juris</i> of 
States, even though multilateral conventions may have an important role to play in 
recording and defining rules deriving from custom, or indeed in developing them &#8230; In the 
present context, State practice of particular significance is to be found in the judgments of 
national courts&#8221;.21 In deliberation No. 9 (2012) concerning the definition and scope of 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary international law,22 the Working Group 
adopted the approach to formation of customary international law currently restated in the 
work of the International Law Commission (A/CN.4/663) and reflected in the request by 
the Human Rights Council to produce the present report. When the Working Group applies 
the law, and when it finds violations of human rights obligations, it is bound by the general 
method of international law, in treaty interpretation and the application of customary 
international law. In addition to the materials presented in the present report to the Human 
Rights Council, important sources of international law can be found in the Council&#8217;s own 
procedures and their outcomes, with the additional reporting and peer-review procedures, 
including those of the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b>64. <b>The present report demonstrates how the procedural guarantee has been 
developed in different international instruments, in regional legal frameworks, and in 
the domestic law of States from a diversity of legal traditions. The reaffirmation and 
clarification of the due process safeguard is a feature of international treaties and 
domestic legislation, the jurisprudence of international human rights mechanisms, 
including treaty bodies and special procedure mandate holders, regional human rights 
mechanisms and national courts. The procedural guarantee is viewed as an essential 
component of the due process rights that are necessary to protect the right to liberty 
and security of the person in all situations of deprivation of liberty and to prevent 
arbitrary arrest, detention or exile, enforced disappearance, or risk of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The review of legal 
frameworks further confirms that, where it has been determined that the fundamental 
rights of the detainee have been violated, such wrongs demand a remedy.</b>  
</p>
<p>65. <b>The extensive survey undertaken of the relevant sources shows that the right to 
challenge the lawfulness of detention and the right to a remedy where there is a wrong 
is supported by uniform international practice, State practice and the <i>opinio juris</i> of 
States. It shows not only the existence of customary norms of international law that 
apply <i>erga omnes</i>, but also that these norms are peremptory rules, <i>jus cogens</i>, in

to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 17 June 2013, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, in its capacity as Secretariat of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, 
transmitted a Note Verbale to the Permanent Missions to the United Nations and to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva informing them that, in accordance with Human Rights 
Council resolution 20/16 of 6 July 2012, paragraph 10, the Working Group is in the process 
of preparing draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right 
of anyone deprived of his or her liberty to challenge the lawfulness of detention before 
court.  
</p>
<p>2. As these principles and guidelines are being developed with the aim of assisting 
Member States in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty in 
compliance with international human rights law, the Working Group was directed by the 
Council, in paragraph 11(a) of res. 20/16, to seek the views of Governments in their 
preparation. The Working Group thereby transmitted a questionnaire, requesting 
Governments to provide, inter alia, how Article 9(4) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights is incorporated into their domestic legislation. States not party to the 
International Covenant were requested to provide the legal framework regulating the right 
of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to bring proceedings before 
court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his or her 
detention. 
</p>
<p>3. The questionnaire was completed and returned to the Working Group by 44 Member 
States. As notified, all replies have been posted on the web page of the Working Group and 
made available to the public.23 The entire responses have been taken in to account in 
developing the draft principles and guidelines. Reproduced in tabular format below are only 
the national legal provisions incorporating article 9 (4) of the International Covenant, or the 
abovementioned right, in to domestic law.
