<p> From 23 to 26 July 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the human right to water and 
sanitation conducted an official visit to Kiribati, aiming to examine the situation of the 
human rights to water and sanitation in the country. Kiribati is facing enormous challenges 
in realizing the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation due to, inter alia, its 
geographic and financial difficulties, which are aggravated by adverse effects of climate 
change. The country must urgently address the essential issues of sanitation and hygiene in 
order to reduce the large number of preventable infant and child deaths. Kiribati has been 
working hard with the international community to improve its water and sanitation 
situation. It should, however, take greater ownership of the efforts being undertaken with 
the support of international donors, and ensure access to water and sanitation as one of the 
most important adaptation measures. Adaptation plans should place the human rights to 
water and sanitation at the centre in order to respond to people&#8217;s actual needs without 
discrimination.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. From 23 to 26 July 2012, the Special Rapporteur on the human right to water and 
sanitation conducted an official visit to Kiribati, aiming to examine the situation of the 
human rights to water and sanitation in the country. During the mission, she met with 
different interlocutors, including the Minister of Education; the Permanent Secretary of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration; and officials of the Ministry of Public Works 
and Utilities, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Internal and Social Affairs, and the 
Public Utilities Board. She visited several communities in South Tarawa and talked to 
people about their access to water, sanitation and hygiene. She met with civil society 
organizations and development partners. She also met with representatives of the Australian 
Agency for International Development (AusAID), the New Zealand Aid Programme, the 
Japan International Cooperation Agency and the European Union, as well as with the 
United Nations Country Team and the Applied Geoscience and Technology Division 
(SOPAC) of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community in Suva. The Special Rapporteur 
expresses her appreciation to the Government of Kiribati for the cooperation extended in 
organizing and facilitating the visit. She also extends her special thanks to SOPAC and to 
the United Nations Country Team. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to express her 
gratitude to the people from South Tarawa she met with, who shared with her their stories 
and challenges, but also hopes, in relation to access to water, sanitation and hygiene.  
</p>
<p>2. Kiribati consists of 32 low-lying atolls and one elevated coral island, spread over 
3.5 million square kilometres of ocean. The distance between the capital, Tarawa, and outer 
islands can be more than 3,000 km. The remoteness of Kiribati itself and distances between 
the capital and the country&#8217;s outer islands make the management of water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>services a considerable challenge. Kiribati is one of the five countries and territories in the 
world that are comprised entirely of low-lying atolls.1 The atolls are no higher than 3 to 4 
metres above sea level and are a few hundred metres wide on average. Natural resources, 
including soil for agricultural development and freshwater sources, are limited on these 
narrow and flat atoll islands. One of the officials described the situation of Kiribati as 
follows: &#8220;We are living on a &#8216;ship&#8217; where water is limited&#8221;. This unique geography exposes 
most of the people directly to extreme weather events, which are intensified by climate 
change. Some communities on some of the outer islands, such as Abaiang, have already 
been forced to relocate due to coastal erosion, which is occurring as a consequence of 
climate change. Due to internal migration and natural population growth, nearly half of the 
country&#8217;s total population (103,000) currently lives in South Tarawa. Some towns in South 
Tarawa, such as Betio, are among the most densely populated single-story areas in the 
world, with 6,600 inhabitants per square kilometre. These circumstances are putting 
extreme stress on water resources and the infrastructure.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>3. At the international level, the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
derives from the right to an adequate standard of living, which is provided for in, inter alia, 
article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 11 of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This right was also explicitly 
recognized by the General Assembly and reaffirmed by the Human Rights Council in 
</p>
<p>  
 1  These are: Kiribati, Maldives, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu, as well as Tokelau. See J. Barnett and 
</p>
<p>W.N. Adger, &#8220;Climate dangers and atoll countries&#8221;, <i>Climatic Change</i>, vol. 61, No. 3 (December 
2003), p. 322. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>2010.2 The human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation can be defined as the 
entitlement of everyone to water and sanitation that is safe, available, accessible, affordable 
and acceptable. These rights must be guaranteed in a non-discriminatory manner, and the 
State is obliged to take concrete and targeted steps towards ensuring universal access to 
water and sanitation to the maximum of available resources, including international 
assistance and cooperation. Water must be safe for human consumption, and sanitation 
facilities must safely prevent human and animal contact with human excreta. The 
realization of these rights also requires ensuring access to adequate and affordable hygiene 
practices, including hand washing and menstrual hygiene management with dignity. 
Effective measures must be taken to avoid the infiltration of human and animal waste into 
the groundwater or into other water sources. Furthermore, appropriate mechanisms must be 
implemented to deal with the effects of climate change, including emergencies or natural 
disasters that might affect these human rights. 
</p>
<p>4. Kiribati has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, with 
reservations to the latter on articles 24, paragraph 2 (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f); 26; and 28, 
paragraph 1 (b), (c) and (d), (on health, social security and education, respectively).3 While 
the Government of Kiribati explained to the Special Rapporteur that it had decided to 
withdraw the reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, its decision has not 
been officially transmitted to the Secretary-General. The Special Rapporteur strongly 
encourages the Government of Kiribati to clarify this issue as soon as possible, in particular 
since article 24 (c) places a specific obligation on the State to combat disease and 
malnutrition by providing clean drinking water. As a State party to these treaties, Kiribati 
has an obligation to fulfil the human rights to water and sanitation specifically, under article 
14, paragraph 2 (h), of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and article 24 (c) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, bearing in 
mind the openly affirmed intention of the Government to withdraw its reservation to the 
latter.  
</p>
<p>5. Kiribati is not yet a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the other core 
human rights treaties; and is strongly advised to accede to those. By becoming a State party 
to the international human rights treaties, which lay down States&#8217; legal obligations, the 
</p>
<p>Government will undertake to implement domestic measures and legislation compatible 
with its treaty obligations and duties. In any case, Kiribati has been a State Member of the 
United Nations since September 1999, which obliges the country to respect the Charter of 
the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which enshrines the 
right to an adequate standard of living, including the human right to safe drinking water and 
sanitation. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a constitutional document of the 
United Nations and is part of customary international law.  
</p>
<p>6. A first and crucial step that any Government must take in order to ensure the human 
rights to water and sanitation is to recognize them in an international context and at the 
national level. Kiribati supported the outcome document of the United Nations Conference 
</p>
<p>

 3  Declaration by Kiribati on the Convention on the Rights of the Child: &#8220;The Republic of Kiribati 
</p>
<p>considers that a child&#8217;s rights as defined in the Convention, in particular the rights defined in articles 
12-16 shall be exercised with respect for parental authority, in accordance with the Kiribati customs 
and traditions regarding the place of the child within and outside the family.&#8221; Available from 
http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-

</b></p>
<p>on Sustainable Development (Rio+20 Conference), entitled &#8220;The future we want&#8221;,4 which 
reaffirmed this fundamental human right. This positive evolution should now be explicitly 
reaffirmed and further developed nationally.  
</p>
<p>7. The human rights to water and sanitation are not explicitly affirmed in the provisions 
of the Constitution of Kiribati, which provides in its chapter II, entitled &#8220;Protection of 
Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual&#8221;, for the protection of the rights to life 
and to personal liberty and for protection from inhuman treatment and from discrimination. 
Nowhere in the text of the Constitution is there an explicit reference to the recognition and 
protection of economic, social and cultural rights. The Special Rapporteur thus calls on the 
Government to consider widening the scope of the Constitution to explicitly protect not 
only the human rights to water and sanitation, but also other economic, social and cultural 
rights that are contemplated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, such as the rights to 
education, health, food, social security and housing. The explicit recognition of these rights 
seems crucial in a country that is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and whose 
Constitution provides every person with the fundamental rights and freedoms of the 
individual &#8211; which cannot be fully realized nor enjoyed with no clear and full protection of 
socioeconomic rights.  
</p>
<p>8. Furthermore, the definition of discrimination included in the country&#8217;s Constitution 
limits its scope to practices by which people are afforded a different treatment due to their 
&#8220;race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex&#8221; (art. 3). This is a much 
narrower definition than the one contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or 
core international human rights treaties, where discrimination is defined as any distinction 
based on &#8220;race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status&#8221;.5 The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government 
of Kiribati to broaden the concept of discrimination contained in its Constitution, so as to 
reflect international norms and consensus on this matter.  
</p>
<p>9. There is no national human rights institution in Kiribati. Kiribati considers a 
regional human rights institution more appropriate at this time. Nevertheless, the Special 
Rapporteur calls on the country to accept the recommendations made in this regard under 
the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council held in 2010 (A/HRC/15/3, 
para. 66) and to establish its own national human rights institution that complies with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (Paris Principles).  
</p>
<p>10. Kiribati does not have a comprehensive law to govern the provision of water and 
sanitation. Neither does it have a comprehensive law regarding the management and 
conservation of water resources, and the existing regulations are fragmented. While the 
country has a building code that regulates rainwater harvesting, there has been no 
enforcement mechanism and many of its provisions are simply not implemented. As a 
result, the full potential of rainwater harvesting is not realized. In the recommendations 
contained in the legislation analysis conducted by the Government of Kiribati in 2004, it is 
noted that the formulation of comprehensive water resources legislation would be 
extremely advantageous.6 In order to establish a clear legal framework for the provision of 
water and sanitation and the management of water resources and wastewater, an essential 
first step is to implement the human rights to water and sanitation. A clear legal framework

</p>
<p>could formalize the current management of water resources by a wide range of agencies in 
Kiribati, clarify responsibilities regarding the provision of sanitation services, and regulate 
the monitoring of and reporting on water quality.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Institutional structure and policy framework for water and 
sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>11. At the policy level, Kiribati has adopted the National Development Strategy 2003-
2007 and the Kiribati Development Plan 2012-2015, which contain some policies and goals 
that are of direct relevance to the water and sanitation sectors, namely improving the supply 
and quality of water, ensuring the sustainability of water resources, promoting community 
participation for better use of water resources, rehabilitating and expanding existing water 
systems, improving the collection, storage, treatment and distribution of water and 
rehabilitating the sanitation systems. In the Kiribati Development Plan 2012-2015, water 
and sanitation are addressed in the context of an analysis of the 2009 Kiribati Demographic 
Health Survey. According to the survey, while about 90 per cent of households have access 
to an improved water source, some houses have inadequate sanitation facilities and share 
toilets.7 This base analysis itself is far from the reality that the Special Rapporteur observed 
during her mission, which will be discussed further in the sections below. In the 
Development Plan, poor quality of water is addressed mainly under the chapter on 
environment, focusing only on the consolidation of monitoring programmes and on water 
protection and conservation. Poor coverage and deficient maintenance of water and 
sanitation infrastructures are addressed under the chapter on infrastructure, in which the 
Government focuses on encouraging and enhancing community participation in 
maintaining national infrastructure and increasing financial support for coverage and 
maintenance. The Development Plan does not identify any links between these water and 
sanitation issues and the high infant and child mortality rates referred to under its chapter 
on health.  
</p>
<p>12. Kiribati adopted a National Water Resources Policy and a National Sanitation Policy 
in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Combined, these documents contain 40 short- to medium-
term priority strategies for implementation in the first 3 years following the adoption of the 
respective policy, and an additional 27 priority actions to be undertaken in the subsequent 3 
to 10 years. Both policies cover many of the normative contents of the human rights to 
water and sanitation and some human rights principles, such as participation &#8211; even though 
they do not include a specific reference to human rights &#8211; and provide a broad overview of 
important issues to be addressed. The National Sanitation Implementation Plan &#8211; a 10-year 
plan based on the National Sanitation Policy &#8211; includes more concrete objectives and 
activities.  
</p>
<p>13. It seems, however, that the Government of Kiribati itself needs to process these 
comprehensive policies and break them down into concrete and feasible action plans, taking 
into consideration its own financial and human capacities. While all the priority issues 
contained in these policies are important, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the 
priority-setting was overambitious, unfocused and seemingly lacking in national ownership. 
The priorities set for the first three years have yet to be implemented. The current review of 
these policies is a key opportunity for the Government to identify more targeted and 
achievable priorities. This exercise should be undertaken by the Government itself so as to 
enable it to take ownership of its own policies and translate its commitment into action. 
Adopting and implementing a national water and sanitation strategy and plan of action

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>covering the entire population and all the dimensions of the human rights to water and 
sanitation, as well as addressing some of the existing gaps, would be another crucial step. 
Such a strategy and plan of action should be devised, and periodically reviewed, on the 
basis of a participatory and transparent process.  
</p>
<p>14. In terms of the institutional structure regarding water and sanitation in Kiribati, the 
National Strategic Policy and Risk Assessment Unit, under the Office of Te Beretitenti (the 
President), coordinates government and community activity relating to water and sanitation. 
(Unfortunately the Special Rapporteur did not have an opportunity to meet with 
representatives of the Office.) The Public Utilities Board, under the Ministry of Public 
Works and Utilities and as per the Public Utilities Ordinance of 1977, has extensive powers 
over water supply, sanitation and electricity in South Tarawa and in some parts of North 
Tarawa. The Ministry&#8217;s Water Unit has the primary responsibility for the provision of 
water. However, none of the government institutions, at this stage, has a specific 
responsibility for sanitation and hygiene promotion. The Water Unit has been slowly 
incorporating the work relating to sanitation services and there is a plan to formally broaden 
its competences in 2013, so as to also cover sanitation. The Water Unit is playing the role 
of regulator as well, without a clear mandate provided by law. The Ministry of Health and 
Medical Services carries out monitoring of water quality and health inspectorate services. 
The Department of Public Utilities within that ministry sets the standard of water quality 
and monitors water quality but without a sound legal mandate to carry out such monitoring. 
The only related provision in the Public Health Regulations of 1926 is one requiring that 
guttering and downpipes be kept clean and &#8220;efficient&#8221;. The Ministry of Environment, Lands 
and Agricultural Development is responsible for carrying out environmental impact 
assessments for major water resource developments and sanitation and waste disposal 
projects. Island councils play a key role in the implementation of rural water and sanitation 
schemes. Allocating clear responsibilities in the water and sanitation sectors at the national 
level, including the establishment of an independent regulator, is another urgent step that 
the Government must take to realize the human rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The human rights to water and sanitation in Kiribati 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Water 
</b></p>
<p>15. In 2011, 66 per cent of the population of Kiribati had access to an improved water 
source.8 Only South Tarawa and Christmas Island have public water supply infrastructures 
and are partially connected to a water network. This supply is usually provided only every 
other day for two hours per day. The rest of the population in South Tarawa and Christmas 
Island relies on rainwater supplies and well water. Another type of source is fresh 
groundwater lenses (see para. 17 below), which are the main sources of potable water for 
people on the outer islands, although the primary source of water supply varies between and 
within islands. People on outer islands also rely on open wells and unprotected rain 
catchment systems.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Availability 
</b></p>
<p>16. Human rights law requires that water is available continuously and in a sufficient 
quantity to meet the requirements of drinking and personal hygiene, as well as of additional 
personal and domestic uses, such as cooking and food preparation, the washing of dishes 
</p>
<p>  
 8  WHO and United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), <i>Progress on Sanitation and Drinking Water: 
</i></p>
<p><i>2013 Update</i> (Geneva, 2013), p. 23. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>and laundry, and cleaning.9 Neither continuity nor the exact quantity required can be 
determined in the abstract, since individual requirements for water consumption vary, for 
instance due to climatic conditions, level of physical activity and personal health 
conditions. Regarding the necessary quantity, estimates and international recommendations 
can provide broad guidance for assessing whether the availability criterion is being met. For 
instance, it has been estimated that all domestic needs can be met with about 100 litres per 
capita per day.10 An absolute minimum amount in the context of disaster response is set at 
15 litres per capita per day.11 However, such an amount raises health concerns, as it is 
insufficient to meet hygiene requirements, and must not be understood to correspond to the 
full realization of the right to water. 
</p>
<p>17. As a country of atoll islands, freshwater sources in Kiribati are limited to shallow 
groundwater, rainwater and desalinated water. The viability of groundwater in low atolls as 
a source of fresh water is determined by the thickness of freshwater lenses. Such 
groundwater lenses, which are often found in small coral islands or atolls, consist of a layer 
of rainwater floating above more saline sea water. Thin freshwater lenses are vulnerable to 
rainfall variability and over-extraction.  
</p>
<p>18. There is only a partial picture of the availability of fresh water in Kiribati, and most 
of the information is limited to the situations on Tarawa and Christmas Island. The 
availability of water in South Tarawa is of particular concern. An increasing population is 
putting additional stress on water resources as well as on the infrastructure. Between 1995 
and 2000, there was significant internal migration of people from the outer islands to South 
Tarawa, resulting in an urban growth rate of 5.2 per cent, compared with a national growth 
rate of 1.7 per cent. According to SOPAC, the combined sustainable yield of the two major 
groundwater sources, Bonriki and Buota, in South Tarawa, is 2,010 kilolitres (kl) per day. 
With estimated system losses of 40 per cent of this yield, the available water supply is 
1,206 kl per day. The population of South Tarawa, as measured in 2010, is approximately 
50,000; thus, the available water from groundwater sources, if evenly distributed, currently 
amounts to 24 litres per person per day. With an estimated 5 per cent increase in population 
from 2010, by 2025 the estimated available freshwater will amount to only 11.6 litres per 
person per day. This is far below the minimum amount of water needed to meet people&#8217;s 
most basic needs.12 Such a scenario demonstrates that even with a relatively modest 
increase in population growth, South Tarawa will face significant constraints with respect 
to drinking water available for the population. SOPAC experts stressed that it was essential 
to remember that the groundwater reserve was providing 2 million litres of fresh water per 
day and that it would be impossible to ensure a sustainable provision of freshwater without 
the protection of these groundwater resources, even though desalination and improvements 
to rainwater harvesting would contribute to some increases in available water.  
</p>
<p>19. A lack of confidence in a regular water supply, together with a lack of incentives 
and awareness of the necessity of saving water, contribute to water losses, as people are not 
sure what time the water will be available and keep the water tap open. The Public Utilities 
Board estimates that water system losses represent up to 40 per cent of the water supply in

identify 20 litres per day as basic access, but note that this does not guarantee crucial hygiene 
requirements (<i>Domestic Water Quantity</i>, p. 22). 
</p>
<p> 12 According to assessments by WHO, between 50 and 100 litres of water per person per day are needed 
to ensure that most basic needs are met and few health concerns arise. </p>

<p>South Tarawa. Taking into account waste and unlawful connections, the total losses are 
estimated to represent nearly 70 per cent of the supply. 
</p>
<p>20. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and SOPAC discovered through a joint assessment that, if 
adequate rain falls during part of the year, there should be sufficient water resources to 
provide drinking water for all I-Kiribati (Kiribati people). The challenge, rather, is the 
distribution of water and the prevention of a degradation of the small freshwater lenses used 
for washing, sanitation and agriculture.13 Monitoring activities, in particular the collection 
of information on the salinity of the water in the lenses, are essential to assessing the 
condition of the lenses, for example to evaluate whether over-extraction is occurring. There 
is, however, no such regular and analysable monitoring of salinity data, thus it is difficult to 
assess the recharge level and sustainability of those important water sources.14  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Desalination of water 
</b></p>
<p>21. Due to the very limited available freshwater sources in Kiribati, the option of 
desalination has been tried, but with few successes. The operation costs of desalination 
plants are very high due to the need for large amounts of reliable power supply, and the 
maintenance requires high technical capacity. On a small, isolated island, it is a great 
challenge to maintain desalination plants. Of the five desalination plants installed in 
Kiribati in the past few years, only one &#8211; on Banaba Island &#8211; is operational, and only 
partially.15 Despite these negative experiences, the Asian Development Bank and AusAID 
are implementing a desalination project under the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility.

AusAID and the New Zealand Aid Programme, citing an assessment that was carried out, 
indicates that desalination is the most cost-effective solution only if it can be managed and 
maintained over a period of longer than 10 years. According to information the Special 
Rapporteur received during the mission, the capital investments in the four planned 
desalination plants will amount to 9.5 million Australian dollars ($A), and the estimated 
cost of a maintenance contract is $A 200,000 per year. Moreover, electricity costs to run the 
desalination plants will reach $A 2.2 million per year. According to the Public Utilities 
Board, the cost of a cubic metre of desalinated water will be US$ 20 (the water itself 
costing US$ 5 and the distribution, including pumping, amounting to US$ 15).  
</p>
<p>22. In any case, if desalinated water is to become a viable and sustainable option in 
Kiribati, the Government must seriously consider all the implications of this choice &#8211; in 
particular regarding the impact that the operation and maintenance of desalination systems 
will have on the national budget, and what effects it will have on the price that citizens pay 
for water. The Special Rapporteur learned during the mission that desalinated water is not 
economically sustainable without major subsidies by the Government. In this context, the 
affordability of water has to be taken into account as a priority when selecting the most 
appropriate solutions. On the other hand, a solution has to be found that is financially viable 
and sustainable for a country with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$ 163 million. An 
ideal solution would consist of a combination of investments aimed at (a) increasing the 
country&#8217;s water harvesting and storage capacity; (b) boosting the protection and 
conservation of groundwater sources; and (c) prioritizing the substantial reduction of 
leakages and other losses of piped water in South Tarawa. Following the implementation of

</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>those three measures, and provided that further water resources are needed in the country, 
more limited investments for desalination could be undertaken.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Affordability and sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>23. The normative content of the human rights to water and sanitation requires that 
sanitation and water facilities and services must be affordable to all people. The direct and 
indirect costs and charges associated with securing water must be affordable, and must not 
compromise or limit people&#8217;s capacity to acquire other basic goods and services guaranteed 
by human rights, such as food, housing, health services and education. However, 
affordability does not necessarily require services to be provided free of charge. When 
people are unable, for reasons beyond their control, to gain access to sanitation or water 
through their own means, the State is obliged to find solutions for ensuring this access.  
</p>
<p>24. At the same time, sustainability is particularly relevant to issues concerning water 
and sanitation. Water networks or other sources of water delivery may be built, but in the 
absence of corresponding capacity-building to maintain such infrastructure, the ongoing 
needs of the community in question will not be met. Economic sustainability requires, inter 
alia, that, in addition to the initial investment, the costs of ongoing operation, management 
and investment must be taken into consideration from the planning phase onwards in order 
to ensure the continued functioning of the system. One source of income in this regard is 
user fees. However, measures to achieve economic sustainability must take into account the 
equality aspect of ensuring that the poorest segments of the population can still afford these 
services. The availability of skilled labour and affordable spare parts for operation and 
maintenance are just as important. In that context, good practices could include building the 
capacity of the local community, or of the local private sector, to maintain facilities after a 
project initiated by development agencies or civil society organizations is terminated.  
</p>
<p>25. As another element in ensuring the economic sustainability of water systems, while 
respecting the principle of affordability, tariff structures can be implemented which ensure 
that those who can afford it contribute to the sustainability of the system, and that those 
who cannot afford it receive assistance from the State. In the case of South Tarawa, there is 
currently a flat rate tariff system; the fee is US$ 10 per month per connection. The Public 
Utilities Board conducted a survey and discovered that 67 per cent of water is lost through 
constant system losses, such as leakages, as well as through illegal connections and waste 
(see also para. 19 above). There is no systematic way of collecting the tariff, and the Public 
Utilities Board has not been able to collect enough fees to recover the cost. This flat and 
unenforced tariff is also a disincentive for the people to save water.  
</p>
<p>26. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Public Utilities Board was 
discussing the new tariff system, particularly in relation to desalination plants, and 
considering the introduction of a tariff that would be metred and proportional to the actual 
consumption. The human right to water does not require the provision of free water; 
however, for the right to be fulfilled, water must be affordable to all. While the introduction 
of the new tariff system could be a good incentive to save water and could help ensure the 
long-term sustainability of the water system, there should be a thorough discussion on the 
affordability of water to all residents of South Tarawa, as well as the possibility of 
introducing social tariffs or creating subsidies for water services &#8211; a priority when selecting 
adaptation measures for the water sector. This is particularly relevant given that much of 
the population on South Tarawa lives under the poverty line.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur fully shares the view of SOPAC that in order to ensure a 
sustainable supply of drinking water, the Government, together with the international 
community, should make the utmost effort to preserve the precious groundwater resources 
and further explore and map available groundwater resources. In parallel, the Government 
should focus on tackling system and other losses. There is also room for improvement with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>regard to rainwater harvesting. With respect to the preservation of the groundwater sources, 
measures should be urgently taken to, inter alia, improve the sanitation system to prevent 
further contamination. The Kiribati Adaptation Program (KAP) Phase III refers to the issue 
of water leakages, and the Government is working with an international expert to address 
the problem. Tackling water losses includes implementing an appropriate tariff system that 
is acceptable to and affordable for the people. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Quality 
</b></p>
<p>28. While the most recent estimates indicate that 66 per cent of the population in 
Kiribati uses improved water sources, the number of people relying on water of poor 
quality is unfortunately estimated to be much higher. To meet the standards of the relevant 
human rights, water must be safe, that is, of a quality that does not pose a threat to human 
health. In its Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
defines safe drinking water as water that &#8220;does not represent any significant risk to health 
over a lifetime of consumption, including different sensitivities that may occur between life 
stages&#8221; (p. 1). The current monitoring of access to water under the Millennium 
Development Goals is based on the assumption that improved sources, such as piped 
connections, protected wells and rainwater collection, are likely to provide safe water. This, 
however, is not always the case. The drinking water obtained from many improved sources 
is in fact unsafe, with potentially adverse consequences for health.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur was very worried and shocked by the high infant mortality 
rate (43 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2009), as well as by the under-five child mortality 
rate (75 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2009),16 which is the highest in the Pacific region. 
Waterborne diseases are increasingly common, diarrhoeal diseases are endemic and 
outbreaks of typhoid occur annually. Apart from perinatal conditions, diarrhoeal diseases 
and pneumonia are the main causes of child mortality, and malnutrition is a major 
contributing factor.17 Furthermore, unsafe water has other profound effects on people&#8217;s 
health and, as a result, on their capacity to attend school, work or otherwise participate in 
society. The transmission of waterborne diseases via contaminated water must be avoided.  
</p>
<p>30. Water quality in Kiribati is a constant concern, given the contamination of the water 
network and wells by seepage from septic tanks and other types of pollution. Furthermore, 
saltwater intrusion, aggravated by the rising sea level and king tides, into underground 
freshwater sources is affecting water quality and availability. The Government has also 
acknowledged that &#8220;the quantity of freshwater in the country is limited, demand is 
increasing and the quality of water is especially vulnerable&#8221;.18  
</p>
<p>31. Despite the recognition of serious problems regarding water quality, the Special 
Rapporteur was surprised to learn that water quality testing had not been conducted as 
regularly as it should be because of the complexity of funding and procurement 
mechanisms. At the time of her visit, no water testing had been carried out at all in the 
country during the previous six months, according to information gathered during the 
mission. The monitoring of water quality should be included in the Government budget as 
one of the core activities, to ensure regular testing. The fact that none of the Government 
institutions is responsible for sanitation and hygiene promotion is a contributing factor to 
the high mortality rates.

</p>
<p><b> B. Sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>32. Only 39 per cent of the population in Kiribati had access to improved sanitation 
facilities as of 2011.19  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Availability, accessibility and quality 
</b></p>
<p>33. The human right to sanitation requires that there must be a sufficient number of 
sanitation facilities (with associated services) within, or in the immediate vicinity of, each 
household, health or educational institution, public institutions and places, and the 
workplace (availability); that sanitation facilities must be hygienically safe to use, which 
means that they must effectively prevent human, animal and insect contact with human 
excreta (quality); and that sanitation facilities must be physically accessible for everyone 
within, or in the immediate vicinity of, each household, health or educational institution, 
public institutions and places, and the workplace (accessibility).  
</p>
<p>34. However, only approximately 2,000 households on South Tarawa are connected to a 
waterborne sewage system; most of the population rely on deficient septic tanks, or use the 
beach, the sea or the bush as toilets. Due to the limited fresh water, seawater is provided for 
toilet flushing, and that damages the sewer pipes. The lack of sanitation services is most 
pronounced in rural Kiribati, where four of every five households use non-improved 
sanitation facilities. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Open defecation 
</b></p>
<p>35. Open defecation is a common practice &#8211; 37 per cent of the population practiced it as 
at 2011.20 In South Tarawa, more than 60 per cent of people defecate on the beach, despite 
it being illegal to do so. The situation of the lack of sanitation services is most pronounced 
in rural Kiribati and urban high-density areas such as South Tarawa, leading to a prevalence 
of diarrhoea in children under 5. Women and girls experience the lack of sanitation 
differently. They must go to the beach, sea or bushes very early in the morning so that they 
are less exposed. With respect to menstruation, women and girls have no facilities to clean 
themselves hygienically with privacy.   
</p>
<p><b> 3. Menstrual hygiene management 
</b></p>
<p>36. Sanitation in schools remains a problem, particularly on the outer islands.21 It is 
common for adolescent girls to miss three days of school per month because sanitary pads 
are unaffordable for many families, and also because toilets in schools are not equipped 
with menstrual hygiene facilities or not properly maintained. It is also increasingly common 
for women and girls to use disposable baby nappies during menstruation because they last 
longer and are cheaper. In addition to the hygienic concern of using the same baby nappy 
all day, their disposal is a problem in atoll islands; Kiribati has no land on which to dump 
wastes and does not recycle its waste.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>37. The human right to sanitation requires that access to sanitation facilities and 
services, including the construction, emptying and maintenance of facilities, as well as 
</p>
<p>  
 19  See also WHO and UNICEF, <i>Progress </i>(footnote 8 above), p. 22. 
 20  WHO and UNICEF, <i>Progress</i>, p. 22. 
 21  UNICEF has implemented a water and sanitation programme in Abemama and built toilets for girls 
</p>
<p>and boys. As part of awareness-raising on hand washing, it conducted a survey on the sale of soap on 
the island. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>treatment and disposal of faecal matter, must be available at a price that is affordable for all 
people without limiting their capacity to acquire other basic goods and services, including 
water, food, housing, health care and education, guaranteed by other human rights. 
</p>
<p>38. A vast majority of the population do not have access to adequate sanitation; access 
depends not only on geographic location but also on wealth, which is distributed unevenly 
in Kiribati. One study indicates that 20 per cent of the households and almost 25 per cent of 
the population may live below the national minimum cost of living or basic needs poverty 
line.22 Poor citizens living in the outer islands already spend 50 per cent of their budget on 
imported food, as Kiribati imports most of its food due to the highly permeable atoll soils. 
Therefore they have little money left for sanitation services, despite government subsidies 
for the transport of food to the outer islands. Under such extreme poverty, open defecation 
is considered by people as necessary and culturally accepted. While the National Water 
Resources Policy sets &#8220;inequities in provision of services to schools, hospitals, clinics, 
</p>
<p>rural, outer island and urban communities&#8221; as one of the priority issues to be addressed 
(p. 6), the National Sanitation Policy does not explicitly set &#8220;improved sanitation facilities 
in outer islands&#8221; as a priority.  
</p>
<p>39. There have been efforts made by donors. The Asian Development Bank approved a 
loan for a sanitation project to improve the existing sewage and sanitation services and 
hygiene practices in South Tarawa. The KIRIWATSAN project, funded by the European 
Union and implemented by UNICEF and the Ministry of Public Works and Utilities, for 
instance, is focused on improving access to water and sanitation and reducing waterborne 
diseases on the outer islands of Kiribati. The project includes hydrogeological assessment 
and design, rainwater harvesting and community mobilization and capacity-building.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Acceptability 
</b></p>
<p>40. The human right to sanitation requires that sanitation facilities and services be 
culturally acceptable, so as to ensure that they are not rejected by the population and that 
they are effectively used. Awareness-raising and education campaigns often have to be 
undertaken, in order to dissipate existing taboos or stigma related to sanitation. In Kiribati 
this was the case in relation to composting toilets. In the late 1990s, more than 150 
composting toilets were constructed on Christmas Island by AusAID, but they did not 
operate well and the community preferred flush toilets. A composting toilet is a dry toilet; 
in such systems, organic solid waste is decomposed in moist conditions, producing humus. 
In Kiribati, however, it is considered a taboo to use human waste to fertilize soil. Hence, the 
pilot project to introduce composting toilets on Christmas Island and South Tarawa has to 
date not been well received by the people.  
</p>
<p>41. Composting toilets reduce water demand significantly, and contribute to protecting 
precious water sources from being contaminated by wastewater. In addition, compost will 
be a great help to agriculture on atoll islands where the soil is very poor. As in the case of 
Tuvalu, where a similar acceptability obstacle was found at the beginning of an eco-
sanitation project, but where an awareness-raising campaign is helping change people&#8217;s 
perceptions, Kiribati should carry out wider and participatory discussions on the solutions 
that will be most suitable and sustainable for them, and consider dry sanitation as an option.

<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Hygiene 
</b></p>
<p>42. A study by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services showed that the direct cause 
of infant and child mortality was not necessarily water quality but rather behaviours such as 
the lack of hand-washing habits and the unhygienic practices followed in caring for babies. 
Over 80 per cent of households boil drinking water, but store it in open containers; the 
water is thus immediately re-contaminated when unclean vessels and hands are dipped into 
it. The widespread practice of open defecation also contributes to the spread of disease by 
increasing the risk of direct contact with human excretions. Safe sanitation and behavioural 
change are key to efforts to reduce infant and child mortality. The Government is urged to 
speed up the integration of sanitation responsibilities into the Water Unit of the Ministry of 
Public Works and Utilities. This also entails, of course, providing the necessary human and 
financial capacities, since the Water Unit is currently very small and has a limited budget. 
</p>
<p><b> V. International assistance for the development of Kiribati 
</b></p>
<p>43. The economy of Kiribati relies heavily on international aid. For example, it is 
estimated that official development assistance accounted for 15 per cent of the GDP per 
capita in 2010 (US$ 229 of US$ 1,519).23 In Kiribati, there are two donor coordination 
mechanisms: the Development Coordination Committee within the Ministry of Finance and 
Economic Planning; and the donor coordination meeting among donors. The Development 
Coordination Committee brings together ministries and aims at coordinating development 
programmes at the national level. The purpose of the donor coordination meeting, which 
has taken place biannually, is to coordinate donor programmes. The obvious constraint is 
that not all the donors are based in Kiribati. In reality many of the cooperation 
arrangements are decided bilaterally between a donor and the Government, although there 
is an initiative to organize an annual donor-Government round-table meeting. To address 
the lack of coordination in the water and sanitation sector, there is an ongoing effort to 
establish a functional intersectoral national water and sanitation committee as well, which 
would help coordinate water and sanitation projects.24  
</p>
<p>44. Kiribati has developed several important policies for the water and sanitation 
sectors; during the mission the Special Rapporteur met with the governmental officials 
charged with implementing those policies. In the interviews and discussions, it seemed to 
the Special Rapporteur that not all of the officials had seen those fundamental policy 
documents, and that not all were aware of the priority issues contained therein, or the 
deadlines to achieve the goals. The Special Rapporteur also sensed a lack of ownership over 
the strategies. Several experts told the Special Rapporteur that often such documents are 
drafted by external and foreign consultants, since their elaboration is a prerequisite for 
obtaining certain funding. This outsourcing of the development of policies explains the 
impression that the Special Rapporteur had during her meetings. As discussed above, civil 
servants with whom the Special Rapporteur met were not even aware of the priorities 
outlined in the National Water Resources Policy and the National Sanitation Policy. 
Currently, the review of these policies is ongoing and government officials are trying to 
narrow down the priorities. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Kiribati to 
take full ownership and leadership in this process, and calls on development partners to 
support national ownership and strengthening of capacity.

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to take the opportunity of the 
current review to identify more targeted and achievable priorities. Such an exercise 
undertaken by the Government itself will enable it to take ownership of its own policies and 
to translate its commitment into actions. The international community should continue to 
support such efforts led by the Government, and ensure the full ownership of decisions 
taken by the Government of Kiribati itself when it comes to implementing the human rights 
to water and sanitation. The international community should take a coordinated approach to 
decide on their support based on the priorities identified by Kiribati. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Impact of climate variability and climate change on the rights 
to water and sanitation  
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur paid particular attention to the impacts of climate change on 
the enjoyment of the human rights to water and sanitation. She has been encouraged by 
Human Rights Council resolution 10/4, in which the Council urged relevant special 
procedure mandate holders to give consideration to the issue of climate change within their 
mandates. Kiribati is one of the five countries and territories in the world comprised 
entirely of low-lying atolls (see para. 2 above). As noted above, the atolls are only a few 
metres above sea level, which means that most of the people are directly exposed to 
extreme weather events intensified by climate change. It is estimated that, without 
appropriate adaptation measures, 25 to 54 per cent of the land areas of South Tarawa and 55 
to 80 per cent of land areas in North Tarawa could be inundated by 2050.25 The inundation, 
coupled with loss of land and a possible decrease in rainfall due to weather changes, will 
have a negative impact on groundwater resources, which are already very vulnerable. 
According to the environmental vulnerability index developed by SOPAC and the United 
Nations Environment Programme,26 Kiribati is one of the top 10 most vulnerable nations in 
the world. This means that the environmental conditions to which Kiribati is exposed can 
negatively influence the sustainable development of the country. 
</p>
<p>47. In addition, Kiribati is among the 49 countries categorized by the United Nations as 
least developed countries.27 Between 2000 and 2002, Kiribati experienced a population 
growth rate of 1.7 per cent, while the GDP growth rate was only 1.4 per cent. This 
underdeveloped financial capacity with a rapidly growing population makes it a further 
challenge for Kiribati to take measures to mitigate and adapt to adverse impacts of climate 
change. Furthermore, according to estimates contained in a World Bank study from 2000, 
without adaptation measures, by 2050 the Tarawa atoll alone may face annual damages of 
US$ 8 million to 16 million, as compared a GDP that was only US$ 47 million in 2000.28 
This estimate includes a loss of US$ 1 million to 3 million related to water resources 
negatively affected by climate change.29  
</p>
<p>48. The impacts on people include health issues related to the quantity and quality of 
water supply and poor sanitation and hygiene. With a likely increase in average

<p>temperature, diarrhoea-related hospitalizations could increase by 1.9 to 9.0 per cent in 
Kiribati, according to a UNICEF estimate.30 Sea level rise will also increase diarrhoea risk, 
particularly in urban areas, related to the spread of faecal matter by increased and more 
frequent wave action.31 Children are the most at risk of climate-related diseases and 
malnutrition, according to WHO.32 Adolescents will also be physically and psychologically 
affected by stress and uncertainty on livelihoods, employment opportunities and possible 
emigration. About 41 per cent of the population in Kiribati is under 20 years old according 
to a 2009 national census, and approximately 1,700 young people enter the job market 
annually. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Adaptation 
</b></p>
<p>49. Adaptation in a small atoll island country is a technical and financial challenge. 
Nevertheless, the State&#8217;s obligations related to the right to water include a duty to &#8220;adopt 
comprehensive and integrated strategies and programmes to ensure that there is sufficient 
and safe water for present and future generations&#8221;.33 That may include impact assessments 
of threats that may impinge on water availability, such as climate change. Kiribati signed 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in June 1992; the 
Convention entered into force in Kiribati in May 1995. The State developed the National 
Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA)34 under the Climate Convention framework; the 
document contains proposals for nine projects, the top two priorities being a water 
resources adaptation project and simple well improvement. Even though these projects 
addressed some of the elements that form the normative content of the human right to 
water, such as safety, NAPA did not explicitly incorporate the human rights to water and 
sanitation, thus failing to address some of the other elements, such as accessibility and 
affordability.  
</p>
<p>50. Adaptation projects, such as KAP, are based on the Kiribati Development Plan as 
well as on NAPA. Thus, KAP also lacks a comprehensive approach to water and sanitation 
issues, although it is positive that KAP focuses on so-called &#8220;no regrets&#8221; environmental 
management, such as water resource management, coastal zone management and vector-
borne disease control measures, rather than structural adaptation solutions such as seawalls.  
</p>
<p>51. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, NAPA, KAP and other adaptation plans 
should place the human rights to water and sanitation in the centre in order to respond to 
people&#8217;s actual needs without discrimination. This does not mean that every individual 
should receive the same treatment. On the contrary, this means that the Government should 
tailor solutions for people in different situations, from people living in high density 
informal settlements on South Tarawa to those on very remote outer islands. While an 
initiative for well improvement on outer islands has been identified as one of the priority 
projects, it is a relatively small project and particularly vulnerable islands or regions or 
disadvantaged groups of people are not explicitly targeted. The Government is encouraged 
to look at social and economic aspects of adaptation, with a focus on people&#8217;s specific 
needs rather than mere technical and infrastructural adaptation.

</b></p>
<p>52. President Anote Tong has been on the forefront of advocacy regarding the adverse 
effects of climate change on small islands, bringing it to the attention of the international 
community. The President advocates, among other things, the concept of &#8220;migration with 
dignity&#8221;, not hesitating to speak about the likelihood that all citizens of Kiribati will 
eventually have to be relocated to other countries. The President&#8217;s policy refers to, inter 
alia, measures such as improving the professional skills of I-Kiribati to a competitive level 
in the international labour market. The Office of the President is taking the lead on climate 
change issues domestically as well.

<p>53. While the Special Rapporteur respects and welcomes advocacy efforts made by the 
President, she observed that the Government&#8217;s commitment to address the effects of climate 
change at the international level was not being fully translated into practical actions to 
improve the enjoyment of human rights by I-Kiribati, including access to water and 
sanitation. The Government of Kiribati is small, and the few senior government officials are 
constantly on trips abroad to raise awareness of the challenges that the country is facing and 
to call for international support. Such efforts are essential, but the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that they need to be balanced with attention to providing leadership and guidance 
for the government officials left in the country to implement the country&#8217;s strategy and 
plans of action for the provision of water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Participation  
</b></p>
<p>54. As the President himself publicly discusses, studies show that the relocation of at 
least some communities affected by climate change to less exposed areas, including to areas 
outside of Kiribati, is likely to be inevitable. International emigration itself is not new to I-
Kiribati, as they seek education and job opportunities in other countries in the Pacific 
region. New Zealand, for instance, accepts 75 Kiribati citizens every year and grants them 
residency under the Pacific Access Category quotas. In 2009, following the United Nations 
Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, the Foreign Minister of Fiji reportedly 
expressed his country&#8217;s intention to consider accepting &#8220;climate change refugees&#8221; from 
Tuvalu and Kiribati in the future. Reportedly, the Government of Kiribati has recently 
entered into talks with the Government of Fiji to buy about 6,000 acres of land on the main 
island of Fiji. The potential relocation of citizens of one country to an island in another 
country&#8217;s territory has several implications with respect to the enjoyment of human rights 
by those relocated, including their rights to essential access to basic services and to 
nationality. The legal status of the potentially displaced population is unclear, as there is no 
precedent; it will depend entirely on an agreement between the Government of Kiribati and 
a host State.35 While the President claims that relocation would be a last resort, the Special 
Rapporteur strongly encourages the Government to make the relevant information widely 
available in accessible formats for everyone, including women, children and people living 
on remote outer islands, so that they can prepare themselves to make their own decisions.  
</p>
<p>55. In Kiribati, 40 per cent of the population are under 20 years old; they are the ones 
who may face resettlement inside or outside their own country. Although Kiribati has a 
strong traditional structure in decision-making, the engagement of young people and 
children in climate change discussions and adaptation activities has been a positive 
development. NAPA, for instance, is one of the few plans in the Pacific region that 
emphasizes the importance of involving children in decision-making processes. Under 
</p>
<p>  
 35  See Susin Park, &#8220;Climate change and the risk of statelessness: the situation of low-lying island 
</p>
<p>States&#8221;, Legal and Protection Policy Research Series (United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees, May 2011). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>KAP, national consultations on adaptation and awareness-raising activities were carried 
out. Capturing the voice of marginalized people in Kiribati is possible, but expensive and 
time-consuming due to the remoteness of the outer islands. The Government budgets 
currently do not include costs for such national consultations, but the local government 
structures, Island Councils, and social service staff and support groups on most islands 
provide a system through which national activities can be conducted. A UNICEF study 
indicates that the capacity of the Government of Kiribati to include children in adaptation 
planning &#8220;may not be sufficient&#8221;.36 For instance, children outside of the school system have 
limited access to information on climate change, as climate change education is primarily 
carried out in school. Children&#8217;s workshops on climate change conducted by UNICEF 
showed that many children were aware of the physical impact of climate change, but less so 
of the impact on their health or of preparation.37  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur recommends that States ensure the active, free and 
meaningful participation of rights holders and other relevant stakeholders. In particular, 
States should ensure the participation of those whose rights appear most directly threatened; 
in the case of Kiribati, these include children, as well as women, who are usually 
responsible for collecting and treating water. Although some consultations were made in 
the framework of NAPA and KAP, the process of participation should be specifically 
planned, financed and implemented, rather than carried out in an ad hoc manner, and should 
include public officials; service delivery organizations; technical specialists in climate 
science and policy, water and sanitation; civil society organizations concerned with water 
and sanitation; and community-based organizations. The State should also establish clear 
agreed minimum standards for participation and develop appropriate capacity-development 
strategies in order to help make participation effective. Civil society organizations with 
whom the Special Rapporteur met shared their view that people, particularly women on 
outer islands, have been excluded from the development of adaptation planning and 
strategies; some of those excluded have been reported as saying &#8220;we will die here&#8221; or &#8220;we 
accept that we are going to die here&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. International responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>57. Several studies have indicated that adverse effects of climate change threaten the 
enjoyment of many human rights. Many States Members of the United Nations have 
recognized this fact.38 But not all of the effects of climate change on human rights are 
waiting to be felt in the future. Some vulnerable individuals and communities around the 
world are already experiencing the effects.39 Indeed, the Special Rapporteur observed that 
the effects of climate change are not a future threat but a present reality for I-Kiribati; for 
many in Kiribati, under such circumstances,  the deprivation of access to safe and 
sustainable water and sanitation, which constitutes a human rights violation, is part of 
everyday life.

<p>58. To comply with their international obligations in relation to the rights to water and 
sanitation, State parties must also respect the enjoyment of those rights in other countries.40 
In the case of the effects of climate change, establishing an accountability mechanism is a 
challenge because it can be difficult to attribute a climate-related violation of human rights 
of a specific population to specific actions (A/HRC/10/61, para. 96).

<p><b> IX. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur witnessed the grave challenges that Kiribati is facing 
due to its remoteness, the very significant distances within the country, its unique 
</b></p>
<p><b>geography and environmental vulnerability, the growing population in South Tarawa, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the scarcity of natural and financial resources. Access to water and sanitation is 
</b></p>
<p><b>an acute concern, as the limited availability of fresh water and the limited capacity of 
</b></p>
<p><b>safe wastewater management are being and going to be further aggravated by adverse 
</b></p>
<p><b>effects of climate change. It is essential to take urgent action to protect and conserve 
</b></p>
<p><b>the groundwater resources in order to ensure sustainable water supply, particularly in 
</b></p>
<p><b>South Tarawa. System and other losses are extremely high, and rainwater harvesting 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be implemented to the maximum capacity. Kiribati should establish a legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework to conserve the precious groundwater resources and review the National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Water Resources Policy to set realistic priorities.  
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>The Special Rapporteur advises the Government not to concentrate all efforts 
on one single solution to address the water scarcity challenges, but rather to diversify 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures. This will contribute to both affordability and sustainability.  
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>During her mission, the Special Rapporteur was shocked by the high infant and 
child mortality rates of the country. In order to significantly reduce preventable 
</b></p>
<p><b>deaths of children, the country must address the essential issues of sanitation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>hygiene as a matter of urgency. The first step is to explicitly assign competences over 
</b></p>
<p><b>sanitation to a government department and provide it with the necessary human and 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial resources. The specific plan and budget should take into account awareness-
</b></p>
<p><b>raising activities, since behavioural change is the key to improving hygiene. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact of climate change will hit this remote country, consisting of small atoll islands, 
</b></p>
<p><b>hard </b>&#8211;<b> the people are directly exposed to extreme weather, and the Government has 
</b></p>
<p><b>very limited financial and human capacities to adapt to it. The international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community has worked hard to help provide support; however, its uncoordinated 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach with respect to Kiribati hampers the ability of the country to process 
</b></p>
<p><b>international aid and prevents it from taking ownership over development and 
</b></p>
<p><b>adaptation plans.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Government, which bears the main responsibility for the realization 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the human rights to water and sanitation, take concrete and targeted steps within 
</b></p>
<p><b>the maximum of available resources, including by seeking international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>aid and assistance;

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) The Government of Kiribati establish a solid legal and institutional 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework to implement the human rights to water and sanitation taking into 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration changing climate and its impacts on water and sanitation. Clear 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities in the water and sanitation sectors </b>&#8211;<b> including the establishment of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulator who is independent from the Government </b>&#8211;<b> must be allocated at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national level;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Government of Kiribati take greater ownership of its policies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>priorities for the water, sanitation and hygiene sector </b>and integrate donors&#8217; initiatives 
</p>
<p><b>and funds into its plans and activities, in order to ensure greater sustainability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>interventions and impact on the lives of I-Kiribati; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The international community consider positively the provision of on-
</b></p>
<p><b>budget rather than off-budget assistance in order for Kiribati to take greater 
</b></p>
<p><b>ownership of measures adopted to provide water and sanitation services; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Government diversify measures to address the water scarcity 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges rather than concentrate all efforts on one single solution. Reduction in 
</b></p>
<p><b>system and other losses, the preservation of groundwater resources and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>improvement of rainwater harvesting should be made priorities. This will contribute 
</b></p>
<p><b>to both affordability and sustainability; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The Government make the reduction and eventual elimination of open 
</b></p>
<p><b>defecation its urgent priority in </b>order to protect people&#8217;s right to sanitation <b>in a 
</b></p>
<p><b>dignified manner and also to avoid preventable deaths of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The monitoring of water quality be regularized through legislation, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the budget for such monitoring be included in the budget of the Government as 
</b></p>
<p><b>one of the core activities to ensure regular testing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) </b>&#8220;Hardware&#8221; provided by donors in the form of project funding be 
</p>
<p>accompanied by equally relevant &#8220;software&#8221; measures, namely information and 
</p>
<p><b>awareness-raising regarding the maintenance of the desalination plants, if 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented, and the importance of hygiene practices, which must be ensured even 
</b></p>
<p><b>after the </b>completion of a given donors&#8217; project<b>;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Access to water and sanitation be affordable to all, in particular to those 
</b></p>
<p><b>who have a lower income. The price paid for water, sanitation and hygiene must not 
</b></p>
<p><b>compromise access to other human rights such as food, housing or education. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government should bear this in mind when discussing and adopting new water tariffs 
</b></p>
<p><b>in relation to the instalment of desalination plants or when discussing sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>options;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) The Government of Kiribati, the international community, civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>and communities continue to explore the most suitable and sustainable sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>options, including composting toilets, which will not only enable water savings, but 
</b></p>
<p><b>will also avoid many of the problems caused by inadequate wastewater management;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Adaptation plans should put the human rights to water and sanitation at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the centre in order to respond to pe</b>ople&#8217;s actual needs without discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>International assistance to adaptation should therefore also be based on such plans 
</b></p>
<p><b>that mainstream the human rights to water and sanitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Kiribati ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights treaties to which the State is not yet a party; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) The Government of Kiribati withdraw its reservations to the Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the Rights of the Child, in particular article 24 (c), which places a specific </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation on the State to combat disease and malnutrition by providing clean 
</b></p>
<p><b>drinking-water;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Kiribati consider revising the Constitution and including the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights to water and sanitation as well as other economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>which are contemplated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>encouraged to consider broadening the concept of discrimination contained in its 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(o) The Government of Kiribati implement the recommendations of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council held in 2010. Special attention
