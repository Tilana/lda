Genesis Energy, L.P. Reports Second Quarter 2016 Results
•
HOUSTON – (BUSINESS WIRE) – Genesis Energy, L.P. (NYSE: GEL) today announced its
second quarter results.
Certain highlights of our results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 included the following items:
We reported the following results for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter
in 2015, which improved results were primarily attributable to our acquisition on July 24, 2015 of
*
the offshore pipelines and services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and its
affiliates (our “Enterprise acquisition”):
Net Income Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $23.7 million, or $0.22 per unit, for the
second quarter of 2016 compared to $11.7 million, or $0.12 per unit, for the same period in 2015,
representing an increase of $12.0 million or 103%.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities of $62.6 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared
to $8.6 million for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $54 million or 628%.
Available Cash before Reserves of $96.0 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of
$27.2 million over the prior year quarter, or 40%, providing 1.18 coverage for our quarterly
distribution to unitholders attributable to that quarter, which is discussed below. Excluding the
effects from our public offering of common units in July 2016 (discussed below), Available Cash
before Reserves would have provided 1.27 times coverage for our quarterly distribution.
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was $133.5 million, an increase of $46.2
million, or 53%, over the prior year quarter. After giving pro forma effect to our July 2016 common
unit offering, our Adjusted Pro Forma Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA ratio is 4.76 as of June 30,
2016. Without giving effect to that offering, our Adjusted Debt to Pro Forma EBITDA ratio is 5.25
as of June 30, 2016. These amounts are calculated and further discussed later in this press
release.
Included in each of Net Income, Available Cash before Reserves, and Adjusted EBITDA is a
$2.4 million non-cash increase in equity-based compensation expense that resulted solely from
a 30% increase in the market price of our common units for the 2016 quarter.
•
•
•
•
On August 12, 2016, we will pay a total quarterly distribution of $81.4 million based on our
quarterly declared distribution of $0.69 per unit attributable to our financial and operational
*
results for the second quarter of 2016. This represents an increase in our distribution for the
forty-fourth consecutive quarter.
Grant Sims, CEO of Genesis Energy, said, "Our diversified, yet increasingly integrated,
businesses continued to perform in the second quarter within an acceptable range in spite of the
ongoing dislocations in the energy sector, uncertainties in capital markets and the midstream
space, and specific challenges, at the margin, on certain of our operations. Even if this
challenging backdrop continues in future quarters, we would expect to see sequentially higher
net income and Available Cash before Reserves due to a variety of factors, including increasing
volumes out of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the end of certain refinery turnarounds, and the
initiation of service, and the anticipated ramp up of volumes between now and the end of 2017,
from some of our recent organic projects. In the aggregate, we believe our commercial operations
are relatively stable in this challenging environment and we believe we have a reasonably clear
line of sight of volume growth over the next four to six quarters. As a result, we feel comfortable
that our financial results and condition will continue to strengthen in future periods.
Our primary objective continues to be to deliver the best value to our unitholders while never
wavering from our commitment to safe and responsible operations. A lot has changed, we
recognize, in how the market apparently values unit prices for MLPs or other midstream entities
over the last year and a half to two years. Although the move to eliminate our IDRs almost six
years ago and continuing to deliver double-digit growth in distributions on a year over year basis
were rewarded historically, we believe the metrics demanded by the markets have changed
during these recent tumultuous times.
1
We now believe the best way to promote unit price appreciation under current conditions is to
exercise strong financial discipline designed primarily to maintain and enhance our financial
flexibility across the business cycle. Although we believe we would otherwise naturally restore
our financial flexibility with cash flows from operations, we feel we can accelerate that process by
issuing additional equity, lowering the future growth rate of quarterly distributions, or pursuing a
combination of the two.
Consequently, on July 27, 2016, we closed a public offering of 8,000,000 common units
generating net proceeds of approximately $298 million. As a practical matter, we would have
issued such additional equity a year ago at the time of closing our Enterprise acquisition had
markets been stronger at that point. This 2016 equity raise instantly improved our liquidity and
credit metrics.
We believe our increased liquidity and even stronger balance sheet resulting from such actions
should combine to give us the flexibility to continue to pursue acquisitions and/or organic projects
that we feel are consistent with delivering long term value to all of our stakeholders. We also
believe that our improved credit profile will significantly lower the future costs of refinancing our
public debt when such issued tranches become due beginning in 2021 or callable beginning in
2017.”
Financial Results
Segment Margin
Variances between the second quarter 2016 (the “2016 Quarter”) and the second quarter of 2015
(or “2015 Quarter”) in these components are explained below.
Segment results for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the 2016 Quarter increased $59.2 million,
or 236%, from the 2015 Quarter. This increase is primarily due to our Enterprise acquisition,
which closed in July 2015. As a result of our Enterprise acquisition we obtained approximately
2,350 miles of additional offshore natural gas and crude oil pipelines, including increasing our
ownership interest in each of the Poseidon, SEKCO, and CHOPS pipelines, and six offshore hub
platforms. The operating results of that business continue to meet or exceed our expectations,
with sequential increases in volumes (compared to the first quarter of 2016) in the most
significant offshore crude oil pipelines in which we acquired (as well as those in which we
previously owned an interest).
Onshore Pipeline Transportation Segment Margin for the 2016 Quarter decreased $2.3 million, or
16%. Volumes decreased on our Texas pipeline system, particularly delivery volumes to the
Texas City refining market. Such lower volumes on our Texas system to historical customers will
likely continue in future periods as we complete the repurposing, which includes making the
necessary upgrades on our existing 18-inch Webster to Texas City crude oil pipeline to reverse
the direction of flow, of our Houston area crude oil pipeline and terminal infrastructure. We
anticipate this repurposing, as well as the other components of our Houston area crude oil
pipeline and terminal infrastructure project, to be completed prior to the end of 2016. Additionally,
margin was negatively affected by lowered levels of tertiary crude oil activities in Mississippi.
Volumes on our Louisiana system were sequentially down primarily as a result of a protracted
turnaround at our primary customer's refining complex. We anticipate volumes on our Louisiana
system to ramp back up starting in the third quarter upon the completion of this turnaround.
2
Refinery services Segment Margin for the 2016 Quarter decreased $0.4 million, or 2%. That
decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in NaHS sales volumes due to lower demand
from pulp and paper customers during the scheduled downtime these customers typically exhibit
in the spring, compared to the 2015 Quarter. We were able to realize benefits from our favorable
management of the purchasing (including economies of scale) and utilization of caustic soda in
our (and our customers') operations and our logistics management capabilities, which somewhat
offset the effects on Segment Margin of decreased NaHS sales volumes.
Marine Transportation Segment Margin for the 2016 Quarter decreased $9.1 million, or 34%, from
the 2015 Quarter. This decrease in Segment Margin in the 2016 Quarter is primarily due to
pressure on rates and utilization of our blue water, offshore barges. The impacts of the negative
factors and pressures on our offshore barge performance which we have previously discussed
have been consistent with our expectations with regards to both timing and scale. Additionally,
we faced certain challenges on utilization and rates for our inland barges in large part attributable
to fewer long voyages from the midwest to the Gulf Coast than we have historically experienced.
We believe these conditions may be reflective of certain aspects of the changing dynamics in
refining operations which we must continue to monitor in future periods.
Segment Margin for our supply and logistics segment decreased by $3.5 million, or 30%,
between the two quarters. In the 2016 Quarter, the decrease in our Segment Margin is primarily
due to lower demand for our services, compared to the 2015 Quarter, in our historical back-to-
back, or buy/sell, crude oil marketing business associated with aggregating and trucking crude
oil from producers' leases to local or regional re-sale points. We have found it difficult to compete
with certain persons in the market who are willing to lose money on such local gathering
because they are attempting to minimize their losses from minimum volume or take-or-pay
commitments they previously made in anticipation of new production that has not yet and is
unlikely to come online. In addition, a portion of this decrease can be attributed to decreased rail
volumes as a major refinery customer supported by our Louisiana facilities was experiencing a
refinery turnaround during the 2016 Quarter. We anticipate such rail volumes related to our
Louisiana facilities to begin ramping back up starting in the third quarter upon the completion of
this turnaround.
Other Components of Net Income
In the 2016 Quarter, we recorded Net Income Attributable to Genesis Energy, L.P. of $23.7
million compared to $11.7 million in the 2015 Quarter.
Net income is impacted similarly by the overall increase in Segment Margin previously
discussed, which was principally due to the contributions from the offshore Gulf of Mexico assets
acquired in our Enterprise acquisition. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense
increased $27.7 million between the quarterly periods primarily as a result of the effect of placing
recently acquired and constructed assets in service during calendar 2015 (including the offshore
pipelines and services assets acquired as a result of our Enterprise acquisition) and 2016. Other
income also increased $19.2 million between the quarterly periods due to the loss on debt
extinguishment recognized in the second quarter in 2015 relating to the early retirement of our
$350 million 7.875% senior unsecured notes due 2018.
In addition, interest costs for the 2016 Quarter increased by $17.6 million from the 2015 Quarter
primarily due to an increase in our average outstanding indebtedness from recently acquired and
constructed assets (principally from additional debt outstanding as a result of financing our
Enterprise acquisition). Interest costs, on an ongoing basis, are net of capitalized interest costs
attributable to our growth capital expenditures.
General and administrative expenses included in Net income decreased by $3.5 million. This
decrease is primarily related to a decrease in expense related to our annual bonus program
relative to the 2015 Quarter.

(1) Volumes for our equity method investees are presented on a 100% basis. As of July 24, 2015
we owned 100% of CHOPS and SEKCO and 64% of Poseidon. As our SEKCO volumes
ultimately flow into Poseidon and thus are included within our Poseidon volume statistics, we
have excluded them from our total for Offshore crude oil pipelines.
(2) Utilization rates are based on a 365 day year, as adjusted for planned downtime and dry-

of 2016, and $23.7 million for the second quarter of 2016. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to
net income for all periods presented are available on our website at www.genesisenergy.com.
(3) This amount reflects the adjustment we are permitted to make under our credit agreement for
purposes of calculating compliance with our leverage ratio. It includes a pro rata portion of
projected future annual EBITDA from material projects (i.e. organic growth) and includes
Adjusted EBITDA (using historical amounts and other permitted amounts) since the beginning of
the calculation period attributable to each acquisition completed during such calculation period,
regardless of the date on which such acquisition was actually completed. This adjustment may
not be indicative of future results.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
This press release and the accompanying schedules include non-generally accepted accounting
principle (non-GAAP) financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and total Segment Margin. In this
press release, we also present total Available Cash before Reserves as if it were a non-GAAP
measure. Our Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies because such measures may include or exclude other specified items. The
accompanying schedules provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their
most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Our non-GAAP financial
measures should not be considered (i) as alternatives to GAAP measures of liquidity or financial
performance or (ii) as being singularly important in any particular context; they should be
considered in a broad context with other quantitative and qualitative information. Our Available
Cash before Reserves, Adjusted EBITDA and total Segment Margin measures are just three of
the relevant data points considered from time to time.
When evaluating our performance and making decisions regarding our future direction and
actions (including making discretionary payments, such as quarterly distributions) our board of
directors and management team has access to a wide range of historical and forecasted
qualitative and quantitative information, such as our financial statements; operational information;
various non-GAAP measures; internal forecasts; credit metrics; analyst opinions; performance,
liquidity and similar measures; income; cash flow; and expectations for us, and certain
information regarding some of our peers. Additionally, our board of directors and management
team analyze, and place different weight on, various factors from time to time. We believe that
investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by
management, lenders, analysts and other market participants. We attempt to provide adequate
information to allow each individual investor and other external user to reach her/his own
conclusions regarding our actions without providing so much information as to overwhelm or
confuse such investor or other external user.
AVAILABLE CASH BEFORE RESERVES
Purposes, Uses and Definition
Available Cash before Reserves, also referred to as distributable cash flow, is a quantitative
standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships
and is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external
users of financial statements  such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating
agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:
(1)the financial performance of our assets;
(2)our operating performance;
(3)
the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital
investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash
(4)requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and
(5)
our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our units, growth
capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of
indebtedness.
We define Available Cash before Reserves as net income as adjusted for specific items, the
most significant of which are the addition of certain non-cash gains or charges (such as
depreciation and amortization), the substitution of distributable cash generated by our equity
investees in lieu of our equity income attributable to our equity investees (includes distributions
attributable to the quarter and received during or promptly following such quarter), the elimination
of gains and losses on asset sales (except those from the sale of surplus assets), unrealized
gains and losses on derivative transactions not designated as hedges for accounting purposes,
the elimination of expenses related to acquiring or constructing assets that provide new sources
of cash flows and the subtraction of maintenance capital utilized, which is described in detail
below.
Recent Change in Circumstances and Disclosure Format
We have implemented a modified format relating to maintenance capital requirements because
of our expectation that our future maintenance capital expenditures may change materially in
nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount from time to time. We believe that,
without such modified disclosure, such changes in our maintenance capital expenditures could
be confusing and potentially misleading to users of our financial information, particularly in the
context of the nature and purposes of our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Our
modified disclosure format provides those users with new information in the form of our
maintenance capital utilized measure (which we deduct to arrive at Available Cash before
Reserves). Our maintenance capital utilized measure constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary
maintenance capital expenditures and it takes into consideration the relationship among
maintenance capital expenditures, operating expenses and depreciation from period to period.

Maintenance Capital Requirements
Maintenance Capital Expenditures
Maintenance capital expenditures are capitalized costs that are necessary to maintain the
service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of any system component or
equipment which is worn out or obsolete. Maintenance capital expenditures can be discretionary
or non-discretionary, depending on the facts and circumstances.
Historically, substantially all of our maintenance capital expenditures have been (a) related to our
pipeline assets and similar infrastructure, (b) non-discretionary in nature and (c) immaterial in
amount as compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those historical
expenditures were non-discretionary (or mandatory) in nature because we had very little (if any)
discretion as to whether or when we incurred them. We had to incur them in order to continue to
operate the related pipelines in a safe and reliable manner and consistently with past practices. If
we had not made those expenditures, we would not have been able to continue to operate all or
portions of those pipelines, which would not have been economically feasible. An example of a
non-discretionary (or mandatory) maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing a segment
of an old pipeline because one can no longer operate that pipeline safely, legally and/or
economically in the absence of such replacement.
Prospectively, we believe a substantial amount of our maintenance capital expenditures from
time to time will be (a) related to our assets other than pipelines, such as our marine vessels,
trucks and similar assets, (b) discretionary in nature and (c) potentially material in amount as
compared to our Available Cash before Reserves measure. Those future expenditures will be
discretionary (or non-mandatory) in nature because we will have significant discretion as to
whether or when we incur them. We will not be forced to incur them in order to continue to
operate the related assets in a safe and reliable manner. If we chose not make those
expenditures, we would be able to continue to operate those assets economically, although in
lieu of maintenance capital expenditures, we would incur increased operating expenses,
including maintenance expenses. An example of a discretionary (or non-mandatory)
maintenance capital expenditure would be replacing an older marine vessel with a new marine
vessel with substantially similar specifications, even though one could continue to economically
operate the older vessel in spite of its increasing maintenance and other operating expenses.
In summary, as we continue to expand certain non-pipeline portions of our business, we are
experiencing changes in the nature (discretionary vs. non-discretionary), timing and amount of
our maintenance capital expenditures that merit a more detailed review and analysis than was
required historically. Management’s recently increasing ability to determine if and when to incur
certain maintenance capital expenditures is relevant to the manner in which we analyze aspects
of our business relating to discretionary and non-discretionary expenditures. We believe it would
be inappropriate to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure by deducting
discretionary maintenance capital expenditures, which we believe are similar in nature in this
context to certain other discretionary expenditures, such as growth capital expenditures,
distributions/dividends and equity buybacks. Unfortunately, not all maintenance capital
expenditures are clearly discretionary or non-discretionary in nature. Therefore, we developed a
new measure, maintenance capital utilized, that we believe is more useful in the determination of
Available Cash before Reserves. Our maintenance capital utilized measure, which is described
in more detail below, constitutes a proxy for non-discretionary maintenance capital expenditures
and it takes into consideration the relationship among maintenance capital expenditures,
operating expenses and depreciation from period to period.
Maintenance Capital Utilized
We believe our maintenance capital utilized measure is the most useful quarterly maintenance
capital requirements measure to use to derive our Available Cash before Reserves measure. We
define our maintenance capital utilized measure as that portion of the amount of previously
incurred maintenance capital expenditures that we utilize during the relevant quarter, which
would be equal to the sum of the maintenance capital expenditures we have incurred for each
project/component in prior quarters allocated ratably over the useful lives of those
projects/components.
Because we have not historically used our maintenance capital utilized measure, our future
maintenance capital utilized calculations will reflect the utilization of solely those maintenance
capital expenditures incurred since December 31, 2013. Further, we do not have the actual
comparable calculations for our prior periods, and we may not have the information necessary to
make such calculations for such periods. And, even if we could locate and/or re-create the
information necessary to make such calculations, we believe it would be unduly burdensome to
do so in comparison to the benefits derived.

ADJUSTED EBITDA
Purposes, Uses and Definition
Adjusted EBITDA, is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by management and
by external users of financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts
and rating agencies, to aid in assessing, among other things:
(1)
(2)
(3)
the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structures
or historical cost basis;
our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy
industry, without regard to financing and capital structure;
the viability of potential projects, including our cash and overall return on alternative capital
investments as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry;
the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to satisfy certain non-discretionary cash
requirements, including interest payments and certain maintenance capital requirements; and
our ability to make certain discretionary payments, such as distributions on our units, growth
capital expenditures, certain maintenance capital expenditures and early payments of
indebtedness.
(4)
(5)
We define Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as net income or loss plus net interest
expense, income taxes, non-cash gains and charges (other than certain non-cash equity based
compensation expense), depreciation and amortization plus other specific items, the most
significant of which are the addition of cash received from direct financing leases not included in
income, expenses related to acquiring assets that provide new sources of cash flow and the
effects of available cash generated by equity method investees not included in income.  We also
exclude the effect on net income or loss of unrealized gains or losses on derivative transactions.
SEGMENT MARGIN
Our chief operating decision maker (our Chief Executive Officer) evaluates segment performance
based on a variety of measures including Segment Margin, segment volumes where relevant and
capital investment. We define Segment Margin as revenues less product costs, operating
expenses (excluding non-cash gains and charges, such as depreciation and amortization), and
segment general and administrative expenses, plus our equity in distributable cash generated by
our equity investees. In addition, our Segment Margin definition excludes the non-cash effects of
our legacy stock appreciation rights plan and unrealized gains and losses on derivative
transactions not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Our Segment Margin definition
also includes the non-income portion of payments received under direct financing leases.
