<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Sixteenth session 
</b>Agenda item 4 
<b>Human rights situations that require the Council&#8217;s attention</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire</b>* 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-
14/1, in which the Council invited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to submit a report on the abuses and violations of human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in 
relation to the conclusion of the 2010 presidential election. The report covers events up to 
31 January 2011. 
</p>
<p> The long-awaited presidential election in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was held on 31 October and 
28 November 2010 after having been postponed six times since 2005. While the first round 
was conducted on 31 October in a peaceful atmosphere and provided hope for the end of 
the long-running political and military crisis in the country, the run-off round held on 28 
November was marred by a radicalization of political rhetoric and speech that progressively 
drove the country into turmoil, with severe consequences for the overall human rights 
situation. Following the announcement of divergent results by the Independent Electoral 
Commission and the Constitutional Council, elected President Alsassane Ouattara formed a 
Government, while Laurent Gbagbo has tried to hang on to power and also appointed a 
&#8220;Government&#8221; that is not, however, recognized by the international community.  
</p>
<p> The imposition of a night-time curfew on the eve of the run-off round, attempts to 
prevent members of the Dioula and Baoul&#233; ethnic communities from voting, significant 
irregularities and acts of intimidation witnessed in the Centre-North-East zone controlled 
by Forces nouvelles, the violent repression by law enforcement officers of a public 
demonstration organized by the Rassemblement des houphou&#235;tistes pour la d&#233;mocratie et la 
paix (RHDP) on 16 December 2010 and the subsequent call by RHDP for civil 
disobedience on 18 January 2011 progressively contributed to the deterioration of the 
situation in the country. This unprecedented situation was exacerbated by the recruitment 
and use of youth groups, militias and alleged mercenaries, which resulted in a number of 
serious human rights violations, some of which reportedly were ethnically and politically 
motivated and produced victims in both sides, but mainly among supporters of RHDP.  
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>

<p> The State-owned television corporation, Radiodiffusion T&#233;l&#233;vision ivoirienne, has 
been disseminating xenophobic messages inciting hatred and violence, and promoting 
religious and ethnic division between the north and the south. The volatile political 
situation and worsening human rights situation led to the internal and cross-border 
displacement of thousands of Ivorians internally and in neighbouring countries, and has had 
a negative impact on the economic, social and cultural rights of the population.  
</p>
<p> The Gbagbo camp repeatedly obstructed the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te 
d'Ivoire (UNOCI) and impeded its freedom of movement, including attempts made by the 
Human Rights Division to investigate allegations about mass graves in Anyama (Abidjan), 
Lakota (near Divo) and Issia (near Daloa) and other serious human rights violations. These 
obstructions prevented UNOCI from fully discharging its protection of civilians mandate, 
as prescribed by the Security Council in its resolutions 1894 (2009) and 1933 (2010).  
</p>
<p> The deteriorating human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was strongly condemned 
by the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner. The High Commissioner wrote 
individually to Mr. Gbagbo and three high-ranking military commanders to remind them of 
their obligation to protect civilians and of their personal accountability for human rights 
abuses and infringements of international humanitarian law committed by members of the 
security forces placed under their command and control. Several United Nations experts 
and special procedures mandate holders also voiced their concern over gross human rights 
violations committed in the country.  
</p>
<p> With the political stalemate now going into its third month, the human rights 
situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is becoming more precarious. Almost 300 people have been 
confirmed killed since the beginning of the crisis, and there are continuing reports of 
abductions, illegal detention and attacks against civilians. More than 35,000 people have 
been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge elsewhere, including in neighbouring 
countries. There are reports of thousands of youths being forcibly recruited and armed, 
presumably in preparation for violent conflict. The propagation of hatred and violence 
through the media remains a serious concern. Disruptions to the means of livelihood, 
including through the impact of the operation &#8220;ghost country&#8221;, which calls for nation-wide 
civil disobedience and work stoppage, have severely limited access to education and basic 
economic and social rights. Meanwhile, the obstruction of UNOCI has limited its ability to 
verify the full extent and scale of the human rights violations across the country.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-
14/1, in which the Council invited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to submit a report on the abuses and violations of human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in 
relation to the conclusion of the 2010 presidential election. The report covers the period up 
to 31 January 2011.  
</p>
<p>2. On 23 December 2011, the Human Rights Council held a special session during 
which it reviewed the human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire following the proclamation of 
the results of the second round of the presidential election on 28 November 2010. The 
political stalemate resulting from the elections has been characterized by the use of 
excessive force by supporters of Laurent Gbagbo, including members of the security forces 
loyal to him to repress public demonstrations, harassment and intimidation, incitement to 
ethnic and political violence, arbitrary arrest and detention, sexual violence, torture, 
enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Acts of harassment, assault, destruction 
of property and looting were reportedly committed by supporters of President Alassane 
Ouattara during and after the elections. Thousands of people were also forcefully displaced, 
both within C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and into neighbouring countries. Despite repeated calls from the 
international community to allow free movement and access to civilians, the security forces 
and youth groups allied to Mr. Gbagbo continued to obstruct the movement of the United 
Nations Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (UNOCI). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>3. The long-awaited presidential election, postponed six times since 2005, was finally 
held on 31 October 2010 in a generally quiet and peaceful atmosphere, despite some 
disagreements among the opposing camps over the ballot counting process. Prior to the run-
off round between the two leading candidates, however, Laurent Gbagbo, the outgoing 
president, and Alassane Dramane Ouattara, on 28 November 2010, there was a noticeable 
radicalization in political rhetoric and speech that culminated in a number of incidents, 
including violent attacks against the headquarters of Mr. Ouattara&#8217;s party, the 
Rassemblement des houphou&#235;tistes pour la d&#233;mocratie et la paix (RHDP) in Yopougon 
(Abidjan), the looting and destruction of property belonging to presumed Ouattara 
supporters in the western region of the country, and the imposition of a curfew on the eve 
of the second round of elections.  
</p>
<p>4. The presidential election campaign was launched on 15 October 2010 for a period of 
two weeks. The political rallies held by the 14 presidential candidates proceeded smoothly 
across the country, with no major incidents, pursuant to the code of conduct established. All 
candidates had equitable access to public media during the two weeks. Some minor 
incidents were reported, including harassment, intimidation and threats, and destruction of 
election posters. The confiscation of voters&#8217; cards by Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s supporters was 
observed in some areas of the country, principally in the western and northern regions. In 
the western part of the country, members of former militia groups threatened to disrupt the 
electoral process if 2,000 ex-militiamen were not paid their reintegration allowances in 
time, and prevented some political rallies from being held in Duekou&#233; and Guiglo. 
Problems observed across the country included the lack of well-trained polling agents and 
persistent delays in the opening of polling stations, the delivery of election materials and 
the payment of salaries and allowances of polling agents. These led to frustrating delays in 
compiling results at both the local and national levels, amidst rising socio-political tension. </p>


<p>5. The first round of the presidential election was marked by a high voter turnout of 83 
per cent and a large participation of women. Observers were generally satisfied with the 
organization of the election despite several logistical problems and lacuna, and no major 
incident or serious human rights violation was reported. On 3 November 2010, the 
Independent Electoral Commission announced the provisional results of the first round. Of 
the three leading contenders, Laurent Gbagbo obtained 38.3 per cent of the votes, Alassane 
Dramane Ouattara 32.8 per cent and Henri Konan Bedi&#233; 25.24 per cent. The provisional 
results announced by the Commission were confirmed and proclaimed by the Constitutional 
Council on 5 November 2010, and were certified by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on 12 November 2010. As required by the electoral laws, a second round 
of the presidential election was scheduled between the two leading contenders, Mr. Gbagbo 
and Mr. Ouattara, on 28 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>6. On 27 November 2010, on the eve of the run-off election, President Gbagbo 
imposed a night-time curfew, ostensibly to deter violence. On the same day, in a 
communiqu&#233; broadcast on SR TV, Forces nouvelles announced its decision not to enforce 
the curfew in its zone, while the opposition political parties denounced the curfew as a 
means of instilling fear in voters and called for it to be lifted. Earlier, on 14 November, 
President Gbagbo had decided to deploy the national army across the country, citing the 
apparent inability of the Centre de commandement int&#233;gr&#233; (CCI) to provide sufficient 
security as it had been mandated to do by the Ouagadougou Political Agreement.  
</p>
<p>7. On 28 November, the presidential election was conducted successfully; voter turnout 
exceeded 81 per cent, although there was last-minute confusion over its outcome. Repeated 
attempts to prevent members of the Dioula and Baoul&#233; ethnic communities from voting in 
several areas, including in Lakota, Issia and San Pedro, led to violent clashes between 
supporters of Gbagbo&#8217;s party, La majorit&#233; pr&#233;sidentielle (LMP), and that of Mr. Ouattara, 
RHDP. LMP supporters depicted Mr. Ouattara as the &#8220;father of the rebellion&#8221;, and 
displayed defamatory posters and screened a film denigrating him, inciting violence against 
members of the Dioula ethnic group to which Mr. Ouattara belongs. Some messages were 
blatantly xenophobic and propagated religious and ethnic division between the North and 
the South. They appealed to people not to vote for Mr. Ouattara, calling him &#8220;the assassin&#8221;, 
to block his supporters from campaigning on his behalf, and to rise up against his 
supporters should he win the second round. Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s campaign adopted a slogan that 
called on his supporters to &#8220;vote 100 per cent&#8221; for the &#8220;original&#8221;. On 18 November, the 
Minister for the Interior read a press release on State television in which he condemned 
these acts and asked the perpetrators to cease their activities.  
</p>
<p>8. In addition to the curfew imposed on 27 November, on 2 December 2010, the 
Government closed the country&#8217;s land, air and sea boundaries, which were was 
subsequently reopened on 6 December. The Government also decided to withdraw the 
members of the Forces de defense et de securit&#233; (FDS) from the CCI, and asked 
administrative authorities deployed in the North to relocate to the South.  
</p>
<p>9. After some delays, the Independent Electoral Commission finally announced the 
results on 2 December 2010, declaring that Mr. Ouattara had won the presidential election 
by 54.1 per cent of the votes against 45.9 per cent for Mr. Gbagbo. On 3 December, the 
Constitutional Council reversed the results announced by the Commission and declared Mr. 
Gbagbo the winner with 51.45 per cent of the votes against 48.55 per cent for Mr. Ouattara, 
after invalidating the votes from seven regions in the North that had voted overwhelmingly 
for Mr. Ouattara. In his certification role, the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General validated the results announced by the Commission declaring Mr. Ouattara the 
winner. The certification of the Special Representative was fully endorsed by the 
international community. Nevertheless, on 3 December, the Constitutional Council swore in 
Mr. Gbagbo for a new term as President. In turn, on 4 December, Mr. Ouattara notified the </p>


<p>President of the Constitutional Council of his own swearing-in as President. Both sides 
formed their respective Governments. Former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro was 
reconfirmed in his function by Mr. Ouattara, while Mr. Gbagbo designated a university 
professor, Gilbert Marie Ak&#233; N&#8217;Gbo, as his new Prime Minister. The army gave its support 
to Mr. Gbagbo, while the Forces arm&#233;es des Forces nouvelles (FAFN) endorsed Mr. 
Ouattara. This unprecedented situation, where two presidential candidates were both sworn 
in as President-elect, heightened the political tension in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Human rights situation during and after the elections 
</b></p>
<p>10. The enforcement of the curfew declared on 27 November 2010, the repeated clashes 
between LMP and RHDP supporters and the violent suppression of an attempted public 
demonstration by RHDP supporters on 16 December 2010 led to systematic human rights 
abuses ranging from extra-judicial killings, torture, illegal arrest and detention, abductions 
and enforced disappearances, including that of journalists, and the wilful destruction of 
property.  
</p>
<p>11. During the period from 15 to 22 December 2010, 173 people were reported killed 
and 90 were subjected to torture and ill-treatment, while 471 others were arbitrarily arrested 
and detained in various detention centres, including the Police headquarters, where police 
officers allegedly conditioned the release of arrested people to the payment of as much as 
150,000 CFA francs (approximately $300). In addition, 24 people were reported missing 
during this period.  
</p>
<p>12. The human rights situation was exacerbated by public and private media, which 
polarized the political and electoral arena and spread inflammatory messages, thus 
jeopardizing national unity and cohesion. The ongoing political crisis also had a negative 
impact on the full realization of the right to education in some parts of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
particularly in Bouak&#233;, Daloa and Bondoukou, where classes were suspended  
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights violations by the defence and security forces and armed 
militia 
</b></p>
<p>13. Members of the defence and security forces, including those of the Compagnie 
r&#233;publicaine de s&#233;curit&#233; (CRS), the Centre de commandement des op&#233;rations de s&#233;curit&#233; 
(CECOS), the Republican Guard, the Brigade anti-&#233;meute, the Brigade du maintien de 
l&#8217;ordre, the gendarmerie and the Navy, aided by militia, youth groups and English-speaking 
&#8220;mercenaries&#8221;, cracked down on RHDP supporters, mainly of the Dioula and Baoul&#233; ethnic 
groups, in several locations. They used tear gas, grenades, machetes and live ammunition to 
quell demonstrations staged by unarmed opposition supporters. On 1 December, on the 
pretext that they were conducting a weapon search at the Rassemblement des Republicains 
(RDR) headquarters in Wassakara, Yopougon, CECOS members reportedly fired live 
ammunition, killing six RDHP supporters and injuring 14 others. Seven other RDHP 
supporters were arrested and detained at the central civilian prison, the Maison d&#8217;arr&#234;t et de 
correction d&#8217;Abidjan.  
</p>
<p>14. A similar raid was reportedly conducted on 25 December 2010 by members of the 
F&#233;d&#233;ration estudiantine et scolaire de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (FESCI), aided by the FDS and some 
militiamen, against the headquarters of the Parti d&#233;mocratique de C&#244;te d'Ivoire (PDCI) in 
the Cocody district of Abidjan. In the attack, 11 people were injured, three of whom 
sustained serious gunshot wounds. On 4 January 2011, at around 4.30 a.m., members of the 
FDS again raided PDCI headquarters. They fired gunshots, destroyed doors and arrested at 
least 63 RHDP supporters, including six women and a number of children. One person was </p>


<p>killed and four were seriously injured during the incident. Those arrested were held in 
custody at the Prefecture de la police in Plateau, then transferred to the central civilian 
prison. They were all subsequently released on 18 January.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Violent suppression of the demonstrations on 16 December 2010 
</b></p>
<p>15. Political violence escalated on 16 December 2010, when RHDP authorities tried to 
rally supporters from all over the country to march peacefully towards Abidjan to take over 
the building of Radiodiffusion T&#233;l&#233;vision ivoirienne (RTI) with a view to install the 
Director-General appointed by the Ouattara Government. The march was forcefully 
repressed by members of the FDS, particularly in Abidjan, Divo, Bondoukou and 
Ti&#233;bissou, near Yamoussoukro. In Yamoussoukro, a clash between members of the FDS 
and the FAFN resulted in several casualties. On the same day, a similar clash between FDS 
and FAFN members in Abidjan at the Golf Hotel resulted in at least 10 deaths, including 
three FDS soldiers. The FAFN in Bouak&#233; reinforced its troops and advanced to Ngattalikro, 
near Yamoussoukro, in the former zone of confidence, to head off a possible FDS attack 
from the south.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Call for civil disobedience by the Rassemblement des houphou&#235;tistes 
pour la d&#233;mocratie et la paix 
</b></p>
<p>16. Launched on 18 January 2011, Operation &#8220;ghost country&#8221;, by which the RHDP 
called for civil disobedience across the country, was severely repressed by the FDS from 18 
to 20 January in Abidjan, Abengourou, Agnibil&#233;bro and Gagnoa. The FDS members 
involved in these abuses included soldiers from the CECOS, the CRS, the Brigade anti-
&#233;meute and the Navy. The FDS aggressively removed barricades erected by RDHP 
supporters in the Att&#233;coub&#233; and Adjam&#233; neighbourhoods of Abidjan and in the 
Dioulabougou neighbourhood of Gagnoa, and shot indiscriminately at unarmed civilians, 
killing nine people, including a 15 year-old boy, and causing injury to 21 others. In 
reaction, demonstrators in Gagnoa vandalized nine buses belonging to Soci&#233;t&#233; de transport 
KS, a private company whose owner had refused to follow the call by RHDP. Three other 
people were killed in Agnibil&#233;kro by the FDS. The call by RHDP had a negative impact on 
the daily life of citizens, especially those working in the health and education sectors. 
Several schools were closed, and many patients were deprived of their basic right to 
medical care owing to the absence of medical personnel.  
</p>
<p>17. The passivity of law enforcement officers, who failed to protect civilians against 
various abuses, led to the establishment of self-defence groups to secure certain 
neighbourhoods. Local communities also used a warning system consisting of making noise 
with sauce pans and other kitchen tools, known as &#8220;op&#233;ration casseroles,&#8221; to prevent 
killings, abduction and other violations by the FDS or other security agencies.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Abobo PK 18 attacks  
</b></p>
<p>18. On 17 December 2010 and 11 January 2011, FDS soldiers raided Abobo PK 18, a 
suburb of Abidjan and a stronghold of President Ouattara&#8217;s supporters, where the soldiers 
suspected the presence of FAFN members and of <i>dozos</i> (traditional hunters) loyal to him. 
On 17 December 2010, they broke into private homes, fired gunshots all night long and 
arrested several young men. At least 18 people were reportedly killed in this operation. On 
11 January 2011, the FDS once again raided Abobo PK 18. On the pretext of searching for 
weapons and dismantling roadblocks erected by the local population, they broke into 
several homes, firing live bullets to intimidate residents. Preliminary information from </p>


<p>different sources indicated that at least nine people, including four FDS members, were 
killed during the incident. On 12 January, members of the Young Patriots in Abobo 
Avocatier killed at least two people, raising the death toll to at least 11. A curfew imposed 
by Mr. Gbagbo has been in force in Abobo and Anyama since 9 January. It should be noted 
that the nature and degree of the casualties inflicted on the police in the Abobo PK 18 
incidents, who in some instances sustained gunshot injuries, indicate the presence of armed 
&#8220;civilians&#8221; among the population. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Duekou&#233; incident and intercommunity tension in the post-electoral 
context 
</b></p>
<p>19. Intercommunity tension increased during the run-up to the presidential election; 
several cases of ethnic and politically-related violence were reported, particularly in 
Duekou&#233; in the west of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. On 3 January, at least 35 people were killed and 
more than 100 were wounded, and 230 houses were burned down in inter-ethnic violence 
between heavily armed Dioula and Guer&#233; militias, the latter allegedly aided by Liberian 
mercenaries. The incident occurred after a female trader of the Dioula ethnic origin was 
shot and killed in an ambush by a group of highwaymen composed of Guer&#233; youths. On 8 
and 9 January, the Humanitarian Coordinator in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire led a joint mission of United 
Nations country team agencies, including the human rights division of UNOCI, to 
Duekou&#233;, Man and Danan&#233; to assess the humanitarian implications of the clashes. The 
mission noted that women and children were the most affected, and identified several areas 
for urgent and immediate action, including health, water and sanitation, nutrition and the 
safety of the population.  
</p>
<p>20. Intercommunity violence has also been reported in many other areas, such as 
Abengourou, Bondoukou, Bouak&#233;, Dabou (40 km from Abidjan), Daloa, Divo, Gagnoa, 
Guiglo (32 km south-west of Duekou&#233;), Hir&#233;, Issia, Lakota, Oum&#233;, Sa&#239;oua, Sinfra (130 km 
from Daloa), San Pedro, Yamoussoukro and Zuenoula, between members of the native 
B&#233;t&#233;, Gouro and Dida groups and Baoul&#233; and Dioula communities over land claim disputes, 
exacerbated by political differences. Members of non-native communities were harassed, 
and some were killed for not voting for Mr. Gbagbo.  
</p>
<p>21. After the second round of the election, similar acts were committed against the 
above-mentioned communities, leading to the displacement of at least 94 members of the 
Baoul&#233; ethnic group from Bemadi (10 km from Issia) and neighbouring villages. Several 
victims and witnesses also testified that houses belonging to northerners and people from 
the Baoul&#233; ethnic group were marked with the signs &#8220;X&#8221; or &#8220;B&#8221; in various neighbourhoods 
of Abidjan to facilitate the identification of occupants for abduction, extra-judicial killing or 
the destruction or looting of property. The same witnesses also revealed the existence of 
blacklists of people to be eliminated. Many people therefore abandoned their homes out of 
fear of reprisals, and remained in hiding for weeks.  
</p>
<p>22. LMP supporters destroyed ballot boxes in Paulkro (15 km from Ouat&#233;), in San 
Pedro, Belem (6 km from Wat&#233;), Yaobl&#233;kro Chantier, Kanakro (10 km from Wat&#233;), Wat&#233; 
and Buyo. In some instances, they obstructed the deliberations of members of the 
Independent Electoral Commission, resulting in the cancellation of some results. Well-
known LMP leaders also incited native youths to harass and intimidate polling station staff. 
In Buyo, the gendarmerie brigade commander confiscated the voting cards of 10 would-be 
voters, whom he claimed were foreigners. Many would-be voters did not exercise their 
right to vote out of fear of reprisals. Similar abuses were reported in Akoup&#233; (Agneby), 
Dougbafla (Oum&#233;), Gadouan, Ouaragahio and Bakayo (Soubr&#233;), where militia groups and 
native youths erected barricades in order to prevent members of non-native communities 
from voting. </p>


<p><b> G. Internal and cross-border displacement  
</b></p>
<p>23. The prevailing political situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has also triggered the exodus of 
thousands of people into neighbouring countries. According to the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee of the United Nations country team, as at 27 January 2011, at least 32,000 
Ivorian refugees had registered in Liberia, 340 in Guinea, 168 in Togo, 92 in Mali, 12 in 
Burkina Faso and 13 in Ghana, while a total of 13,000 people had sought refuge with the 
Catholic Church in Duekou&#233; and 4,000 others in Man. The internal displacement of a 
considerable number of members of the Baoul&#233; ethnic group was reported in the village of 
Iboke (about 80 km west of San Pedro) in the Grand Bereby district following threats to 
their lives by LMP youths in the area. In Sinfra, clashes led to the displacement of 
approximately 1,000 people, who sought refuge at the UNOCI Banbatt camp on 28 
November. A similar displacement was observed in Yaakro-Koffikouassikro (6 km from 
Ti&#233;bissou) where 827 people, including 331 women and 176 children, fled the village for 
Ti&#233;bissou following the clash on 16 December between FDS and FAFN soldiers there.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Allegations of mass graves 
</b></p>
<p>24. UNOCI has received several reports of alleged mass graves in various parts of the 
country, mainly in Abidjan, Issia and Lakota (in the Kokora &#8220;poulailler&#8221; zone, 4 km from 
Lakota), Dahiri (4 km north of Lakota) and Lobodiguia (Daloa). Other witnessed alleged 
that several corpses had been buried in the For&#234;t de Banco, in Abidjan. On 28 December 
2010, a team of human rights investigators, led by the Chief of the Human Rights Division, 
attempted to investigate the alleged killing of between 60 and 80 people whose corpses 
were reportedly deposited on 18 December at Ndotr&#233; and subsequently removed to a 
morgue in Anyama, near Abidjan. A similar attempt had previously been made on 20 
December by a team led by the Special Representative. On both occasions, UNOCI 
investigators were blocked by soldiers loyal to Mr. Gbagbo from gaining access to the 
building in which the bodies were reported to be held. The Special Representative was 
stopped at gunpoint and forced to withdraw. Other attempts by UNOCI human rights 
officers to investigate reports of the existence of mass graves in Lakota and Issia were 
similarly impeded by FDS members and local administrative officials. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Targeting of religious buildings 
</b></p>
<p>25. On 17 and 18 December, FDS members stormed four mosques in Grand Bassam, 
Abobo and Williamsville, near Abidjan, during Friday prayers, causing the death of one 
person and injury to at least 27 others. In Grand Bassam, a group of police, gendarmes and 
marine officers stormed the Sylla mosque around 12.50 p.m. on 17 December while the 
Imam was conducting the sermon attended by several worshippers at the Friday prayers. 
The FDS threw teargas into the courtyard, creating panic in the crowd of worshippers. As a 
reaction, worshippers set fire to a vehicle belonging to the local police commissioner as 
well as to his home. In reprisal, the local security forces, reinforced by CRS members 
dispatched from Abidjan and aided by informants, broke into private homes and opened fire 
on civilians with live ammunition. One person was killed and a dozen others were injured. 
On the same day, CRS members fired shots and teargas at worshippers at the Al Hayatt 
Mosque in Andokoi 3, near Abobo, injuring 17 people, including 14 women. Similar 
incidents were reported in Abobo PK 18, at the Taqwa mosque, and in Williamsville, at Al 
Huda mosque. In the latter case, CRS members prevented worshippers from attending 
Friday prayers by firing gunshots and releasing teargas in the vicinity of the mosque 
between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., destroying property. On 16 December, in Bangolo, near </p>


<p>Duekou&#233;, armed men reportedly attacked a Catholic church. They escaped with computers 
and a vehicle, which was recovered on 20 December by its owner. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>26. With regard to violence against women, 23 cases of rape linked to post-election 
violence have been documented. On 24 December, a 44-year-old woman married to a high-
ranking State official was raped in Benongossou, near Abidjan airport, by three individuals 
dressed in civilian attire and armed with knives and machetes, and accompanied by another 
group of men dressed in military attire and armed with rifles. The woman was abducted 
outside her home and taken to a nearby bush, where she was sexually assaulted for refusing 
to make a pro-Gbagbo statement. The victim was referred to a specialized organization for 
psychological and medical assistance. 
</p>
<p>27. On 4 January 2011, in Duekou&#233;, 19 women and girls were gang-raped by armed 
militiamen, who threatened to burn them alive. On 15 January, a male RHDP supporter, 
aged 30, who had previously been arrested on 4 January during the raid on the PDCI 
headquarters by FDS members and released from detention on 5 January, was rearrested, 
tortured and sexually abused by members of the Republican Guard. In the holding cell, the 
victim was beaten and sodomized from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m. by eight soldiers, who also 
inserted the end of their kalashnikov rifles into his anus until he agreed to provide them 
with the names and addresses of other RHDP supporters. He was treated by UNOCI health 
personnel at the mission&#8217;s medical unit before being referred, on 16 January, to a 
specialized hospital for appropriate medical assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Role of the media in inciting hatred and violence 
</b></p>
<p>28. Even though all 14 presidential candidates had equal and free access to public media 
during the run-up to the first round of the election, the RTI mainly focused on the activities 
conducted by Mr. Gbagbo, Mr. Bedi&#233; and Mr. Ouattara. Public and private media failed to 
provide basic civic education training for the benefit of the citizens. One consequence of 
this failure was the high level of spoiled ballots observed in the first round of the election. 
Accusing foreign media of bias in the Ivorian crisis following the broadcast by France 24 of 
the provisional electoral results announced by the Independent Electoral Commission from 
the Golf Hotel, the Gbagbo Government shut down the foreign media, blocked the 
transmission of telephone text messages and attempted to block the transmitters of ONUCI 
FM radio, which was accused by Mr. Gbagbo and his supporters of broadcasting messages 
inciting violence. 
</p>
<p>29. This new situation was openly amplified by public and private media in the pay of 
political leaders, under the passive eye of the media regulator, the Conseil national de la 
communication audiovisuelle. The RTI publicly embarked upon an intensive and 
systematic campaign to incite intolerance and hatred against the United Nations, the 
African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the 
facilitator of the Ivorian dialogue and non-LMP leaders and supporters. It galvanized 
people, including soldiers loyal to Mr. Gbagbo, to prepare for a potential war. The RTI was 
turned into a propaganda machine for the LMP candidate, monopolizing media space, 
spreading inflammatory messages and violent speeches, and calling upon the Ivorian 
population to &#8220;resist the enemy&#8221;, thus creating a potentially explosive situation in the 
country. </p>


<p><b> L. Recruitment, arming and use of youths, militias and mercenaries 
</b></p>
<p>30. A worrying trend of youth militarization was observed in the country, particularly 
after the presidential run-off of 28 November 2010. Young people were recruited in 
different localities, but particularly in Abidjan, Bouafl&#233;, Daloa, San Pedro, the Agn&#233;by 
region, Vavoua and Zuenoula. In some instances, they were reportedly brought to Abidjan 
to undergo rapid military training in designated centres, such as Akakro village in 
Bingerville, in Cit&#233; verte (Yopougon), Zaon and 220 Logements. It was also reported that 
some youths were forcibly abducted and taken to the training centres to be used later as 
human shields should ECOWAS forces enter the country. Many were promised integration 
into the regular police force and the army. Some youths who had already completed their 
training were sent to the field with military uniform and weapons, while others have been 
kept in training centres, hotels and other venues. In this respect, UNOCI has received 
reliable information on the existence of a new fighting group called the &#8220;Force de r&#233;sistance 
et de lib&#233;ration de la C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire&#8221; linked to Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s camp. The group has already 
issued combatant cards to new recruits with a registration number and the signature of a 
certain &#8220;colonel Dj&#233;dj&#233; Gbeazigboyou&#8221;. The reverse side of the card reads <i>La C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
ou la mort</i> (&#8220;C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire or death&#8221;) and <i>Nous vaincrons</i> (&#8220;We will win&#8221;).  
</p>
<p>31. Another disturbing element is the reactivation of the Compagnie des Scorpions 
Guetteurs (also known as the Front de lib&#233;ration du Grand Centre), which reportedly 
intends to launch a new operation called &#8220;Libert&#233; immuable&#8221; from the centre of the country 
to &#8220;liberate&#8221; Bouak&#233; and the FAFN-controlled zone. The operation was reportedly launched 
more than eight months ago and involves the recruitment of around 1,000 youths, whose 
task will be to infiltrate zones controlled by Forces nouvelles and to collect information on 
the position of the FAFN and the Impartial Forces before the final assault by the FDS. A 
total of 14 sites - 10 in the north-east and four in the north-west - were identified for this 
operation, which is estimated to cost 35,000,000 CFA francs (around $70,000). In 
Yamoussoukro, the Scorpions Guetteurs committed abuses against the local population in 
the Dioulabougou neighbourhood. They injured 10 people, including two children, when 
locals attempted to dislodge them from the area to put an end to these abuses.  
</p>
<p>32. Other groups include the Young Patriots, led by Charles Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, the FESCI and 
alleged Liberian mercenaries reportedly recruited by the Gbagbo &#8220;Government&#8221;. Witnesses 
reported the presence of heavily armed mercenaries among the FDS in Abidjan, on 16 
December, in Duekou&#233; during the intercommunity clashes of 5 January 2011, and in Abobo 
PK18, on 11 January 2011. In response to the allegations about the involvement of Liberian 
mercenaries in the country, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia issued a press 
communiqu&#233; on 7 December in which she strongly advised Liberian nationals not to get 
involved in the Ivorian crisis. All these fighting groups work closely with the FDS, 
especially the Republican Guard and the CECOS. They are often used as informants in 
charge of identifying individuals to be arrested, abducted or assassinated and whose 
residences can be identified by specific symbols and markings.  
</p>
<p>33. Among the instigators of the above-mentioned operations, Charles Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, Mr. 
Gbagbo&#8217;s &#8220;Minister for Youth Affairs&#8221;, has been consistently cited by witnesses, alongside 
the former Minister for the Interior, D&#233;sir&#233; Tagro, the mayor of Yopougon, Bamana Djida, 
as well as other high-ranking LMP politicians and military officers. Sophisticated arms and 
machetes were reportedly distributed illegally to the recruits. Many reports revealed the 
existence of weapons caches in different locations in Abidjan and in the interior of the 
country. Armed youths from the native B&#233;t&#233;, Gouro, Gu&#233;r&#233; and Dida communities and 
other LMP supporters are reported to have committed acts of violence against members of 
other ethnic groups for not voting for Mr. Gbagbo. </p>


<p>34. On 4 January, 18 Malian nationals working as baggage handlers in the Adjam&#233; 
neighbourhood of Abidjan were abducted and taken to an unknown destination by a group 
of armed civilians on board two pick-up vehicles in the Adjam&#233;&#8211;Texaco neighbourhood. At 
the time of reporting, neither the circumstances surrounding their enforced disappearance 
nor their whereabouts had been established. At 4 p.m. on 12 January, three Malians were 
beaten to death in Abobo Avocatier by a group of Young Patriots. On 19 January, seven 
other Malian nationals were abducted, beaten and tortured in the village of Adjaman&#233; (35 
km west of San Pedro) by native Kroumen youths, who accused them of being rebels. The 
Malians, migrant workers who had just recently arrived in the area, were released from 
custody on the same day. 
</p>
<p><b> M. Situation in the zone controlled by Forces nouvelles during and after 
the elections 
</b></p>
<p>35. Although the situation has been calmer in the areas controlled by Forces nouvelles, a 
number of human rights violations has been reported. On 8 December, in reaction to the 
invalidation of the votes in seven northern regions by the Constitutional Council, all 
administrative authorities of the concerned localities stated in a press communiqu&#233; that 
polling had been generally free and fair in the area despite a few incidents observed in 
certain polling stations, which were quickly addressed. No killings had been noted. A few 
cases of human rights violations ranging from threats and intimidation to minor 
infringement of the right to physical integrity and to property were reported in the area 
during the second round of the election on 28 November.  
</p>
<p>36. In Bouak&#233;, the local headquarters of the ruling party, the Front populaire ivoirien of 
Mr. Gbagbo, was attacked and vandalized. The residences of Siki Blon Blaise, President of 
the Conseil general, of Lancin&#233; Gon Coulibaly, former mayor of Korhogo, and of Issa 
Malick Coulibaly, national campaign director for Mr. Gbagbo, were also looted and razed 
to the ground in Man and Korhogo, respectively, by young individuals reportedly belonging 
to the RHDP. Also in Korhogo, an LMP supporter was severely beaten and undressed by 
RDHP supporters following a political dispute. Similar attacks against the property of LMP 
officials by RHDP supporters were reported in Bocanda, M&#8217;Bahiakro and Toumodi, located 
in the area controlled by the Government. On 3 December, in Ben Kouassikro (5 km from 
Bouak&#233;), five FAFN soldiers, claiming to be search for weapons, broke into the home of 
the parents of an LMP representative and stole 13,000 CFA francs (around $26). Seven 
other FAFN members returned to the house two hours later and confiscated four bags 
containing some 1,000 T-shirts. They threatened to return if the LMP representative did not 
stop campaigning for Mr. Gbagbo. FAFN soldiers also arbitrarily arrested and detained two 
people in Bouak&#233;, a zone deserted by local judicial authorities after the proclamation of the 
28 November presidential election results, as well as nine foreigners (three Cameroonians, 
four Ghanaians, one Nigerian and one Togolese national) suspected of being mercenaries 
employed by the Gbagbo camp.  
</p>
<p>37. In Odienn&#233;, several incidents were reported, including attacks against private homes 
and the destruction of property following the proclamation of the provisional results 
announcing Mr. Ouattara as the winner. FAFN members looted the Diocesan office in 
Odienn&#233; as well as the residences of the local LMP campaign director for Odienn&#233; and of 
another LMP campaign director in Minignan. RHDP supporters also attempted to 
physically assault the principal of the Coll&#232;ge municipal, a midwife and two teachers. In 
Kani, near Segu&#233;la, a local member of the Independent Electoral Commission representing 
the LMP was intimidated and threatened with death. In Bouna, two vehicles belonging to 
LMP supporters were confiscated by RHDP youths. On 17 December, a vehicle belonging 
to a private company was confiscated by FAFN members in Vavoua (53 km from Daloa). </p>


<p>The vehicle was returned two days later to its owner following the intervention of UNOCI 
human rights officers. 
</p>
<p>38. On 15 and 16 December, FAFN soldiers clashed violently with the FDS in 
Ti&#233;bissou, a border town between the Forces nouvelles-controlled zone and the south, 
where the FDS had stopped the progress of northerners attempting to march from Bouak&#233; 
to Abidjan, where they planned to join other RDHP supporters to march to and seize the 
offices of the RTI. As a result of the skirmishes, three people were killed and 29 FAFN 
members and two civilians were injured. No information was available regarding casualties 
among Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s military and civilian supporters. On 5 January, the local vice-
president of the RHDP youth in Djebonoua (15 km from Bouak&#233;) threatened to physically 
assault LMP members, mainly those employed in the education sector, seriously affecting 
the enjoyment by pupils and students of their right to education. Traditional leaders and 
FAFN authorities intervened to preserve peace and social cohesion in the area. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Attacks on United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d'Ivoire and 
obstruction of its monitoring activities 
</b></p>
<p>39. Following the political deadlock, the Government formed by Mr. Gbagbo and the 
FDS began to obstruct UNOCI patrols and to propagate false news against the Operation, 
which they accused of supporting and arming the FAFN. Pre-empting possible threats 
against its staff, UNOCI decided to raise the security level from two to three and to 
evacuate, on 7 December, its non-essential staff to Banjul in the Gambia. Some UNOCI 
staff also received death threats. On 30 December, in Yamoussoukro, a certain Lieutenant 
Gondo of the Army training academy pointed at close range his rifle at the head of an 
UNOCI staff member and threatened to kill him. In another incident, a man who had 
worked for UNOCI in Abidjan as a driver during the presidential election received a death 
threat from armed men who visited his home on two separate occasions; fearing for his life, 
the man subsequently went into hiding. In the same vein, a female human rights officer who 
was returning to duty in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire after her rest and recuperation leave was denied entry 
at the airport by law enforcement officers, who molested her, forcibly took her back to the 
plane and forced her to return to France. In addition, obstructions by FDS members, youth 
and militia groups loyal to Mr. Gbagbo to the movement and work of UNOCI made it 
extremely difficult for the Operation to perform its mandated tasks effectively, including 
the investigation of alleged human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>40. In the midst of the political deadlock that followed the announcement of the 2010 
presidential election results, the UNOCI Human Rights Division is facing serious 
constraints in verifying the grave allegations of human rights violations. Local authorities 
refuse to cooperate, thus impeding the Division&#8217;s ability to investigate thoroughly the cases 
brought to its attention. Another major concern is the silence of national non-governmental 
organizations, as well as that of the National Human Rights Commission in the face of the 
serious human rights violations perpetrated by both sides in the ongoing political standoff. 
</p>
<p>41. To address these difficulties, the Human Rights Division established an integrated 
human rights monitoring and investigation task force on 15 December. The task force 
comprises 98 human rights experts drawn from the Division, 10 other UNOCI military, 
police and civilian components and four agencies of the United Nations country team in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The task force is organized into 12 field teams deployed across the country. 
Its work in the south of the country has, however, been hampered, unlike in the north, 
where the task force has been able to conduct its activities without obstruction. In the same 
vein, the Division established a 24-hour telephone service, the &#8220;green line&#8221;, through which 
violations can be reported by victims or witnesses. The green line was later transformed 
into a 24-hour call centre, where Division staff and other UNOCI components can log in </p>


<p>allegations of human rights violations received from the general public. More than 300 calls 
are received daily by the call centre. The Division has continued to verify allegations 
through established networks (such as religious groups and international non-governmental 
organizations) to orientate UNOCI military patrols to &#8220;hot spots&#8221; and thus reassure local 
communities and facilitate access to medical assistance for indigent victims in the medical 
hospital at UNOCI headquarters. The head of the Division participates in the UNOCI press 
conferences every Thursday to keep the general public and the international community 
informed about the human rights situation in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Action by the United Nations and the High Commissioner  
</b></p>
<p>42. The deteriorating human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has been strongly 
condemned by the Secretary-General, the special procedures mandate holders of the Human 
Rights Council and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The latter 
wrote individual letters to Mr. Gbagbo and three high-ranking military officers loyal to him, 
namely the Navy Commander, the Commander of the Republican Guard and the 
Commander of the CECOS. The High Commissioner reminded them of their responsibility 
to protect civilians and of their command and control accountability for serious human 
rights violations committed by individual members or units of the defence and security 
forces placed under their command. Other human rights mandate holders, notably the 
Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, the Special 
Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict and the Special 
Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, voiced their deep concern at the gross 
human rights violations committed in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire since the holding of the presidential 
election. Furthermore, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced his 
intention to send an assessment mission to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to determine whether the situation 
there warranted his intervention. 
</p>
<p>43. On 20 December, at a press conference broadcast on state television, Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s 
&#8220;Minister for the Interior&#8221; refuted reports of serious human rights violations in the country 
and regarded the reported death toll as biased, stating that the High Commissioner had 
failed to mention that 14 FDS members had been killed by Mr. Ouattara&#8217;s supporters. On 
the following day, in a televised message, Mr. Gbagbo acknowledged the killings and the 
burning and looting of property on 16 December in Abidjan during an attempted march by 
RHDP members. While insisting that he was the duly-elected president, he intimated his 
readiness to dialogue with Mr. Ouattara and proposed the creation of an evaluation 
committee on the post-election crisis with national, regional and international participants.  
</p>
<p>44. By Presidential Decree No. 2011-06 of 7 January 2011, Mr. Gbagbo established an 
international commission of inquiry with a mandate to investigate human rights violations 
related to the post-election period. The commission is composed of seven members, 
including four Ivorians &#8211; Djidji Kadjo Alphonse, Marc Richmond, Mawa Coulibaly and 
D&#233;preuba B&#233;atrice &#8211; and three foreigners: Willy Rubeya, a Burundian lawyer; Robert 
Charvin, a French law professor; and Jean Martin Mbenba, a former Minister for Human 
Rights of the Congo. The commission members have been assigned the responsibility of 
investigating human rights violations, identifying perpetrators and submitting a report to the 
&#8220;Gbagbo Government&#8221; within a month. </p>


<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>Following a relatively peaceful first round, the run-off of the 2010 presidential 
election in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, held on 28 November 2010, was marked by a drastic 
deterioration in the human rights situation. At least 275 people have been killed since 
mid-December. Acts of intimidation, harassment and other infringements of the rights 
to life, physical integrity, safety and security, and property were committed by 
supporters of political parties, in particular by LMP supporters. Members of the 
defence and security forces loyal to Mr. Gbagbo used excessive and deadly force to 
repress political opponents, thus progressively driving the country into political 
turmoil and installing a climate of suspicion, fear and repression. Reports of the 
recruitment and arming of youths, the forced recruitment of other people to be used 
as human shields in the event of war, and the reactivation and rearmament of various 
militia groups indicate a strong possibility that the human rights situation in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire will worsen, despite the mediation efforts made by the international 
community, the African Union and ECOWAS to put an end to the crisis. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>The prevailing political stalemate and the prospect of military intervention by 
ECOWAS with a view to installing the legitimate president-elect in power and the 
possible resumption of civil war in the country pose a real threat to the protection of 
civilians. The Security Council, in its resolution 1894 (2009) on the protection of 
civilians in armed conflicts, gave UNOCI a protection of civilians mandate, as outlined 
in Council resolution 1933 (2010), consisting in the protection, without prejudice to 
the primary responsibility of the Ivorian authorities, of civilians under imminent 
threat of physical violence, within the capabilities of UNOCI and its areas of 
deployment. In compliance with that resolution, UNOCI has drafted and adopted a 
comprehensive protection of civilians strategy that draws lessons from the 
shortcomings observed during the violent incidents of February 2010. A task force led 
by the Chief of the Human Rights Division was formed to draft and oversee the 
implementation of the strategy at both the national and subregional levels. To date, 
however, the strategy has not been fully implemented in the prevailing context, owing 
to the fact that UNOCI has been systematically prevented from implementing its 
mandate, including the strategy and the promotion and protection of human rights, by 
LMP supporters and officers and members of the FDS loyal to Mr. Gbagbo. The 
measures taken against UNOCI and its staff in this regard have included obstructing 
and restricting United Nations movement through the country, preventive and 
targeted attacks against United Nations personnel and property and turning back 
United Nations staff at the airport. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>In the light of the above, the High Commissioner makes the recommendations 
below. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. To the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Conduct in-depth, independent and impartial investigations into all 
politically-related violence, including serious human rights violations and abuses 
perpetrated during the period under review, and hold all perpetrators to account; </b></p>


<p><b> (b) Continue to seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis in order to end the 
suffering of the civilian population;
