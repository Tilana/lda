Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On August 2, 2016, in connection with the appointment of Robert V. Nelson, III to the Board of
Directors (the “Board”) of Sanchez Energy Corporation (the “Company”), as described below
under Item 5.02, the Company entered into an Indemnification Agreement (the “Indemnification
Agreement”) with Mr. Nelson. The Indemnification Agreement requires the Company to, among
other things, indemnify Mr. Nelson against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with his
status or service as one of the Company’s directors or in his capacity at other specified entities at
which he serves at the Company’s request and to advance his expenses incurred as a result of
any proceeding for which he may be entitled to indemnification. The Indemnification Agreement
is intended to provide indemnification rights to the fullest extent permitted under the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and is in addition to any other rights that Mr. Nelson may
have under the Company’s organizational documents or applicable law.
The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the Indemnification Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on
Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain
Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
(d) Appointment of Director
On August 2, 2016, Mr. Nelson was appointed to the Board.  The Board determined Mr. Nelson to
be independent under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and qualified to serve
on the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the
Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) of the Board under the rules of the
NYSE and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to which committees Mr. Nelson was
appointed concurrently with his appointment as director. The Board has assigned Mr. Nelson to
Class I, for which the term of office expires on the date of the Company’s 2019 annual meeting of
stockholders.
Mr. Nelson, age 40, was most recently with C&J Energy Services, Ltd.  (“C&J”) where he was
Vice President of Corporate Operational Development.  In this capacity he was responsible for
joint ventures and strategic partnerships with operators while assisting in the merger of certain
operating units of Nabors Industries Ltd. (“Nabors”) with C&J.  Prior to joining C&J, Mr. Nelson
served in positions of increasing importance with Nabors and its subsidiaries.  He began in
Corporate Development followed by successful assignments in Treasury, Nabors Drilling USA,
and Nabors Well Services.  He was subsequently named Vice President and General Manager
of the South Texas Region for Nabors Completion and Production Services, where he was
responsible for directing this unit’s rapidly growing activity in the Eagle Ford Shale.  Mr. Nelson
worked for UBS before beginning his career at Nabors.  He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from
the University of Texas at Austin and a Master of Business Administration degree from Rice
University’s Jones Graduate School of Business.
There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Nelson and any other person
pursuant to which Mr. Nelson was appointed to serve as a director of the Company. There are no
transactions in which Mr. Nelson had or will have an interest that would be required to be
disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
In connection with his appointment as a director, the Compensation Committee awarded 28,576
shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Nelson (the “Director Grant”), pursuant to the Sanchez
Energy Corporation Third Amended and Restated 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “Plan”).
The Director Grant was made pursuant to a Restricted Stock Agreement, a form of which was
previously filed with the Company’s registration statement on Form S-8 (File No. 333-178920)
and is incorporated herein by reference, and will vest on June 1, 2017. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan), the shares of
restricted common stock will vest automatically. In addition, in the event of Mr. Nelson’s death,
the Compensation Committee may, but is not obligated to, accelerate the vesting of any or all of
the respective shares of restricted common stock. Further, notwithstanding the above, pursuant to
the terms of Mr. Nelson’s restricted stock
2
agreement, the Compensation Committee may, at its sole discretion, choose to accelerate the
vesting of an award of restricted shares at any other time.
