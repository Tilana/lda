United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in Empire's Annual Report filed with
the SEC on Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2004 and in conjunction with Great South Land
Minerals Limited’s audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2004 filed with the Australian Securities
and Investments Commission . In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim
periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially
duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for 2004 as reported in the 10-KSB have been
omitted.
Organization:  Empire Energy Corporation International (“EEGC” or “the Company”) was incorporated in Utah on
November 10, 1983. EEGC commenced commercial activity in the oil and gas industry on May 17, 1999. The
primary prospect was in Nicaragua. EEGC also participated in an exploration program in Tennessee in 1999 and
continuing until 2002. During 2000 and 2001, EEGC acquired additional production and/or prospects in Texas,
Oklahoma and Wyoming.
During 2002, EEGC sold most of its oil and gas properties and entered into an agreement to acquire Great South
Land Minerals (“GSLM”). Effective April 12, 2004, EEGC changed its name from Empire Energy Corporation to
Empire Energy Corporation International, reincorporated in the state of Nevada, increased the authorized shares
from 50 million to 100 million and effected a 1 for 10 reverse stock split. During 2003 and 2004, EEGC sold all
properties, settled some debts and pursued the acquisition of GSLM, which was completed April 7, 2005.
Reverse Acquisition: On April 7, 2005 (acquisition date) Empire Energy received 96.4% acceptances for its bid to
acquire all the common stock in GSLM and on June 15, 2005 Empire Energy compulsorily acquired the remaining
common stock of GSLM. All of the outstanding shares of GSLM were exchanged for 62,426,782 shares of Empire
Energy common stock in a one for one scrip issue.
Pursuant to the guidance in Appendix B of SEC Accounting Disclosure Rules and Practices Official Text, the
“merger of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell corporation with nominal net assets
typically results in the owners and management of the private company having actual or effective operating control
of the combined company after the transaction, with the shareholders of the former public shell continuing only as
passive investors. These transactions are considered by the staff to be capital transactions in substance, rather than
business combinations. That is, the transaction is equivalent to the issuance of stock by the private company for the
net monetary assets of the shell corporation, accompanied by a recapitalisation. Accordingly, the reverse acquisition
has been accounted for as a recapitalisation. For accounting purposes, GSLM is considered the acquirer in the
reverse acquisition and all history presented is that of GSLM.  Operating results of EEGC are included in these
consolidated financial statements from the date of the reverse acquisition, April 7, 2005.  References to EEGC in the
remainder of these notes will refer to the consolidated company including the operating history of GSLM unless
otherwise specified.
The costs of the reverse acquisition (transaction costs) have been charged to expense.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect the historical results of GSLM, and the
consolidated results of operations of the Company and GSLM subsequent to the date of acquisition.
Principles of Consolidation:    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EEGC (the “Parent”
entity) and its wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated on consolidation.

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Going Concern and Liquidity:  EEGC is in the development stage, devoting substantially all of its efforts to
exploration and raising financing. EEGC has substantially funded its operations with proceeds from the issuance of
common stock. In the course of its exploration activities, EEGC has sustained operating losses and expects such
losses to continue for the foreseeable future. EEGC will finance its operations primarily through cash and cash
equivalents on hand, future financing from the issuance of debt or equity instruments and through the generation of
revenues once commercial operations get underway. However, the Company has yet to generate any significant
revenues and has no assurance of future revenues. To management’s knowledge, no company has yet successfully
developed sub-surface hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in Tasmania. Even if development efforts are
successful, substantial time may pass before revenues are realised.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. However, significant uncertainties exist in relation
to conditions that cast doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These are:
·
Substantial losses incurred through supporting the ongoing exploration expenditure during the period since the
inception of the Company.
Uncertainties in terms of the ability to generate cash flows in the future considering that production operations have
not yet commenced.
Extensive commitments for expenditure under the Company’s key mineral exploration lease.
·
Current liabilities of $1,778,963 and current assets of $39,753 including cash or cash equivalents of $1,710 at
September 30, 2005.
The exploration licence SEL 13/98 has been renewed effective 1 October 2004, and has strict mandatory
cumulative expenditure requirements of $3,248,610 by 30 September 2005, $5,085,495 by 30 September 2006,
$8,004,438 by 30 September 2007, $11,976,245 by 30 September 2008 and $13,077,159 by 30 September 2009
without which the licence will be revoked.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms.
The continuing viability and its ability to continue as a going concern and to meet its obligations as they fall due is
dependent on the Company being successful in raising additional funds. The Company’s inability to raise capital
may have a material adverse affect on its financial condition, ability to meet its obligations and operating needs and
results of operations.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
of asset carrying amounts or to the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the
Company not continue as a going concern.
The Company has planned the following activities and the following activities exist to address the above going
concern issues.
·
The directors have reviewed their short-term cash flow requirements and consider that the company has or has
access to sufficient funds to meet the financial obligations of the company.

Going Concern and Liquidity  (continued):
These include:
-
Advances received since September 30, 2005, from entities associated with a director of the company, totalling
approximately $32,528. Negotiations are underway with that same entity, for additional funding.
-
Declarations from key creditors (which represented $1,375,550 of the liabilities as at September 30, 2005) that
proceeding to enforce collection of debt will not be undertaken before January 1, 2007 in respect of all relevant
debts incurred up to September 30, 2005.
·
The directors have reviewed the cash flow requirements necessary to meet the company’s exploration expenditure
commitments and consider that the following actions will ensure that the company has access to sufficient funds.
These include:
-
Obtained approval to increase authorised shares to allow additional acquisitions and fund-raising activities
-
Seeking acquisitions that will provide capital and cash flow
-
Working on refinancing opportunities and using the additional shares to pursue development activities.
-
Entering into negotiations with a number of parties for additional funding.
Emphasis of Matter: The report of the independent registered public accounting firm on EEGC’s financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2004 contained an emphasis of matter paragraph regarding the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern. The independent audit report on GSLM’s financial statements for the year ended 30
June 2004 contained an emphasis of matter paragraph regarding the GSLM’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Revenue Recognition:  Interest revenue is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the
financial asset. Other revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Generally, these criteria are met at
the time product is delivered.
Marketable securities:  Investment securities that are held for short-term resale are classified as trading securities
and carried at fair value. Debt securities that management has the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified
as held-to-maturity and carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discounts using
methods approximating the interest method. Other marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are
carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale
are reported as a net amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of applicable income taxes. Costs of
securities sold are recognized using the specific identification method.

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Property and Equipment:  The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment by
comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets
when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Should
an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over
the asset’s fair value or discounted estimates of future cash flows.
The successful efforts method of accounting is followed for costs incurred in oil and gas exploration and production
operations:
Capitalization of Oil and Gas Expenditures:  Acquisitions costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized
when incurred. Costs of unproved properties are transferred to proved properties when proved reserves are found.
Exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved
properties, are charged against income as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are capitalized initially; however, if it is
determined that an exploratory well does not contain proved reserves, the capitalized costs are charged to expense,
as dry hole costs, at that time. Development costs are capitalized. Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and
equipment and to lift oil and gas to the surface are generally expensed.
Leasehold Impairment and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization:   Unproved properties whose costs are
individually significant are evaluated for impairment by management. Costs of such properties surrendered or
abandoned are charged to exploration expense.
The acquisition costs of proved properties are depleted by the unit of production method based on proved reserves.
Capitalized exploratory drilling costs which result in the discovery of proved reserves and development costs are
amortized/depreciated by the unit of production method based on proved developed reserves. The unit
determination is by field.
Other Property and Equipment:  Other property and equipment is depreciated under the straight-line method over the
useful lives of the assets ranging from 2 to 9 years.
·
Dismantlement, Restoration and Abandonment Costs: In accordance with SFAS No. 143, “ Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations ”, (which became effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2003), which addresses
financial accounting and reporting for liabilities associated with the retirement of long-lived assets, the Company
recognises the fair value of a liability for asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long
lived assets and the associated retirement costs in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair
value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this
additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset as part of depreciation, depletion, and
amortisation. The effect of the passage of time on the amount of the liability is recognised as accretion expense. If
the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, the Company will recognise a gain or loss
on settlement. The adoption of SFAS 150 had no effect on the Company’s financial statements.

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Property and Equipment (continued):
The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is charged to operating expenses as incurred. Material expenditures
which increase the life of an asset are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the
asset. The cost of properties sold, or otherwise disposed of, and the related accumulated depreciation or
amortisation is removed from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in current operations.
Income Taxes : The Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability method pursuant to SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes (“Statement 109”). Under the asset and liability method of Statement 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognised in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets when future
realisation is uncertain.
Receivables : The collectibility of receivables is assessed and an allowance is made for any doubtful accounts.
Receivables at September 30, 2005 have been reduced by an allowance of $30,480 compared to $Nil the previous
year.
Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less.
Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit
risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand in two financial
institutions in Australia. Deposits held with financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on
such deposits. The Company has not experienced any material losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.
Use of Estimates : The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
The Company’s financial statements are based on a number of significant estimates including the selection of the
useful lives for property, equipment, and oil and gas reserve quantities which are the basis for the calculation of
depreciation, depletion and amortisation of oil and gas properties. Management emphasises that reserve estimates
are inherently imprecise and that estimates of more recent discoveries are more imprecise than those for properties
with long production histories. Accordingly, the Company’s estimates are expected to change as future information
becomes available and such changes could be material.
As mandated under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, the Company is required under certain circumstances to evaluate the possible
impairment of the carrying value of its long-lived assets. In addition to the uncertainties inherent in the estimation
process, these amounts are affected by historical and projected prices for oil and natural gas which have typically
been volatile. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s oil and gas reserve estimates will materially change in
the forthcoming year.
Foreign Currency Translation : The functional currency of GSLM is the Australian dollar. Financial statements for
GSLM are translated into United States dollars at year end exchange rates as to assets and liabilities and weighted
average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses. Capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange
rates when capital transactions occurred.

Stock Issuance Costs:  These costs consist primarily of placement fees and expenses and professional fees. These
expenses are charged against the related proceeds from the sale of Company stock in the periods in which they
occur or are charged to expense in the event of a terminated stock issuance.
Comprehensive Income (Loss) : the Company accounts for comprehensive income (loss) under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, “ Reporting Comprehensive Income ” (“SFAS 130”). SFAS 130
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components. The foreign currency
translation gains (losses) resulting from the translation of the financial statements of GSLM, expressed in Australian
dollars, to United States dollars are reported as other comprehensive income (loss) and as accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in the Statement of Stockholders’ Deficit.
Net Loss Per Share:  The company has presented the basic and diluted net loss per share pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, Earnings Per Share. In accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic and
diluted net loss per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Dilutive net loss per share would give affect to the dilutive effect of common stock
equivalents consisting of option and warrants. Potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the net loss
per common share calculation as the effects would be antidilutive.
Stock Options : The Company and its subsidiaries have issued options to Directors, Director-related entities and
Officers. The Company measures compensation cost as prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”), “
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ”. No compensation cost relating to the granting of stock options has
been recognised in the financial statements as the exercise price of all option grants were equal to or greater than
the fair value of the company’s common stock at the date of grant.
Basic and diluted net loss per share calculations are presented in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Statement 128, and are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. They include the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents in years with net income.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements : in December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46r (“FIN
46r”), “ Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. ” This interpretation provides guidance on the identification of, and
financial reporting for, variable interest entities. Variable interest entities are entities that lack the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or lack sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support. FIN 46 requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if that company is obliged to absorb the
majority of the entity’s expected losses or entitled to receive the majority of the entity’s residual returns, or both. FIN
46 also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in
which it has a significant variable interest. FIN 46 is applicable immediately to variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003. For all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, FIN 46 is applicable to periods
beginning after December 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 will not have an effect on the Company’s financial
statements.
In May 2003, as amended in November 2003, The FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “ Accounting for Certain
Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity ” (“SFAS 150”), which establishes standards for how
an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
SFAS 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope, which may have previously
been reported as equity, as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). This statement is effective in fiscal
periods beginning after December 15, 2004. The adoption of SFAS 150 had no effect on the Company’s financial
statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements (continued) :
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “ Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities ” to amend and clarify financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. The changes in this statement
improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly to
achieve more consistent reporting of contracts as either derivative or hybrid instruments. SFAS No. 149 was
effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 had no effect on
the Company’s financial statements.
NOTE 2 – TAXATION
In assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, the Company applies SFAS No. 109 to determine whether it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, the
Company’s valuation allowance at September 30, 2005 and 2004 reduces the net deferred tax assets to $0.
Deferred tax assets consist of:
Net operating losses

At June 30, 2005, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $8,250,969. The benefit of
tax losses will be available provided the following are met:
The Company derives future assessable income of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from
the deductions for the losses to be realized;
The Company continues to comply with the conditions for deductibility imposed by the law; and
No changes in tax legislation adversely affect the Company in realizing the benefit from the deductions for the
losses.
The increase in the valuation allowance was $444,439 and $276,567 during 2005 and 2004, respectively.

NOTE 5 – CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)
HEM Mutual Assurance LLC
As detailed in Note 8, EEGC entered into a complex Convertible Debenture Purchase Agreement with HEM Mutual
Assurance LLC (“HEM”) closing on July 2, 2004. If the Company breaches one of a number of key terms in the
agreement, HEM can sue Empire for compensation damages equal to $3,000,000 payable on demand. At the date
of this report, the Company has not breached any of these key terms.
Centurion Private Equity, LLC
In November 2001, EEGC entered into an investment agreement ("Investment Agreement") with Centurion Private
Equity, LLC ("Centurion"). The investment agreement entitled EEGC to issue and sell its common stock for up to an
aggregate of $15 million under certain conditions during a three-year period. The three-year period began with the
SB-2/A registration statement that was filed with the SEC dated January 31, 2002. Rights under this arrangement
expired unused on January 31, 2005.
In connection with the Investment Agreement, EEGC issued and delivered to Centurion a warrant to purchase
125,000 shares of common stock.  This warrant is exercisable at a price of $0.80 per share and expires September
6, 2006.
Anadarko Energy Services Company
During August 2001, EEGC agreed to sell the gas production from its Bedsole #1 well in Leon County, Texas to
Anadarko Energy Services Company. The primary term of the agreement was two years with provision to be
extended year to year thereafter. The gas price was an indexed based price reduced by an amount that allows
Anadarko to recover the cost of measurement equipment normally paid for by the producer. Once 200,000 MMBTU's
of gas was delivered during the primary term of the contract the price reduction was eliminated. If the wells do not
deliver 200,000 MMBTU's during the primary term EEGC must pay $0.30 per MMBTU for any shortage. The
property was sold to Carr Resources in August 2002 but the potential liability from the gas contract remained with
EEGC. Carr drilled an additional productive well on the unit in September 2002, which reduced the required
production. Total production is unknown but no claim has been made to EEGC since the primary term of the
agreement expired in August 2003 and no claim is expected.
Industria Oklahoma-Nicaragua, S. A.
Prior to 2002, EEGC acquired a 51% interest in the Industria Oklahoma-Nicaragua, S.A. ("ION"), a Nicaraguan
subsidiary, which had been pre-qualified in that country to bid on oil and gas concessions and had incurred certain
obligations to pursue this concession.  All rights and obligations of this interest were distributed during 2004 to a
corporation owned by EEGC shareholders of record July 1, 2002.
Common stock issuance
During December 2004 and January 2005, the company sold 3,420,000 and 1,460,000 shares of common stock for
$342,000 and $146,000, respectively. Terms of the sales included a provision that allowed the purchasers of these
shares to receive an additional 50% of shares if the acquisition of GSLM was not completed within 90 days of their
purchase. The purchase of GSLM was completed on April 6, 2005. In September 2005 the company issued
2,490,000 additional shares of common stock to settle this contingency.
With these sales of the common stocks, the company issued 1,500,000 warrants to the broker as its offering costs.

NOTE 8 – CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES
On July 2, 2004, EEGC obtained $500,000 for operating capital by assuming notes payable to HEM Mutual
Assurance LLC (“HEM”).  The notes payable had been issued by  Bob Owen & Company, Inc. a Kansas corporation
("BOCI") for the specific purpose of merging with and funding EEGC. The notes accrue interest at 1.5% per annum.
$485,000 is convertible to common shares of EEGC at the lower of $1.30, 125% of the average of the five days
closing price preceding the conversion date, or 100% of the average of the three lowest closing prices for the 40
days preceding the conversion date, $15,000 is convertible at $0.01 per share.   There is no collateral for the notes.
  The notes mature on May 19, 2009.
The notes called for an original cap on convertible shares of 1,650,000.  However, the debtor has the ability to force
additional shares to be issued, therefore, no cap on shares was used when calculating the beneficial conversion
feature of the notes.  The $500,000 in proceeds is convertible into 2,063,953 shares, for a fair value per share of
$0.24.
The notes have been discounted for fair value of stock issued for the purchase of BOCI and the beneficial
conversion feature.   As of June 30, 2005 700,000 shares of common stock were issued for $7,000 of debt.  The
value of the stock converted, $169,577 (700,000 times $0.24), was amortized.   The remaining discounts will be
amortized over the life of the note.   A summary of the notes is as follows:

In addition to the debentures disclosed above, there is a contingent convertible debenture due to HEM. If EEGC
chose to activate the contingent convertible debenture, EEGC would receive proceeds of $500,000 and HEM would
be entitled to repayment or to acquire additional common stock shares at an exercise price of between the lower of
$1.625 and the average of the three lowest closing per share bid prices during the 40 trading days prior to
conversion. At September 30, 2005 the conditions for exercising this contingent debenture had not been met.

NOTE 12 – MERGER WITH GREAT SOUTH LAND MINERALS LIMITED
Overview of GSLM : GSLM is a development stage company that was incorporated in Tasmania, Australia in 1995.
The principal activity of GSLM is the exploration and development of sub-surface hydrocarbons in Tasmania.
Background to the Merger:  On July 15, 2002, the Board of Directors of EEGC unanimously approved the terms and
conditions for the acquisition of GSLM as established by a letter of intent between GSLM and EEGC dated July 9,
2002 and amended on December 10, 2002 and October 16, 2003.  Under this agreement, shareholders of GSLM
would own approximately 95% of the EEGC common stock upon completion of this reverse acquisition.
At a shareholders meeting of EEGC held on March 29, 2004, all of the necessary shareholder approvals required by
EEGC were obtained. On May 27, 2004, an agreement was entered into by GSLM and EEGC to actively pursue the
merger of the two companies.
On July 2, 2004 EEGC obtained proceeds of $500,000 of working capital by merging with Bob Owen and Company
Inc., a Kansas Corporation (“BOCI”). At the date of merger, BOCI did not have any material assets and liabilities
except for the convertible debenture purchase agreement with HEM Mutual Assurance LLC detailed in Note 8.
EEGC used these funds to pay operating expenses and pursue its acquisition of GSLM.
On March 4, 2005, EEGC lodged a Bidder’s Statement with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to
acquire all the share capital of GSLM in a one for one scrip issue. On April 7, 2005, EEGC announced that it had
received 96.4% acceptances and on June 15, 2005 it compulsorily acquired the remaining common stock of GSLM.
NOTE 13 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In August 2005, the company agreed to purchase a 37.5% ownership interest in Zeehan Zinc, Limited, a Tasmanian
mining company, by issuing 37.5 million of its common shares in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of
the corporation that owned the 37.5% interest.  The transaction was not completed by September 30, 2005 so the
acquisition does not appear in these financial statements.
In September 2005, the company agreed to purchase seismic services in a total amount of approximately
$4,560,000.  The services had not been substantially completed at September 30, 2005 so the expenditure does not
appear in these financial statements.
25
Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In order to resolve the Company's remaining liabilities and provide the stockholders with an opportunity to
participate in a potential major oil and gas exploration project, the Board of Directors, on July 15, 2002, unanimously
approved the terms and conditions for the acquisition of Great South Land Minerals, Ltd. (GSLM). GSLM is an oil &
gas exploration firm headquartered in Hobart, Tasmania (Australia). Approval of the Company's shareholders was
obtained at a shareholder's meeting held March 29, 2004. Acceptance by a majority of GSLM shareholders was
obtained in April 2005 and acquisition of 100% of GSLM shares was completed in June 2005. Approximately 62
million shares of Empire common stock were issued to former GSLM shareholders representing over 85% of the
outstanding shares of the combined company and qualifying as a reverse acquisition.  Accordingly, the operating
history included in these financial statements is that of GSLM before the date of acceptance of the offer, April 7,
2005, and includes the activity of Empire after that date.  Since Empire had immaterial assets at the date of the
acquisition, the financial statements are combined in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.
In anticipation of the GSLM merger, Empire acquired a Convertible Debenture Purchase Agreement dated as of
July 2, 2004, with HEM Mutual Assurance LLC, an accredited investor located in Minneapolis, Minnesota ("HEM"),
pursuant to which it sold and issued convertible debentures to HEM in an aggregate principal amount of up to
$1,000,000, of which, $500,000 has been received and primarily used to pay costs of pursuing the GSLM merger.
Through September 30, 2005, HEM has converted approximately $7,000 of the debentures into approximately
700,000 shares of common stock.  This arrangement is more fully described in Part II, Unregistered Sale of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds.
The acquisition of GSLM was accepted by a majority of the shareholders of GSLM in April 2005.  The combined
Company will continue to pursue other merger candidates, financing and business arrangements that will resolve
the current liabilities and increase the value of the Company.
No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in implementing these plans or attaining
successful operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty.
Results of Operations
During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the combined Company generated no revenue. The combined
Company generated a loss of $252,879 by incurring general & administrative expenses of $205,414, primarily legal,
accounting, auditing and consulting expenses required to maintain the corporate existence and pursue the GSLM
merger and related financing, recording interest expense of $21,146 and incurring exploration expenses of $30,799
to maintain and pursue the value in the property rights.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the
Company (then GSLM alone) also generated no revenue. The Company generated a loss of $158,498 primarily by
incurring $165,753 from general and administrative expenses and $3,172 in interest expense.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the Company generated no revenue. The Company
generated a loss of $1,239,112 by incurring general & administrative expenses of $1,016,539, primarily legal,
accounting, auditing and consulting expenses required to maintain the corporate existence and pursue the GSLM
merger and related financing, recording interest expense of $51,395 and incurring $187,271 in exploration
expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2004, the Company also generated no revenue. The
Company generated a loss of $419,698 primarily by incurring $370,940 from general and administrative expenses
and $49,145 in interest expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
On September 30, 2005, the Company had $1,710 in cash, and $3,989,675 in total liabilities.   The liabilities
include approximately $250,000 in convertible debentures and the remainder substantially in trade payables and
accrued expenses.Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was
$385,771 compared to $293,765 for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.  No cash was used in investing
activities  for the nine months ended September 30, 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities was $309,091
for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, from current borrowings. Net cash of $304,179 was provided by
financing activities and no cash was used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2004.
 Additional financing will be needed to develop the license property and pursue the company’s business plan.
26
Present Activities:
The Company has completed the acquisition and is pursuing financing opportunities and pursuing the business
plan.
Item 3. Controls and Procedures
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed for the purposes of ensuring that
information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-QSB.  Based upon
that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective for
the purposes discussed above as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-QSB.  There
was no significant change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
