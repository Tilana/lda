<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth 
session from 21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Montenegro was held at the 
11th meeting on 28 January 2013. The delegation of Montenegro was headed by Suad 
Numanovi&#263;, Minister of Human Rights and Minorities. At its 16th meeting held on 31 
January 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Montenegro. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Montenegro: Estonia, Mauritania, United 
States of America. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 
5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued 
for the review of Montenegro: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">5. Poland took note of the standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders.  It 
commended efforts to protect human rights, noting the establishment of the Protector of 
Human Rights and Freedoms (Ombudsman) and the Law on the Prohibition of 
Discrimination. The high rates of children subjected to sexual exploitation or abuse and 
cases of child engaged in exploitative labour raises concern. Poland made 
recommendations. </footnote>/15/MNE/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">4. The Philippines recognized the significant developments since Montenegro&#8217;s 
independence and its accession to numerous human rights conventions, but expressed 
concern that Montenegro had not yet acceded to the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
(ICRMW). Cooperation with regional and international partners to combat human 
trafficking is commendable. Acknowledging measures to address domestic violence and 
promote women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, it encouraged Montenegro to intensify efforts to 
implement strategies and action plans in those areas. It made recommendations. 
</footnote>/15/MNE/2 and Corr.<footnote name="1">5. Regarding the rights of the child, the development of the National Action Plan for 
Children is in the final stage of adoption. 
</footnote>); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">3. Norway noted the establishment of various institutions to enforce human rights and 
their participation in public discussion on said rights. Despite a general positive trend, 
sustained efforts are required to implement international standards and harmonize the legal 
framework. It encouraged the Government to address this process as a matter of a priority. 
Norway made recommendations. 
</footnote>/15/MNE/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Czech Republic, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Montenegro through the troika. These questions 
are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Montenegro welcomed the opportunity to present its national report, especially 
given that Montenegro joined the Human Rights Council as of 1 January 2013. The 
Government confirmed its commitment to the Council by deciding to appoint the special 
representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ambassador, on the Council 
</p>
<p>6. The national report was a result of cooperation between State authorities and non-
governmental organizations. The United Nations system in Montenegro supported the 
process of drafting the report. The Government of Montenegro adopted the national report 
on the status of human rights in Montenegro on 13 September 2012. 
</p>
<p>7. Montenegro has achieved significant progress since its previous report in 2008, inter 
alia, in the following areas: independence of the judiciary; decriminalization of insult and 
defamation; fight against corruption and organized crime; improvement of the prison 
system; legal reforms related to anti-discrimination, domestic violence, trafficking in 
human beings, strengthening of capacities of the Ombudsman; setting up the Council for 
anti-discrimination, Council for persons with disabilities and Council for rights of the child; 
advancement of tolerance towards differences, in particular in relation to the LGBT 
population; social inclusion of the Roma and Egyptian community. </p>


<p>8. The greatest attainment of Montenegrin independence has been the multiethnic 
harmony and continuation of free democratic elections, promotion of work and support to 
human rights activists. 
</p>
<p>9. On 29 June 2012, Montenegro opened the negotiation process for full membership 
in the European Union (EU). Through harmonization with the <i>acquis</i>, implementation of 
legislative framework and regular monitoring of the respect for human rights and freedoms, 
the negotiations will lead to further progress in implementing EU and United Nations 
standards. 
</p>
<p>10. Significant progress has been made to strengthen the independence and efficiency of 
the judiciary. The law prescribes more objective criteria for the election and promotion of 
judges and State prosecutors and the system for their appraisal, and election procedures 
have been upgraded. The composition of the Prosecutorial Council was changed in order to 
provide greater independence. Cooperation with international institutions, in particular the 
European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), has been advanced. The Courts of Montenegro 
website (www.sudovi.me) now makes available final court judgments, ECtHR judgments 
against Montenegro, publications and characteristic judgments of the Strasbourg Court. 
</p>
<p>11. The biggest step forward in the provision of systemic conditions for the fight against 
discrimination in Montenegro has been the adoption of the Law on Prohibition of 
Discrimination (2010) and the new Law on the Ombudsman (2011); their full 
implementation lies ahead. 
</p>
<p>12. The implementation plan for the Law on Prohibition of Discrimination, developed 
together with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), set the 
education plan and media promotion plan for anti-discriminatory action. 
</p>
<p>13. Three important international conferences have been organized so far (two of them 
took place last year), devoted primarily to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) 
rights. 
</p>
<p>14. Cooperation with local self-governments concerning gender mainstreaming at the 
local level has continued and improved. However, more efficient implementation of 
legislation in this area needs further work, especially with regard to greater participation of 
women in leadership and combating violence against women. 
</p>

<p>20. Particular attention has been provided to social inclusion of the Roma and Egyptian 
population in Montenegrin society. In April last year, the Government of Montenegro 
adopted the new strategic document for improvement of the situation of Roma and 
Egyptians in Montenegro for the period 2012-2016. 
</p>
<p>21. One of the major challenges faced by Montenegro is a durable solution to the 
situation of refugees and internally displaced persons from the former Yugoslavia. This 
issue is being resolved by the development of a legal framework, strengthening of 
institutions and through a regional approach (the Sarajevo process) that will include 
cooperation with the countries of origin of the displaced persons. Aware of the complexity 
of the issue, in October 2011, the Government of Montenegro set up the Coordinating 
Committee for monitoring implementation of the Strategy for a durable solution to the issue 
of displaced and internally displaced persons, with special emphasis on the Roma living in 
the Konik camp. 
</p>
<p>22. Out of the total number (around 16,000) of displaced persons (DPs) and internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) in Montenegro, 9,<footnote name="5">7. Liechtenstein welcomed the Law on Protection from Domestic Violence, but noted 
concerns about high rates of domestic and sexual violence against women and girls, and 
poor prosecution rates for those crimes. Welcoming the national campaign on domestic 
violence against children, it noted with concern that corporal punishment of children 
remained both legal and common. Liechtenstein made recommendations. </footnote>00 people submitted applications for status 
resolution by the end of 2012, of which 5,<footnote name="6">2. The Netherlands welcomed the legislative framework providing protection against 
discrimination and the establishment of the Ombudsman office. Discrimination on the basis 
of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity persists throughout Montenegrin society, 
despite the improved legislative and administrative framework. It encouraged the 
Government to promote and defend the rights of the LGBT community and to prosecute the 
perpetrators of crimes against them. The Netherlands made recommendations.  
</footnote>39 applications, or 60 per cent, have been 
resolved. Montenegro&#8217;s national housing programme envisages securing the funds to 
resolve the  housing issue for 6,063 people. The time frame for implementation is 2016.  
</p>
<p>23. Montenegro has been implementing activities to efficiently combat human 
trafficking. The Government adopted the Strategy for the fight against trafficking for the 
period 2012-2018 and an accompanying action plan. The documents place emphasis on six 
main areas: prevention and education; victim assistance; protection and reintegration; 
coordination and partnership; international cooperation and identification of trafficking 
victims. 
</p>
<p>24. Family protection is a key priority; the Law on Protection from Domestic Violence 
was adopted in 2010 and a strategy was adopted in 2012. The law sets out five measures for 
the protection of victims of domestic violence, and the principle of urgency is envisaged for 
cases concerning protection from violence. The obligation to report violence has been 
introduced for the State authorities, other authorities, health, educational and other 
institutions. The Criminal Code incriminates criminal offences relating to marriage and 
family, including domestic violence and neglect and abuse of a juvenile.  
</p>
<p>25. The Law on Free Legal Aid was adopted in 2011 and provision of free legal aid 
services was launched in 15 basic courts.  
</p>
<p>26. Montenegro completed the anti-corruption legislative and institutional framework. 
The strategic anti-corruption documents are being successfully implemented and a new 
two-year action plan for the fight against corruption and organized crime is being drafted. 
The report is in the final stage of harmonization with UNODC. In December 2012, the 
Council of Europe&#8217;s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) noted that all five  of the 
recommendations concerning incrimination that it had issued to Montenegro had been met. 
</p>
<p>27. One area deserving particular attention in the context of human rights observance 
relates to the protection of rights of persons deprived of their liberty. The amended Law on 
Criminal Sanctions Enforcement of June 2011 established the Parole Section, a separate 
unit of the Ministry of Justice&#8217;s Criminal Sanction Enforcement Department. The growing 
trend towards alternative sanctioning and reducing the number of imprisonment sentences 
pronounced will lead to reduced numbers of people in custody. 
</p>
<p>28. An essential element of human rights and freedoms that is provided particular 
protection in Montenegro is the freedom of thought and expression, the right to information 
and freedom of the media. </p>


<p>29. The Criminal Code amendments of June 2011 decriminalized insult and defamation; 
just satisfaction in such cases is now sought in civil proceedings only. The Supreme Court 
set the guidelines for all courts, aligned with the case law of the European Court for Human 
Rights, and limits the amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damages in insult and 
defamation cases. 
</p>
<p>30. The 2010 Electronic Media Law is fully harmonized with the Directive on audio-
visual media services. The Agency for Electronic Media was set up under this law as an 
independent media regulator with full political, financial and institutional independence. 
</p>
<p>31. The Ministry of Culture proposed amendments to the Electronic Media Law in the 
first quarter of 2013 with the aim of releasing the Agency from the obligation to provide 
financial and operational reports to the Parliament. 
</p>
<p>32. Three self-regulatory bodies have been set up to reinforce the principles of self-
regulation, freedom and independence of the media. 
</p>
<p>33. Montenegro acceded to the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official 
Documents; as of 1 February 2013, the new Free Access to Information Law will be 
applied with a set of new provisions in place. 
</p>
<p>34. Religious matters and rights of religious communities in Montenegro are clearly 
covered in the Constitution which guarantees the right to freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion. The State guarantees equality among the religious communities; Montenegro 
has signed contracts with the Holy See, as well as with Islamic and Jewish communities. 
</p>
<p>35. The most valuable practice in Montenegro is the involvement of civil society in all 
activities advancing respect for human rights and EU membership talks.  
</p>
<p>36. With particular respect for the importance of preserving a healthy environment, the 
National Sustainable Development Strategy provides long-term guidance for economic and 
social development and environmental protection. Montenegro set up the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), an independent authority, in 2009. In cooperation with OSCE, 
on 15 April 2011, an Aarhus Centre was set up within the EPA to assist in the application 
of the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-
making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention). 
</p>
<p>37. The delegation thanked all the countries that contributed through their 
recommendations to further the development of human rights protection mechanisms in 
Montenegro. 
</p>
<p>38. Montenegro is fully cooperating with all mechanisms for human rights protection, in 
particular with special procedures. The error in the OHCHR compilation was pointed out 
and has been corrected. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>39. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>40. Chile drew attention to the significant progress made regarding legislation to protect 
and promote all human rights and fundamental freedoms. It noted the ratification of seven 
international conventions and the attendant action plans and strategies for their 
implementation. Progress achieved in the areas of gender equality and the fight against 
discrimination was highlighted. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. China commended the accession of Montenegro to various human rights 
instruments. Montenegro is committed to promoting gender equality and protecting the </p>


<p>rights of persons with disabilities. Montenegro had taken action to protect minority rights 
and combat discrimination, improve work on children&#8217;s education and health and has 
contributed to international cooperation in the field of trafficking in persons. China made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>42. Costa Rica welcomed efforts to guarantee the right to a healthy environment, 
including awareness-raising and citizen involvement. It acknowledged the institutional 
framework to monitor the protection and promotion of human rights and measures to 
increase women&#8217;s participation in the political sphere. It asked whether measures had been 
taken to avoid appointing women to fill electoral lists that left them with little possibility of 
being elected. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Croatia welcomed steps undertaken to implement the recommendations of the 2008 
UPR, especially those aimed at ensuring the rights of prisoners and protecting citizens from 
discrimination. Croatia requested further information on the measures taken to reduce the 
prison population and improve its conditions. It also requested additional information 
concerning the finalization of the Strategy for combating homophobia, the role of the civil 
society and the main principles on which the strategy was based. 
</p>
<p>44. Cuba welcomed progress in establishing a legislative and institutional framework for 
the exercise, protection and promotion of human rights and highlighted Montenegro&#8217;s 
efforts regarding the rights of persons with disabilities. It commended the action plan for 
persons with disabilities, with a particular focus on children, and the measures and strategy 
adopted to combat domestic violence. Cuba made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>45. Cyprus commended efforts to combat discrimination against vulnerable groups.  
Recalling efforts to better integrate persons with disabilities into political, social and 
economic life, it noted the establishment of the Council for the care of persons with 
disabilities. Reports indicated, however, that children with disabilities continued to face 
significant challenges, which raise the question of what measures are envisaged to improve 
their situation. 
</p>
<p>46. Estonia acknowledged the establishment of several bodies to monitor the protection 
of human rights and the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT) and 
CRPD. It encouraged the Government to continue its actions on gender equality and to 
implement the strategy and action plan for combating human trafficking. Legislation on 
freedom of expression has been harmonized with European standards, although more could 
be done to protect journalists and prosecute violence against them. Estonia made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>47. The United States of America recognized success in the areas of LGBT rights, 
torture prevention and housing for refugees in the Konik camp. Despite efforts to resolve 
the legal status of refugees, concerns remained about the thousands who are still not 
registered. The lack of political will and judicial independence to tackle corruption raised 
concerns. Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians (RAE) face widespread prejudice, often condoned 
by local authorities, and an action plan for their inclusion lack formal implementation. It 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>48. France welcomed the progress made by Montenegro in the field of human rights, 
noting in particular the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CPED) and the adoption of the Law on Gender 
Equality and the Law on the Prohibition of Discrimination. A number of challenges 
nonetheless remains. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Germany welcomed progress on the Roma inclusion in education, but was 
concerned that many Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians were not legally registered.  It requested </p>


<p>more information on activities to address the legal status, employment and social 
integration of those communities. It requested details of plans to promote and defend the 
rights of the LGBT community. Germany also sought information on plans to investigate 
and prosecute cases of violence against journalists. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Bulgaria took positive note of the development of the institutional system to protect 
and promote human rights, particularly the establishment of the Council for Persons with 
Disabilities and the Council on Children&#8217;s Rights, and the development of an action plan 
for children&#8217;s rights. It asked for further details of the steps taken to include children with 
developmental disabilities in the education system. Bulgaria made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>51. Guatemala welcomed the establishment of national institutions to protect the rights 
of children and persons with disabilities and combat discrimination, and the strategies and 
action plans to combat homophobia, prevent torture and provide foster care for children. It 
shared concerns about discrimination against minority children, refugee children and 
children with disabilities, particularly regarding access to education, health care and 
housing. Guatemala made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>52. The Holy See emphasized the diverse nature of Montenegrin society and the 
harmony found among its citizens. It welcomed progress in the field of human rights that 
led to the establishment of a stable legislative and institutional framework for the exercise, 
protection and promotion of human rights, and encouraged further efforts in that regard. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Hungary, while noting the legal guarantees for the political representation of 
minorities and the creation of the six minority councils, expressed concern about 
deficiencies in funding of those councils. Despite the efforts made, the situation of children 
with disabilities warranted further improvement. Hungary asked how the authorities 
intended to address allegations of serious human rights violations committed by police 
officers. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Indonesia welcomed the comprehensive efforts taken to promote and protect human 
rights. Indonesia noted the memorandum of understanding on gender equality signed by 14 
out of 21 municipalities and the central Government, and hoped that the remainder would 
follow suit. Indonesia welcomed legislation strengthening the role of the Ombudsman and 
encouraged the institution&#8217;s compliance with the Paris Principles. It also welcomed the 
</p>
<p>strategy for a permanent resolution to the problems of displaced persons. Indonesia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Italy noted that, despite progress with regard to the judicial system, further work was 
required to ensure full judicial independence. Barriers to social inclusion for Roma children 
persisted and further action was urged in that regard. It asked what measures were 
envisaged to accelerate the examination of legal cases on the restitution of assets that were 
nationalized by the former Yugoslavian government. Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Kyrgyzstan welcomed the development of a stable legislative and institutional 
human rights system and noted that improvements to the rule of law and respect for 
fundamental rights led to negotiations on EU membership. It drew attention to judicial 
reforms tackling independence and autonomy, efficiency, access to justice, combating 
crime &#8211; particularly corruption, terrorism and organized crime &#8211;, prison reform and the 
judicial information system. Kyrgyzstan made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>58. Lithuania commended the adoption of the Law on the Protector of Human Rights 
and Freedoms (Ombudsman) and the anti-discrimination law which tackles direct and 
indirect discrimination, as well as the strengthening the Ombudsman institution. However it 
noted that those laws had not been fully implemented and that the Ombudsman lacked 
capacity to genuinely address discrimination issues. Although welcoming amendments to 
the Criminal Code decriminalizing defamation, Lithuania expressed concern about attacks 
against journalists. Lithuania made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Malaysia particularly commended Montenegro&#8217;s ratification of CRPD and efforts to 
improve women&#8217;s participation in all areas of life, including in politics and the civil service. 
</p>
<p>Remaining challenges include the lack of capacity affecting the full enjoyment of rights by 
minority groups, including Muslims, and poor access to public buildings for persons with 
disabilities. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Mexico noted actions to protect and promote human rights, particularly the standing 
invitation issued to special procedures mandate holders and the ratification of most of the 
regional and international human rights instruments, which require speedy implementation. 
It highlighted the amended Labour Law guaranteeing women&#8217;s labour rights and legislative 
amendments improving conditions for persons with disabilities. Mexico made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Morocco noted the ratification of most of the international human rights instruments 
and welcomed the judicial reform and its action plan. Having received numerous refugees 
and displaced persons, Montenegro has established various bodies to protect their rights and 
cultures. Noting that material obstacles continue to hinder access to education for Roma 
children and children with disabilities, it asked how Montenegro intended to tackle the 
problem. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>

<p>66. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia commended the ratification of core 
human rights treaties and the establishment of a legislative and institutional human rights 
framework. Noting the adoption of a law and strategy against domestic violence, it 
requested details on the legal framework to combat violence against women and the effects 
of the legislation adopted. More information was requested on the institutional protection of 
minority rights. 
</p>
<p>67. The Republic of Moldova applauded efforts by Montenegro to strengthen its human 
rights protection system. At the same time, it emphasized the importance of effective 
translation of the human rights standards into practice. It welcomed the development of 
policies, programmes and strategies to combat human trafficking and prevent and eliminate 
domestic violence against women and children. The Republic of Moldova made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Slovakia commended Montenegro on its ratification of core international human 
rights instruments, notably its signing of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on a communications procedure (OP-CRC-IC). It noted that 
Montenegro, as a multi-ethnic and multicultural State, promoted intercultural dialogue and 
cooperation among ethnic and religious groups in the wider region. Slovakia made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>69. Slovenia welcomed the adoption of legislation and specific measures to address 
discrimination in general, but especially discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation 
and gender identity, and legislation to prohibit the publication of information and opinions 
aimed at inciting discrimination. It also welcomed the adoption of legislation on protection 
from domestic violence. Slovenia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>70. Responding to comments made, the Montenegro delegation referred to significant 
steps taken to address the high level of homophobia in Montenegro. In December 2011, the 
Government set up three working groups (with equal numbers of representatives from 
ministries and NGOs), with the aim of creating the conditions for LGBT persons to obtain 
equal status in the community.  
</p>
<p>71. The new law strengthening the competences of the Protector of Human Rights and 
Freedoms (Ombudsman) was highlighted. It was set up as the national mechanism for the 
protection of persons deprived of liberty against torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment. The Parliament of Montenegro appointed a Deputy 
Ombudsman for the prevention of torture and the protection of persons deprived of liberty. 
</p>
<p>72. Montenegro has adopted a series of strategic documents on anti-corruption: the 
Strategy for the fight against corruption and organized crime and the Strategy for the 
reform of judiciary 2010, including the action plan. The creation of a Commission 
composed of high-ranking members of the executive, judiciary, Parliament, political parties 
and NGOs to coordinate and monitor anti-corruption policy was an important step forward. 
Montenegro has also established specialized anti-corruption governmental departments; 
undergone GRECO evaluations concerning the State&#8217;s corruption practices conducted 
public campaigns to enhance awareness of corruption; implemented judicial training for 
judges and prosecutors dealing with corruption and instigated disciplinary procedures 
against a number of officers regarding corruption and organized crime. Montenegro intends 
to implement activities related to improving anti-corruption legislation; strengthen 
cooperation between bodies dealing with combating corruption and conflict of interest; 
develop integrity plans and campaigns to promoting reporting of corruption and protection 
for citizens who report it.  
</p>
<p>73. Reference was made to the judicial reform being undertaken in cooperation with the 
courts, prosecution and the bar and all stakeholders. Parliamentary committees are working </p>


<p>on amendments to comply with the recommendations of the Council of Europe&#8217;s Venice 
Commission on strengthening the accountability of judicial office holders. 
</p>
<p>74. Montenegro has invested huge efforts into improving legislation and implementing 
policies for persons with disabilities, including through developing support services at the 
local level, such as centres for children with developmental difficulties; personal assistance; 
home support for children with highest degree of disability; teaching assistants; appropriate 
transport for such children; inclusive education and specialized health care. External 
monitoring of institutions is carried out by independent civil society organizations and the 
Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>75. Concerning attacks, threats or violent behaviour against journalists, according to the 
most recent data, prepared just before this session, all but three cases have been resolved. 
As a result, 13 persons have been indicted and adjudication has been achieved in 10 cases, 
with imprisonment sentences in all but one case.  
</p>
<p>76. Responding to questions concerning overcrowding in the penitentiary system, the 
Montenegro delegation explained that the criminal sanction enforcement system has greatly 
improved over the last two years, with the support of the European Union and a project to 
support the reform of the penitentiary system in partnership with Germany and the 
Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>77. Montenegro is strongly committed to resolving the status of DPs and IDPs and to 
improving their situation. Project proposals have been submitted to build 42 housing blocks 
in two towns. Following the fire in the Konik camp, a medium-term accommodation 
solution was sought through the provision of containers.

to guarantee the enjoyment, protection and promotion of human rights, but was concerned

ratification of core international human rights conventions and the establishment of national

Montenegro to provide training for relevant staff in identifying signs of ill-treatment. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>104. The Montenegro delegation referred to action taken to combat human trafficking, 
with the strategy paper adopted by the Government, which focuses on prevention, criminal 
prosecution, protection of victims and identification of potential victims. Public awareness-
raising is a priority, as well as building professional capacities through training and regional 
cooperation to address the problem. 
</p>
<p>105. The delegation referred to various measures taken to substantially increase the 
integration of children with special needs in regular schools. The activities of special 
departments in regular schools have been reinforced. Former specialized institutions are 
being used as resource centres to support the regular system. Such efforts have been 
accompanied by a comprehensive public awareness-raising campaign undertaken in 
cooperation with UNICEF. 
</p>
<p>106. Measures to ensure the effective implementation of the anti-corruption laws were 
highlighted, including the setting up of separate departments within courts, prosecution 
offices and police departments for the handling of corruption cases. 
</p>
<p>107. Responding to the question about war crimes, the delegation clarified that of the six 
war crimes cases concerning Montenegro, three had ended in final judgements, one is at the 
appellate procedure and two cases are still pending. Services have been set up to offer 
assistance to victims of war crimes and a guide on the rights of victims of war crimes has 
been published. 
</p>
<p>108. Montenegro is facing the problem of judicial backlog. The Law on the Protection of 
the Right to Trial Within a Reasonable Time has been adopted, which provides a means of 
redress for the exercise of this right. A plan has been adopted with specific measures for the 
reassignment of judges with a lesser workload, the redistribution of cases from 
overburdened courts and the introduction of overtime. The new Criminal Procedure Code, 
implemented 1 September 2011, introduced prosecutor-led investigations and plea  </p>
<p>bargaining measures. </p>


<p>109. Responding to concerns raised about statelessness, the delegation said that the 
regional working group had concluded, through the Sarajevo process, that there was no risk 
of statelessness because the former Yugoslavia had one of the best systems of registration. 
All persons residing in Montenegro and coming from the former Yugoslavia without 
citizenship can be subsequently registered in the citizen registry based on their parents&#8217; 
place of birth or on some other grounds. Montenegro signed an agreement with Kosovo1 in 
2011, concerning subsequent registration in citizen registries. As a result, in 2012 there 
were a dozen collective visits to Kosovo with more than 500 IDPs, primarily RAE, in order 
to be registered so as to obtain adequate documentation. With regard to the issue of children 
born outside of health institutions, the Ministry of Interior is handling the procedure for 
determining the facts for the registration of such children. 
</p>
<p>110. With regard to the integration of RAE population, progress was evident in the areas 
of education, health and employment. There is a need for further social integration and 
Montenegro has adopted a strategy for improving the position of the RAE population for 
the period 2012-2016, with accompanying annual action plans. The areas of concern 
identified were housing, health, education, employment, social and child care. Another area 
incorporated in this strategy is violence against women and the issue of early and forced 
marriages. Representatives of Government institutions and NGOs have allocated 470,000 
Euros for the purposes of integration. 
</p>
<p>111. Montenegro adopted the new action plan for the achievement of gender equality for 
the period 2013-2017 with NGO endorsement. Activities include the promotion of women 
in politics, curbing violence against women, women&#8217;s health and the advancement of 
women&#8217;s rights. Implementation of the plan will be monitored by a Commission composed 
of representatives of State institutions and NGOs. 
</p>
<p>112. Media outlets established three independent self-regulatory bodies in 2012: the 
Media Self-regulation Council, the Press Council and the Self-regulation Council for Local 
Press and Periodicals, in line with European practice for monitoring professional and 
ethical standards. 
</p>
<p>113. The Prime Minister, together with UNICEF, led the &#8220;It&#8217;s about abilities&#8221; campaign 
which highly resonated with the public and contributed to better public awareness about 
education of children with disabilities. Montenegro participated in the Paralympics for the 
first time in 2012 and this received considerable media attention. Montenegro is planning to 
include data on persons with disabilities in the upcoming census, in line with United 
Nations recommendations relating to improved data on persons with disabilities. Significant 
steps are being taken to intensify measures for the employment of youth with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>114. The institution of the Ombudsman has been reinforced by new preventive authority. 
New experts have been hired and, in the context of the global economic crisis, Montenegro 
did not cut the 2012 budget for the Ombudsman. Montenegro also plans to seek the expert 
assistance offered by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>115. On the issue of corruption, the delegation stated that Montenegro does not 
distinguish between high- and low-level corruption. The aim of Montenegro&#8217;s policy is zero 
tolerance towards corruption. With the opening of chapters 23 and 24 in the negotiations 
with the European Union, Montenegro received an impetus and capacities for better 
managing this issue. All the activities of its administration serve to further progress in the 
area of fighting corruption and organized crime. Regarding the criminal offences of persons 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>(1999)  </p>


<p>with economic and political power, they are already under the scrutiny of the police and 
prosecution that deal with these issues. 
</p>
<p>116. Montenegro was recognized as a model for guaranteeing minority rights. It will 
continue to strengthen institutions for respecting human and minority rights and full 
observance of freedoms for all its citizens.
