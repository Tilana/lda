<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background  
</b></p>
<p>1. The United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of 
Human Rights, established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1987/83, 
receives voluntary contributions from Governments, organizations and individuals. The 
objective of the Fund is to provide financial support for international cooperation aimed at 
building up and strengthening national and regional institutions and infrastructures that will 
have long-term impact on improved implementation of international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>2. The Board of Trustees has been operational since 1993 and its members are 
appointed by the Secretary-General for a three-year renewable term. The mandate of the 
Board is to assist the Secretary-General in streamlining and rationalizing the working 
methods and procedures of the technical cooperation programme. It meets twice a year and 
reports on its work to the Secretary-General and the Human Rights Council. Current 
members are Sozar Subari (Georgia), Fatima Mbaye (Mauritania), Mariclaire Acosta 
Urquidi (Mexico), Christopher Sidoti (Australia) and Deepika Udagama (Sri Lanka). Ms. 
Acosta was appointed to the Board in June 2012, replacing Cecilia Medina. Ms. Udagama 
was chairperson of the Board from April 2012 until April 2013. The Board elected Mr. 
Sidoti to succeed her as chairperson from April 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate  
</b></p>
<p>3. In 2004, the Board of Trustees refocused its attention from more detailed review of 
individual projects to advising the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) on policy orientation and strategy in strengthening its technical 
cooperation programme in the field of human rights. Since then, instead of focusing on 
smaller projects, the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation has funded the work of 
OHCHR field presences given that many of those activities fall within the area of technical 
cooperation. This broader definition of technical cooperation, agreed by the Board of 
Trustees, was presented to Member States and reported in the annual report of the 
Secretary-General submitted to the Human Rights Council.1  
</p>
<p>4. The Board has been advised that the above-mentioned approach is highly 
appreciated by the High Commissioner in that it increases the flexibility of OHCHR when 
responding to requests by States for field services. It furthers the inclusion of technical 
cooperation as an integral part of the OHCHR strategic planning process. The Board has 
been determined to ensure that the High Commissioner has access to the experience, 
expertise and wisdom of the Board members and so it has expanded the opportunities for 
the Board as a whole and Board members individually to offer strategic and other advice to 
OHCHR at the global and regional levels that could support the technical cooperation 
provided by its 57 field presences, including stand-alone presences, such as the country 
offices and regional offices, or through collaborative arrangements, such as the assistance 
of human rights advisers for United Nations country teams or human rights components of 
United Nations peacekeeping missions. The recent practice of the Board Members of 
undertaking visits to OHCHR field presences to learn from their experience on the ground 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/16/66. </p>


<p>and of participating in OHCHR strategic planning meetings, both regionally and globally, is 
a form of additional support in this area.  
</p>
<p>5. The present report covers the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh sessions of the Board. 
At those sessions, the Board built on its previous experience, and continued to explore 
various components of the Human Rights Programme on Technical Cooperation, funded by 
the Voluntary Fund, with a view to providing policy guidance and advice on the technical 
cooperation activities carried out by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities and results of the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights and the Board of 
Trustees 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Thirty-sixth session 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field 
of Human Rights held its thirty-sixth session in Geneva, from 23 to 26 April 2012. The 
session was chaired by Ms. Udagama, who was elected Chairperson of the Board of 
Trustees at that session. The other members of the Board (Mr. Sobari, Ms. Mbaye and Mr. 
Sidoti) attended the session. Owing to conflicting schedules, Ms. Medina was not able to 
participate in the session. 
</p>
<p>7. The objective of the session was to benefit from a country/region-specific overview 
of the 2012-2013 Management Plan of OHCHR and thematic strategies, and to meet with 
relevant OHCHR divisions and to provide policy guidance and advice on technical 
cooperation activities carried out by the Office. 
</p>
<p>8. The Board was updated on follow-up activities of the universal periodic review 
mechanism and the use of the Universal Periodic Review Voluntary Fund for Financial and 
Technical Assistance. In this regard, the Board received a status report on the involvement 
of field presences in the universal periodic review and follow-up actions undertaken to 
support the implementation of recommendations by Member States.  
</p>
<p>9. The Board members expressed their appreciation for the engagement of field 
presences in their support for follow-up activities on universal periodic review 
recommendations. The Board also expressed its willingness, should such a request be made, 
to assume the functions of the Board of Trustees for the Universal Periodic Review 
Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance. 
</p>
<p>10. The Board was also updated on the 2012-2013 Management Plan, in particular with 
regard to thematic priorities and the streamlining of the planning process, as well as the 
OHCHR performance monitoring system. In this context, the Board received a brief 
overview on the use of the online performance monitoring system, which was designed to 
monitor and report on results for the biennium. As at 18 March 2012, 33<b> </b>OHCHR field 
presences had been trained on the use of the system, the new feature of which is the 
possibility of including financial monitoring. The system makes an important contribution 
to the commitment of OHCHR to becoming a fully results-based organization, transparent 
and accountable to all stakeholders. Board members assessed the system very favourably 
and requested that they be granted access to the online system.  
</p>
<p>11. The Board was updated on the human rights mainstreaming mechanism of the 
United Nations Development Group, which was established in November 2009. The 
mainstreaming mechanism comprises 19 United Nations agencies, funds and programmes. 
It is chaired by OHCHR, with a rotating vice-chairpersonship, and reports to the United </p>


<p>Nations Development Group. The mechanism aims at responding directly to the increasing 
demand from Member States for more technical support on human rights mainstreaming 
and applying rights-based approaches to national development strategies. It also seeks to 
strengthen coordinated United Nations responses to requests from Member States for 
support in their efforts to meet their international human rights commitments. In October 
2011, OHCHR and its partners launched the United Nations Development Group human 
rights mainstreaming mechanism Multi-donor Trust Fund, to strengthen the capacity of 
United Nations country teams in supporting the development of human rights capacities at 
the country level. A joint strategy to deploy human rights advisers to the offices of Resident 
Coordinators and United Nations country teams was launched in January 2012 to 
operationalize that process, which also expands opportunities for technical assistance in the 
field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>12. The Board expressed its appreciation for the development of the joint strategy and 
the launching of the Multi-donor Trust Fund, which is expected to facilitate responses to the 
increasing requests that OHCHR receives from Resident Coordinators for the deployment 
of human rights advisers in their respective country teams. During the preparation of the 
present report, the Board was informed that the Trust Fund would, in 2013, be able to cover 
10 new deployments out of the 20 anticipated in the above-mentioned joint strategy owing 
to the limited contributions received. While the Board hopes that human rights 
mainstreaming mechanism will become a source of funding for a significant number of 
human rights advisers, it will cover only new deployments. The Board is also unsure 
whether the available funds will cover all needs and requests, and therefore considers that 
support for existing human rights advisers from the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
Cooperation remains crucial.  
</p>
<p>13. The Board was updated on the field presences in all regions and the implementation 
of activities funded by the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the framework of 
the OHCHR Management Plan, the successes achieved and the partnerships on the ground 
with civil society, Governments, United Nations partners and United Nations country 
teams. The Board was also informed of the strategies being developed to address ongoing 
challenges in the regions of Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, 
North America and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean region. 
</p>
<p>14. The Board was briefed on the situation of the human rights components of United 
Nations peacekeeping missions in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone, 
Somalia, the Sudan and South Sudan. It also received briefings on the situation of human 
rights advisers in Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, the Niger, Rwanda and the Great Lakes 
Region, and on the situation of country offices in Guinea, Togo and Uganda.  
</p>
<p>15. In the Africa region, the main areas of focus for technical assistance include 
elections and political transition, conflict situations, and the rule of law and impunity. The 
Board acknowledged the challenges faced in all these different countries and welcomed the 
achievements made in the field.  
</p>
<p>16. The Board received an overview of the human rights work of field presences in the 
Middle East and North Africa region, which are faced with a great number of requests for 
technical cooperation activities. A major challenge in the region is the establishment of 
institutions in the context of continuing political and social transformation.  
</p>
<p>17. The Board was briefed on the situation of the country office in Mauritania, the office 
in Tunisia and the special situation of the stand-alone office in Palestine. The Board 
welcomed the efforts made in this region despite the challenges and difficulties faced.  
</p>
<p>18. The Board was briefed on the situation of human rights components of United 
Nations peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Timor-Leste, and on the situation of 
human rights advisers in Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka. The Board was also informed </p>


<p>that the Nepal office and the human rights component in Timor-Leste had closed. To 
support further the countries in the region in the area of human rights, the Board 
recommended considering strengthening the capacity of the OHCHR Regional Office in 
Bangkok. 
</p>
<p>19. The Board noted the recent developments in the field presences in the Europe and 
Central Asia region, as well as the challenges, including political, human, financial and 
administrative constraints, in the implementation of priorities in the region. The Board was 
also updated on the activities of the stand-alone office in Kosovo, the situation of human 
rights advisers in South Caucasus (Georgia), the Republic of Moldova, the Russian 
Federation and Ukraine, and the important work done in the region with regard to thematic 
issues.  
</p>
<p>20. The Board was briefed on the situation of the human rights component of the United 
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the situation of human rights advisers in Ecuador, 
Nicaragua and Paraguay, and the situation of country offices in Bolivia (Plurinational State 
of) and Mexico. The Board acknowledged the challenges faced in all these different 
countries and welcomed the achievements made in the field.  
</p>
<p>21. The Board received an overview of OHCHR work relating to humanitarian crisis, 
rapid response and United Nations peace support missions, as well as the role of the Office 
and challenges faced with regard to providing support to different commissions of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>22. The Board was updated on issues relating to national human rights institutions , 
including the legal and technical assistance provided to them and the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights 
Institutions, as well as regional trends and mechanisms. The Board noted the importance of 
ensuring the true independence of national human rights institutions in full compliance with 
the Paris Principles, and the strategic value of developing and investing in such institutions 
as part of United Nations efforts to strengthen national human rights protection systems. It 
welcomed the support of OHCHR for the establishment and strengthening on national 
human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles, and encouraged OHCHR 
to extend that support. 
</p>
<p>23. The Board recognized and emphasized the strategic importance of the cooperation 
between OHCHR and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at the country 
level by all types of United Nations human rights field presences, and stressed the value of 
partnerships with regional human rights mechanisms. The Board welcomed and was 
encouraged by the strategic value and partnerships with national human rights institutions 
and by continuing efforts to strengthen the collaborative efforts between those institutions 
and UNDP in advancing the mandate of OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>24. The Board received presentations from the Human Rights Council and Special 
Procedures Division of OHCHR on the latest developments with regard to the end of the 
first cycle of the universal periodic review, its process and achievements, the new 
modalities adopted by the Council for the second cycle, and the follow-up to universal 
periodic review recommendations.  
</p>
<p>25. The Board also met with the High Commissioner and briefed her on its findings, in 
particular with regard to the Board&#8217;s concern to ensure funding for the most important of 
</p>
<p>the many new requests for human rights advisers that the Office was receiving. The Board 
also recommended exploring the possibility of having strong regional offices as part of the 
Office&#8217;s strategic plan to engage with countries.  </p>


<p><b> B.  Thirty-seventh session 
</b></p>
<p>26. The thirty-seventh session of the Board of Trustees was held in Nouakchott on 28 
and 29 January 2013, and in Tunis from 30 January to 2 February 2013. This was the 
second time that a session of the Board was organized outside Geneva. The two field 
missions provided the Board with an opportunity to obtain a direct and personal view of the 
actual needs of the country offices in North Africa. In Mauritania, the Board was able to 
gather first-hand insight into the use of the Voluntary Fund with regard to achievements, 
thematic priorities, constraints and challenges. In Tunis, while the country office does not 
yet receive funds from the Fund, the Board observed in situ the challenges and 
opportunities in the area of technical cooperation that the opening of a new country office 
presented.  
</p>
<p>27. The Board discussed technical cooperation activities by the OHCHR presence in 
Mauritania during meetings with different national authorities, United Nations partners, 
diplomatic missions and civil society organizations in the country. This included visits to 
selected projects where the Board received briefings on the specific situations of human 
rights to be addressed by the technical advice and services provided by OHCHR. In 
Tunisia, the Board observed in particular the importance for a new office to be rapidly 
established in the political environment and context, and to develop a flexible programme 
that is able to adjust to the changing environment and needs while keeping its main focus 
on protection and promotion.  
</p>
<p>28. During the field visits, the Board discussed support provided to various justice and 
accountability programmes and mechanisms in Mauritania and on transitional justice in 
Tunisia. The OHCHR technical cooperation programme was found to be particularly 
relevant in the two countries, particularly in the light of the politically complex situation in 
both of them. In Mauritania, efforts and support to address accountability for the <i>passif 
humanitaire</i>2 and to ensure the total eradication of slavery in the country were the focus of 
attention during discussions with all stakeholders. In Tunisia, the Board was particularly 
well informed of the support of OHCHR in the areas of constitutional development, the 
administration of justice and law enforcement transformation. With regard to justice and 
accountability, the Board stressed that the challenge in Mauritania was still to ensure that 
technical assistance supports current efforts to address remaining tensions and inequalities 
between communities. In Tunisia, OHCHR is making critical efforts to support transitional 
justice, institutional capacity-building for the administration of justice in full compliance 
with international human rights standards, and the promotion of joint United Nations efforts 
to achieve a human rights focus in the current Constitution-building exercise. With regard 
to law enforcement institution-building, the Board was of the view that training efforts 
should be constantly reassessed to ensure that the right issues were being addressed 
effectively with a methodology that provides the expertise, practicality and continuity 
required.  
</p>
<p>29. The Board was also briefed on the various thematic priorities addressed by field 
presences in the countries visited, including thematic strategies relating to discrimination; 
combating impunity and strengthening the rule of law; the promotion and protection of 
economic, social and cultural rights; the promotion of democracy and good governance; 
and the strengthening of cooperation with international and regional human rights 
mechanisms and national human rights institutions. The Board found that OHCHR would 
benefit from strengthening efforts to translate the OHCHR gender and women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Term used to refer to human rights violations committed in Mauritania between 1988 and 1992. </p>


<p>strategy into specific actions across all the thematic priorities in both countries, and in 
particular throughout the programme in Tunisia.  
</p>
<p>30. The Board is of the view that field visits are fruitful for its work and mandate , and 
proposes that similar sessions be held with field presences in others countries on an annual 
basis. In-country discussions are particularly helpful in identifying in concrete terms the 
priority areas for further technical cooperation work, challenges and best practices by the 
Office.  
</p>
<p>31. The Board took the opportunity of its last day in Tunis to hold an internal meeting to 
continue discussions on its future programme. During the meeting, Mr. Sidoti was elected 
as the new chairperson of the Board, to succeed Ms. Udagama at the end of her term in 
April 2013. The members of the Board thanked Ms. Udagama for having provided a 
renewed focus for the work of the Board, centred on an increasingly advisory role for 
OHCHR. The members also took the opportunity to welcome the new member of the 
Board, Mariclaire Acosta (Mexico), to replace former member Cecilia Medina.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Technical cooperation: main findings, challenges identified 
and recommendations   
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Human Rights Council, international treaty bodies and special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures  
</b></p>
<p>32. The Board followed closely the developments in context of the follow-up to the 
universal periodic review, in particular in the context of the policy adopted by the Office in 
2010 supporting the holistic implementation by Member States of the recommendations 
made by all United Nations human rights mechanisms: the treaty bodies, the special 
procedures and the universal periodic review. he policy reflects the Office&#8217;s thematic 
strategy, in the framework of the OHCHR Management Plan 2012-2013, to strengthen 
international human rights mechanisms and the progressive development of international 
human rights law.  
</p>
<p>33. The Board expressed its appreciation for the draft guidelines to assist in the review 
by OHCHR of requests for technical assistance and/or funding under the Universal Periodic 
Review Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, and noted that the 
guidelines were based on the Office&#8217;s mandate, in particular its overall approach to and 
policy on technical cooperation, its priorities at the global, regional and country levels, and 
the holistic approach of the Office to the work of all human rights mechanisms; its effort to 
turn itself into a results-based institution; and its concern to optimize the use of its limited 
resources. The guidelines aimed at ensuring that the resources entrusted to the Office 
through the Voluntary Fund are managed in a meaningful, efficient, transparent and 
accountable manner, and contribute to an effective improvement in the exercise and 
enjoyment of their human rights by people, the main goal of the Human Rights Council and 
its universal periodic review mechanism.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Measuring results in technical cooperation and the response of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office of the High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Board commends OHCHR for its efforts during the period under review to fully 
implement its performance monitoring system. The Board had the possibility to test its 
usefulness at the field level during its recent visits to Mauritania and Tunisia.  </p>


<p>35. The performance monitoring system, which to date has been implemented in 33 field 
presences and at Headquarters, is proving to be a critical tool not only for transparency and 
accountability but also in helping OHCHR to gain ready access to a wide range of 
information, allowing for a clearer and better formulation of results. The Board is of the 
view that the system, which interlinks the planning, monitoring and the production of 
reports, greatly facilitates the definition and selection of the Office&#8217;s results, as well as their 
measurement. In the field, the system facilitates monitoring of the implementation and 
performance of technical cooperation projects, adjusting, if required in real time, to 
changing environments and the challenges faced. It also facilitates the sharing of 
experiences and lessons learned, particularly relevant in the area of technical cooperation.  
</p>
<p>36. The Board strongly recommends that OHCHR and its field presences continue to 
ensure the wide use of the system, investing in particular in strengthening its financial 
component. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Interim OHCHR field manual on technical cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>37. The Board was consulted on a preliminary draft of the interim OHCHR field 
reference manual on technical cooperation, which aims at providing guidance to its field 
presences and staff on the approach of OHCHR to technical cooperation. The interim 
manual was designed to bring together, in one single document, OHCHR policies, practices 
and procedures relating to technical cooperation, and is being developed in the light of 
recent trends, such as a holistic approach to follow up on recommendations made by 
international human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>38. As one of the vehicles of OHCHR to fulfil the mandate of the High Commissioner, 
technical cooperation is an effective means for overcoming in-country knowledge and 
capacity gaps, and supporting efforts made by the country to address those gaps. The 
demands on OHCHR for technical cooperation have increased steadily in this area during 
the past 10 years, and field presences, either as OHCHR offices or as joint endeavours with 
other United Nations entities, through partnerships at the national and regional levels, play 
a crucial role. The interim manual situates technical cooperation as an integral part of the 
OHCHR programme as defined in the OHCHR programme tools.  
</p>
<p>39. The interim manual provides useful links and suggestions, as well as practical 
examples, while ensuring technical cooperation as an inclusive exercise that engages and 
involves all national stakeholders, including government agencies and civil society in all 
stages of the process. It also includes references to useful existing OHCHR tools, such as 
the Universal Human Rights Index, as it can align recommendations made by treaty bodies, 
the special procedures and during sessions of the universal periodic review, and cluster 
them by thematic issues and groups of persons affected, thus forming a solid basis for the 
design of technical cooperation projects.  
</p>
<p>40. The Board welcomes this effort, which provides guidance for OHCHR staff 
involved in technical cooperation work and in the management of technical cooperation 
projects. It encourages OHCHR to complete the interim manual as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Synergy with other United Nations entities  
</b></p>
<p>41. During its field visits to Mauritania and to Tunisia, the Board had the opportunity to 
meet OHCHR partners within the United Nations system. Particularly relevant in the area 
of technical cooperation was the joint strategic planning at the country level through the 
process of preparation of United Nations country analysis and strategic programme 
frameworks.  </p>


<p>42. For example, in the context of the ongoing work by the United Nations country team 
in Tunisia in preparation for the common country assessment, the Board was informed by 
the Resident Coordinator that a human rights-based approach and a results-based approach 
were being fully applied, taking into account, for example, the recommendations made by 
relevant human rights bodies, a number of which have undertaken visits in the past year to 
the country. OHCHR plays an important role in supporting the United Nations country 
team in this endeavour. This has led to, inter alia, the set-up of joint project documents with 
UNDP on security sector reform and justice reform. Similar efforts have been made in 
Mauritania, with a specific focus on recommendations on relevant topics that have been the 
subject of study by a number of special procedures. In both cases, the universal periodic 
review seems to provide a renewed framework for United Nations entities to apply an 
increasingly proactive role in translating the intentions of a human rights-based approach 
into practical actions. Furthermore, one expanding area of work is the integration of human 
rights into national development plans, where a number of human rights advisers are 
playing a pivotal role, for example in Ecuador, in particular with regard to the 
operationalization of the application of a human rights-based approach to programmes and 
budgets.  
</p>
<p>43. In the above context, the efforts made by OHCHR at the global level to ensure 
access to clustered and prioritized recommendations through the Universal Human Rights 
Index, which includes all recommendations and concluding observations made by relevant 
human rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic, are critical in providing key 
elements for the preparation of United Nations country analysis and strategic programme 
frameworks describing the collective response of the United Nations system to national 
development priorities. 
</p>
<p>44. Many of the above-mentioned recommendations could lead to requests for technical 
cooperation. In a number of cases, OHCHR might be the best placed to provide support; in 
many others, in the case of cross-cutting themes and complex issues, they might require 
joint support from the entire United Nations country team or a number of United Nations 
entities. This represents certainly an important opportunity to strengthen the human rights 
focus of the technical cooperation programmes not only of OHCHR but also of the entire 
United Nations system.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Status of funding and donors 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Board was updated at its meeting in January and February 2013 on the overall 
financial status of OHCHR and its donors, the 2012 financial situation of the Voluntary 
Fund for Technical Cooperation and its functioning in the overall funding system, including 
interlinkages with other extrabudgetary resources. The Board was informed that 
expenditures under the Voluntary Fund had been constantly increasing in recent years; the 
increases had not, however, been matched by financial contributions. This situation raised 
concern about the future of technical cooperation activities funded by the Voluntary Fund.  
</p>
<p>46. The Board underlined the importance of ensuring continuous contributions to the 
Fund. It expressed its support for the strategy of increasing the size of the donor base, 
including enlarging the number of contributing Member States. The Board considers that an 
increase in unearmarked funds will allow OHCHR to be more flexible in implementing 
identified priorities. Detailed information on income and expenditure under the Voluntary 
Fund is annexed to the present report. </p>
