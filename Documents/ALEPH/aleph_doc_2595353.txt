Operational
•
•
•
In the second quarter, the Company produced 4,681,608 silver equivalents ounces, a decrease
of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in production was primarily attributed
to an 8% decrease in average silver grades due to lower grades at the La Encantada and Santa
Elena mines.
 
Cash cost per ounce in the quarter was $6.41, an increase of 28% or $1.41 per ounce compared
to the previous  quarter.  The  increase in cash cost per ounce was primarily the result of lower
silver grades at the La Encantada and Santa Elena mines, as well as lower lead grades at the La
Parrilla mine during the quarter. Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, cash cost per
ounce decreased by 27% or $2.33 per ounce. The improvement was a result of the acquisition of
the  Santa  Elena  mine  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  as  well  as  ongoing  company-wide  cost
reduction efforts and a focus on producing profitable ounces.
 
All-in sustaining cost per ounce (“AISC”) in the second quarter was $10.97, an increase of 22%
or $2.00 per ounce compared to the previous quarter but is well below the annual guidance of
$12.29 to $13.36 per ounce. The increase in AISC was primarily attributed to increases in cash
cost per ounce and general and administrative expenses incurred in the second quarter.

Generated  revenues  of  $66.1  million  in  the  quarter,  an increase  of  22%  or  $11.9  million
compared  to  the  second  quarter  of  2015 primarily  due  to  22%  increase  in  silver  equivalent
ounces sold as a result of production from the Santa Elena mine, which was acquired in October
2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, even though the average realized silver price
was $1.03 per ounce lower than in the previous year, revenue increased by 22% as a result of a
29% increase in silver equivalent ounces sold.
The Company recognized mine operating earnings of $9.9 million compared to mine operating
earnings of $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in mine operating earnings
was primarily driven by an increase in production levels and a decrease in production costs.
Earnings  before  income  taxes  were  $9.2  million  in  the second quarter, compared to a loss of
$4.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in mine operating
earnings and  a  $4.6  million  unrealized  gain  on  the  Company’s  investment  in marketable
securities.
Cash flow from operations before movements in working capital and income taxes in the quarter
was $23.5 million ($0.15 per share) compared to $16.4 million ($0.14 per share) in the second
quarter of 2015.
The Company generated net earnings of $6.1 million (earnings per share of $0.04) compared to
a net loss of $2.6 million (loss per share of $0.02) in the second quarter of 2015.
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  increased  from  $61.7  million  to $108.2  million  during  the  second
quarter, while working capital improved from $57.8 million to $119.1 million.

On May 12, 2016, the Company closed a CAD$57.5 million bought-deal private placement with
a  syndicate  of  underwriters  for  the issuance  of  5,250,900  common  shares  at  a  price  of
CAD$10.95 per common share.
 
On  July  12,  2016,  the  Company  entered  into  a  debt settlement  agreement  with  First  Mining
Finance  Corp.  (“First  Mining”)  to settle  $1.2  million  in  loan  receivables.  Pursuant  to  the
agreement,  First Mining  will  settle  $0.5  million  of  the  debt  through  issuance  of  820,440  of its
common  shares  at  a  deemed  price  of  CAD$0.80  per  share.  The  remaining balance  of  $0.7
million will be paid in cash in twelve equal monthly cash payments.

2016 PRODUCTION OUTLOOK AND COST GUIDANCE UPDATE
This section provides management’s production outlook and cost guidance for the remainder
of 2016. These are forward-looking estimates and are subject to the cautionary note regarding
the  risks  associated  with  relying  on  forward-looking  statements  at  the  end  of  this  MD&A.
Actual results may vary based on production throughputs, grades, recoveries and changes in
economic circumstances.
The Company is updating its 2016 annual silver production estimate to be in the range of 10.7 million
to  11.9  million  ounces,  or  16.8  million  to  18.7  million  silver  equivalent  ounces,  compared  to  the
previous guidance of 12.0 million to 13.3 million ounces of silver, or 17.8 million to 19.8 million silver
equivalent ounces. The 11% decrease in silver production is primarily due to lower throughput rates at
Del Toro and La Guitarra compared to prior estimates. Silver equivalent ounces were also revised to
reflect  the  effect  of  an  increase  in  silver  price  on  equivalent  ounces  from  other  by-product  metals.
Annual cash cost is now expected to be within the range of $5.40 to $6.00 per payable silver ounce, a
23% reduction compared to the previous guidance of $7.11 to $7.60 per ounce. AISC is also expected
to decrease to $11.50 to $12.35 per payable silver ounce, a 7% reduction compared to the original
guidance of $12.29 to $13.36 per ounce.

(1) Metal price assumptions for calculation of silver equivalent ounces are based on: silver $20.00/oz; gold $1,350/oz; lead $0.80/lb; and zinc $1.00/lb.
(2) Consolidated AISC includes general and administrative cost estimates of $1.36 to $1.45 per payable silver ounce, share-based payments expense of
$0.36 to $0.38 per ounce and accretion of decommissioning liabilities of $0.08 per ounce.
(3) Currency assumption of 18.5:1 MXP:USD used for purposes of cash cost and AISC estimates.
With proceeds from the CAD$57.5 million private placement completed in May 2016, the Company
plans to expand its development and exploration program budget by $20.9 million in the second half
of the year, including an increase in planned development and exploration metres of 51% and 71%,
respectively. The expanded development and exploration program applies to all of the Company’s
operations and will focus to perform in-fill drilling to support underground mining activities and further
delineate  Reserves  and  Resources  at  each  mining  unit,  with  a  significant  portion  attributed  to
expanding the Reserves and Resources at La Guitarra in preparation of the 1,000 tpd mine and mill
expansion.
In addition, the Company has budgeted several expansionary projects in the second half of 2016 with
short payback periods, consisting of:
La Encantada – roasting plant construction for $8.8 million ($5.8 million in 2016 H2 with the
remainder of the investment in 2017). Once in production, the Company expects to recover an
additional 1.5 million ounces of silver from the reprocessing of above ground tailings;
La Guitarra – $3.7 million for the acquisition and rehabilitation of underground equipment for the
increase in development in preparation of the 1,000 tpd expansion in order to achieve
economies of scale in production costs;
San Martin – installation of tailings filter press for $1.3 million in order to recover water, reduce
cyanide consumption and tailings costs and environmental risks;
Plomosas – $2.6 million for the reconditioning of the main access and underground drifts, a
5,000 metre underground diamond drilling program, to develop crosscuts to prepare future
underground drill stations and to obtain surface access agreements for future surface permitting;
and
Corporate - central maintenance shop expansion for $0.5 million to increase savings by
performing more equipment overhauls per year in-house.
With these additional investments, the Company expects to invest a total of $88.5 million in capital
expenditures in 2016, compared to its previous guidance of $63.8 million. These expansionary capital
investments are expected to have a positive impact on the Company’s financial and operating results
in 2017.

Total production for the quarter was 4,681,608 silver equivalent ounces and consisted of 2,844,930
ounces  of  silver,  16,371  ounces  of  gold,  8,825,234  pounds  of  lead  and  3,837,301  pounds  of  zinc.
Compared  to  the  previous  quarter,  total  production  decreased  by  8%  primarily  attributed  to  an  8%
decrease in average silver grades related with lower grades at the La Encantada and Santa Elena
mines. The decrease in silver grades at the Santa Elena mine was due to planned mine sequencing
of  the  Main  Vein  and  accessing  areas  of  the  heap  leach  pad  that  contained  overall  lower  grades.
Silver grades at La Encantada averaged 169 g/t during the quarter, or a 24% decrease compared to
the prior quarter primarily due to the blending of lower grade ore from previously mined stopes. The La
Encantada mine is currently developing stope 291, a high grade structure in close proximity to the
San Javier breccia, in an effort to increase grades in the second half of 2016.
During the second quarter, the Company processed a total of 798,182 tonnes of ore, reflecting a 1%
increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. Combined silver recoveries averaged 75% remaining
consistent with the previous quarter.
Cash Cost per Ounce
Cash cost per ounce (after by-product credits) for the quarter was $6.41 per payable ounce of silver,
an increase of 28% from $5.00 per ounce in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in cash cost per
ounce was primarily the result of lower grades at the La Encantada and Santa Elena mines due to
change in mining sequence discussed above.
First Majestic Silver Corp. 2016 Second Quarter Report
Page 5
Compared to the same quarter of 2015, cash cost per ounce decreased 27% from $8.74 per ounce.
The  decrease  in  cash  cost  per  ounce  was  primarily  the  result  of  an  ongoing  company-wide  cost
reduction efforts and a focus on producing only profitable ounces, which resulted in significant cost
savings in contractor, haulage, energy and reagents. Santa Elena, the Company’s recently acquired
mine,  had  a  negative  cash  cost  of  ($2.86)  per  ounce,  which  also  contributed  to  the  significant
reduction in the Company’s consolidated cash cost.
All-In Sustaining Cost per Ounce
Consolidated AISC for the quarter was $10.97 per ounce, a 22% or $2.00 increase compared to $8.97
per ounce in the previous quarter. The increase in AISC was primarily attributed to an increases in
cash cost per ounce and general and administrative expenses incurred in the second quarter.
Compared  to  the  same  quarter  of  the  prior  year,  AISC  decreased  by  24%  or  $3.52  per  ounce
compared to $14.49 per ounce. AISC reduced significantly due to a $2.33 reduction in cash costs per
ounce,  as  well  as  decreases  in  sustaining  capital  expenditures.  AISC  was  also  lower  due  to  the
recent  addition  of  the  Santa  Elena  mine,  which  had  an  AISC  of  $1.81  per  ounce  in  the  quarter.
Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to increase in the second half of the year to catch up
with expanded program targets and newly available budget. See “2016 Second Half Outlook” for more
detail.
Development and Exploration
A total of 11,738 metres of underground development was completed during the quarter, compared to
10,007 metres developed in the previous quarter and 10,259 metres completed in the second quarter
of 2015. The increase in mine development compared to the previous quarter was due to programs
delayed in the first quarter.
At quarter end, 17 diamond drill rigs were active at the Company’s six operating mines. During the
quarter, a total of 19,342 metres were drilled compared to 6,697 metres drilled in the first quarter and
16,268 metres drilled in the second quarter of 2015. The Company’s exploration program, focusing on
underground  expansion  of  known  ore  bodies  at  all  six  mines,  ramped  up  in  the  second  quarter  to
catch up with program targets after a slow initiation at the beginning of the year due to budgeting and
permitting delays.

The  Santa  Elena  mine  has  a  gold  streaming  agreement  with  Sandstorm  Gold  Ltd.  (“Sandstorm”),
which requires the mine to sell 20% of its gold production from a designated area of its underground
operations over the life of mine to Sandstorm. The selling price is based on the lower of the prevailing
market price or $350 per ounce until fulfillment of 50,000 ounces, after which the price will increase to
the  lower  of  the  prevailing  market  price  or  $450  per  ounce,  adjusted  for  a  1%  annual  inflation
commencing in April 2014. As at June 30, 2016, the Santa Elena mine has delivered 38,558 ounces
of gold to Sandstorm to date.
During the quarter, Santa Elena exceeded guidance by producing 605,615 silver ounces and 12,704
ounces of gold for a total quarterly production of 1,559,410 silver equivalent ounces, a decrease of
10% compared to 1,725,417 silver equivalent ounces in the previous quarter primarily due to a slight
reduction in silver and gold grades from  both  the  above  ground  heap  leach  pad  and  underground
production areas.
First Majestic Silver Corp. 2016 Second Quarter Report
Page 7
Silver recoveries increased to 89%, up from 87% compared to the previous quarter. Gold grades and
recoveries averaged 1.69 g/t and 95%, respectively, compared to 1.82 g/t and 94% in the previous
quarter. Improvement in recoveries were attributed to throughput control and mill enhancements made
to improve finer grinding. Compared to the previous quarter, grades decreased slightly due to planned
mine sequencing of the Main Vein and accessing areas of the heap leach pad that contained overall
lower grades. The lower grades from the Main Vein were slightly offset by higher grades from the
Alejandra vein.
The mill processed a total of 245,753 tonnes during the quarter, consisting of 124,772 tonnes (1,371
tpd) of underground ore and 120,981 tonnes (1,329 tpd) from the above ground heap leach pad. This
compares with a total of 242,539 tonnes processed during the previous quarter, consisting of 118,337
tonnes (equivalent to 1,300 tpd) of underground ore and 124,202 tonnes (equivalent to 1,365 tpd) from
the above ground heap leach pad.
Cash costs in the second quarter was negative ($2.86) per payable silver ounce, attributed primarily to
high byproduct credits from the mine’s high gold production. Compared to the previous quarter, cash
costs increased slightly from negative cash costs of ($3.34) per payable silver ounce, primarily due to
lower head grades due to change in mining sequence, and temporary higher labour and contractor
costs as the mine is transitioning some of its mining activities from contractor to employees.
A total of 2,931 metres of underground development were completed in the second quarter compared
to 2,480 metres of development in the previous quarter. In the quarter, the Company completed its
development of the portal ramp to access the Tortugas vein. In addition, at the end of the quarter, total
development  of  the  new  San  Salvador  ramp  reached  426  metres,  or  19%  of  the  2,300  metre
development plan. The new ramp is scheduled to connect to the Main Vein area along level 575 by
the end of 2016. Once completed, the transportation of ore via trucks is expected to reduce haulage
bottlenecks and increase the underground production capacity.
Two underground drill rigs were active on the Santa Elena property during the quarter, with 3,509
metres drilled compared to 146 metres drilled in the previous quarter. The intent of the drilling program
was to delineate the planned stopes in the Santa Elena main vein and the Tortuga vein, and to locate
the hanging-wall fault that drives the stope width when it gets closer to the main vein. The Company is
also currently drilling the Santa Elena North Vein from surface and expects to begin surface drilling on
the Ermitaño West property in the third quarter.

Total production from the La Parrilla mine was 948,552 silver equivalent ounces during the quarter, a
decrease of 5% compared to 1,001,359 equivalent ounces of silver in the previous quarter. During the
quarter, the lead circuit processed an average lead grade of 1.4% with recoveries of 85% for a total
lead production of 2,894,123 pounds, representing a 23% decrease compared to the previous quarter.
The  decrease  in  lead  production  was  primarily  attributed  to  lower  head  grades.  The  zinc  circuit
processed  an  average  zinc  grade  of  2.2%  with  recoveries  of  68%  for  a  total  zinc  production  of
3,837,301  pounds,  representing  a  5%  decrease  compared  to  the  previous  quarter  primarily  due  to
lower  head  grades.  Compared  to  the  second  quarter  of  2015,  total  production  decreased  4%  from
985,107  equivalent  ounces  of  silver.  The  decrease  was  primarily  attributed  to  a  12%  decrease  in
throughput, partially offset by higher recoveries.
During the quarter, the flotation circuit processed 114,930 tonnes (1,263 tpd) with an average silver
grade of 155 g/t and an 88% recovery while the cyanidation circuit processed 42,941 tonnes (472 tpd)
with  an  average  silver  grade  of  110  g/t  and  a  64%  recovery  for  total  production  of  948,552  silver
equivalent ounces.

Cash cost in the quarter was $7.33 per ounce, an increase of 36% compared to the previous quarter
and a decrease of 32% compared to the second quarter of 2015. The increase in cash costs was
primarily attributed to lower by-product credits from reduced lead and zinc production. Compared to
the  same  quarter  of  the  prior  year,  the  improvement  in  production  costs  was  attributed  to
management’s  decision  to  focus  on  profitable  ounces,  leaving  higher  cost  ounces  in  the  ground,
resulting  in  the  planned  reduction  of  cyanidation  circuit  throughput  and  significant  savings  in
contractor, electricity, reagent and maintenance costs.
A  total  of  1,834  metres  of  underground  development  were  completed  in  the  quarter,  compared  to
1,790 metres in the first quarter of 2016 and 1,901 metres in the second quarter of 2015. A total of
3,030 metres of diamond drilling were completed in the quarter compared to 1,517 metres of diamond
drilling in the first quarter of 2016 and 4,356 metres in the first quarter of 2015. Two underground drill
rigs were active during the quarter as the focus of the 2016 exploration program is on the Rosarios
mine, Intermedia veins and the San Nicolas system, where drilling results have indicated potential for
the lateral and in-depth extension of known structures.
In July 2016, the Company is planning to complete a 2,284 line kilometre, high resolution, airborne
magnetic survey covering over 28,750 hectares at La Parrilla. This geophysical work will support the
ground exploration activities by defining geophysical anomalies for targeting additional mineralization
around the La Parrilla complex.

A total of 623,070 equivalent ounces of silver were produced by the La Encantada processing plant
during  the  quarter.  Production  in  the  second  quarter  decreased  by  25%  from  832,957  equivalent
ounces of silver in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in production was primarily due to lower
silver  grades  and  recoveries.  Compared  to  the  same  quarter  of  the  prior  year,  total  production
increased by 3% due to a 10% increase in tonnes milled, partially offset by 5% lower silver grades.
Tonnage  milled  in  the  quarter  was  209,039  tonnes,  compared  to  189,140  tonnes  in  the  previous
quarter and 189,811 tonnes in the second quarter of 2015. During the previous quarter, the processing
plant operated at a reduced throughput rate due to down time related to maintenance of the crushing,
grinding  and  filtration  areas.  Repair  work  was  completed  in  April,  on  schedule,  allowing  mill
processing rates to return to normal operating levels in May. However, throughput rates were reduced
slightly in June due to heavy rains causing ore and surface stockpiles to become unusually wet.
Silver grades averaged 169 g/t during the quarter, a 24% decrease compared to the previous quarter
and a 5% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to the blending of lower
grade  ore  from  previously  mined  stopes.  The  Company  is  currently  developing  stope  291,  a  high
grade  structure  in  close  proximity  to  the  San  Javier  breccia,  in  an  effort  to  increase  grades  in  the
second half of 2016.

Cash cost per ounce for the quarter was $12.41 compared to $8.49 in the previous quarter and $14.65
in the same quarter of the previous year. Increase in cash cost per ounce compared to the previous
quarter was primarily attributed to lower silver head grades as a result of change in mining sequence.
A new high grade area was discovered in close proximity of the San Javier breccia and is undergoing
development planning. Total production cost per tonne for the quarter was $35.13, comparable to the
first quarter of 2016 and 21% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015.
The roasting project was advanced in the second quarter with the completion of the analysis of using
pulverized coal as the primary source for fuel combustion. The Company is now advancing on full
scale engineering work to design the furnace and other auxiliary parts for manufacturing by the end of
the year. The estimated capital investment to construct the roasting plant and its satellite facilities is
estimated at approximately $8.8 million and would take 12 months to bring into production. Once in
full  production,  the  Company  expects  to  recover  an  additional  1.5  million  ounces  overall  from  the
reprocessing of above ground tailings.
A total of 1,043 metres were developed underground in the quarter compared to 1,189 metres in the
first quarter of 2016 and 2,021 metres in the second quarter of 2015. Mine development efforts are
currently focused on the preparation of the San Javier breccia and high grade narrow veins in order to
increase production of low-cost profitable ounces.
A  total  of  3,062  metres  were  drilled  in  the  second  quarter  compared  to  nil  metres  in  the  previous
quarter. The 2016 drilling program commenced in April and will focus on the newly discovered Maria
Isabel breccia in close proximity to current operating areas.
The Company recently completed a 1,297 line kilometre, high resolution, airborne magnetic survey
covering  over  8,700  hectares  at  La  Encantada.  This  geophysical  work  will  support  the  ground
exploration activities by defining geophysical anomalies for targeting additional mineralization.
On June 26, 2016, a minor spillover occurred from Plant 2 caused by heavy seasonal rains filled the
emergency  containment  overflow  area  to  its  maximum  capacity  of  water.  Most  of  the  spillage  was
contained  within  the  Company’s  property.  Restoration  and  cleanup  crews  immediately  began
neutralizing  the  affected  area  and  reinforced  the  containment  area.  A  water  pump  was  installed  to
collect the rain-sludge solution for pumping back to the processing tanks. The transportation of the
solution and the cleanup process was completed on July 6, 2016. Furthermore, the Company does
not expect this incident to have any significant impact on operations or the local environment.

During the second quarter, the Del Toro mine processed 80,739 tonnes of ore with an average silver
grade of 192 g/t. Del Toro produced a total of 682,443 silver equivalent ounces, an 18% increase
compared to 578,556 ounces produced in the previous quarter. Improvements were made in dilution
control, mining and milling activities resulting in both silver grades and recoveries during the quarter,
increasing 34% and 3%, respectively. Several high grade veins within the San Juan, Perseverancia
and Dolores mines, were also developed during the quarter to provide new production stopes. These
were partially offset by 7% decrease in throughput due to dilution control and efforts to improve the
economics of the mine and processing plant.
Compared to the same quarter of the prior year, production decreased by 41% due to a 50% decrease
in tonnes milled, partially offset by 8% increase in head grades and 12% increase in metallurgical
silver recoveries.
Lead grades and recoveries averaged 5.0% and 66%, respectively, producing a total of 5,931,111
pounds of lead, or a 22% increase compared to the previous quarter.
Cash cost per ounce for the quarter was $7.90, a 17% reduction compared to $9.52 per ounce in the
previous quarter and an increase of 82% compared to $4.34 in the same quarter of the prior year. The
improvement  in  cash  cost  per  ounce  compared  to  the  previous  quarter  was  primarily  attributed  to
increase in silver production, partially offset by lower by-product credits.
First Majestic Silver Corp. 2016 Second Quarter Report
Page 13
The 82% increase in cash cost per ounce compared to the second quarter of 2015 was due to a
combination of 40% decrease in silver ounces produced and 11% decrease in byproduct credits.
Total  underground  development  at  Del  Toro  in  the  current  quarter  was  1,754  metres  compared  to
1,201 metres in the first quarter of 2016 and 1,813 metres in the same quarter of the prior year. The
increase  in  development  metres  compared  to  the  prior  year  was  due  to  preparation  of  new
development areas for exploitation.
At  quarter  end,  four  drill  rigs  were  active  at  Del  Toro  and  a  total  of  3,306  metres  were  completed
compared  to  1,278  metres  in  the  previous  quarter  and  5,200  metres  in  the  same  quarter  of  2015.
Drilling at Del Toro was focused on expansion laterally and at depth of known structures in the Lupita
area. Current exploration targets include the Santa Teresa, San Nicolas and Carmen Consuelo veins.

During  the  quarter,  the  San  Martin  mine  processed  a  total  of  69,863  tonnes  compared  to  75,863
tonnes in the previous quarter and 89,506 tonnes in the same quarter of the prior year. The average
head grade was 219 g/t, a decrease of 10% compared to the previous quarter and an 18% decrease
compared to the same quarter of the prior year.
During the quarter, San Martin produced 411,686 silver ounces and 1,078 ounces of gold for a total
production  of  492,669  silver  equivalent  ounces.  Total  production  decreased  15%  compared  to  the
prior quarter primarily due to a 10% decrease in silver grade and an 8% decrease in tonnes milled.
Compared  to  the  same  quarter  of  the  prior  year,  total  production  decreased  29%  due  to  a  22%
decrease in throughput and an 18% decrease in silver grades, partially offset by an 8% increase in
recoveries.
Silver recovery in the quarter was 84%, a 3% increase compared to 81% in the previous quarter and
an increase of 8% compared to 77% in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in recovery
was  primarily  attributed  to  improved  barren  solution  control  and  washing  efficiency.  The  Company
anticipates  grades  will  gradually  increase  over  the  next  few  quarters  as  production  rates  from  the
Veladora vein are increased to 250 tpd.

Page 15
During the quarter, total production cost was $65.75 per tonne, a 23% increase compared to $53.32
per tonne in the previous quarter and an increase of 17% compared to same quarter of 2015. Cash
cost per ounce was $8.67, a 49% increase from $5.83 per ounce in the previous quarter and a 39%
increase compared to the $6.25 per ounce in the second quarter of 2015. The increase in production
costs was a result of additional costs associated with preparation of various high grade stopes that
will be brought into production in the third quarter and additional ground support costs such as rock-
bolting and shot-creting due to the unstable ground conditions.
Engineering work for the installation of the tailings filter presses continued during the quarter. The
filter presses, which are designed to recover and re-use tailings solution and to save on water and
cyanide consumption, are expected to be installed and undergo testing in the first quarter of 2017.
A total of 2,524 metres of underground development was completed in the quarter compared to 2,093
metres of development in the previous quarter and 2,208 metres of development in the second quarter
of 2015.
During the quarter, a total of 4,137 metres of diamond drilling were completed compared with 3,113
metres drilled in the previous quarter and 833 metres drilled in the second quarter of 2015. Three
underground drill rigs were active at the San Martin property during the quarter, focusing on extending
the preparation of mining levels in the mineralized zones of the Rosario, Guitarrona and La Veladora
veins, while the exploration program will be focused on the La Lima Intermedia.

During the second quarter, La Guitarra produced 206,262 silver ounces and 2,253 gold ounces for a
total quarterly production of 375,464 silver equivalent ounces. Compared to the previous quarter, total
production increased 3% due to a 21% increase in average silver grades and a 32% increase in gold
grades,  offset  by  a  19%  decrease  in  tonnes  milled.  Due  to  the  higher  grades  being  sourced,  mill
throughput was reduced to 34,917 tonnes (384 tpd) in an effort to further improve the economics of the
operation while maintaining a consistent level of production ounces. Compared to the same quarter of
the prior year, production increased by 5% attributed to a 12% increase in head grades, offset by an
18% decrease in tonnes milled.
Approximately 64% of the production ore came from the Coloso area and the remaining 36% was
extracted  from  the  older  La  Guitarra  area  during  the  quarter.  The  800  metre  drift  from  Coloso
successfully intersected the Nazareno vein at the end of the quarter. The area of the vein intersected
was approximately 3.5 metres wide with grades of 360 g/t of silver and 0.5 g/t of gold.
Cash cost in this quarter was $5.93 per ounce, a 28% decrease compared to the previous quarter and
a  12%  decrease  compared  to  the  same  quarter  of  2015.  The  decrease  in  cash  cost  was  primarily
attributed to higher byproduct credits from increased gold production, partially offset by higher costs
associated with drifting into the narrow veins of Jessica and Joya Larga in the Coloso area, which
required the Company to use lower volume stope-ramping and shrinkage mining to improve dilution
control, resulting in an increase in preparation of sills in ore and ore extraction infrastructure.
First Majestic Silver Corp. 2016 Second Quarter Report
Page 17
A total of 1,652 metres of underground development was completed during the quarter compared to
1,254  metres  in  the  previous  quarter  and  2,316  metres  in  the  second  quarter  of  2015.  During  the
quarter,  four  underground  drill  rigs  were  active  at  the  La  Guitarra  property  and  2,298  metres  of
diamond drilling were completed compared to 643 metres during the previous quarter and 569 metres
in the same quarter of the prior year. The drilling program is currently focused on in-fill drilling at the
Jessica  and  La  Joya  veins  in  order  to  confirm  high  grade  resources  both  laterally  and  at  depth  to
assist  underground  mining  activities  and  further  delineate  Reserves  and  Resources,  while  the
exploration program will focus on the Nazareno vein.
In 2014, the Company entered into two agreements to acquire 757 hectares of adjacent mineral rights
at the La Guitarra Silver Mine. The total purchase price amounted to $5.4 million, of which $5.2 million
is to be settled in common shares of First Majestic and $0.2 million in cash. As at June 30, 2016, the
Company  has  paid  the  $0.2  million  and  issued  $3.7  million  in  common  shares.  The  remaining
balance  of  $1.5  million  in  common  shares  will  be  issued  in  three  equal  annual  payments  in
September based on the Company’s five days volume weighted average market price at the time of
the payments.

EXPLORATION PROJECTS
Plomosas Silver Project, Sinaloa, Mexico
The Plomosas Silver Project, which was acquired during the 2012 Silvermex acquisition, consists of
13 mining concessions covering 6,986 hectares, which include the adjacent Rosario and San Juan
historic mines located in the Sinaloa State, México.
The  two  key  areas  of  interest  within  the  property’s  boundaries  are  the  historic  operations  of  the
Rosario  and  San  Juan  mines.  Extensive  facilities  and  infrastructure  are  in  place  on  the  property,
including a fully functional mining camp facility for 120 persons, a 20 year surface rights agreement in
good standing, a 30 year water use permit, a tailings dam, a 60 kilometre 33 kilovolt power line, an
infirmary, offices, shops and warehouses, and an assay lab. Extensive underground development pre-
existing at the Rosario and San Juan mines will allow for easy access to mineralized zones. This
existing development is expected to allow First Majestic to accelerate exploration and development in
the future.
The  Company  is  preparing  the  underground  infrastructure,  including  dewatering  and  ventilation,  in
order to access and equip the three underground drilling stations. The Company’s plans at Plomosas
include  a  5,000  metre  diamond  drilling  program  during  the  second  half  of  2016  as  well  as
development  of  new  crosscuts  to  prepare  underground  drilling  stations  to  be  used  in  2017.  The
Company is working toward obtaining surface access agreements and permits for additional drilling
on surface beginning in 2017.
The Company is currently utilizing the mining camp infrastructure to maintain the old structures under
care and maintenance. Future plans include drilling and development in order to prepare a NI 43-101
Technical report with resource estimates and a Preliminary Economic Assessment.
La Luz Silver Project, San Luis Potosi, México
The La Luz Silver Project is located 25 kilometres west of the town of Matehuala in San Luis Potosi
State, México, near the village of Real de Catorce. The Company owns 100% of the La Luz project
and all of the associated mining claims of what was historically known as the Santa Ana Mine and
consists of 36 mining concessions covering 4,977 hectares, with estimated historical production of
230 million ounces between 1773 and 1990. In July 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of
an additional 21 hectares of surface rights covering 29 adjacent properties for $1.0 million. The total
surface rights on different properties at La Luz amount to 26 hectares.
To  date,  the  Company  has  completed  a  Baseline  Study  and  the  Geo-hydrologic  Study.  However,
there has been opposition to mining in the La Luz area from certain indigenous people (Huicholes)
and non-government organizations (“NGOs”). An injunction was placed by the Company to defend
against the indigenous people’s attempts to obtain a constitutional decree to declare certain areas in
San Luis Potosi as natural protected areas, including areas within which the La Luz mine has been
duly  granted  mining  concessions.  The  Company  is  currently  addressing  these  constitutional  legal
matters  in  the  Mexican  courts.  Three  different  legal  orders  to  obtain  approvals  to  present  its  final
permit applications were submitted and one positive resolution was obtained, while the other orders
remain in front of the court. There is currently no estimate of when a final resolution can be expected.
The Company is ready to submit the Environmental Impact Statement, the Risk Study and the Change
of  Use  of  Land  Studies  to  government  authorities  once  the  courts  resolve  the  outstanding
constitutional matters. The Company is unable at this time to estimate when these legal constitutional
matters will be resolved.
Jalisco Group of Properties, Jalisco, México
The  Company  owns  a  group  of  mining  claims  totalling  5,245  hectares  located  in  various  mining
districts located in Jalisco State, México. During 2008, surface geology and mapping began with the
purpose  of  defining  future  drill  targets.  However,  exploration  has  since  been  discontinued  as  the
Company focuses its capital investment on other more mature and higher priority projects.

1. Revenues in the quarter increased 22% compared to the same quarter of the previous year due a
22% increase in silver equivalent ounces sold compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily
attributed  to  incremental  production  from  the  Santa  Elena  mine, which was acquired in October
2015. Average realized silver price in the quarter was $17.01 per ounce which was comparable
to $16.99 per ounce in the same quarter of the prior year.
2. Cost of sales in the quarter increased 9% compared to the same quarter of the previous year as a
result of the following factors:
•
the addition of the Santa Elena Mine, which produced 1.6 million silver equivalent ounces in
the quarter and added $10.5 million to the Company’s cost of sales;
Partially offset by:
• weakening  of  the  Mexican  pesos  against  the  U.S. dollar,  as  a  significant  portion  of  the
Company’s  operating  costs are incurred in Mexican pesos, which weakened by 18% against
the U.S. dollar compared to the second quarter of 2015; and
the  Company’s ongoing effort to reduce costs through headcount reductions, renegotiating
contractors and suppliers contracts, and realizing efficiencies, which resulted in significant cost
reductions in mining contractor, mineral haulage, diesel and explosives.
•
First Majestic Silver Corp. 2016 Second Quarter Report
Page 20
3. The increase in depletion, depreciation and amortization was attributed to a combination of the
following:
•
the addition  of  the  Santa  Elena  mine i n October  2015,  which  contributed  $4.0  million  to
depletion, depreciation and amortization during the quarter;
• Revisions  to  life  of  mines at  the  end  of 2015  accelerated  depletion  and  depreciation  rates
applied  to  mining interests and property, plant and equipment depreciated under the units-of-
production  method.  Life  of  mine  estimates  were  reduced  at  the  end of  2015  to  reflect  lower
Reserves and Resources estimates with higher cut-off grades based on lower metal prices;
partially offset by:
•
Impairment  charge  on  non-current  assets recognized  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  which
resulted in an $87.2 million decrease in depletable mining interests and depreciable property,
plant  and  equipment,  which  results  in  lower  depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  in
subsequent periods.
4. Mine  operating  earnings during  the  quarter increased  $6.5  million  from  the  second  quarter  of
2015  due  to  an  $8.9 million  increase  in  gross  margin  offset  by  $2.4  million  higher  depletion,
depreciation and amortization expense. Gross margin was primarily affected by a 22% increase in
silver equivalent ounces sold and lower cash costs per ounce.
5. The Company’s investment and other income or loss is primarily comprised of gain or losses on
the following:
• $4.6 million gain on investment in marketable securities, compared to a loss of $0.1 million in
the second quarter of 2015; and
• $0.3 million in interest income and other.
6. Finance  costs decreased $0.3 million compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to
lower debt financing costs subsequent to the early settlement of BAML prepayment facilities in
February 2016.
7. During the quarter, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $3.1 million compared to an
income  tax  recovery  of  $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. The $5.0 million increase in
income tax expense was primarily attributed to a $13.7 million increase in earnings before tax.

1. Revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased 22% compared to the same period of
the previous year due to the following significant contributors:
• Silver  equivalent  ounces  sold increased  by 29%  compared  to  the  same  period  of  2015,
primarily attributed to incremental production from the Santa Elena mine, which was acquired in
October 2015;
Partially offset by:
• Average  realized  silver  price decreased  by 6%  from  $17.02  per  ounce  in  the  six  months
ended June 30, 2015 to $15.99 per ounce in the current period.
2. Cost of sales in the period increased 12% compared to the same period of the previous year as a
result of the following factors:
•
the addition of the Santa Elena Mine, which produced 3.3 million silver equivalent ounces in
the quarter and added $22.2 million to the Company’s cost of sales;
Partially offset by:
• weakening  of  the  Mexican  pesos  against  the  U.S. dollar,  as  a  significant  portion  of  the
Company’s  operating  costs are incurred in Mexican pesos, which weakened by 19% against
the U.S. dollar compared to the same period of 2015; and
the  Company’s ongoing effort to reduce costs through headcount reductions, renegotiating
contractors and suppliers contracts, and realizing efficiencies, which resulted in significant cost
reductions in mining contractor, mineral haulage, diesel and explosives.
•
First Majestic Silver Corp. 2016 Second Quarter Report

3. The increase in depletion, depreciation and amortization was attributed to a combination of the
following:
•
the addition  of  the  Santa  Elena  mine i n October  2015,  which  contributed  $7.8  million  to
depletion, depreciation and amortization during the six months ended June 30, 2016;
• Revisions  to  life  of  mines at  the  end  of 2015  accelerated  depletion  and  depreciation  rates
applied  to  mining interests and property, plant and equipment depreciated under the units-of-
production  method.  Life  of  mine  estimates  were  reduced  at  the  end of  2015  to  reflect  lower
Reserves and Resources estimates with higher cut-off grades based on lower metal prices;
partially offset by:
•
Impairment  charge  on  non-current  assets recognized  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015,  which
resulted in an $87.2 million decrease in depletable mining interests and depreciable property,
plant  and  equipment,  which  results  in  lower  depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  in
subsequent periods.
4. Mine  operating  earnings during  the  six  months ended  June  30,  2016  increased  $10.9  million
from the same period of 2015 due to a $16.0 million increase in gross margin offset by $5.1 million
higher  depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization.  Gross  margin  was primarily  affected  by  a  29%
increase in silver equivalent ounces sold and lower cash costs per ounce.
5. The Company’s investment and other income or loss is primarily comprised of gain or losses on
the following:
• $5.6 million gain on investment in marketable securities; and
• $0.5 million in interest income and other;
Offset by:
• $1.3 million loss on fair value adjustment of prepayment facilities, which contains commodity
• $1.3 million loss on fair value adjustment of prepayment facilities, which contains commodity
price swaps and call options on a portion of the Company’s lead and zinc production, prior to
early settlement in February 2016.
6. Finance costs increased $2.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
same  period  of  2015, primarily  due  to  a  $3.5  million  loss  related  to  prepayment  of  interest
expenses embedded in the early settlement of BAML prepayment facilities in February 2016,
which resulted in accelerated interest and accretion expense plus call option payments. The debt
restructuring improved the Company’s working capital by approximately $32.0 million.
7. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded  an income  tax  expense of
$11.9 million compared to an income tax expense of $nil in the same period of 2015. In November
2015, the  Mexican  Tax  Authorities  introduced  a  provision  which  enable  companies to  settle  a
portion of its tax deconsolidation liability against past loss carryforwards at a  discounted  rate  of
15% as compared to the Mexican corporate tax rate of 30%. In March 2016, the Company elected
to  apply this  new  provision  to  reduce  its  deconsolidation  tax  liability  by  $14.7 million.  As  the
Company was previously carrying these tax loss carryforwards as a deferred tax asset valued at
$21.4 million, this effectively resulted in a one-time net $6.7 million deferred tax expense related to
the value of tax loss carryforwards being written off during the period. Without the effect of this one-
time adjustment, the Company’s income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was
$5.2 million. The increase in income tax expense compared to the same period of the prior year
was due to an increase in earnings before income taxes of $14.3 million.
8. As a result  of  the  foregoing, net  loss for  the  six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.3 million
(Loss per share of $0.01) compared to a loss of $3.7 million (Loss per share of $0.03) in the same
period of the prior year.

1.
In the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded mine operating earnings of $9.9 million
compared to $9.4 million in the first quarter. Net earnings for the quarter was $6.1 million, a $13.5
million increase compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to a $5.6 million decrease in
deferred tax expense and a $4.6 million fair value gain on marketable securities. Deferred tax
expense  in  the  prior  quarter  was affected  by  a  one-time  net  $6.7  million  deferred  income  tax
expense related to the value of tax loss carryforwards being written off.
2. During  the  first  quarter  of  2016,  mine  operating  earnings was  $9.4  million,  compared  to  $3.9
million in the quarter ended December 31, 2015. The increase in mine operating earnings was
primarily attributed to decrease in cost of sales as a result of an ongoing company-wide effort to
reduce costs and focus on producing profitable ounces. Net loss for the quarter was $7.4 million
compared  to  a  net  loss  of  $103.0  million  in  the fourth quarter of 2015. Net loss in the current
quarter was primarily affected by a one-time net $6.7 million deferred income tax expense related
to  the  value  of  tax  loss  carryforwards  being  written  off.  Net  loss in  the  previous  period  was
primarily due to a $108.4 million, or $70.2 million net of tax, impairment of non- current assets.
3. During the fourth quarter of 2015, mine operating earnings was $3.9 million, compared to loss of
$3.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The increase in mine operating earnings
was primarily driven by the addition of the Santa Elena mine, which had mine operating earnings
of $9.4 million during the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $103.0 million, compared to a loss
of $1.8 million in the previous quarter primarily due to a $108.4 million, or $70.2 million net of tax,
impairment of non-current assets due to reduction in market consensus on long-term silver price
forecasts and the consequential impact on the Company’s reserves and resources.
4. During the third quarter of 2015, mine operating loss was $3.6 million, compared to earnings of
$3.4 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in mine operating earnings was
primarily driven by a decrease in silver prices and less silver equivalent ounces sold. Net loss for
the quarter was $1.8 million, compared to a loss of $2.6 million in the previous quarter due to a
decrease  in  mine  operating earnings  and  investment  and  other  losses  related  to  fair  value
adjustment of prepayment facilities and derivatives, net of deferred income tax recovery related to
taxation effects on foreign currency translation.
5. During the second quarter of 2015, mine operating earnings was $3.4 million compared to $5.0
million  in  the  quarter  ended March  31,  2015.  The  decrease  in  mine  operating  earnings  was
primarily driven by a decrease in silver prices and silver equivalent ounces sold. Net loss for the
quarter  was  $2.6  million,  compared  to  a  loss  of  $1.1 million  in  the  previous  quarter  due  to
decrease  in  mine  operating  earnings and  investment  and  other  losses  related  to  fair  value
adjustment of prepayment facilities and derivatives.
6. During  the  first  quarter  of  2015,  mine  operating  earnings was  $5.0  million  compared  to  $5.8
million in the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in mine operating earnings was
primarily driven by decrease in silver prices and silver equivalent ounces sold, as approximately
934,000 ounces of silver sales that were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2014 and sold in the
quarter ended December 31, 2014. Net loss for the quarter was $1.1 million, compared to a loss
of $64.6 million in the previous quarter due to a non-cash impairment charge of $102.0 million, or
$66.0 million net of tax, recognized at the end of the previous quarter.

8.
In the quarter ended December 31, 2014, mine operating earnings was $5.8 million compared to
mine operating loss of $1.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014. The increase in
mine  operating  earnings  was  attributed  to  approximately  934,000  ounces  of  silver  sales  that
were suspended at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014 due to declining silver prices and rolled
into  sales  of  the  fourth  quarter.  Net  loss  for  the  quarter  was  $64.6  million  compared  to  $10.5
million in the previous quarter due to a non-cash impairment charge of $102.0 million, or $66.0
million net of tax, related to some of the Company’s non-current assets during the quarter and
related taxation effects.
 
In  the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2014,  mine  operating  loss  was  $1.8  million  compared  to
mine operating earnings of $9.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2014. The decrease
in  mine  operating  earnings  was  primarily  attributed  to  the  Company’s  decision  to  suspend
approximately 934,000 in silver sales near the end of the quarter as a result of significant decline
in silver prices during the quarter. Net earnings also decreased $18.0 million compared to the
preceding quarter as a result of a decrease in mine operating earnings and a one-time litigation
gain of $14.1 million recognized in the second quarter of 2014.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Liquidity
As at June 30, 2016, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $108.2 million compared to
$51.0 million at December 31, 2015. Cash and cash equivalents is primarily comprised of cash held
with reputable financial institutions and is invested in cash accounts and in highly liquid short-term
investments with maturities of three months or less. The funds are not exposed to liquidity risk and
there are no restrictions on the ability of the Company to use these funds to meet its obligations. As at
June 30, 2016, total available liquidity, including $8.8 million of undrawn revolving credit facility, was
$117.0 million.
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $57.2 million during the period. The Company’s cash flows
from operating, investing and financing activities during the year are summarized as follows:
• Cash provided from operating activities of $37.0 million;
• Cash provided by financing activities of $44.2 million, including:
o $42.7 million net proceeds from private placement completed in May 2016;
o $49.9 million net proceeds from new debt financing closed in February 2016; and
o $8.6 million proceeds from exercise of stock options, of which $4.1 million related to exercise
of replacement stock options issued for the SilverCrest acquisition.
offset by:
o $31.6 million was spent on repayment of prepayment facilities;
o $15.0 million was spent on repayment of SilverCrest’s credit facility;
o $5.1 million was spent on repayment of lease obligations; and
o $5.3 million was spent on financing costs;
• Cash used in investing activities of $25.5 million, primarily related to:
o $18.5 million spent on mine development and exploration activities; and
o $6.0 million spent on purchase of property, plant and equipment and deposits for the
acquisition
of non-current assets.
Working capital as at June 30, 2016 was $119.1 million compared to $15.6 million at December 31,
2015.  To  improve  the  Company’s  working  capital  position  and  advance  various  expansionary
projects, the Company completed a CAD$57.5 million private placement in May 2016 and closed a
$60.0 million debt financing agreement in February 2016, consisting of a $35.0 million three year term
loan and a $25.0 million revolving credit facility with a three year expiry. Additional improvement in
working  capital  can  also  be  attributed  to  improving  metal  prices  and  lower  operating  costs,  which
resulted in $48.4 million in operating cash flows generated before movements in working capital and
taxes during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Since June 30, 2016, as at the date of this MD&A, proceeds from exercise of stock options were $10.7
million (CAD$14.0 million).
Capital Resources
The Company’s objective when managing capital is to maintain financial flexibility to continue as a
going concern while optimizing growth and maximizing returns of investments from shareholders.
The  Company  monitors  its  capital  structure  and,  based  on  changes  in  operations  and  economic
conditions, may adjust the structure by repurchasing shares, issuing new shares, issuing new debt or
retiring existing debt. The Company prepares annual budget and quarterly forecasts to facilitate the
management of its capital requirements. The annual budget is approved by the Company’s Board of
Directors.
The  Company  is  not  subject  to  any  externally  imposed  capital  requirements  with  the  exception  of
complying with covenants defined in the debt facilities. As at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company was fully in compliance with these covenants.

date of this MD&A.
MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company thoroughly examines the various financial instruments and risks to which it is exposed
and assesses the impact and likelihood of those risks. These risks may include credit risk, liquidity
risk,  currency  risk,  commodity  price  risk  and  interest  rate  risk.  Where  material,  these  risks  are
reviewed and monitored by the Board of Directors.
Credit Risk
Credit  risk  is  the  risk  of  financial  loss  if  a  customer  or  counterparty  fails  to  meet  its  contractual
obligations. The Company’s credit risk relates primarily to trade receivables in the ordinary course of
business and VAT and other receivables.
The Company sells and receives payment upon delivery of its silver doré and by-products primarily
through four international customers. Additionally, concentrates and related base metal by-products
are  sold  primarily  through  two  international  organizations  with  good  credit  ratings.  Payments  of
receivables are scheduled, routine and received within 60 days of submission; therefore, the balance
of trade receivables owed to the Company in the ordinary course of business is not significant.
At June 30, 2016, value added taxes (“VAT”) receivable included $8.9 million (2015 - $11.1 million) of
monthly VAT filings of Nusantara, a subsidiary of the recently acquired SilverCrest Mines Inc., that
were delayed due to a prior audit from the Mexican tax authorities. During the six months ended June
30, 2016, the Company collected $4.5 million of the outstanding balance of value added taxes related
to the audit of Nusantara. The Company is now proceeding to file the remaining VAT claims for the
period from September 2015 to June 2016. The Company believes the balance is fully recoverable
within the next twelve months and, therefore, has not provided an allowance against this balance nor
reclassified the balance as non-current.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements represents
the  Company’s  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk.  With  the  exception  to  the  above,  the  Company
believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they
arise.  The  Company  has  in  place  a  planning  and  budgeting  process  to  help  determine  the  funds
required to support the Company’s normal operating requirements and contractual obligations. Based
on  the  Company’s  current  operating  plan,  the  Company  believes  it  has  sufficient  cash  on  hand,
combined with cash flows from operations, to meet its ongoing operating requirements as they arise
for  at  least  the  next  12  months.  If  commodity  prices  in  the  metals  markets  were  to  decrease
significantly, or the Company was to deviate significantly from its operating plan, the Company may
need a further injection of capital to address its cash flow requirements.

Page 27
Currency Risk
The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily relating to financial instruments that are
denominated in Canadian dollars or Mexican pesos, which would impact the Company’s net earnings
or loss and other comprehensive income or loss. To manage foreign exchange risk, the Company
may  occasionally  enter  into  short-term  foreign  currency  derivatives.  As  at  June  30,  2016,  the
Company  carried  $18.0  million  in  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  with  a  weighted  average
contract rate of 18.7 to 1 (MXN to USD), which expire between July to September 2016, to hedge its
exposure on the Mexican peso. These forward contracts have a fair value of $0.4 million as at June
30, 2016 (December 31, 2015 – liability of $0.3 million) based on market quoted price. The foreign
currency derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.
The  sensitivity  of  the  Company’s  net  earnings  or  loss  and  comprehensive  income  or  loss  due  to
changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso against the U.S.
dollar is included in the table below:

Commodity Price Risk
The Company is exposed to commodity price risk on silver, gold, lead and zinc, which have a direct
and  immediate  impact  on  the  value  of  its  related  financial  instruments  and  net  earnings.  The
Company’s revenues are directly dependent on commodity prices that have shown volatility and are
beyond  the  Company’s  control.  The  Company  does  not  use  derivative  instruments  to  hedge  its
commodity price risk to silver.

First Majestic currently conducts foreign operations primarily in México, and as such the Company’s
operations  are  exposed  to  various  levels  of  political  and  economic  risks  by  factors  outside  of  the
Company’s control. These potential factors include, but are not limited to: royalty and tax increases or
claims by governmental bodies, expropriation or nationalization, foreign exchange controls, high rates
of  inflation,  extreme  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  import  and  export  regulations,
cancellation  or  renegotiation  of  contracts  and  environmental  and  permitting  regulations.  The
Company currently has no political risk insurance coverage against these risks.
The Company is unable to determine the impact of these risks on its future financial position or results
of operations. Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in foreign
countries may substantively affect Company’s exploration, development and production activities.
Environmental and Health and Safety Risks
The  Company’s  activities  are  subject  to  extensive  laws  and  regulations  governing  environmental
protection  and  employee  health  and  safety.  Environmental  laws  and  regulations  are  complex  and
have tended to become more stringent over time. The Company is required to obtain governmental
permits  and  in  some  instances  air,  water  quality,  and  mine  reclamation  rules  and  permits.  The
Company has complied with environmental taxes applied to the use of certain fossil fuels according to
the  Kyoto  Protocol.  Although  the  Company  makes  provisions  for  reclamation  costs,  it  cannot  be
assured  that  these  provisions  will  be  adequate  to  discharge  its  future  obligations  for  these  costs.
Failure to comply with applicable environmental and health and safety laws may result in injunctions,
damages,  suspension  or  revocation  of  permits  and  imposition  of  penalties.  While  the  health  and
safety of our people and responsible environmental stewardship are our top priorities, there can be no
assurance that First Majestic has been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws,
regulations  and  permits,  or  that  the  costs  of  complying  with  current  and  future  environmental  and
health and safety laws and permits will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s business,
results of operations or financial condition.
Claims and Legal Proceedings Risks
The Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters
that arise in the ordinary course of business activities. Many factors, both known and unknown, could
cause  actual  results,  performance  or  achievements  to  be  materially  different  from  the  results,
performance  or  achievements  that  are  or  may  be  expressed  or  implied  by  such  forward-looking
statements  or  information  and  the  Company  has  made  assumptions  and  estimates  based  on  or
related to many of these factors. Such factors include, without limitation: availability of time on court
calendars in Canada and elsewhere; the recognition of Canadian judgments under Mexican law; the
possibility  of  settlement  discussions;  the  risk  of  appeal  of  judgment;  and  the  insufficiency  of  the
defendant’s  assets  to  satisfy  the  judgment  amount.  Each  of  these  matters  is  subject  to  various
uncertainties  and  it  is  possible  that  some  of  these  matters  may  be  resolved  unfavourably  to  the
Company. First Majestic carries liability insurance coverage and establishes provisions for matters
that  are  probable  and  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  In  addition,  the  Company  may  be  involved  in
disputes  with  other  parties  in  the  future  which  may  result  in  a  significant  impact  on  our  financial
condition, cash flow and results of operations.
Although  the  Company  has  taken  steps  to  verify  ownership  and  legal  title  to  mineral  properties  in
which  it  has  an  interest,  according  to  the  usual  industry  standards  for  the  stage  of  mining,
development and exploration of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the Company’s
title. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers, and title may be affected by
undetected defects. However, management is not aware of any such agreements, transfers or defects.
First Majestic Silver Corp. 2016 Second Quarter Report

In  April  2013,  the  Company  received  a  positive  judgment  on  the  First  Silver  litigation  from  the
Supreme Court of British Columbia (the “Court”), which awarded the sum of $93.8 million in favour of
First Majestic against Hector Davila Santos (the “Defendant”). The Company received a sum of $14.1
million in June 2013 as partial payment of the judgment, leaving an unpaid amount of approximately
$62.2 million (CAD$81.5 million). As part of the ruling, the Court granted orders restricting any transfer
or encumbrance of the Bolaños Mine by the defendant and limiting mining at the Bolaños Mine. The
orders also require that the defendant to preserve net cash flow from the Bolaños Mine in a holding
account  and  periodically  provide  to  the  Company  certain  information  regarding  the  Bolaños  Mine.
However, there can be no guarantee that the remainder of the judgment amount will be collected and
it is likely that it will be necessary to take additional action in Mexico and/or elsewhere to recover the
balance. Therefore, as at June 30, 2016, the Company has not accrued any of the remaining $62.2
million (CAD$81.5 million) unpaid judgment in favour of the Company.
OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Share Repurchase Program
The Company has an ongoing share repurchase program to repurchase up to 5% of the Company’s
issued and outstanding shares. The normal course issuer bids will be carried through the facilities of
the Toronto Stock Exchange and alternative Canadian marketplaces. No shares were repurchased
during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At June 30, 2016, the Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements such as contingent
interest  in  assets  transferred  to  an  entity,  derivative  instruments  obligations  or  any  obligations  that
generate financing, liquidity, market or credit risk to the Company, other than contingent liabilities and
vendor liability and interest, as disclosed in this MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and
the related notes.
Related Party Disclosures
Amounts paid to related parties were incurred in the normal course of business and measured at the
exchange  amount,  which  is  the  amount  agreed  upon  by  the  transacting  parties  and  on  terms  and
conditions similar to non-related parties.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company has a $1.2 million (December 31, 2015 - $1.1 million) promissory
notes receivable from First Mining Finance Corp., a related party, which is repayable on demand with
an  interest  rate  of  9%  per  annum.  On  July  12,  2016,  the  Company  entered  into  a  debt  settlement
agreement with First Mining to settle the promissory notes receivable. Pursuant to the agreement, First
Mining  will  settle  $0.5  million  of  the  debt  through  issuance  of  820,440  of  its  common  shares  at  a
deemed price of CAD$0.80 per share. The remaining balance of $0.7 million will be paid in cash in
twelve equal monthly cash payments.
There  were  no  other  significant  transactions  with  related  parties  outside  of  the  ordinary  course  of
business during the period.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates
The  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  as  issued  by  IASB
requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about future events that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based
on  management’s  best  knowledge  of  the  amount,  events  or  actions,  actual  results  may  differ  from
these  estimates.  There  were  no  changes  in  critical  accounting  judgments  and  estimates  that  were
significantly  different  from  those  disclosed  in  the  Company’s  annual  MD&A  as  at  and  for  the  year
ended December 31, 2015.
Future Changes in Accounting Policies Not Yet Effective as at June 30, 2016
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("IFRS 15") which
supersedes  IAS  11  – Construction  Contracts,  IAS  18  – Revenue,  IFRIC  13  – Customer  Loyalty
Programmes,  IFRIC  15  – Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate,  IFRIC  18  – Transfers  of
Assets from Customers, and SIC 31 – Revenue – Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services.
IFRS 15 establishes a single five-step model framework for determining the nature, amount, timing
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. The standard is
currently  mandatory  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2018,  with  early  adoption
permitted.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  the  adoption  of  this  standard  on  its
consolidated financial statements.
Financial instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments ("IFRS 9") to replace
IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 provides a revised model for
recognition and measurement of financial instruments and a single, forward-looking “expected loss”
impairment model. IFRS 9 also includes a substantially reformed approach to hedge accounting. The
standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption
permitted.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  the  adoption  of  this  standard  on  its
consolidated financial statements.
Finance leases
In  January  2016,  the  IASB  published  a  new  accounting  standard,  IFRS  16  – Leases  ("IFRS  16")
which  supersedes  IAS  17  – Leases.  IFRS  16  specifies  how  to  recognize,  measure,  present  and
disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring the recognition of
assets and liabilities for all leases, unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset
has a low value. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019,
with early adoption permitted, if IFRS 16 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, has also been
applied.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  the  adoption  of  this  standard  on  its
consolidated financial statements.
First Majestic Silver Corp. 2016 Second Quarter Report

NON-GAAP MEASURES
The  Company  has  included  certain  non-GAAP  measures  including  “Cash  costs  per  ounce”,
“Production  cost  per  tonne”,  “All-in  sustaining  costs  per  ounce”,  “Average  realized  silver  price”,
“Adjusted  earnings  per  share”,  “Cash  flow  per  share”  and  "Working  capital”  to  supplement  its
consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with IFRS. The terms IFRS and
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are used interchangeably throughout this MD&A.
The Company believes that these measures, together with measures determined in accordance with
IFRS,  provide  investors  with  an  improved  ability  to  evaluate  the  underlying  performance  of  the
Company. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and
therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is
intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Cash Cost per Ounce, All-In Sustaining Cost per Ounce and Production Cost per Tonne
Cash  costs  per  ounce  and  total  production  cost  per  tonne  are  non-GAAP  measures  used  by  the
Company to manage and evaluate operating performance at each of the Company’s operating mining
units, and are widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance, but do not have
a standardized meaning and are disclosed in addition to IFRS measures.
All-In  Sustaining  Cost  (“AISC”)  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  and  was  calculated  based  on  guidance
provided  by  the  World  Gold  Council  (“WGC”)  in  June  2013.  WGC  is  not  a  regulatory  industry
organization  and  does  not  have  the  authority  to  develop  accounting  standards  for  disclosure
requirements.  Other  mining  companies  may  calculate  AISC  differently  as  a  result  of  differences  in
underlying  accounting  principles  and  policies  applied,  as  well  as  differences  in  definitions  of
sustaining versus development capital expenditures.
AISC is a more comprehensive measure than cash cost per ounce for the Company’s consolidated
operating  performance  by  providing  greater  visibility,  comparability  and  representation  of  the  total
costs associated with producing silver from its current operations.
The  Company  defines  sustaining  capital  expenditures  as,  “costs  incurred  to  sustain  and  maintain
existing assets at current productive capacity and constant planned levels of productive output without
resulting in an increase in the life of assets, future earnings, or improvements in recovery or grade.
Sustaining  capital  includes  costs  required  to  improve/enhance  assets  to  minimum  standards  for
reliability,  environmental  or  safety  requirements.  Sustaining  capital  expenditures  excludes  all
expenditures at the Company’s new projects and certain expenditures at current operations which are
deemed expansionary in nature.”
Consolidated AISC includes total production cash costs incurred at the Company’s mining operations,
which  forms  the  basis  of  the  Company’s  total  cash  costs.  Additionally,  the  Company  includes
sustaining  capital  expenditures,  corporate  general  and  administrative  expense,  exploration  and
evaluation  costs,  share-based  payments  and  reclamation  cost  accretion.  AISC  by  mine  does  not
include certain corporate and non-cash items such as general and administrative expense and share-
based payments. The Company believes that this measure represents the total sustainable costs of
producing silver from current operations, and provides the Company and other stakeholders of the
Company  with  additional  information  of  the  Company’s  operational  performance  and  ability  to
generate cash flows. As the measure seeks to reflect the full cost of silver production from current
operations,  new  project  capital  and  expansionary  capital  at  current  operations  are  not  included.
Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments, dividends and financing costs are also not
included.

Average Realized Silver Price per Ounce
Revenues are presented as the net sum of invoiced revenues related to delivered shipments of silver
doré  bars  and  concentrates,  including  associated  metal  by-products  of  gold,  lead  and  zinc  after
having deducted refining and smelting charges, and after elimination of intercompany shipments of
silver, silver being minted into coins, ingots and bullion products.
The following is an analysis of the gross revenues prior to refining and smelting charges, and shows
deducted smelting and refining charges to arrive at the net reportable revenue for the period per IFRS.
Gross  revenues  are  divided  into  payable  equivalent  silver  ounces  sold  to  calculate  the  average
realized price per ounce of silver equivalents sold.

Average  realized  price  per  ounce  of  silver  sold  in  each reporting  period  is  affected  by  mark-to-market  adjustments  and  final settlements  on
concentrate  shipments  in  prior  periods.  Concentrates  sold to  fourth-party  smelters  are  provisionally  priced  and  the  price  is  not settled  until  a
predetermined  future  date,  typically  one  month  after delivery  to  the  customer,  based  on  the  market  price  at  that  time.  The mark-to-market
adjustments do not apply to doré sales.
Adjusted Earnings per Share (“Adjusted EPS”)
The  Company  uses  the  financial  measure  “Adjusted  EPS”  to  supplement  information  in  its
consolidated financial statements. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures
prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRS,  the  Company  and  certain  investors  and  analysts  use  this
information to evaluate the Company’s performance. The Company excludes non-cash and unusual
items from net earnings to provide a measure which allows the Company and investors to evaluate
the  operating  results  of  the  underlying  core  operations.  The  presentation  of  Adjusted  EPS  is  not
meant to be a substitute for EPS presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be evaluated
in conjunction with such IFRS measure.

ADDITIONAL GAAP MEASURES
The  Company  uses  additional  financial  measures  which  should  be  evaluated  in  conjunction  with
IFRS. It is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following additional GAAP measures
are used:
Gross Margin
Gross  margin  represents  the  difference  between  revenues  and  cost  of  sales,  excluding  depletion,
depreciation  and  amortization.  Management  believes  that  this  presentation  provides  useful
information  to  investors  to  evaluate  the  Company’s  mine  operating  performance  prior  to  non-cash
depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization  in  order  to  assess  the  Company’s  ability  to  generate
operating cash flow.
Mine Operating Earnings
Mine operating earnings represents the difference between gross margin and depletion, depreciation
and amortization. Management believes that mine operating earnings provides useful information to
investors  because  mine  operating  earnings  excludes  expenses  not  directly  associated  with
commercial production.
Operating Cash Flows before Working Capital and Taxes
Operating  cash  flows  before  working  capital  and  taxes  represents  cash  flows  generated  from
operations before changes in working capital and income taxes paid. Management believes that this
measure allows investors to evaluate the Company’s pre-tax cash flows generated from operations
adjusted for fluctuations in non-cash working capital items due to timing issues and the Company’s
ability to service its debt.
The terms described above do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, therefore the
Company’s definitions may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The  Company’s  management,  with  the  participation  of  its  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer
(“CEO”)  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  (“CFO”),  has  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the results of that evaluation, the Company’s CEO
and  CFO  have  concluded  that,  as  of  June  30,  2016,  the  Company’s  disclosure  controls  and
procedures  were  effective  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  the  information  required  to  be
disclosed by the Company in reports it files is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the appropriate time periods and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the
CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The  Company’s  management,  with  the  participation  of  its  CEO  and  CFO,  is  responsible  for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined
in the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the Canadian Securities
Administrators.  The  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to
provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of
financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  IFRS  as  issued  by  the  IASB.  The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
maintaining records that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, the transactions and
dispositions of assets of the Company;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of
financial statements in accordance with IFRS;
provide reasonable assurance that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and the Company’s Directors; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements
because of inherent limitations. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the Company’s policies and procedures.
There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations of Controls and Procedures
The  Company’s  management,  including  the  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief
Financial  Officer,  believes  that  any  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  or  internal  control  over
financial  reporting,  no  matter  how  well  conceived  and  operated,  may  not  prevent  or  detect  all
misstatements because of inherent limitations. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs.  Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  in  all  control  systems,  they  cannot  provide  absolute
assurance  that  all  control  issues  and  instances  of  fraud,  if  any,  within  the  Company  have  been
prevented  or  detected.  These  inherent  limitations  include  the  realities  that  judgments  in  decision-
making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally,
controls  can  be  circumvented  by  the  individual  acts  of  some  persons,  by  collusion  of  two  or  more
people, or by unauthorized override of the control. The design of any control system also is based in
part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that  any  design  will  succeed  in  achieving  its  stated  goals  under  all  potential  future  conditions.
Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS
Cautionary Note regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain  information  contained  herein  this  MD&A  constitutes  forward-looking  statements.  Forward-
looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as “plan”, “expect”, “forecast”, “project”,
”intend”, ”believe”, ”anticipate”, “outlook” and other similar words, or statements that certain events or
conditions “may” or “will” occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates
of  management  at  the  dates  the  statements  are  made,  and  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  risks  and
uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those
projected  in  the  forward-looking  statements.  These  factors  include,  without  limitation:  the  inherent
risks  involved  in  the  mining,  exploration  and  development  of  mineral  properties,  the  uncertainties
involved  in  interpreting  drilling  results  and  other  geological  data,  fluctuating  metal  prices,  the
possibility  of  project  delays  or  cost  overruns  or  unanticipated  excessive  operating  costs  and
expenses, uncertainties related to the necessity of financing, the availability of and costs of financing
needed in the future, and other factors described in the Company’s Annual Information Form under
the  heading  “Risk  Factors”.  The  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to  update  forward-looking
statements  if  circumstances  or  management’s  estimates  or  opinions  should  change  other  than  as
required by securities laws. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements.
Cautionary Note regarding Reserves and Resources
Mineral reserves and mineral resources are determined in accordance with National Instrument 43-
101 (“NI 43-101”), issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators. This National Instrument lays out
the standards of disclosure for mineral projects including rules relating to the determination of mineral
reserves and mineral resources. This includes a requirement that a certified Qualified Person (“QP”)
(as  defined  under  the  NI  43-101)  supervises  the  preparation  of  the  mineral  reserves  and  mineral
resources. Ramon Mendoza, P. Eng., Vice President of Technical Services and Jesus Velador, Ph.D.,
Director of Exploration, are certified QPs for the Company. Ramon Mendoza has reviewed this MD&A
for QP technical disclosures. All NI 43-101 technical reports can be found on the Company’s website
at www.firstmajestic.com or on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Cautionary  Note  to  United  States  Investors  Concerning  Estimates  of  Mineral  Reserves  and
Resources
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis has been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure
requirements of United States securities laws. The terms “mineral reserve”, “proven mineral reserve”
and “probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with Canadian
NI  43-101  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects  and  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,
Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) - CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral
Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended. These definitions differ from the definitions in
the  disclosure  requirements  promulgated  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the
“Commission”)  and  contained  in  Industry  Guide  7  (“Industry  Guide  7”).  Under  Industry  Guide  7
standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report mineral reserves, the three-year
historical  average  price  is  used  in  any  mineral  reserve  or  cash  flow  analysis  to  designate  mineral
reserves  and  the  primary  environmental  analysis  or  report  must  be  filed  with  the  appropriate
governmental authority.
In addition, the terms “mineral resource”, “measured mineral resource”, “indicated mineral resource”
and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101. However,
these terms are not defined terms under Industry Guide 7 and are not permitted to be used in reports
and  registration  statements  of  United  States  companies  filed  with  the  Commission.  Investors  are
cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be
converted into mineral reserves. “Inferred mineral resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to
their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed
that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under
Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-
feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an
inferred  mineral  resource  exists  or  is  economically  or  legally  mineable.  Disclosure  of  “contained
ounces”  in  a  mineral  resource  is  permitted  disclosure  under  Canadian  regulations.  In  contrast,  the
Commission only permits U.S. companies to report mineralization that does not constitute “mineral
reserves”  by  Commission  standards  as  in  place  tonnage  and  grade  without  reference  to  unit
measures.
Accordingly,  information  contained  in  this  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  may  not  be
comparable  to  similar  information  made  public  by  U.S.  companies  subject  to  the  reporting  and
disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations
of the Commission thereunder.
