<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
visited Senegal from 17 to 24 August 2009 at the invitation of the Government. He is 
grateful to the Government, in particular the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Permanent 
Mission of Senegal in Geneva, for the support provided in the organization and conduct of 
his visit. The Special Rapporteur was able to experience <i>teranga</i>, the traditional hospitality 
for which Senegal is known.  
</p>
<p>2. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Ministers of: Justice; Interior; 
Local Communities and Decentralization; Defense; and Senegalese Abroad and senior 
officials from these Ministries, as well as with senior officials from the Ministries of: 
Foreign Affairs; Economy and Finance; Public Function, Labour, Employment and 
Professional Organizations; and Family, Food Security, Women Entrepreneurs, Micro-
Finance and Children. He also met officials from the National Agency for Statistics and 
Demography, and spoke with representatives of the National Assembly. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to express his sincere thanks to the Ministers and other officials for 
the frank and constructive discussions that were held.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also held a number of consultations with the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator and the United Nations country team as well as with representatives 
of a wide range of civil society organizations. The Special Rapporteur wishes to expresses 
his gratitude to the Resident Coordinator, the United Nations agencies and, in particular, the 
West Africa Regional Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
for their cooperation and assistance prior to, during and after the visit. He is also grateful 
for the time that representatives of the civil society dedicated to him during this visit and 
for the information they provided.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur conducted field trips to Saint-Louis and Mbour, where he 
held discussions with representatives of local authorities and civil society organizations. 
During these trips the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to gather information directly 
from migrants, including returnees. He is most grateful for their willingness to share with 
him their stories of suffering and despair.  
</p>
<p>5. The focus of this visit was out-migration, as the request of the Special Rapporteur to 
visit Senegal emanated from the unprecedented arrival, throughout 2006, of over 30,000 
migrants to the Canary Islands aboard small boats. This peak coincided with the emergence 
of a new, remarkably long route from West African shores, including Senegalese ones. The 
characteristic vessel used by the migrants was the traditional West African pirogue, a long, 
colourful wooden fishing boat adapted to the needs and difficulties of the new route. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to pay tribute to those migrants who have perished at 
sea while attempting to reach far-off destinations and whose number is and will remain 
unknown. He notes that the harrowing journey evokes that of individuals who were forced 
to embark from the island of Gor&#233; during the period of slavery. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background: the migration phenomenon 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Movement of persons in and out of Senegal 
</b></p>
<p>7. The geostrategic position of Senegal, where sea, land and air routes towards the 
European and American continents converge, has made it a country of origin, transit and 
destination with regard to migratory flows from the West African region and beyond.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>8. Many immigrants to Senegal have come from neighbouring countries such as Cape 
Verde, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Mauritania. There are also a number 
of immigrants from other countries within the subregion, including Benin, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
Ghana, Nigeria and Togo. Fewer groups come from Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Gabon and 
Morocco. Non-African residents to Senegal mainly include long-settled French and 
Lebanese immigrants, and those newly arrived from China. In the Second Senegalese 
Household Survey of 2002, the number of immigrants in Senegal was estimated at 126,054, 
representing 1.5 per cent of the total population. Among the 86,688 immigrants of working 
age, an estimated 55.9 per cent were employed professionally and 11.2 per cent were 
looking for jobs. 
</p>
<p>9. The country also hosts a number of children who have migrated alone or with family 
members or other adults, mostly from neighbouring countries. Some of these children are 
forced to beg, either by the religious teachers entrusted with their care or out of necessity. A 
2007 study undertaken by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Bank1 found that the phenomenon of children 
begging in the streets had acquired alarming dimensions in the region of Dakar in 
particular, where it is estimated that 6,840 <i>talib&#233; </i>(defined in the study as those children who 
reported having spent the night preceding the survey in a religious school (<i>daara</i>) and who 
reported receiving religious education) are begging. According to the study, child beggars 
are overwhelmingly boys, and 90 per cent are <i>talib&#233;s. </i>Almost half of these children come 
from abroad, usually from neighbouring countries such as the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-
Bissau and Mali. <i>Talib&#233;s</i> are often children from Guinea-Bissau (30 per cent) whereas 
many non-<i>talib&#233;s</i> come from Mali (30 per cent). Most of these children have left their 
families and communities because they have been entrusted by their parents to religious 
teachers to receive a religious education.  
</p>
<p>10. A total of 98 per cent of the <i>talib&#233;</i> children report that their religious teachers send 
them begging, whereas 62 per cent of non-<i>talib&#233; </i>children are compelled to beg as a means 
to satisfy their needs and those of their families. The income that <i>talib&#233; </i>children obtain 
from begging is in part utilized to satisfy their needs but most is handed over to their 
religious teachers. Law enforcement officials informed the Special Rapporteur that 
detecting these children as they cross the border into Senegal is difficult as such children 
usually travel with their parents or authorized adults who, as ECOWAS nationals, do not 
require a visa to circulate within the region. 
</p>
<p>11. Senegal is one of the major transit countries of the migration stream from West 
Africa to Europe.<b> </b>Points of departure include coastal cities throughout the country, 
including not only the northern city of Saint-Louis, but also Dakar and Mbour. The islands 
of Djogu&#233; and Karabane appear also to be major departure areas according to the 
Senegalese gendarmerie. The main aim of most of the African migrants is to reach 
European soil, be it mainland Europe, the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla or islands 
in the Atlantic Ocean or the Mediterranean Sea. 
</p>
<p>12. The land route is believed to be used by the poorest migrants who cannot afford the 
fees for the journey to Europe by pirogue. The land route goes to Mali and through the 
Maghreb (Gao in Mali and Agadez in Niger are believed to be the main migrant hubs along 
this route). Many migrants never leave Africa and end up working, usually irregularly, in 
the Maghreb region where they may continue to be at risk of human rights violations.

</b></p>
<p>13. Senegal hosts a number of stranded migrants, including rejected asylum-seekers and 
refugees for whom refugee status has ceased to apply, mostly from West Africa. Such 
migrants may face particular vulnerabilities as a result of being caught in transit without 
any means to travel to their destination or back to their country of origin.  
</p>
<p>14. The first Senegalese reaching Europe through organized migration frameworks 
joined the French colonial army. After leaving the army, many ex-soldiers found 
employment at Marseille harbour, which became a centre for the Senegalese community in 
Europe. Given its position as the former colonial power of Senegal, France long remained 
the most important country of destination in Europe for Senegalese migrants, who were 
involved in particular in trade between Europe and Africa. Now Senegalese migrants are 
found in a number of European countries, including Italy and Spain, as well as in other 
regions. 
</p>
<p>15. In 2004 the Ministry of Senegalese Abroad estimated that there were 648,600 
Senegalese emigrants (stock) representing 4.48 per cent of the population. According to the 
Second Senegalese Household Survey, 54 per cent of the Senegalese who emigrated 
between 1999 and 2004 went either to Europe (46 per cent) or to the United States of 
America (8 per cent), whereas 44 per cent went to other countries in Africa, either within 
the ECOWAS area or elsewhere. The preference of European Union countries as a 
migration destination was first observed in the 1990s, and there seems to have been no 
change in the trend. It was estimated that neighbouring countries, such as the Gambia, Mali 
and Mauritania, hosted approximately 40 per cent of Senegalese migrants. According to the 
same survey, women accounted for 16 per cent of the migrant population from Senegal 
between 1992 and 1997. Upon departure they were on average younger than men.2 In 
addition 45.9 per cent of the emigrants who left between 1997 and 2002 were working 
before their departure and 29 per cent were looking for jobs.  
</p>
<p>16. One of the elements of the European Union strategy to secure external borders was 
the creation of a body - the European Agency for the Management of Operational 
Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) 
- that aims to coordinate and enhance border security by ensuring the coordination of 
Member States&#8217; operational cooperation<b>.</b> In 2008 Frontex collated and analysed information 
from European Union States related to the detection of irregular border crossings at the 
external sea and land borders of the European Union. Frontex indicated that Spain reported 
the detection of 16,200 irregular border crossings at its sea borders. Compared with 2007, 
the number of irregular arrivals in the Canary Islands had decreased to 9,200 (down 26 per 
cent).3 The Government of Spain reported that in 2008 irregular border crossing at the 
Canary Islands had decreased by 25 per cent compared to the 2007 figures. During the first 
six months of 2008, 1,600 migrants arrived, compared to 4,114 during the same period the 
previous year.4 In April and May of 2009 no irregular border crossings were reported in the 
Canary Islands.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Remittances 
</b></p>
<p>17. A comprehensive evaluation of the amount of remittances from migrants is still 
difficult, given that the vast majority of such remittances reach Senegal through unofficial

</p>
<p>channels. However, the Government has estimated that remittances amounted to 
approximately 242 billion FCFA (7 per cent of the gross domestic product), representing an 
important source of income for the<b> </b>country and providing people with a strong incentive to 
migrate.5  
</p>
<p>18. It is estimated that remittances transferred through official channels represent 
between 40 and 50 per cent of the overall Senegalese remittances. Wire transfers of money 
represent the most commonly used means of transfer. In 2006 it was reported that Senegal 
had more than 500 wire-transfer points (banks, post offices and others).  
</p>
<p>19. An estimated 75 per cent of the remittances transferred to Senegal contributes to the 
satisfaction of daily consumption needs of families left behind, which is an essential 
element for the protection of their right to an adequate standard of living. About 10 per cent 
of remittances is deposited in local banks as part of savings. The rest is reportedly devoted 
to two types of investment: housing and trade. Concerning housing, remittances may be put 
towards purchasing land, family houses or houses to prepare the migrant&#8217;s return or to rent 
out (particularly in the capital). Investments in the trade sector are reportedly rare and 
concentrated in the transport sector (taxis, coaches), the import of second-hand vehicles or 
parts, and in agriculture.  
</p>
<p>20. One of the main conclusions of a national study on remittances conducted in 
2007/08 indicated that remittances from migrants contribute to reducing by approximately 
31 per cent the prevalence of households living below the poverty line.6. Senegalese 
migrants in many countries of destination have been able to establish community groups 
through which they maintain contacts with their villages and communities of origin. Some 
of these groups have also been able to invest in community projects such as schools, health 
centres and mosques in their villages of origin. In order to facilitate this type of investment 
and to overcome obstacles linked to administrative hurdles and a generally deficient 
institutional environment for business, the Government adopted a law on decentralization 
and economic policies to provide local authorities with the necessary flexibility to establish 
direct partnerships with the countries of destination within the framework of the 
international obligations assumed centrally by the State. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Refugees and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>21. The number of refugees and asylum-seekers in Senegal has been constant since 
</p><p>2001. In 1999 there were 21,539 refugees; in 2007, 20,421 according to 2008 estimates by 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.7 About 95 per cent of 
the refugees/asylum-seekers are from Mauritania. Between 2000 and 2007 there were 
approximately 4,042 asylum applications, mainly from nationals of Sierra Leone, C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, Liberia and Mauritania. 
</p>
<p>22. An estimated 20,000 Mauritanian refugees continue to live in northern Senegal, 
spread among 283 sites, 16 years after being expelled from their home country. The exact 
number of Mauritanian refugees is still not known, as the registration exercise, which began 
in December 1999, was abandoned in 2000. This has left the majority of these refugees in a 
precarious situation as they do not have proper identification papers, except for the &#8220;Green 
Card&#8221; which was issued upon their arrival in 1989 and which expired three months

<p>afterwards. This state of affairs has had a negative impact on the enjoyment of the refugees&#8217; 
human rights, including the right of refugee children to education, as well as on access to 
benefits and freedom of movement.  
</p>
<p>23. Many of the Mauritanian refugees managed to integrate with the local population, 
but the quality and security of their lives remain precarious. Although the Government of 
Senegal has provided these refugees with certain services, such as medical facilities, as well 
as with teachers and books, unemployment among them remains high and the income 
generating projects, inadequate.8  
</p>
<p>24. A number of Mauritanian refugees are believed to have returned spontaneously, 
whereas the last organized voluntary repatriation ended in December 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Smuggling of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>25. The smuggling of migrants through Senegal seems to be organized mainly by 
nationals from English-speaking countries in Western Africa, such as Ghana, Liberia and 
Nigeria, many of whom have lived in Senegal for a long time. Senegalese nationals, 
referred to as <i>sergents-recruteurs</i>, support them. In a smuggling network, everybody has his 
or her own<b> </b>separate tasks.9<b>  
</b></p>
<p>26. In a typical case of smuggling via maritime routes, an old trawler is bought. 
Migrants are not only from Senegal - many West Africans arrive in Dakar by plane,<b> </b>after 
which they try to board a boat to Europe.<b> </b>After the payment of a fee, the candidate migrants 
are escorted to beaches in and around Dakar.<b> </b>From the beach fishermen take them by 
pirogues to the trawler at sea. In the process of trying to reach their destinations, migrants 
spend the equivalent of hundreds<b> </b>of United States dollars on bribes, smugglers, 
transportation, and daily necessities. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime quoted 
prices of US$ 480 to US$ 1,930 for<b> </b>a Senegal-Canary Island crossing.10 Migrant smuggling 
routes in Africa are also being used by international criminal networks involved in the 
smuggling of undocumented migrants from other regions, particularly East, South,<b> </b>and 
Southwest Asia. Undocumented migrants from Bangladesh, China, India, and Pakistan 
have been<b> </b>found stranded in West or North Africa. Taking advantage of the relative ease of 
securing visas to<b> </b>West African countries, migrants normally enter such countries legally by 
air.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>27. According to ILO, every year between approximately 200,000 and 300,000 children 
fall victim to trafficking for sexual or labour exploitation in West Africa. The organization 
also estimates that 41 per cent of children in West Africa work.  
</p>
<p>28. Senegal is a source, transit, and destination country for children and women 
trafficked for the purpose of forced labour and commercial sexual exploitation. Women and 
girls are reportedly trafficked for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, including for

countries, the Middle East, and Europe for domestic servitude and possibly for sexual 
exploitation. Women and girls from other West African countries, particularly Ghana, 
Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone may be trafficked to Senegal for sexual exploitation, 
including for sex tourism. Children are trafficked to Senegal from neighbouring countries 
for forced begging, whereas Senegalese children are trafficked mainly to other African 
countries for forced labour in gold mines. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework for the protection of 
the rights of migrants in Senegal 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The international and regional legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International level 
</b></p>
<p>29. Senegal has ratified all core human rights instruments, except the Second Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition 
of the death penalty. At the time of writing, it had signed, but not yet ratified, the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol.  
</p>
<p>30. Senegal has also ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur was 
encouraged to learn during his visit that the governmental report to the Committee on 
Migrant Workers, which had been long overdue, was being finalized in accordance with, 
inter alia, the recommendation addressed to and supported by Senegal within the universal 
periodic review the State underwent in 2008.11<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note 
that the report was submitted to the Committee in December 2009. 
</p>
<p>31. In addition Senegal has ratified the main ILO instruments on labour rights, including 
the Convention concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour, 1930 (No. 29), the Convention 
concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize, 1948 (No. 87), 
the Convention concerning the Application of the Right to Organize and to Bargain 
Collectively, 1949 (No. 98), and the Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate 
Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, 1999 (No. 182). Senegal 
has yet to ratify the Convention concerning Migration for Employment, 1949 (No. 97) and 
the Convention concerning Migrant Workers in Abusive Conditions and the Promotion of 
Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers, 1975 (No. 143), but 
discussions have started towards their ratification.  
</p>
<p>32. By virtue of Act No. 17 (2003), Senegal ratified the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols: the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and the Protocol 
against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. 
</p>
<p>33. Senegal is party to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) and its 
1967 Protocol. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>34. At the regional level, Senegal is party to the African human rights instruments, 
including the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and its Protocol on the Rights

</b></p>
<p>of Women, as well as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Senegal 
is also a member of the Conf&#233;rence Interafricaine de la Pr&#233;voyance Sociale (Inter-African 
Conference on Social Security), established in 1993. In the light of the subregional 
integration processes on free circulation of persons, the Conference aims to, inter alia, 
create a supranational framework to collectively address issues related to harmonizing 
social security legislations and systems and strengthening specialized training in this field. 
Senegal is party to the OUA Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee 
Problems in Africa.  
</p>
<p>35. At the subregional level, Senegal is party to the Treaty of the Economic Community 
of West African States (ECOWAS) which was adopted on 28 May 1975. Article 1 of this 
Treaty states that &#8220;subject to the provisions governing police regulations and public safety, 
as well as prescriptions of the sanitary rules, nationals of Member States are free to enter 
the territory of any of the Members, to travel, to stay and to leave by simply showing a 
valid national passport with no other formality, such as obtaining an entry or exit visa&#8221;. In 
January 1993 the member States adopted a revised version of this Treaty, stipulating that 
the establishment of a common market implies, inter alia, &#8220;the removal, between Member 
States, of obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital and to the 
right of residence and establishment&#8221;. In order to guarantee the implementation of the 
relevant articles on migration, a number of protocols, decisions, directives and resolutions 
have also been adopted by ECOWAS member States. Of relevance are, for example, the 
protocol relating to the free movement of persons and goods, the right of residence and 
establishment, and a protocol which includes a code of conduct for citizenship in the 
Community. 
</p>
<p>36. Senegal is also member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which 
was established by virtue of a treaty (1994). Article 91 of the treaty stipulates that &#8220;subject 
to limitations justified by reasons pertaining to public order or public safety, nationals of 
Member States are entitled to freedom of movement and residence throughout the territory 
of the Union&#8221;. Article 92 of the treaty provides for the right to establishment throughout the 
Union, which includes the right to exercise non-salaried activities and to establish and 
manage companies under the conditions defined by domestic legislation.   
</p>
<p><b> B. The national legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>37. Human rights are central to the Constitution and legal system of Senegal. Article 7 
of the Constitution stipulates that: &#8220;the human person is a sacred and inviolable legal entity, 
and the State has an obligation to defend and protect this inviolability&#8221;.12 Moreover, article 
98 stipulates that the international treaties ratified by the State acquire an authority superior 
to that of ordinary laws.  
</p>
<p>38. Article 14 of the Constitution of Senegal recognizes the right to freedom of 
movement and residence within the country and allows any citizen to move about freely, 
both within and outside the national territory and to reside in Senegal or abroad, according 
to the conditions established by law. In this regard, emigration legislation imposes no 
restrictions on Senegalese citizens entering or leaving the country.  
</p>
<p>39. The right to asylum is governed by Law 68-27 (1968) whereby &#8220;no individual who 
enjoys the status of refugee in Senegal shall be deported, except for reasons of national 
security, if she/he carries out activities contrary to the public order or is condemned to a 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>custodial sentence for a crime or a serious offence&#8221; (art. 4). Refugee status is granted by the 
National Eligibility Commission. Refugees have the same entitlements as nationals, 
including the right to work and education.  
</p>
<p>40. The main texts dealing with migration issues are: Law No. 61-10 (1961) related to 
Senegalese nationality (amended by Law No. 89-42 (1989)), and Law No. 71-10 (1971) 
and Decree No. 71-860 (1971) concerning the conditions of admission, stay and settlement 
of aliens. This legislation defines as foreign any person who does not hold Senegalese 
nationality, whether or not they have some other nationality. Article 4 of Law 71-10 also 
defines immigration as foreigners travelling to Senegal with the intent of establishing their 
residence there or of engaging in gainful activity or professional employment on a 
permanent basis.  
</p>
<p>41. A foreigner must obtain an establishment permit prior to entering the country; 
exceptionally such a permit may be granted to foreigners holding temporary residence 
permits. Establishment permits may also be issued to the immigrant&#8217;s spouse, ascendants, 
and minor and unmarried descendants living as dependants under the same roof. 
Withdrawal of the permit implies automatic cancellation of the employment contract. 
Public authorities may grant Senegalese nationality to those foreigners who apply for it and 
who fulfil the requirements set by law, including continuous residence of 10 years (5 years 
for foreigners married to Senegalese nationals). However, children born in Senegal to 
parents who are foreign nationals seem to have difficulty gaining access to Senegalese 
nationality, mainly due to the cumbersome and lengthy administrative procedure.  
</p>
<p>42. Foreigners who fail to comply with Senegalese legislation concerning entry, 
temporary residence and exit may be sanctioned by the withdrawal of the temporary 
residence or establishment permit, for example, if the conditions under which the permit 
was granted no longer exist, if essential facts were omitted or concealed or if changes of 
residence or employment were not reported. Foreigners may also be expelled if condemned 
for crimes or offences, if they engage in conduct or actions that lead to the conclusion that 
they will not adapt to the established order, if they are involved in serious and patent cases 
of interference in the internal affairs of Senegal or if they can no longer maintain 
themselves or their families. The Ministry of Interior rules on the expulsion of foreigners, 
who can appeal the decision on the grounds of a perceived abuse of power to the State 
Council. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention during its visit to Senegal (5-15 
September 2009) found that administrative detention in police stations of foreigners who 
had served their criminal sentence in full and are awaiting deportation may be prolonged 
indefinitely due to administrative and logistical problems associated with their deportation 
(A/HRC/13/30/Add.3, para. 68).  
</p>
<p>43. Law No. 2005-02 (2005) deals with combating trafficking in persons and related 
practices and the protection of victims. It prohibits trafficking in persons and other forms of 
exploitation of vulnerable groups, prescribing penalties of 5 to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment for 
all forms of trafficking. This law also criminalizes organized clandestine migration via 
land, air and sea, whether the territory is used as a zone of origin, transit or destination. 
Article 3 of Law No. 2005-02 also makes it a crime to compel a person to beg, an act which 
may be punished with imprisonment of between two and five years and a fine of between 
500,000 and 2 million CFA.13 
</p>
<p>  
 13 Article 245 of the Penal Code (recalling Law No. 75-77 of 9 July 1975) already stipulated that anyone 
</p>
<p>who allows begging by minors (under the age of 21) in their custody shall be punished with three to 
six months&#8217; imprisonment. In addition, Decree No. 3749 prohibits the worst forms of child labour, 
including children begging on behalf of a third party.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>44. Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees the right to work and the Labour Code 
derived from Law No. 97-17 (1997), which revised the previous Code (Law 61-34 (1961)), 
accords the status of worker to any individual regardless of nationality as long as (a) he/she 
engages in a professional activity in exchange for remuneration and (b) he/she is placed 
under the direction and authority of another person considered the employer. The Labour 
Code also introduces an approval visa in relation to labour contracts for any migrant 
worker. If foreigners lose their jobs they do not automatically lose their residence permits; 
rather, upon renewal they must submit proof of their means of subsistence.  
</p>
<p>45. Although the current Labour Code includes more provisions relating to expatriates, 
the particular conditions pertaining to this category of workers are established by the will of 
the parties and are therefore of contractual nature. The Code allows companies to proceed 
to direct hiring of workers and the creation of placement offices acting as correspondents of 
the employment service, thus eliminating the former de facto monopoly of the Labour 
Service. According to the Code, a limit may be imposed on the number of foreign workers 
in a given company and only a certain percentage of foreign workers may be hired, 
depending on the professional category or industrial sector. Foreigners may be excluded 
from certain professions such as in the civil service or the judiciary, as well as from certain 
gainful activities such as working as a notary, among others. In addition, article L.105 of 
the Code provides that under equal working conditions, professional qualifications and 
productivity, pay shall be equal for all workers regardless of origin, gender, age or legal 
status. Migrant workers are entitled to family reunification, housing, paid annual leave and 
exceptional home leave. They also enjoy the same union rights and union protection as 
nationals (outlined in art. L.5). Foreign workers may obtain access to management positions 
in a union after five years of residence in the country and if their country of origin extends 
the same rights to Senegalese workers.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Institutional structure 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Senegalese Committee for Human Rights was established on 22 April 1970 by 
Decree No. 70-453. In 1997, the legal foundation was strengthened through the adoption of 
Law 97-04 (1997), enabling the Committee to become an &#8220;independent institution of 
consultation, observation, evaluation, dialogue and submission of proposals, focused on 
respect for human rights&#8221; (art. 1).  
</p>
<p>47. The Committee may issue opinions or recommendations on all matters related to 
human rights, in particular on the amending of laws, regulations and administrative 
practices in force concerning human rights. It can also bring to the attention of the public 
authorities cases of human rights violations and propose, if necessary, measures which 
could put an end to such violations. The Committee is made up of 29 members drawn from 
civil society, the National Assembly, the supreme jurisdictions, the bar association, 
academic institutions, and trade unions. In 2000, the Committee was accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; 
status (signifying that it is in conformity with the Paris Principles) by the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights. At the regional level the Senegalese Committee for Human Rights is 
affiliated with the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. On the 
governmental side, in June 2004 a High Commissioner for Human Rights and Peace-
building with the rank of Minister was appointed.  
</p>
<p>48. In 2003 the Government created a Ministry for Senegalese Abroad, with a view to 
coordinating all actions aimed at promoting and protecting Senegalese settled abroad as 
well as their families who are left behind in Senegal. In 2006 this Ministry adopted a policy 
with four main objectives, namely: (a) to ensure good management of the migratory fluxes; 
(b) to guarantee health, social and legal protection to Senegalese abroad; (c) to promote the 
economic role of Senegalese abroad; and (d) to strengthen the institutional structure of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>support for Senegalese abroad. The Office of the President also established a committee to 
assist Senegalese refugees/asylum-seekers who are repatriated. 
</p>
<p>49. Originally, all migration-related matters were managed by the Ministry of Labour. 
Now the focal point for migration issues is the Ministry of Youth and Youth Employment. 
Representatives of this Ministry chair the Commission Nationale de Gestion et de Suivi des 
Offres d&#8217;Emploi (National Commission of Management and Follow-up to Employment 
Offers)<i>,</i> which was created in 2008 within a framework of agreements signed by Senegal 
and some of its partners, such as Spain, aimed at promoting regular migration. The 
Commission is composed of representatives of the various Ministries concerned, such as 
the Ministries of Foreign Affairs; Interior; Senegalese Abroad; Public Service, 
Employment, Labour and Professional Organizations; and of Technical Education and 
Vocational Training. The Commission is tasked, inter alia, (a) to centralize and disseminate 
employment offers abroad, monitor and ensure the protection of the rights of migrant 
workers, (b) to supervise the management of the preselection and selection procedures, (c) 
to put in place measures to train, inform and sensitize migrant workers prior to their 
departures, (d) to monitor the execution of labour contracts and follow up on the migrant 
workers&#8217; return to Senegal, (e) to adopt measures to fight brain drain and (f) to ensure 
coordination among the different Ministries involved in aspects of migration.  
</p>
<p>50. The Caisse de S&#233;curit&#233; Sociale (Social Security Fund) was created in 1956. The 
Fund is tasked with managing and disbursing family benefits and benefits concerning work-
related accidents and illnesses.  
</p>
<p>51. With regard to human trafficking, since December 2009 the Government has been 
examining the proposal of the Prime Minister to establish a committee to fight the 
trafficking and exploitation of women and children that would become the main 
governmental body in charge of coordinating all actions in this field. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Bilateral agreements 
</b></p>
<p>52. The 2006 France-Senegal agreement related to the concerted management of 
migration flows (amended on 25 February 2008) was the first bilateral agreement signed by 
France on this subject. The agreement covers the circulation of persons (visas, transit, 
exchange of information), stay permits (for students, as well as for workers and members of 
their families), the patrolling of borders and the return of migrants in irregular situations, 
the participation of migrants in the development of their country of origin, and development 
cooperation in, for example, the health and agricultural/fisheries sectors.  
</p>
<p>53. Senegal and France are also linked by an agreement on social security that was made 
in 1960, renegotiated in 1974 and incorporated in Law 75-33 (1975). A fiscal agreement is 
also in force between the two countries, aimed at avoiding double taxation on revenues.  
</p>
<p>54. In 2000 Senegal and France also entered into an agreement on co-development, with 
a view to supporting Senegalese settled in France who wish to reintegrate upon their return. 
The agreement includes four main dimensions, namely, support for the economic initiatives 
of migrants in Senegal, mobilization of the highly qualified diaspora, decentralized 
development in the areas of origin and the establishment of a Priority Solidarity Fund. The 
related initiatives are implemented through the Programme d&#8217;Appui aux Initiatives de 
Solidarit&#233; pour le Developpement (2009-2011) (Programme to Support Solidarity for 
Development Initiatives), which has a budget of 9 million euros (see chapter IV, section D 
below).  
</p>
<p>55. Bilateral relations between Spain and Senegal in the field of migration are regulated 
by the Framework Agreement on Development Cooperation, which was signed on 10 
October 2006 and which entered into force on 24 June 2008. This Framework Agreement </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>includes a number of joint declarations on the management of migratory flux between these 
two countries. The Spanish Ministry of Labour cooperates with the Senegalese Ministry of 
Labour on recruiting labour migrants, in exchange for help in preventing unauthorized 
departures.14 An agreement signed in November 2007 in the context of the Framework 
Agreement provided for, among other things, the recruitment of 2,000 Senegalese fishers 
over a period of two years and included pre-departure recruitment and training. It is 
reported that since 2007, more than 1,500 Senegalese went to Spain to work in the fishery, 
agriculture and cleaning sectors under the auspices of this Agreement. Successful 
applicants, generally women, were given temporary contracts - most were for seasonal 
work in the agriculture sector, lasting four months. The workers were also required to 
return to Senegal upon expiry of the contract.15 In addition, 2,000 Senegalese fishermen 
would be trained and recruited by Spanish fishing enterprises. By April 2009 more than 
4,000 applications for these openings had been received, out of which 660 candidates were 
selected for training.16  
</p>
<p>56. An agreement on the repatriation of unaccompanied Senegalese minors arriving in 
Spain irregularly, signed by the Governments of Spain and Senegal on 5 December 2006, 
came into force on 18 July 2008. The agreement is aimed at (a) strengthening cooperation 
through a framework to prevent the emigration of, as well as to protect and repatriate, 
unaccompanied minors, (b) establishing a permanent dialogue and exchanging data and 
information to tackle these issues efficiently, and (c) promoting the re-insertion of the 
children.17 The Special Rapporteur was informed that, at the time of his visit to Senegal, 
there were around 500 unaccompanied minors in Spain, of which 11 had been verified as 
Senegalese.  
</p>
<p>57. Senegal also signed an agreement with Gabon on the mobility of Senegalese 
teachers, as well as a technical cooperation agreement with Djibouti concerning the 
recruitment of 40 Senegalese managers to strengthen the education and training system in 
the context of South-South cooperation. Senegal has social security agreements with Mali 
and Mauritania, as well as agreements with Mali and Guinea-Bissau on the return of child 
victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>58. In terms of bilateral cooperation among non-governmental organizations, the 
National Confederation of Senegalese Workers entered into a partnership for the 
management of migratory fluxes with one of the main trade union federations in Italy, the 
Italian Confederation of Workers&#8217; Trade Unions (CISL).

</p>
<p><b> IV. Major challenges in the protection of the human rights of 
migrants in Senegal 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Socio-economic challenges 
</b></p>
<p>59. One of the major challenges is to provide urban and rural youth, who represent the 
majority of those attempting the perilous voyage across the ocean, with employment 
opportunities and just and favourable conditions of work.18 In 2002 the permanent 
unemployment rate (measuring the population aged between 15 and 64 who had not worked 
continuously during the preceding 12 months and who were looking or waiting for jobs) 
was estimated at 13 per cent, whereas the rate of the active population without a job was 
estimated at between 40 and 50 per cent. Permanent unemployment affected those below 
the age of 35 in particular, among whom the rate reaches 30 per cent according to 2007 
estimates of the World Bank.19 According to the organization, every year in Senegal about 
16,000 direct or indirect jobs are created through various programmes and initiatives. This, 
however, manages to engage only 5 per cent of those who are unemployed or who declare 
themselves as underemployed.  
</p>
<p>60. The Second Senegalese Household Survey showed that in 2001/02 approximately 
57.1 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line. The prevalence of poverty was 
reportedly higher in rural areas, where 65.2 per cent of the population and 57.5 per cent of 
households lived below the poverty line.  
</p>
<p>61. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its concluding 
observations on Senegal in 2001 expressed concern that 30 per cent of the Senegalese were 
living in absolute poverty, that 70 per cent of the poor came from the countryside and were 
women, and that poverty was on the increase (E/C.12/1/Add.62, para. 29). It also expressed 
concern about the high unemployment rate especially among the young people living in 
Dakar (para. 18) and that the minimum wage was not sufficient to provide a decent 
standard of living for workers and their families (para. 19).  
</p>
<p>62. The socio-economic stagnation, the perception of emigration as the only realistic 
strategy to move out of poverty, and the limited available options to emigrate legally have 
influenced attitudes to the risks of migrating by boat, namely, death and return.20 In one 
study, the greatest commonality among those who attempted to migrate through pirogues 
from Senegal seemed to be their determination to break out of protracted economic and 
social stagnation. Second to this was the shared conviction that they could not accomplish 
this wish by staying within the country.21 Even though pirogue migrants may not have been 
found to be the poorest in their society (considering that a sea crossing may cost on average 
620 euros22), their possibilities for socio-economic advancement at home appear severely 
limited.23  
</p>
<p>63. With regard to social protection for migrants, all salaried workers, whether 
Senegalese or foreign, employed in the private, public or semi-public sectors are entitled to 
</p>
<p>  
 18 In 2006 the total population of Senegal was estimated at 11,077,484, of which an estimated 54.4 
</p>
<p>per cent were young persons (below the age of 20).

<p>family and other social security benefits. However, those working in the informal sectors, 
many of whom are African migrants, are excluded from the enjoyment of such benefits. An 
additional concern brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur during this visit is the 
absence of mechanisms whereby families left behind by Senegalese working abroad are 
able to enjoy such social security benefits.  
</p>
<p>64. Pirogue migration seems to have become &#8220;a social phenomenon through which 
young Senegalese men could seek to restore a tarnished sense of dignity and manhood&#8221;.24 
Since the 1980s, when emigration began to grow significantly, the figure of the emigrant 
has come to be seen as embodying economic success and social prestige and has become a 
social role model.25 There are Senegalese pop songs which celebrate the migrant as a 
modern hero. In this regard, during his visit the Special Rapporteur learned of many 
sensitization and information initiatives carried out by governmental and non-governmental 
actors in cooperation with international agencies such as the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM). For example in 2007 an awareness campaign in Senegal included 
television spots and messages from celebrities, such as the Senegalese singer Youssou 
N&#8217;Dour, warning of the dangers of irregular migration. In 2006, in Thiaroye-sur-Mer, 550 
Senegalese women whose sons or husbands died at sea while trying to reach Europe joined 
together; through the Women&#8217;s Association against Irregular Migration they have 
conducted regular awareness-raising and information campaigns on the dangers of irregular 
migration through workshops, television shows and other media.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legislative challenges 
</b></p>
<p>65. Legislation and regulations governing the various aspects of migration and the 
human rights of migrants appear scattered, and are often not in conformity with 
international instruments and standards.  
</p>
<p>66. For instance, the Special Rapporteur was informed that in 2006, Law No. 02 (2005) 
on trafficking in persons and organized clandestine migration was applied by law 
enforcement officials and judges not only to arrest, prosecute and condemn traffickers but 
also to prosecute migrants who attempted the sea crossing towards Europe. Although this 
law - one of the first specific laws on these issues in West Africa - may represent a positive 
step in the fight against trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, it poses 
challenges to the protection of the human rights of migrants. In fact the clauses, contrary to 
article 5 of the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, do 
not provide for criminal immunity of migrants. Rather, they provide for the possibility to 
prosecute and condemn all persons over the age of 18 who knowingly contribute to the 
realization of the offence of clandestine migration. During this visit, the Special Rapporteur 
was informed that a new draft law has been elaborated but not yet adopted. It seems the 
Government aims at moving this legislation forward together with the reform of the Penal 
Code.  
</p>
<p>67. The provisions of the ECOWAS Treaty and its Protocols are not sufficiently 
integrated in the national law of the member States of the Community and are not 
effectively implemented. The Special Rapporteur, for example, learned during his visit that 
nationals of other States in the Community staying in Senegal more than 90 days should 
register with the relevant authorities. However, the authorities seem to accept that most of 
</p>
<p>  
 24 Ibid., p. 37.  
 25 Ibid. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>these migrants do not register, and enforce the requirement only when migrants come into 
conflict with the law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges in strategies, policies and measures in the field of migration 
</b></p>
<p>68. Senegalese management and policy frameworks related to migration reveal a 
number of deficiencies, including a lack of resources and a lack of coordination among 
entities, committees and other bodies aimed at coping with the variety of aspects related to 
the human rights of migrants 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur notes that coordination among entities involved in the 
various areas of migration management and human rights of migrants could be further 
improved. For example, the National Commission of Management and Follow-up to 
Employment Offers is not yet fully operational, as it has been unable to take stock of the 
activities carried out, the progress made and the remaining difficulties.26 Furthermore, the 
multiplication of entities dealing with migration matters, the duplication of efforts, 
inefficient communication and inadequate internal and inter-ministerial coordination 
contribute to fragmentation and a suboptimal impact of the various initiatives. A lack of 
coordinating mechanisms also seems to characterize the scenario in the ECOWAS region 
despite the existence of legally binding instruments.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur noted that the approach to migration issues has tended to be 
ad hoc, thus impeding the development of a holistic vision of policies and programmes 
related to migration and the protection of the human rights of migrants. Civil society 
organizations, including trade unions, reported that they are not allowed to contribute 
meaningfully in the elaboration of migration-related policies and programmes and their 
management. They claim to be consulted during the final stages of any process in order to 
seek the &#8220;endorsement&#8221; of policies and measures already elaborated by governmental and 
other actors.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur noted that there exist difficulties in the collection and 
analysis of data and statistics related to migration. On many occasions existing 
administrative data are not efficiently used and made public, due to constraints related to 
human and financial resources. Data from consulates, or data on the entry and exit of 
foreigners and residence permits, among other types of information, are often not available. 
Data that are available may not have been collected systematically or comprehensively such 
as, for example, data extrapolated from general population surveys and censuses. At times 
data are considered confidential and thus not released. The civil registry has not yet been 
computerized, thus hindering the rapid exploitation of the data collected.  
</p>
<p>72. In this regard, the Government adopted a programme to put in place a guiding 
framework for statistics in Senegal (2008-2013) aimed at, inter alia, contributing to a better 
visibility of migration-related data at the national level. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that migration is considered integral to national population and development 
policies. He was also informed, however, that the collection of data on migration remains a 
neglected area and thus migration is the least-examined demographic component. For 
example the 2002 census included only one question related to migration, namely, whether 
anyone within the household had left the country in the preceding five years.

<p>including fishing, and indirectly aimed at deterring outmigration, the Government 
established the Grande Offensive Agricole pour la Nourriture et l&#8217;Abondance, which offers 
land and agricultural equipment to migrants who wish to invest in agriculture. During the 
course of his visit, the Special Rapporteur learned that these projects, while important, do 
not seem to attract much interest among young people, as they do not perceive a return to 
agriculture as an alternative to the perceived benefits of outmigration.  
</p>
<p>74. Concerning measures to combat the exploitation of children, including migrant 
children, the Government adopted a strategic plan concerning the education and protection 
of children who are begging or who are not in school (2008&#8211;2013) which provides for 
different phases of interventions, including (a) mapping the religious schools, the children 
who are begging and the actors involved; (b) establishing a platform for the exchange of 
information and the elaboration of consistent strategies and policies related to the protection 
of children; (c) regulating the opening of religious schools and their functioning through an 
official decree and ensuring the implementation and monitoring of this decree; (d) 
elaborating a media plan and a communication strategy; and (e) consolidating and 
documenting the research and experiences gained through the different interventions, 
including good practices, and ensuring their dissemination. As part of its efforts to 
modernize the <i>daaras</i>, and to enhance the quality of lives of children, including migrant 
children, in the care of religious teachers and prevent their abuse, in 2004 the Government 
began setting up projects to introduce trilingualism (mother tongue, French and Arabic) and 
vocational training into these schools. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Challenges and measures under the auspices of bilateral and 
multilateral cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>75. With regard to the Framework Agreement between Senegal and Spain, the Special 
Rapporteur noted with interest the promotion of &#8220;hiring at the origin&#8221; to facilitate the 
regular migration of Senegalese workers to Spain. He acknowledges however that such a 
programme may lead to disproportionately high expectations about the possibilities of 
regular migration to Spain, as the number of contracts available is still limited. The Special 
Rapporteur learned that, for example, in the Mbour Department approximately 30,000 
young people applied to the regular migration programme. Furthermore, the scheme seems 
to be perceived as excluding certain groups. There is also discontent about the management 
of the contracts, partly as a result of misinformation and inconsistency in the information 
disseminated and partly as a result of alleged corruption and nepotism. There is also lack of 
clarity on certain elements of the procedure for applying to the job openings available 
through the Framework Agreement. It appears, for example, that candidates are not 
systematically informed on/notified of the status of their applications and in cases of 
rejection there does not seem to be any mechanism for seeking a review of the decision. 
</p>
<p>76. As mentioned in paragraph 56 above, Senegal and Spain concluded a readmission 
agreement for unaccompanied children. This agreement requires the two countries to 
exchange information about unaccompanied children and to trace the child&#8217;s family within 
a short time frame. The Spanish authorities must inform the Senegalese authorities of the 
presence of an unaccompanied child within 10 days; the Senegalese authorities then have 
20 days to trace the child&#8217;s family and to issue documents confirming the child&#8217;s identity. 
The Special Rapporteur concurs with a report published by Human Rights Watch that such 
deadlines may &#8220;raise questions as to what extent authorities on both sides will be able to 
assess sufficiently the circumstances behind the child&#8217;s departure and the situation awaiting </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>the child upon return&#8221;.27 These deadlines may also increase the risk that information will be 
shared with the relevant authorities before an assessment is made as to whether a child or 
his or her family are subject to persecution and thus have a claim for protection under the 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951).28 
</p>
<p>77. In 2006 the irregular migration affecting the southern external maritime borders of 
the European Union became an issue of increasing concern to all European Union member 
States. In particular the Canary Islands had, in the spring of that year, become the prime 
destination point for irregular migrants leaving from Mauritania and Senegal, whereas the 
previous years the flows of irregular migrants had originated from the coast of Morocco. 
This new route to the Canary Islands had become more utilized by the smuggling networks, 
possibly as a result of strengthened efforts by the Government of Spain to curb irregular 
crossing at other border points.  
</p>
<p>78. As a result, the joint operation HERA I was conducted in the Canary Islands from 19 
July to 31 October 2006, aimed at (a) increasing the capacity of border checks and the 
identification of persons attempting to enter the Schengen area in an irregular manner and 
(b) repatriating undocumented migrants. HERA II was conducted in parallel, also in the 
Canary Islands, from 11 August to 15 December 2006 and was aimed at increasing the 
surveillance of the Atlantic maritime borders of the European Union and preventing the loss 
of lives by controlling the vessels departing from Mauritania, Senegal and Cape Verde and 
contiguous zones.  
</p>
<p>79. It was reported that 18,987 irregular migrants arrived to the Canary Islands during 
HERA I; all were reportedly identified and 6,076 of them - from the Gambia, Guinea, Mali, 
Morocco, Senegal and other countries - were repatriated by the Spanish authorities. It was 
also reported that during HERA II a total of 14,572 irregular migrants arrived to the Canary 
Islands in 246 <i>cayucos</i> or <i>pateras</i> (pirogues) whereas 3,887 migrants in 57 <i>cayucos</i> or 
<i>pateras </i>were sent back to their points of departure on the African coast. According to 
Frontex, information collected during these operations led to the detention of several 
facilitators, mainly in Senegal.29  
</p>
<p>80. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur observed that the Governments of both 
Senegal and Spain were marking a major achievement - no deaths of Senegalese migrants 
had been reported during the first six months of 2009. This was a particularly significant 
accomplishment, considering that the numerous deaths of migrants had been a constant 
feature in the national and international media for several years. Bilateral cooperation 
between the two Governments, including cooperation in patrolling Senegalese territorial 
waters, seems to have significantly contributed to this success and more generally to the 
decrease in the number of irregular arrivals to the Canary Islands. The comprehensive 
approach of this cooperation seems to indicate that the decrease cannot be attributed only to 
stricter border control and sea patrolling, but also to the simultaneous provision of (a) 
regular avenues for migration to meet demand of domestic labour markets and (b) 
development cooperation in the country of origin. In addition the global economic recession 
of the past two years has led to an increase in unemployment rates in many destination 
countries where economic sectors traditionally employing migrants have experienced a 
significant reduction in labour demand.  
</p>
<p>81. In relation to returned migrants, the Special Rapporteur would like to recognize the 
success of Senegal&#8217;s Programme to Support Solidarity for Development Initiatives

<p>implemented in cooperation with the Government of France. The actions and initiatives of 
this programme aim at, inter alia, supporting the economic integration of returned migrants 
and promoting decentralized development through strengthened cooperation with the 
Senegalese diaspora. The programme has also been designed in line with national policies 
and programmes to eradicate poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. 
During his visit the Special Rapporteur was told of Kedougou, one of the programme&#8217;s 
success stories. Kedougou is located 750 kilometers from Dakar &#8211; a journey of between 8 
and 10 hours over land. Public transport to Kedougou was, however, nonexistent. More 
than a thousand Senegalese abroad originally from the Kedougou area decided, therefore, to 
invest in a company whose coaches nowadays constitute the only available public transport 
to this area.  
</p>
<p>82. Over the past few years, the link between migration and development has gained 
broad recognition from national Governments and the international community. Against 
this backdrop, IOM launched in 2001 the Migration for Development in Africa strategy 
aimed at promoting and supporting international cooperation which enhances the 
participation of migrants in the social and economic development of countries of origin. 
Since 2003 IOM has been supporting, in partnership with the Government of Italy and 
under the strategy, a programme targeting the sub-Saharan diaspora in Italy. Currently this 
programme includes migrants from Senegal residing in Italy and supports productive 
investments in Senegal so as to produce income and generate job opportunities. This 
support is provided either through the promotion of migrants&#8217; entrepreneurial initiatives in 
the country of origin, not dependent on their actual return, or through the promotion of co-
development projects where migrant associations partner with Italian local authorities in 
alignment with the principle of decentralized cooperation.  
</p>
<p>83. Following the strong feminization of migration flows registered both at the Italian 
and international levels, and given that women are the primary receivers of remittances all 
over the world, IOM has designed the Migrant Women for Development in Africa 
programme with the objective of promoting the direct engagement of West African women 
residing in Italy, including Senegalese women, in the socio-economic development of their 
areas of origin.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Measures to combat trafficking in persons 
</b></p>
<p>84. Weaknesses in legislation, policies and practices governing migration contribute to 
the emergence and development of trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants.  
</p>
<p>85. The Government of Senegal has been making significant efforts towards the 
elimination of trafficking, engaging in activities such as rescuing and caring for victims. In 
December 2007, nine individuals, two of whom were truck drivers from Guinea-Bissau and 
one of whom was Senegalese, were arrested at the Southern border for attempting to traffic 
34 boys. The suspects are in jail awaiting trial. In 2007, a religious leader was prosecuted 
and sentenced to four years&#8217; imprisonment for beating a <i>talib&#233;</i> to death.  
</p>
<p>86. The Government also adopted the Plan National d&#8217;Action de Lutte contre la Traite 
des Personnes, en Particulier des Femmes et des Enfants au S&#233;n&#233;gal (2008-2013) which 
sets the overarching goal to ensure that all persons in Senegal benefit from legal and social 
protection against trafficking. The goal is expected to be achieved through various types of 
intervention, which include efforts to strengthen law enforcement and prosecution actions, 
to increase the adequacy of protection of victims and witnesses and to build the capacity of 
all actors involved in the fight against trafficking.  </p>

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur believes that the commitment of Senegal to the human 
rights of migrant workers, including its efforts to promote awareness regarding the 
importance of ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families is noteworthy.30  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>He is equally convinced that challenges remain in legislation, policies and 
practices and that further efforts are needed to strengthen the protection and 
promotion of the human rights of migrants in Senegal and of Senegalese migrants 
residing abroad. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to offer the 
following recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Government of Senegal and Governments of European Union member 
States concerned should ensure that multilateral and bilateral agreements, including 
operations of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation 
at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), 
incorporate international standards on human rights and refugee rights. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Government of Senegal should strengthen efforts to ensure the 
harmonization and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty of the Economic 
Community of West African States protocol relating to the free movement of persons, 
residence and establishment within the domestic legislation. It should also train 
border officials and inform the public at large on the provisions of the protocol and 
the Treaty itself. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Government should consider elaborating a holistic and strategic migration 
policy. Further, it should either establish an independent entity responsible for the 
management and follow-up of all questions related to labour migration, or revive the 
National Commission of Management and Follow-up of Employment Offers. The new 
entity or the revived National Commission should be equipped with adequate human 
and financial resources. Strategies, policies and mechanisms in the field of migration 
should be devised and implemented with the full involvement of all stakeholders, 
including civil society, returning migrants and young people.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Government, in cooperation with the relevant international organizations 
and United Nations agencies, should improve data collection and statistical analysis in 
relation to aspects of immigration and out-migration. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>In addition to the social security agreement with France and steps already 
taken to negotiate a similar agreement with Spain, the Government should 
systematically negotiate the inclusion of social security provisions in bilateral and 
multilateral agreements on labour migration in order to, inter alia, facilitate the 
transfer (upon migrants&#8217; return to Senegal) of the social contributions paid by 
Senegalese living abroad in the countries of migration. It should also devise a 
mechanism to extend the coverage of social security to the families of Senegalese 
working abroad.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights on reducing the unemployment rate, the Government should build the 
capacity, including business capacity, of young people and potential migrants and 
conduct regular reviews of the minimum wage levels.  
</b></p>
<p>  
 30 The commitment and efforts of Senegal in this field have also been praised by certain Governments 
</p>
<p>during its universal periodic review in 2009. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/33/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Concerning remittances, the Government should promote among the 
households receiving remittances the necessary capacity to invest in sustainable 
income-generating activities. It should also promote and strengthen the involvement 
of the Senegalese diaspora in the development of the country, including by improving 
the support given to returnees and by enhancing the institutional environment for 
economic development. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Concerning unaccompanied minors, the Government of Senegal and Spain 
should make the implementation of the bilateral readmission agreement transparent 
and allow for independent monitoring. These Governments should also cooperate in 
the return of unaccompanied children when the decision to return has been taken in 
conformity with the children&#8217;s best interest, including with regard to aspects 
requiring international protection, and whether adequate care and integration 
arrangements can be guaranteed upon return. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Government should ensure that migration strategies and policies take into 
account the special protection needs of asylum-seekers and refugees. For instance, it 
should put in place systems of referrals between the immigration services and the 
National Eligibility Commission, which deals with refugee status determination. 
Concerning Mauritanian refugees, the Government should resume the registration 
exercise so that they can be provided with proper identification documents and have 
full access to health, educational and other services.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Concerning trafficking and smuggling, the Government should ensure that the 
new draft law on trafficking and smuggling of migrants is in conformity with 
international human rights standards and that, upon adoption, it is swiftly 
implemented. The Government should also step up efforts to prosecute traffickers and 
to identify and protect all victims of trafficking. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Concerning particularly vulnerable children, including those forced to beg, the 
Government should ensure the swift implementation of the strategic plan concerning 
the education and protection of children who are begging or who are not in school. It 
should also adopt immediately the decree regulating the opening and functioning of 
religious schools and establish mechanisms to monitor its implementation. The 
Government should also implement the recommendations of the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child (CRC/C/SEN/CO/2) in order to stop the practice of using <i>talib&#233;s</i> 
(children sent to live and study at a religious school) for private economic gain and to 
bring to justice the perpetrators of that practice.
