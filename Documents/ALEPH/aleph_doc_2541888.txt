TECK REPORTS UNAUDITED THIRD QUARTER RESULTS FOR 2014
Vancouver, BC – Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TCK.A and TCK.B, NYSE: TCK) (“Teck”)
reported third quarter adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of $159 million, or $0.28 per
share, compared with $252 million or $0.44 per share in 2013. Profit attributable to shareholders
was $84 million in the third quarter, or $0.14 per share, compared with $267 million, or $0.46 per
share, a year ago.
“Our operations performed well during the third quarter and this has allowed us to report profits,
conserve cash and maintain a strong financial position with approximately $5 billion of liquidity at
the end of the quarter,” said Don Lindsay, President and CEO. “We are pleased with the progress
being made in the development of the Fort Hills oil sands project and the reopening of the Pend
Oreille zinc mine while continuing our focus on reducing costs and spending on other capital
projects.”
Highlights and Significant Items
 
—Profit attributable to shareholders was $84 million in the third quarter, which included a non-
cash tax charge of $64 million associated with the introduction of new Chilean tax legislation.
—EBITDA was $651 million in the third quarter compared with $815 million a year ago.
—Gross profit before depreciation and amortization was $750 million compared with $919 million
in the third quarter of 2013.
—Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $492 million in the third
quarter of 2014 compared with $647 million a year ago.
—Our liquidity remains strong with a cash balance of $2.0 billion at October 28, 2014 and US$3
billion available under our revolving credit facility that matures in 2019.
—Our cost reduction program continues to deliver results as we realized lower total operating
and lower unit costs in our copper and zinc business units.
—We have reached agreements with our customers to sell 6.3 million tonnes of coal in the fourth
quarter of 2014 based on US$119 per tonne for the highest quality product and we expect total
sales in the fourth quarter, including spot sales, to be at or above 6.5 million tonnes, resulting
in 2014 sales of approximately 26.2 million tonnes.
All dollar amounts expressed in this news release are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise
noted.

—Coal production was up 2% in the quarter compared with a year ago and on a year-to-date
basis, production is one million tonnes higher than a year ago. Coal sales of 6.7 million tonnes
in the third quarter were the second highest on record for this period and follow record-high
sales for the first half of 2014.
— All of our six coal mines reported positive cash margins in the quarter.
—The Pend Oreille zinc mine restart is progressing well, with first ore expected in December
2014.
—We are increasing our zinc in concentrate production guidance for the second time this year as
a result of strong performance from our Red Dog Operations and now expect to produce in the
range of 615,000 to 630,000 tonnes in 2014.
—Since the start of the year, the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate has moved significantly in
our favour. Each Cdn$0.01 change in the exchange rate affects our EBITDA by approximately
$60 million on an annualized basis.
—Our estimated capital spending for 2014 has been revised downward to $1.5 billion, or
approximately $375 million lower than our original annual guidance. Timing of cash
expenditures at Fort Hills accounts for approximately $225 million of the reduction, while the
balance primarily relates to our cost reduction program.
2     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
This management’s discussion and analysis is dated as at October 29, 2014 and should be read
in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Teck Resources Limited
(“Teck”) and the notes thereto for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and with
the audited consolidated financial statements of Teck and the notes thereto for the year ended
December 31, 2013. In this news release, unless the context otherwise dictates, a reference to
“the company” or “us,” “we” or “our” refers to Teck and its subsidiaries. Additional information,
including our annual information form and management’s discussion and analysis for the year
ended December 31, 2013, is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
This document contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language
under the heading “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION.”
Overview
Our profits and cash flows continue to be negatively affected by lower steelmaking coal prices.
Coal prices in U.S dollar terms were similar to the second quarter of this year, but US$29 per
tonne lower than the same period a year ago. While demand from our customers remains robust,
increased production from Australia has put pressure on prices in 2014. The profitability of our
copper business unit declined primarily due to reduced volumes from Antamina. The lower
copper results were more than offset by favourable results from our zinc business unit, which
benefited from a 25% increase in zinc prices compared with a year ago, reflecting improved zinc
market fundamentals.
The U.S dollar continued to strengthen against the Canadian dollar in the third quarter, which
had a favourable effect on our results. Sales of our products are denominated in U.S dollars,
while the majority of our operating and capital costs are incurred in Canadian dollars. The
stronger U.S. dollar will, to a lesser extent, put upward pressure on a portion of our operating
costs and capital spending.
Our cost reduction program, which began in the second half of 2012, continues to exceed our
initial goals with $590 million of annualized reductions realized to date. Over the nine months to
September, at 10 of our 13 operations we have managed to maintain or reduce unit costs while
increasing throughput. We note that while we have achieved significant efficiencies through this
program, there are offsetting factors such as lower grades, increased waste haul distances,
higher fuel prices and contractual labour rate increases which can offset these cost control
measures. Some of these cost pressures will become more significant as mining progresses at
each of our sites.
While we continue to assess growth opportunities that present themselves, our primary
development focus is on the oil sands business with the development of the Fort Hills oil sands
project. The construction phase of Fort Hills will require a substantial investment of capital
through 2017, but is expected to provide significant cash flows, diversify our commodity mix and
provide a long-life asset located in a stable jurisdiction. We are also in the process of restarting
our Pend Oreille zinc mine in December 2014 to benefit from improving zinc market
fundamentals and the synergy it provides to our Trail Operation. In addition, we are continuing to
plan, design, and permit the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 copper project with a disciplined
approach to creating shareholder value.

Profit and Adjusted Profit(1)
Profit attributable to shareholders was $84 million, or $0.14 per share, in the third quarter
compared with $267 million or $0.46 per share in the same period last year. Included in profit
attributable to shareholders was a $64 million non-cash tax charge as a result of the Chilean tax
reform bill being signed into law.
Adjusted profit, before the effect of Chilean tax reform and other items identified in the table
below, was $159 million, or $0.28 per share, in the third quarter compared with $252 million, or
$0.44 per share, a year ago. The decline in adjusted profit was primarily due to significantly lower
coal prices and partly due to reduced copper production. Partially offsetting these items was the
positive effect of the stronger U.S. dollar and a 25% rise in zinc prices. We also provided $28
million ($17 million after tax) for negative pricing adjustments, which is included in arriving at
both the profit and adjusted profit amounts. This compares with positive pricing adjustments of
$24 million ($15 million after-tax) last year.

Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our coal business unit declined by $230
million in the third quarter (see table below) compared with a year ago primarily due to lower coal
prices and sales volumes that were lower than the record 7.5 million tonnes sold last year. The
average realized coal price of US$110 per tonne was 21% lower than the same period a year
ago and reflects the oversupplied steelmaking coal market conditions. These factors were partly
offset by the favourable effect of a stronger U.S. dollar.
Production in the third quarter of 6.8 million tonnes rose by 2% compared with the same period a
year ago. The higher production is largely attributable to record quarterly and year-to-date
production at the Elkview and Greenhills mines. The last of our planned annual maintenance
shutdowns were completed during the quarter.
Coal sales of 6.7 million tonnes in the third quarter were the second highest on record for this
period and follow record high sales for the first half of 2014, an illustration that demand continues
to grow although at a slower pace. Sales for the third quarter, however, were 12% lower than the
record level achieved in the comparable period last year.

our coal business unit for the quarter:

Property, plant and equipment expenditures totaled $58 million in the third quarter. Total
sustaining capital in the quarter was $36 million. In addition, $17 million was spent on our major
enhancement projects and $5 million on the Quintette project. Capitalized stripping costs were
$81 million in the third quarter compared with $98 million a year ago.
Markets
Increased production and exports from Australia, combined with lower imports into China,
maintained the seaborne market in an oversupplied position and pricing has remained range-
bound since April 2014. While producers have announced over 25 million tonnes of production
cuts since January 2014, many of these cuts have not yet taken effect. We expect that the
unsustainably low pricing levels will lead to announcements of further cuts by other producers.
Coal prices for the fourth quarter of 2014 have been agreed with the majority of our customers
based on US$119 per tonne for the highest quality products. This is consistent with prices
reportedly achieved by our competitors. Additional sales priced on a spot basis will reflect market
conditions when sales are concluded.
Operations
Mining and coal processing performance in the third quarter was very strong with Elkview and
Greenhills each setting new quarterly production records for the second time this year.
Our cost reduction initiatives continue to produce significant results and are focused on
improvement in equipment and labour productivities, reduced use of contractors, reduced
consumable usage and limiting the use of higher cost equipment. A number of factors have
partially offset the strong performance of our cost reduction program. These included the effect of
the strengthening U.S. dollar on diesel fuel, parts and supplies, as well as increased use of tires
and explosives as strip ratios have increased compared to a year ago.
Unit Costs
Total cost of sales in the third quarter of 2014, before depreciation and inventory write-downs,
were $88 per tonne, the same as a year ago.

8      Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
Elk Valley Water Management
Our Elk Valley water management program to date has focused on two main areas: development
of the Elk Valley Water Quality Plan under an Area Based Management Plan Order from the
Government of British Columbia, and construction of the West Line Creek water treatment plant
at our Line Creek Operations.
The Elk Valley Water Quality Plan is intended to address the management of selenium as well
as other substances released by mining activities throughout the watershed in the short, medium
and long term. The plan establishes water quality targets which are protective of the environment
and human health, while considering social and economic factors. The plan was informed by
scientific advice received from a Technical Advisory Committee chaired by the B.C. Ministry of
Environment, and included representatives from Teck, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, State of Montana, Ktunaxa Nation, other provincial and federal agencies and an
independent scientist. Input from the public, which was received through three phases of
consultation, was also included in the development of the plan. The plan has been completed
and submitted to the B.C. Ministry of Environment. The ministry is expected to review the plan
and to approve it, with or without amendments, in the fourth quarter of 2014.
A previous draft action plan for valley-wide selenium management contemplated total capital
spending of up to $600 million over a five year period. This $600 million included the $120
million spent on the West Line Creek Treatment Facility which, in addition to the treatment facility
itself, consists of water intake, outtake and residual management structure. The estimated capital
and operating costs of implementing the new Elk Valley Water Quality Plan will depend on the
terms of the B.C. Government’s approval of the plan, but are expected to vary from those outlined
in the previous draft. The final costs will depend on the water quality targets approved by the
government, as well as the technologies applied to manage selenium and other substances. The
initial cost estimate in the previous plan assumed the application of biological treatment
technology, which is the technology installed in the West Line Creek Treatment Facility. This
facility is being commissioned and has operated at full design rates, although commissioning
work continues.
Our work on the new Elk Valley Water Quality Plan is expected to result in revised cost estimates
by the end of 2014. We expect that, in order to maintain water quality, water treatment will need to
continue for an indefinite period after mining operations end. Our ongoing work could reveal
technical issues or advances associated with potential treatment technologies which could
substantially increase or decrease both capital and operating costs associated with water quality
management. Delays in obtaining approval of the plan could result in consequential delays in
permitting new mining areas, which would limit our ability to maintain or increase coal production
in accordance with our long term plans. If this were to occur, the potential shortfall in future
production could be material.
Outlook
We are expecting coal sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 to be at, or above, 6.5 million tonnes.
Vessel nominations for quarterly contract shipments are determined by customers and final sales
and average prices for the quarter will depend on product mix, market direction for spot priced
sales, timely arrival of vessels, as well as the performance of the rail transportation network and
coal-loading facilities.
9      Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
We now expect our 2014 coal production to be in the range of 26.5 to 27 million tonnes.
We now expect our 2014 annual cost of product sold, before transportation and depreciation
charges, to be in the range of $52 to $55 per tonne (US$46 to US$49) based on current
exchange rates and production plans and our 2014 annual transportation costs are expected to
be in the range of $37 to $39 per tonne.

Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our copper business unit decreased by
$26 million in the third quarter (see table below) compared with a year ago. This was primarily
due to lower sales and production levels, slightly lower copper prices and increased smelter
processing charges in the quarter. These items were partially offset by the positive effect of the
stronger U.S. dollar and reduced unit costs at most of our operations.
Copper production in the third quarter declined by 13,000 tonnes compared with a year ago
primarily due to lower production from Antamina and Carmen de Andacollo, partially offset by
increases at Highland Valley Copper. Our share of Antamina’s copper production decreased by
11,200 tonnes, primarily due to the mining of lower grades as anticipated in the mine plan.
Production at Carmen de Andacollo declined as a result of unexpected mill downtime in
September due to the failure of key electrical equipment. Repairs have been completed and the
mill has operated at full production rates since the end of September. Highland Valley Copper’s
production increased by 4,200 tonnes primarily as a result of increased mill throughput, reflecting
the increased capacity from commissioning the mill optimization project that occurred in the
second quarter.

Capital expenditures consisted of $30 million for sustaining capital, $9 million for major
enhancement projects and $17 million for new mine development, primarily at the Quebrada
Blanca Phase 2 project. Capitalized stripping costs were $55 million in the third quarter, similar
to $56 million a year ago.
Markets
LME copper prices averaged US$3.17 per pound in the third quarter of 2014, up 3% compared
with US$3.08 per pound in the second quarter of this year, but down 1% compared with US$3.21
in the same period a year ago. Copper prices declined through most of the third quarter after
peaking in the middle of July, as tight market conditions were offset by concerns over the
ownership of certain warehoused metals in China. The uncertainty resulted in the liquidation of
stocks held in bonded warehouses and price weakness during the quarter. Expectations that
these Chinese stocks would flow into the LME proved unfounded as LME stocks fell 2,125
tonnes during the quarter. Reported stocks including LME, Comex & SHFE were up
approximately 18,000 tonnes in the third quarter and remain at their lowest levels since 2008.
Consumption in China continues to grow based on infrastructure investment and state power grid
spending plans. In the U.S., consumption continues to grow based on increased automotive
production with spot metal premiums remaining above annual contract levels.
Operations
Highland Valley Copper
Copper production was 29,700 tonnes in the third quarter or 16% higher than a year ago, due to
significant increases in mill throughput resulting from the mill optimization project and continued
focus on mine-to-mill improvement efforts with high energy blasting. Grades in the third quarter
were similar to a year ago, but declined from the second quarter of this year, as anticipated in the
mine plan, and are expected to remain similar in the fourth quarter. Molybdenum production
increased to 1.6 million pounds from 1.0 million pounds a year ago primarily due to the increased
mill throughput and higher grades.
As a result of our cost reduction efforts, operating costs in the third quarter were similar to last
year, despite the significantly higher mill throughput rates that rose 24%. Unit costs declined
substantially as a result of higher copper production.
Mill throughput averaged 139,000 tonnes per day during the third quarter, exceeding the design
capacity of 130,000 tonnes per day. Recoveries were lower than a year ago primarily due to the
lower grades processed in the quarter. Further process optimization efforts continue, but
throughput rates and recoveries are dependent on the mix of ore sources. We expect similar
throughput rates and recoveries in the fourth quarter.
A 30,000 metre drill program was completed in the quarter, focused on further defining and
upgrading resources in the Bethlehem area.
12     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
Antamina
Copper production in the third quarter decreased by 38% compared with a year ago as a result of
significantly lower copper grades and changes in ore types, as planned. Also contributing to the
lower production was the mix of mill feed in the quarter, which was 63% copper-only ore and
37% copper-zinc ore, compared with 81% and 19%, respectively, in the same period a year ago.
Grades are expected to remain similar for the remainder of the year due to mine sequencing and
continued processing of lower grade stockpiles. Zinc production rose to 73,200 tonnes from
44,100 tonnes in the same period a year ago due to the higher amount of copper-zinc ore
processed in the period. Despite the higher amount of zinc produced in the quarter, zinc
production year to date is almost 50,000 tonnes lower than the comparable period a year ago.
Operating costs in the third quarter, before changes in inventory, were 11% lower compared to a
year ago as a result of focused cost reduction efforts. Mill throughput averaged 134,000 tonnes
per day during the quarter, 5% higher than the same period last year.
Quebrada Blanca
Copper production in the third quarter declined by 12% compared with the same period a year
ago. As anticipated in the mine plan, the placement of dump leach ore continued to decline while
heap leach ore placement increased as heap leach circuit improvement efforts were
implemented in the quarter.
Operating costs, before changes in inventory, decreased by US$17 million compared with the
same period a year ago as a result of reduced material movement in the mine, lower supply costs
and continued cost reduction efforts. Depreciation and amortization costs increased by US$7
million compared with a year ago as a result of depreciation of accumulated capitalized stripping
costs.
Work continues on updating the permits for the existing facilities and life extension of the
supergene operation. As previously announced, the social and environmental impact
assessment to extend cathode production to 2020 was submitted in the third quarter. The review,
response and consultation processes by the relevant regulatory agencies is in progress.
Carmen de Andacollo
Copper production in the third quarter declined by 18% compared with a year ago as mill
throughput declined by 15% primarily as a result of the failure of key electrical equipment that
resulted in unexpected mill downtime in September. Repairs have been completed and the mill
has operated at full production rates since the end of September.
Production costs, before changes in inventories, decreased by US$11 million compared with a
year ago primarily due to continued lower costs for operating supplies and consumables as well
as other cost reduction efforts a reduction in contractors.
Duck Pond
Copper and zinc production in the third quarter was 3,800 and 4,700 tonnes, respectively,
compared with 3,700 and 3,700 tonnes, respectively, last year. Mill throughput was a record
13     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
2,000 tonnes per day during the quarter, an 18% increase compared to the same period last year
as ore availability and improved maintenance practices resulted in increased production levels,
offset by lower copper grades and recoveries. Zinc grades and recoveries were higher due to the
mix of ores processed during the quarter.
The Duck Pond Operation has been extended by a few months and is now expected to close in
July 2015.
Cost of Sales
Unit costs of product sold in the third quarter of 2014 as reported in U.S. dollars, before cash
margins for by-products, decreased primarily due to cost reduction efforts across all of our
operations and the favourable effects of a stronger U.S. dollar at our Canadian operations.

Copper Development Projects
Quebrada Blanca Phase 2
During the third quarter of 2014, we continued optimization and detailed design activities for the
Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project, but at a slower pace aligned with permitting activities.
Optimization efforts are focused on capital reduction opportunities and mine planning using
recent resource model updates.
As previously noted, the permits for our existing facilities need to be updated before
resubmission of the Phase 2 SEIA. Timing for resubmission for the Phase 2 SEIA will depend to
some extent on progress on updating permits for the existing facilities and project optimization
activities.
Other Copper Projects
At Relincho, optimization studies continued in the quarter, focused on capital and operating cost
reductions and other value-enhancing initiatives.
Focused engineering studies continue for our Galore Creek, Schaft Creek and Mesaba projects
as we further explore ways to enhance the value of these projects. A pre-feasibility program at
 
 
 
14     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
our 50% owned Zafranal copper-gold project located in Southern Peru commenced in the
quarter. Our share of expenditures will be $15 million.
Outlook
We now expect our 2014 copper production to be in the range of 330,000 to 340,000 tonnes. Our
previous guidance was in the range of 320,000 to 340,000 tonnes.
We now expect our copper unit costs in 2014 to be in the range of US$1.90 to US$2.00 per
pound before margins from by-products and US$1.60 to US$1.70 per pound after by-product
margins based on current production plans and exchange rates. This is lower than our previous
guidance of US$1.95 to US$2.05 and US$1.65 to US$1.75 per pound, respectively.

Performance
Gross profit before depreciation and amortization from our zinc business unit increased by $87
million in the third quarter (see table below) compared with a year ago. Significantly higher zinc
prices and the favourable effect of the stronger U.S. dollar, partly offset by higher profit-based
royalty expense, contributed to the increased gross profit.
Refined zinc production from Trail decreased by 8% compared to last year due to the timing of
the annual maintenance shutdown of the zinc feed roasters. At Red Dog, zinc in concentrate
production rose slightly as a result of increased mill throughput.
The table below summarizes the gross profit change, before depreciation and amortization, in our
zinc business unit for the quarter.

16     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
Markets
LME zinc prices increased by 25% from a year ago and averaged US$1.05 per pound in the third
quarter. Lead prices increased by 4% from a year ago and averaged US$0.99 per pound in the
third quarter. Combined LME and SHFE zinc metal inventories rose by approximately 23,000
tonnes, or 3% in the third quarter. Year-to-date combined LME and SHFE zinc inventories are
down 23%, or approximately 270,000 tonnes.
Zinc metal demand in the U.S. continues to be strong, driven by both good auto production, up
7.9% year-over-year to August, and construction spending, which grew by 8.2% year-over-year to
August 2014. Auto production is also strong in China, up 8.6% year-over-year, which has
translated into strong demand growth for zinc. Mine closures that started to occur in 2013 are
expected to continue through this year and into 2015, which is expected to move the global zinc
market from surplus in prior years to deficit in 2015. The global lead metal market is expected to
move into deficit from 2014 onwards. Combined LME and SHFE lead inventories have risen
37,800 tonnes or 14% in the third quarter, but are down 2% year to date to the end of September.
Operations
Red Dog
Zinc production in the third quarter increased 4% due to an increase in tonnes milled in the
quarter, while lead production rose by 24% primarily due to significantly higher ore grades.
Operating costs in the third quarter remained similar to a year ago while royalty costs increased
significantly due to higher revenues linked to rising zinc prices.
The 2014 shipping season was completed on October 20, 2014 following the shipment of
1,025,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 205,000 tonnes of lead concentrate compared with
1,017,000 tonnes and 183,000 tonnes respectively, for the 2013 season. This represents all of
Red Dog’s concentrates available to be shipped from the operation. Sales volumes of contained
zinc are estimated at approximately 183,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Trail
Refined zinc production declined by 8% in the third quarter compared with a year ago due to a
20-day annual maintenance shutdown of one of the zinc feed roasters in July. Last year the
annual maintenance shutdown occurred in the second quarter.
Refined lead production in the third quarter was similar to a year ago as higher levels of lead in
feed material were offset by reduced online time due to several reliability issues in July. The
major Kivcet smelter cold shutdown and inspection, which occurs every four years, is scheduled
for the fourth quarter this year. Lead sales in the current quarter were lower than both production
in the current period and sales last year, as inventory levels increased in advance of the
shutdown.
Cost of concentrates decreased compared to a year ago reflecting lower production levels,
partially offset by higher zinc prices.
17     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
Pend Oreille
Pend Oreille is on schedule for re-start in December 2014 and costs are on budget. Recruiting is
progressing as planned with 197 of the planned 236 positions committed and critical
underground and surface equipment has been received on-site. Cumulative capital spending for
the re-start project has totalled US$17 million to September 2014. The re-start project is expected
to cost US$41 million.
Outlook
We now expect zinc in concentrate production, including co-product zinc production from our
copper business unit, to be in the range of 615,000 to 630,000 tonnes as a result of stronger
performance from Red Dog in 2014. This is higher than our original guidance of 555,000 to
585,000 tonnes.
We now expect refined zinc production from Trail to be in the range of 275,000 to 280,000 tonnes
due to poor performance in the first half of the year from the aging acid plant, which was replaced
in June. Our previous guidance was in the range of 280,000 to 290,000 tonnes.

ENERGY BUSINESS UNIT
Fort Hills Project
Construction of the Fort Hills Project is progressing substantially in accordance with the project
schedule. We forecast our share of incurred costs for 2014 to be approximately $800 million,
including our earn-in commitments. Our share of Fort Hills cash expenditures in the first three
quarters of 2014 was $421 million, including our earn-in commitments. Cash expenditures tend
to lag incurred costs in the initial phase of construction.
Since sanction, the project has achieved and continues to track to key milestones. Engineering
activity is progressing well, and is now over 50% complete. The capital cost and schedule
outlook has not changed since we announced project sanction last October 30. First oil is still
expected as early as the fourth quarter of 2017, with 90% of our planned production capacity of
180,000 barrels per day expected within 12 months.
Frontier Energy Project
The Frontier project regulatory application review continues with the provincial and federal
regulators. The regulatory review period is expected to continue into the second half of 2015,
making late 2015 or 2016 the earliest an approval decision is expected.
Wintering Hills Wind Power Facility
During the first three quarters of 2014, our share of the power generation from Wintering Hills was
58 GWhs. Expected power generation in 2014 is dependent on weather conditions and the
anticipated 85 GWhs of power generated will result in approximately 55,000 tonnes of CO2
equivalent offsets.
OTHER OPERATING COST AND EXPENSES
Our general and administrative costs declined to $22 million from $30 million a year ago. The
reduction in spending reflects the cost reduction program at head office, with reduced travel,
staffing levels and lower discretionary spending.
Other operating expenses, as set out in Note 3 of our financial statements, were $41 million in the
third quarter and consisted primarily of negative price adjustments of $28 million. Other operating
expense in 2013 was $36 million.

Financing expense was $79 million in the third quarter compared with $83 million a year ago.
Changes in the Fort Hills project agreements in the fourth quarter of 2013 changed the basis of
accounting for the project and as a result we now capitalize interest relating to our investment in
the Fort Hills project. Capitalized interest was $42 million in the third quarter versus $33 million a
year ago. This was partly offset by the stronger U.S. dollar as all our debt and related interest
expense is U.S. dollar denominated.
We recorded $16 million of other non-operating expenses, which consisted of foreign exchange
losses of $10 million and a $6 million provision on marketable securities. In 2013, we recorded
$4 million in non-operating gains, which included $10 million of foreign exchange gains less a $6
million provision on marketable securities.
Income and resource taxes for the third quarter were $151 million, or 64% of pre-tax profits, as
compared to the Canadian statutory corporate income tax rate of 26%. We have provided
additional deferred taxes as a result of the Chilean tax reform bill signed into law in the third
quarter. Without the non-cash Chilean tax reform impact of $64 million, income and resources
taxes were $87 million or 37% of pre-tax profits. The rate of 37% is higher than the Canadian
statutory rate as a result of higher tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the effect of resource
taxes. Due to available tax pools, we are currently shielded from cash income taxes, but not
resource taxes in Canada. We remain subject to cash taxes in foreign jurisdictions.

At the date of this report, we currently have $2.0 billion in cash and US$3 billion available on our
revolving credit facility that matures in 2019.
20     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
In October we renewed our debt shelf prospectus, which qualifies up to US$6.0 billion of debt
securities for sale in Canada and the United States over a period of 25 months, and will facilitate
access to the debt capital markets over that period as and when deemed appropriate.
Operating Cash Flow
Cash flow from operations, before changes in non-cash working capital items, was $492 million
in the third quarter compared with $647 million a year ago. This reduction is primarily due to
significantly lower coal prices in the quarter.
Changes in non-cash working capital items provided a source of cash of $62 million in the third
quarter. Changes to non-cash working capital were minimal in the third quarter of 2013.
Investing Activities
Expenditures on property, plant and equipment were $343 million in the third quarter and
included $99 million on sustaining capital, $36 million on major enhancement projects and $208
million on new mine development. The largest components of sustaining expenditures were $36
million at our coal operations. Major enhancement expenditures included $7 million at Highland
Valley Copper, $17 million at our coal operations and $10 million at Pend Oreille. New mine
development expenditures included $173 million for our share of Fort Hills spending and $13
million for Quebrada Blanca Phase 2.
Capitalized stripping expenditures were $145 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with
$160 million a year ago. The majority of this item constitutes the preparation of pits for future
production at our coal mines.
Financing Activities
Financing activities in the third quarter totalled $437 million and were primarily comprised of debt
interest payments of $156 million and payment for our semi-annual dividend that totaled $259
million. Financing activities in the same period a year ago totalled $423 million.
OUTLOOK
We continue to experience challenging markets for our products and prices for some of our
products have declined significantly in 2014. Commodity markets have historically been volatile,
prices can change rapidly and customers can alter shipment plans. This can have a substantial
effect on our business. Demand for our products, particularly coal, remains strong. However,
increased supply from Australian mines has put downward pressure on coal prices. While we
believe that the longer term fundamentals for steelmaking coal, copper and zinc are favorable,
the weakness in some of these markets may persist for some time. We are also significantly
affected by foreign exchange rates. For the nine months to September 30, 2014, the U.S. dollar
has strengthened by approximately 5% against the Canadian dollar, which has had a positive
effect on the profitability of our Canadian operations. It will, to a lesser extent, put upward
pressure on the portion of our operating costs and capital spending that is denominated in U.S.
dollars.
 
 
 
21     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
We have committed an estimated $2.9 billion on the development of the Fort Hills oil sands
project, of which $421 million has been expended to date. We have access to credit lines which
are expected to be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and working capital needs over this
period. We are taking further steps to manage our capital spending profile and we continuously
monitor all aspects of our cost reduction program, our capital spending and key markets as
conditions evolve.
Capital Expenditures
We have further reduced our sustaining and development capital expenditures through the
deferral of equipment purchases and by reducing spending on certain development projects. As
a result, our original 2014 capital expenditure forecast of $1.9 billion has been reduced by
approximately $375 million to $1.5 billion. Timing of cash expenditures at Fort Hills accounts for
approximately $225 million of the reduction, while the balance relates to our cost reduction
program.
The amount and timing of actual capital expenditures is also dependent upon being able to
secure permits, equipment, supplies, materials and labour on a timely basis and at expected
costs to enable the projects to be completed as currently anticipated. We may change capital
spending plans for the balance of this year and next, depending on commodity markets, our
financial position, results of feasibility studies and other factors.
Our forecast of approved capital expenditures is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion and is
summarized in the following table:

We also expect to spend $700 million on capitalized stripping preparing mining areas for future
production, which is unchanged from our previous guidance.
Foreign Exchange, Debt Revaluation and Interest Expense
The sales of our products are denominated in U.S. dollars, while a significant portion of our
expenses are incurred in local currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar. Foreign exchange
fluctuations can have a significant effect on our operating margins, unless such fluctuations are
offset by related changes to commodity prices.
Our U.S. dollar denominated debt is subject to revaluation based on changes in the
Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. As at September 30, 2014, $6.4 billion of our U.S. dollar
denominated debt is designated as a hedge against our U.S. dollar denominated foreign
operations. As a result, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising on that amount of our U.S.

dollar debt are recorded in other comprehensive income, with the remainder being charged to
profit.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES
We hold a number of financial instruments and derivatives, which are recorded on our balance
sheet at fair value with gains and losses in each period included in other comprehensive income
and profit for the period as appropriate. The most significant of these instruments are marketable
securities, foreign exchange forward sales contracts, metal-related forward contracts and
settlements receivable and payable. Some of our gains and losses on metal-related financial
instruments are affected by smelter price participation and are taken into account in determining
royalties and other expenses. All are subject to varying rates of taxation depending on their
nature and jurisdiction.

OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA
As at October 28, 2014 there were 566.8 million Class B subordinate voting shares and 9.4
million Class A common shares outstanding. In addition, there were 10.7 million director and
employee stock options outstanding with exercise prices ranging between $4.15 and $58.80 per
share. More information on these instruments and the terms of their conversion is set out in Note
20 of our 2013 year end financial statements.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well
designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
Our financial results are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”). This document refers to gross profit before depreciation and amortization,
EBITDA, adjusted profit, adjusted earnings per share, cash unit costs, adjusted cash costs of
sales, cash margins for by-products, adjusted revenue, net debt, debt to debt-plus-equity ratio,
and the net debt to net debt-plus-equity ratio, which are not measures recognized under IFRS in
Canada and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS or Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in the United States.
Gross profit before depreciation and amortization is gross profit with the depreciation and
amortization expense added back. EBITDA is profit attributable to shareholders before net
finance expense, income and resource taxes, and depreciation and amortization. For adjusted
profit, we adjust profit attributable to shareholders as reported to remove the effect of certain types
of transactions that in our judgment are not indicative of our normal operating activities or do not
necessarily occur on a regular basis. This both highlights these items and allows us to analyze
the rest of our results more clearly. We believe that disclosing these measures assists readers in
understanding the cash generating potential of our business in order to provide liquidity to fund
working capital needs, service outstanding debt, fund future capital expenditures and investment
opportunities, and pay dividends.
Gross profit margins before depreciation are gross profit before depreciation and amortization,
divided by revenue for each respective business unit.
Unit costs are calculated by dividing the cost of sales for the principal product by sales volumes.
We include this information as it is frequently requested by investors and investment analysts
who use it to assess our cost structure and margins and compare it to similar information
provided by many companies in our industry.
We sell both copper concentrates and refined copper cathodes. The price for concentrates sold
to smelters is based on average London Metal Exchange prices over a defined quotational
period, from which processing and refining deductions are made. In addition, we are paid for an
agreed percentage of the contained copper in concentrates, which constitutes payable pounds.
Adjusted revenue excludes the revenue from co-products and by-products, but adds back the
processing and refining allowances to arrive at the value of the underlying payable pounds of
copper. Readers may compare this on a per unit basis with the price of copper on the London
Metal Exchange.
Adjusted cash cost of sales is defined as the cost of the product as it leaves the mine, excluding
depreciation and amortization charges. It is common practice in the industry to exclude
depreciation and amortization as these costs are ‘non-cash’ and discounted cash flow valuation
models used in the industry substitute expectations of future capital spending for these amounts.
In order to arrive at adjusted cash costs of sales for copper we also deduct the costs of by-
products and co-products. Total cash unit costs include the smelter and refining allowances
added back in determining adjusted revenue. This presentation allows a comparison of unit
costs, including smelter allowances, to the underlying price of copper in order to assess the
margin. Unit costs, after deducting co-product and by-product margins, are also a common
industry measure. By deducting the co- and by-product margin per unit of the principal product,
the margin for the mine on a per unit basis may be presented in a single metric for comparison to
other operations. Readers should be aware that this metric, by excluding certain items and
 
 
 
 
 
 
31     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
reclassifying cost and revenue items, distorts our actual production costs as determined under
GAAP.
Net debt is total debt less cash and cash equivalents. The debt to debt-plus-equity ratio takes
total debt as reported and divides that by the sum of total debt plus total equity. The net debt to
net debt-plus-equity ratio is net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus total equity, expressed
as a percentage. These measures are disclosed as we believe they provide readers with
information that allows them to assess our credit capacity and the ability to meet our short and
long-term financial obligations.
The measures described above do not have standardized meanings under IFRS, may differ from
those used by other issuers, and may not be comparable to such measures as reported by
others. These measures have been derived from our financial statements and applied on a
consistent basis as appropriate. We disclose these measures because we believe they assist
readers in understanding the results of our operations and financial position and are meant to
provide further information about our financial results to investors. These measures should not be
considered in isolation or used in substitute for other measures of performance prepared in
accordance with IFRS.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This news release contains certain forward-looking information and forward-looking statements
as defined in applicable securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical fact are
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, principally under the headings
“Outlook,” that appear in this release but also elsewhere in this document, include estimates,
forecasts, and statements as to management’s expectations with respect to, among other things,
anticipated costs and production at our business units and individual operations and expectation
that we will meet our production guidance, sales volume and selling prices for our products
(including settlement of coal contracts with customers), plans and expectations for our
development projects, expected progress, costs and outcomes of our various projects and
investments, including but not limited to those described in the discussions of our operations, the
potential savings that may be realized under our cost reduction program, the impact of currency
exchange rates, the expected timing of restarting the Pend Oreille zinc operation, the expected
timing of production at the Fort Hills oil sands project, expectations regarding fourth quarter coal
sales levels and cost of product sold, forecast copper unit costs, the amount of our portion of the
2014 expenditures for the Fort Hills oil sands project, the expectation that the Fort Hills oil sands
project will provide us with significant cash flows and the life of the project, the Frontier
application timing milestones, costs associated with our Elk Valley water management and
timing of approval of our Elk Valley Water Quality Plan, anticipated capital expenditures,
expectations that we have sufficient credit capacity to meet capital commitments and working
capital over the next four years, and demand and market outlook for commodities. These forward-
looking statements involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties and actual results
may vary materially.
These statements are based on a number of assumptions, including, but not limited to,
assumptions regarding general business and economic conditions, the supply and demand for,
deliveries of, and the level and volatility of prices of, zinc, copper and coal and other primary
metals and minerals as well as oil, and related products, the timing of the receipt of regulatory
and governmental approvals for our development projects and other operations, our costs of
production and production and productivity levels, as well as those of our competitors, power
prices, continuing availability of water and power resources for our operations, market
competition, the accuracy of our reserve estimates (including with respect to size, grade and
recoverability) and the geological, operational and price assumptions on which these are based,
conditions in financial markets, the future financial performance of the company, our ability to
attract and retain skilled staff, our ability to procure equipment and operating supplies, positive
results from the studies on our expansion projects, our coal and other product inventories, our
ability to secure adequate transportation for our products, our ability to obtain permits for our
operations and expansions, our ongoing relations with our employees and business partners and
joint venturers. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive. Events or circumstances
could cause actual results to vary materially.
Factors that may cause actual results to vary materially include, but are not limited to, changes in
commodity and power prices, changes in market demand for our products, changes in interest
and currency exchange rates, acts of foreign governments and the outcome of legal proceedings,
inaccurate geological and metallurgical assumptions (including with respect to the size, grade
and recoverability of mineral reserves and resources), unanticipated operational difficulties
(including failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications or
expectations, cost escalation, unavailability of materials and equipment, government action or
delays in the receipt of government approvals, industrial disturbances or
 
 
 
36     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
other job action, adverse weather conditions and unanticipated events related to health, safety
and environmental matters), union labour disputes, political risk, social unrest, failure of
customers or counterparties to perform their contractual obligations, changes in our credit ratings,
unanticipated increases in costs to construct our development projects, difficulty in obtaining
permits, inability to address concerns regarding permits of environmental impact assessments,
and changes or further deterioration in general economic conditions. Our Fort Hills project is not
controlled by us and construction and production schedules may be adjusted by our partners.
Statements concerning future production costs or volumes are based on numerous assumptions
of management regarding operating matters and on assumptions that demand for products
develops as anticipated, that customers and other counterparties perform their contractual
obligations, that operating and capital plans will not be disrupted by issues such as mechanical
failure, unavailability of parts and supplies, labour disturbances, interruption in transportation or
utilities, adverse weather conditions, and that there are no material unanticipated variations in the
cost of energy or supplies. Statements regarding anticipated coal sales volumes and average
coal prices for the quarter depend on timely arrival of vessels and performance of our coal-
loading facilities, as well as the level of spot pricing sales.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
We prepare our annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (“IASB”). These condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”).
 
These condensed interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies
and methods of application as our most recent annual financial statements. Accordingly, they
should be read in conjunction with our most recent annual financial statements. The Board of
Directors approved these financial statements for issue on October 28, 2014.
2. NEW IFRS PRONOUNCEMENTS
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014, the IASB and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) completed its
joint project to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue
standard for IFRS and United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP”). As
a result of the joint project, the IASB issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(“IFRS 15”). IFRS 15 establishes principles to address the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers.
IFRS 15 will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017, with early
adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the effect of this standard on our financial
statements.
Financial Instruments
The IASB issued its completed version of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (“IFRS 9”) in July 2014.
The completed standard provides revised guidance on the classification and measurement of
financial assets. It also introduces a new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment
for financial assets. The new hedging guidance that was issued in November 2013 is
incorporated into this new final standard.
This final version of IFRS 9 will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,
2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the effect of this standard on our
financial statements.

7. INCOME AND RESOURCE TAXES
a) Internal Reorganization
During the first quarter, we completed an internal reorganization that transferred certain mining
assets previously held by our wholly-owned subsidiaries to the parent company. This had the
effect of reclassifying approximately $260 million from our deferred tax liabilities to our deferred
tax assets.
b) Chile Tax Reform
In the quarter, the Chilean Government enacted a comprehensive tax reform bill. We have
adjusted our deferred tax liability related to our Chilean operations and investments based on the
legislated tax rates we expect to apply, resulting in a non-cash charge to profit of $64 million.

EQUITY
a) Share-Based Compensation
During the first three quarters of 2014, we granted 3,205,905 Class B subordinate voting share
options to employees. These options have a weighted average exercise price of $26.22, a term
of 10 years and vest in equal amounts over three years. The weighted average fair value of Class
B subordinate voting share options issued was estimated at $7.36 per share option at the grant
date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The option valuations were based on an
average expected option life of 4 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.62%, a dividend yield of
3.43% and an expected volatility of 41%.
During the first three quarters of 2014, we issued 1,016,601 deferred, restricted and performance
share units to employees and directors. Deferred, restricted and performance share units issued
vest immediately for directors and vest in three years for employees. Furthermore, the
performance share units have a performance vesting criterion that may increase or decrease the
number of units ultimately vested. The total number of deferred, restricted and performance share
units outstanding at September 30, 2014 was 3,566,833.
A share-based compensation expense (recovery) of $3 million (2013 - $19 million) and $16
million (2013 - $13 million) was recorded for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2014, respectively, in respect of all outstanding share options and units.

c) Normal Course Issuer Bids
On occasion, we purchase and cancel Class B subordinate voting shares pursuant to normal
course issuer bids that allow us to purchase up to a specified maximum number of shares over a
one-year period.
In July 2014, we renewed our normal course issuer bid, under which we may purchase up to 20
million Class B subordinate voting shares during the period starting July 2, 2014 and ending on
July 1, 2015. To date in 2014, no shares have been purchased under this bid and 200,000
shares have been repurchased pursuant to our previous issuer bid.

9. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Based on the principal products we produce and our development projects, we have five
reportable segments - coal, copper, zinc, energy and corporate - which is the way we report
information to our Chief Executive Officer. The corporate segment includes all of our initiatives in
other commodities, our corporate growth activities and groups that provide administrative,
technical, financial and other support to all of our business units. Other operating expenses
include general and administration costs, exploration, research and development, and other
operating income (expense). Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length.

10. CONTINGENCIES
We consider provisions for all our outstanding and pending legal claims to be adequate. The
final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending as at September 30, 2014, or with
respect to future claims, cannot be predicted with certainty. Significant contingencies not
disclosed elsewhere in the notes to our financial statements are as follows:
Upper Columbia River Basin
Teck American Inc. (“TAI”) continues studies under the 2006 settlement agreement with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to conduct a remedial investigation on the Upper
Columbia River in Washington State.
The Lake Roosevelt litigation involving Teck Metal Ltd. (“TML”) in the Federal District Court for
the Eastern District of Washington continues. In September 2012, TML entered into an
agreement with the plaintiffs, agreeing that certain facts were established for purposes of the
litigation. The agreement stipulates that some portion of the slag discharged from our Trail
Operations into the Columbia River between 1896 and 1995, and some portion of the effluent
discharged from Trail Operations, have been transported to and are present in the Upper
Columbia River in the United States, and that some hazardous substances from the slag and
effluent have been released into the environment within the United States. In December 2012,
the Court found in favour of the plaintiffs in phase one of the case, issuing a declaratory judgment
that TML is liable under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (“CERCLA”) for response costs, the amount of which will be determined in a
subsequent phase of the case.
 
 
 
50     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
Teck Resources Limited
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
10. CONTINGENCIES, continued
In October 2013, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation filed an omnibus motion
with the District Court seeking an order stating that they are permitted to seek recovery from TML
for environmental response costs, and in a subsequent proceeding, natural resource damages
and assessment costs, arising from the alleged deposition of hazardous substances in the United
States from aerial emissions from TML's Trail Operations. Prior allegations by the Tribes related
solely to solid and liquid materials discharged to the Columbia River. The motion does not state
the amount of response costs allegedly attributable to aerial emissions, nor did it attempt to
define the extent of natural resource damages, if any, attributable to past smelter operations. In
December 2013, the District Court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have
subsequently filed amended pleadings in relation to air emissions, and TML has filed a
responsive motion to strike the air claims on the basis that CERCLA does not apply to air
emissions in the manner proposed by the plaintiffs. The Court has ruled in favour of plaintiffs and
TML has filed a motion seeking reconsideration of that decision.
A hearing with respect to liability in connection with air emissions, if that claim survives, and past
response costs is now expected to take place in December 2015 and a subsequent hearing, with
respect to claims for natural resource damages and assessment costs, is expected to follow,
assuming the remedial investigation and feasibility study being undertaken by TAI are
completed, which is now expected to occur in 2017.
There is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in our defence of the litigation or that
we or our affiliates will not be faced with further liability in relation to this matter. Until the studies
contemplated by the EPA settlement agreement and additional damage assessments are
completed, it is not possible to estimate the extent and cost, if any, of remediation or restoration
that may be required or to assess our potential liability for damages. The studies may conclude,
on the basis of risk, cost, technical feasibility or other grounds, that no remediation should be
undertaken. If remediation is required and damage to resources found, the cost of remediation
may be material.
11. SEASONALITY OF SALES
Due to ice conditions, the port serving our Red Dog mine is normally only able to ship
concentrates from July to October each year. As a result, zinc and lead concentrate sales
volumes are generally higher in the third and fourth quarter of each year than in the first and
second quarter.
12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Certain of our financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and
classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. Certain non-financial assets and liabilities may also be measured at fair value on
a non-recurring basis. There are three levels of the fair value hierarchy that prioritize the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value, with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority.
The levels and the valuation techniques used to value our financial assets and liabilities are
described below:
Level 1 – Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for
identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
 
Marketable equity securities are valued using quoted market prices in active markets.
Accordingly, these items are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
 
 
 
51     Teck Resources Limited 2014 Third Quarter News Release
Teck Resources Limited
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, continued
Level 2 – Significant Other Observable Inputs
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability.
Derivative instruments are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using
pricing models or discounted cash flow models. These models require a variety of inputs,
including, but not limited to, contractual terms, market prices, forward price curves, yield curves,
and credit spreads. The significant inputs are obtained from or corroborated with market data.
Also included in Level 2 are settlements receivable and settlements payable from provisional
pricing on concentrate sales and purchases because they are valued using quoted market prices
for forward curves for copper, zinc and lead.
Level 3 – Significant Unobservable Inputs
Unobservable (supported by little or no market activity) prices.
We include investments in debt securities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they
trade infrequently and have little price transparency. We review the fair value of these
instruments periodically and estimate an impairment charge based on management’s best
estimates, which are unobservable inputs.
The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 are summarized in the following table:
