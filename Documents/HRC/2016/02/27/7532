<p><b>  Mission to Greece</b>* <b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention undertook a visit to Greece from  
21 to 31 January 2013. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Working Group commends the Government of Greece 
for a number of positive initiatives, particularly legislative reforms, to improve the 
situation of deprivation of liberty. It found positive developments in, inter alia, the area 
of migration and asylum. The Working Group also notes the work carried out by the 
police and the Hellenic Coast Guard in combating trafficking in human beings. 
</p>
<p> During its visit, the Working Group found that the legislative developments were 
not always followed by effective implementation in practice. 
</p>
<p> With regard to criminal justice, there is a constitutional provision that establishes 
that pretrial detention may not exceed a period of one year in the case of felonies and six 
months in the case of misdemeanours. The Working Group, however, observed the 
relatively long periods spent by the accused in pretrial detention, sometimes several 
years. This is one of the main reasons for the serious overcrowding in Greek prisons, 
which has intensified and is now a chronic problem. 
</p>
<p> The border shared with Turkey is currently one of the main points of irregular 
border crossings into Europe, in large part owing to its geographical location, at the

<p>south-east border of the European Union, and its proximity to countries that are, or have 
been, experiencing serious conflict. The Working Group found that up to 90 per cent of 
undocumented migrants from Asia and Africa enter the European Union via Greece. 
Concerning the situation of migrants in Greece, it notes that many of them are in a semi-
legal status, holding expired residency permits while going through the process of 
renewal.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group noted with concern the policy of the Government of Greece 
of systematically detaining all irregular migrants detected entering Greek territory, 
including families and unaccompanied minors. It highlights the excessive duration of 
detention of both irregular migrants and asylum seekers for up to 18 months if the person 
refuses to cooperate or if there are delays in obtaining the necessary documentation. In 
many instances, refusal to cooperate or the delays in obtaining necessary documentation 
could not be attributed to the migrant in question but rather to the consular authorities, or 
to legal or practical obstacles.  
</p>
<p> The Working Group points out that the non-application of alternatives to 
detention, lack of effective judicial review, and the excessive length of detention may 
render the detention of an individual arbitrary. 
</p>
<p> In most detention facilities visited by the Working Group, conditions were well 
below international human rights standards, including in terms of severe overcrowding. 
In detention centres for asylum seekers, the conditions are often appalling and 
unhygienic, and facilities were in a poor state of repair. 
</p>
<p> During its visit, the Working Group also learned about numerous round-up 
operations where the police would detain foreigners and members of the Roma 
community who are Greek citizens and release them soon after without charge. In this 
regard, the Working Group recalls that any detention on discriminatory grounds 
constitutes arbitrary detention, and furthermore, that detention without any legal basis 
also renders the detention arbitrary.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention conducted an official visit to Greece 
from 21 to 31 January 2013, following an invitation received from the Government. The 
delegation was composed of Mads Andenas (Norway) and 
Vladimir Tochilovsky (Ukraine). The members of the Working Group were accompanied 
by the Secretary of the Working Group, another staff member of the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and two interpreters. 
</p><p>2. The Working Group thanks the Government of Greece for its invitation to the 
Working Group and for its full cooperation throughout the visit. It also thanks the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the representatives of 
Greek civil society for their support during the visit. 
</p>
<p>3. Throughout the visit and in all respects, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest 
cooperation of the Government and all authorities contacted, which provided the delegation 
with all the information required and arranged all the meetings it requested. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Programme of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Working Group held various meetings with representatives of the State, and 
expresses its appreciation for the valuable information they provided. It met with senior 
authorities from the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the State, including the 
Minister for Public Order and Citizens&#8217; Protection, the Alternate Minister of the Interior, 
the Deputy Minister for National Defence, the Secretary-General for Anti-Crime Policy of 
the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights, the Director of the First 
Reception Service, the Chief of the Hellenic Coast Guard of the Ministry of Shipping, 
Maritime Affairs and the Aegean; the Head of the Legal Department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the Head of the Department on Protection of Refugees and Asylum of the 
Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Welfare, and senior officials of various ministries 
and local authorities on the Aegean island of Samos, in Orestiada and in Thessaloniki.  
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group also met with Members of Parliament, the Ombudsman, 
representatives of the National Commission for Human Rights, and representatives of bar 
associations, international organizations and Greek civil society. 
</p>
<p>6. With regard to the judiciary, the Working Group met with a Magistrate of the 
Supreme Court of Civil and Penal Law (Areios Paghos), the Vice-Public Prosecutor of the 
Supreme Court of Civil and Penal Law, the President of the High Court of Athens, the 
Head of the Public Prosecutors Office of the High Court of Athens, the Vice-Public 
Prosecutor of the Court of Appeals of Athens and with first instance judges and 
prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group visited a number of places where persons are deprived of their 
liberty. It visited the Korydallos Prison, including its psychiatric ward, in Athens, the local 
prison of Thessaloniki and the Komotini Prison in the Rodopi regional unit, as well as 
police holding cells in Athens, on the island of Samos, in Alexandroupolis and Orestiada. It 
also visited a number of detention facilities for irregular migrants and asylum seekers, 
including Thessaloniki Detention Centre, Filakio Detention Centre and Soufli Border Guard 
Station in the Evros region bordering Turkey, and Komotini Detention Centre in the 
neighbouring Rodopi regional unit. It further met with and interviewed detainees in all 
above-mentioned facilities, in private and without the presence of guards or witnesses.  </p>

<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Working Group points out that it was allowed to visit all places of detention 
that it had requested.  
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group also met with representatives of United Nations agencies. The 
visit concluded with a debriefing with the Government on the preliminary observations of 
the Working Group, and a press conference. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Institutional and legal frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political, administrative and judicial structure 
</b>10. Greece is a constitutional republic based on a parliamentary democracy and on the 
principle of separation of powers. Its 300-seat Parliament (Vouli) is unicameral.  
11. The country has a solid judiciary, composed of independent magistrates and judges. 
The Constitution guarantees the independence of judges and prosecutors. The judicial 
system consists of three levels of criminal courts - first instance judges (divided into 
misdemeanour and felony divisions), appeals courts and the Supreme Court of Justice &#8211; as 
well as three levels of civil courts - first instance judges, appeals courts and the Supreme 
Court of Justice - and an examining magistrate system.  
</p>
<p>12. There is a military jurisdiction, not only for military offences, but for any offence 
against the Penal Code, the Military Penal Code or any special penal legislation committed 
by a member of the armed forces (army, navy or air force), including the coast guard. It is 
composed of military judges and military prosecutors. Defence lawyers are civilians. 
Sentences issued by military courts are served in civilian prisons.  
</p>
<p>13.  The Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights is responsible for the 
correctional system. All police forces are under the authority of the Ministry of Public 
Order and Citizens&#8217; Protection and the Ministry of Justice are also responsible for the 
protection of migrants.  
</p>
<p>14. The Greek Ombudsman and the National Commission for Human Rights are 
mandated to protect and promote human rights. There are five deputy ombudsmen at the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s office: one for human rights; one for children&#8217;s rights; one for health care 
and social welfare; one for State-citizen relations; and one for quality of life issues.  
</p>
<p>15. The National Commission for Human Rights, created in 1998, is an independent 
advisory body directly subject to the Prime Minister, operating in accordance with the Paris 
Principles. It has &#8220;A&#8221; status accreditation with the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Human Rights Institutions. The Commission is composed of representatives of 
labour unions, political parties civil society organizations and of six ministries. Committee 
members are requested to, inter alia, submit comments on bills. 
</p>
<p>16. The Prison Inspectorate is a semi-autonomous body headed by a judge that inspects 
prisons and makes recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. International human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>17. According to article 28, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, international treaties 
ratified by Greece are an integral part of domestic Greek law, and have precedence over 
any conflicting provision of the law.  
</p>
<p>18. With regard to the protection of human rights, Greece has ratified most of the major 
international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Optional Protocol thereto. 
</p>
<p>19. Greece is also a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. It 
is not a party to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Forced Disappearance, the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights or the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. 
</p>
<p>20. Greece has adhered to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
Crime of Genocide, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol 
thereto, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, the Geneva Conventions 
and the Protocols additional thereto, the fundamental conventions of the International 
Labour Organization, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the Protocol 
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.  
</p>
<p><b> C. National legislation 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Constitution guarantees respect for and protection of the value of the human 
being (art. 2); full protection of life, honour and liberty, irrespective of nationality, race or 
language, religious or political beliefs for all persons living within Greek territory (art. 5, 
para. 2); and the inviolability of personal liberty (art. 5, para. 3). Furthermore, the 
Constitution provides for freedom of opinion, expression, speech and the press.  
</p>
<p>22. The Constitution prohibits torture, any bodily maltreatment, impairment of health 
or the use of psychological violence, and any other offence against human dignity, which is 
punishable as provided by law (art. 7, para. 2). Every person is entitled to receive legal 
protection by the courts and may plead before them his or her views concerning personal 
rights or interests, as specified by law (art. 20, para. 1). The right of a person to a prior 
hearing also applies in any administrative action or measure adopted at the expense of the 
person&#8217;s rights or interests (art. 20, para. 2). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Judicial guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention: no person may be arrested 
or imprisoned without a reasoned judicial warrant, which must be served at the moment of 
arrest or detention pending trial, except when caught in the act of committing a crime (art. 
6, para. 1). The Constitution also guarantees respect for the right to a fair trial. 
</p><p>24.  Trials are public, although judges may order restrictions on press coverage. 
Defendants have the right to counsel. Strict rules of evidence apply in court, and witnesses 
are subject to cross examination. Bail is sometimes available for those who have committed 
minor offences, including minor drug offences. Depending on the seriousness of the 
offence, a detainee may be held in remand for up to one year. Detainees are not allowed to 
make or receive telephone calls, but may write and receive letters. They are allowed one 
visit a week, and have unlimited access to their defence lawyer.  
</p>
<p>25. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and may appeal a court decision to 
a higher court. Juries are generally used in felony cases, although the law allows for the 
denial of the right to a jury in cases of violent terrorism. Defendants may present witnesses </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>and evidence on their behalf, and question witnesses testifying against them. They have 
access to evidence relevant to their cases held by the authorities . 
</p>
<p>26. According to article 87 of the Penal Code and article 371.4 of the Criminal 
Procedural Code, the term of pretrial detention and the time between the arrest and the 
order of pretrial detention is deducted from the sentence.  
</p>
<p>27. Persons who have been detained on remand and subsequently acquitted are entitled 
to request compensation if it has been established in the proceedings that they did not 
commit the criminal offence for which they were detained (Criminal Procedure Code, art. 
533.2).  
</p>
<p><b> E. Deprivation of liberty of mentally ill persons 
</b></p>
<p>28. A specific and complete legislative framework is in force that allows for 
involuntary placements in psychiatric institutions (law 2071/1992, arts. 96 to 99). A 
programme on mental health reform, initiated in 1994, had the main outcome of abolishing 
most psychiatric institutions. Most chronic patients now live in small residences across the 
country. Psychiatric units are integrated into general hospitals.  
</p>
<p>29.  The number of involuntary placement in psychiatric institutions has, however, 
dramatically increased in recent years, mainly as a consequence of the economic and 
financial crisis.  
</p>
<p>30.  Patients may only be interned in psychiatric institutions by order of a judge. Judges 
must support their decision on the basis of an analysis conducted jointly by an external 
psychiatrist and a medical doctor from the psychiatric institution. According to law, the 
detention is to be reviewed every two years, although this rarely occurs in practice. The 
patient may only leave the institution when a release order has been issued by a judge. 
Patients whose treatment has been completed receive follow-up attention from their 
doctors. 
</p>
<p><b> F. General background on migration 
</b></p>
<p>31. Greece has 18,000 km of coast and 9,000 islands. Its border with Turkey is 
currently one of the main points of irregular border crossings into Europe, in large part due 
to its geographical location, at the south-east border of the European Union, and its 
proximity with countries that are, or have been, experiencing serious conflict. It is 
estimated that up to 90 per cent of undocumented migrants from Asia and Africa enter the 
European Union via Greece. In 2012, 421 people were put in detention in a single day for 
having illegally crossed the border. A barbed wire fence was subsequently built along 12.5 
km of the country&#8217;s mainland borders with Turkey in the Prefecture of Evros.  
</p>
<p>32.  Since the visit of the Working Group to Greece, the European Union has agreed on 
new rules; for example, Regulation 604/2013 came into force on 1 January 2014. The 
regulation maintains the main criteria for defining the Member State responsible for 
examining an application for international protection, and therefore continues to overburden 
the Greek asylum system. 
</p>
<p>33. From 1 August to 31 December 2012, 3,280 immigrants and 38 traffickers were 
detained at the eastern sea borders. Some 1,528 were from Afghanistan and 1,067 from the 
Syrian Arab Republic. In the Evros region, 36,000 people entered Greek territory illegally 
in 2010, an increase over the 28,000 in 2011 and the 23,000 in 2012. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>34. Persons detained for illegal entry into Greek territory are subjected to screening by 
the police force, with the support of the European agency Frontex, in order to establish their 
identity and country of origin, and to take photographs and fingerprints. They are subjected 
to a medical examination and, according to the laws of the European Union and of Greece, 
are informed about their rights. The police force concentrates its efforts on dismantling 
traffic networks. 
</p>
<p>35. Law No. 3386/2005 governs migration, regulating the entry, residence and social 
integration of third-country nationals in Greece, as well as issues raised by migrants 
entering in an irregular situation. According to article 83.1 of the law, illegal entry is a 
criminal offence punishable by imprisonment of at least three months and a fine of at least 
&#8364;1,500. Law No. 3907/2011 was promulgated to simplify the repatriation procedures of 
those already in Greek territory. According to the Government, national legislation is 
aligned fully with European Union laws and directives.  
</p>
<p>36. With regard to the situation of migrants in Greece, the Working Group was 
informed that many of them had semi-legal status, holding expired residency permits while 
undergoing the process of permit renewal.  
</p>
<p>37. At the time of the visit by the Working Group, no fair and effective asylum 
determination procedures system was in place. Since the visit, however, the asylum system 
has undergone many changes. A new asylum service and an appeals authority were 
established under Law No. 3907/2011, which came into force on 26 January 2011. The Law 
provides for the establishment of a first reception service and the adaptation of national 
legislation to European Union Directive 2008/115/EC on the return of irregular migrants. 
The Government reported that the new asylum service, the appeals authority and the first 
reception service are now fully operational. The n asylum service, which commenced its 
activities on 7 June 2013, is the first autonomous facility in Greece to be in charge of 
examining international protection claims. It comprises a central office, in Athens, and 13 
regional asylum offices. 
</p>
<p>38. The Working Group was informed that, at the Attika Police Directorate in Athens, 
only 20 applications for asylum a week were registered by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>39. During the summer of 2012, Greece launched operation Aspida (&#8220;shield&#8221;) on the 
land border with Turkey, and operation Xenios Zeus, a crackdown on irregular migrants 
residing in Athens and elsewhere. The sweep operations in the context of operation Xenios 
Zeus had led to mass arrests and detention, including of migrants in a regular situation and 
others who had been living and working in Greece for several years. The Working Group 
also learned that the police had detained members of the Roma community with Greek 
citizenship in the course of such operations, and had released them soon after without 
charge. In this regard, the Working Group recalls that any detention on discriminatory 
grounds constitutes arbitrary detention, and that detention without any legal basis also 
renders the detention arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>40. According to the Government, the above-mentioned police operations had had a 
positive impact on the protection of the human rights of those irregularly entering and 
residing in Greece, since they allowed the police and other relevant services to evaluate and 
handle more effectively the needs of immigrants in an irregular situation, and to offer them 
shelter in places with decent conditions while their cases were being examined.  
</p>
<p>41. Although the Government considers that the exact number of those who reside 
illegally in Greece cannot be estimated, other sources estimate that there are around 
470,000 migrants in an irregular situation living in the country. For the overwhelming 
majority, Greece is not their final destination, but merely their point of entry to the 
European Union and the Schengen zone. Many irregular migrants had, however, remained 
in Greece because they were prevented from moving on to other European countries owing </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>to European Union regulations. The Dublin system prohibited any improvement of 
balancing the protection of asylum seekers and the burden put on Member States. While 
Regulation 604/2013 is considered a pivotal moment for having established the Common 
European Asylum System, how the responsibility for refugee protection is shifted from the 
southern and eastern regions of the European Union to other Member States remains to be 
seen.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Findings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Positive aspects 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Working Group commends the Government of Greece for the positive efforts it 
has made, particularly through legislative reforms, to improve the situation of deprivation 
of liberty in Greece. In the area of migration and asylum, such positive initiatives include, 
in particular, the adoption of Presidential Decree No. 114/2010 amending the previous 
legislation on the asylum procedure, and setting, for a transitional period, appropriate 
standards and safeguards for the fair and efficient examination of applications for asylum; 
and the adoption of a comprehensive law (No. 3907/2011) providing for the establishment 
of a new asylum service independent of the police, to take over gradually full responsibility 
for asylum issues. 
</p>
<p>43.  In 2011, a new first reception service was established as an autonomous body 
reporting to the Ministry of Public Order and Citizens&#8217; Protection. Its main task is to 
establish first reception centres at the borders according to international standards. When 
undocumented migrants arrive in the country, the service prepares a needs assessment; 
migrants are identified, and their origin and nationality determined. All persons are arriving 
are sorted into a pre-established category; asylum seekers are identified then registered. 
New arrivals will be informed on their lodgings, and their rights and duties. Undocumented 
migrants stay at the first reception centres solely for a short period only (a maximum of 15 
days, with the possible extension of 10 days).  
</p><p>44. The Working Group also notes the work carried out by the police and the Hellenic 
Coast Guard in combating trafficking in human beings.  
</p>
<p>45. Despite these positive achievements, the Working Group notes a number of issues 
that are of particular concern and draw the Government&#8217;s attention to them. In the course of 
its visit, the Working Group found that legislative developments are not always followed up 
by effective implementation in practice.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Criminal justice 
</b>46. The Constitution requires a judicial warrant for an arrest, except when it is made 
during the commission of a crime (<i>in flagrante delicto</i>). This provision is usually respected. 
The law also prohibits arbitrary arrest orders.  
</p>
<p>47. The police are responsible for law enforcement and maintaining order. They are 
required to bring detainees before an examining magistrate within 24 hours. The magistrate 
has a maximum of 72 hours to issue a detention warrant or to order the detainee&#8217;s release, 
unless special circumstances justify a two-day extension of the time limit. 
</p><p>48.  Article 18 of the Penal Code divides offences into felonies, misdemeanours and 
petty offences. In general terms, felonies are punished with penitentiary sentences, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>misdemeanours with correctional punishment and petty offences by fines or pecuniary 
penalties. 
</p>
<p>49. Offences are prosecuted exclusively by the public prosecutor. In the case of a 
felony, the public prosecutor orders an investigation, which is carried out by an 
investigating judge. In the case of a misdemeanour, the public prosecutor orders a 
preliminary summary investigation, carried out by an investigating official. A direct call to 
appear before the court is provided for petty offences. 
</p>
<p>50. Article 6, paragraph 4 of the Constitution establishes that pretrial detention may not 
exceed a period of one year in the case of felonies and six months in the case of 
misdemeanours. In exceptional cases, the maximum duration may be extended by six (if the 
sanction is 20 years of imprisonment or more) or three months, respectively. The article 
also provides that exceeding the maximum duration of detention pending trial by successive 
application of this measure for separate acts referring to the same case is prohibited. 
</p>
<p>51. A panel of judges may release detainees pending trial, either with or without bail. 
The Working Group observed, however, relatively long periods spent by the accused in 
pretrial detention, sometimes as much as several years, despite the above-mentioned 
constitutional provision. Courts are reportedly overburdened and understaffed. Many judges 
call work stoppages to protest against salary and pension cuts, which further increases the 
backlog. Lawyers complained before the Working Group that judges make excessive use of 
pretrial detention, which is often too long. The Working Group found that pretrial detainees 
made up 31 per cent of those incarcerated. With regard to the police, a report issued in 2010 
by the Internal Affairs Unit noted an increase in corruption cases.  
</p>
<p>52. According to the practice of the Working Group, the non-application of alternatives 
to detention, lack of effective judicial review, and the excessive length of detention may 
render the detention of an individual arbitrary. The Working Group was informed that, 
although alternative sentencing for non-violent offenders was available, courts did not use 
their prerogative.  
</p>
<p>53. Defendants have the right to legal counsel. In felony cases, the bar association is to 
provide defendants with a lawyer if they prove that they cannot afford legal counsel. 
Defendants brought to court on the day following the alleged commission of a 
misdemeanour may be tried immediately under an expedited procedure. Legal safeguards, 
including representation by legal counsel, apply in such procedures; however, the Working 
Group received allegations that such procedures may undermine the basic rights of 
defendants owing to the brevity and rapidity of the trial. The Working Group received 
information that the short time available limits the ability of defendants to present an 
adequate defence. Government-held evidence is not made available consistently. In 
addition, the law imposes excessive restrictions on appeals.  
</p>
<p>54. According to the provisions of the national legislation, the presence of a lawyer is 
required by law at every stage of a penal procedure. The Working Group, however, 
received allegations that police agents often fail to inform detainees about their rights to 
contact family members and to consult a lawyer of their choice. Police officers often 
question suspects without giving them access to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>55. Free legal defence is guaranteed for penal and civil cases, but not for administrative 
ones. Lawyers complained that the fees were very low, sometimes not compensating for 
their travel expenses, and that they were paid with considerable delay. 
</p>
<p>56. National law provides for proper safeguards for persons charged with criminal 
offences at the pretrial stage. Article 33 of Ministerial Decree No. 58819/7.4.2003 
stipulates the procedures followed whenever a detainee cannot afford to exercise her or his 
right to a defence. The Working Group, however, found serious discrepancies between the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>legal requirements and the actual application of some of these safeguards. For instance, 
according to national law, anyone charged with a felony has the right to have assigned legal 
assistance without payment, if the person charged does not have sufficient means to pay for 
it. In felony cases, the bar association is to provide the defendants who prove that they 
cannot afford legal counsel with a lawyer. Most detainees indeed indicated that they did not 
have a lawyer because they could not afford one. Very few were aware of the right to free 
legal assistance. 
</p>
<p>57. A number of detainees who had chosen to engage a lawyer at their own expense 
complained that the lawyers simply took their money (between &#8364;200 and &#8364;600) then 
disappeared. Information leaflets on the rights of detainees found in detention facilities 
were very vague and referred only to the detainee&#8217;s right to contact a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>58. The presence of an interpreter is legislated. According to the Government, efforts 
were being made to cover the needs of interpretation in all relevant services by interpreters 
appointed either by the State or by non-governmental organizations. The Working Group, 
however, received complaints from foreigners that they did not have access to a court-
appointed interpreter.  
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group noted with particular concern the situation of detainees after 
round-up operations carried out by police raids in the streets and public places. In many 
cases, these individuals had been arrested following a racial profile; they were not informed 
about their rights or about the reason for their detention. In police stations, they were not 
entitled to inform their relatives or to contact a defence lawyer.  
</p>
<p>60. The Working Group also received allegations that Roma experienced difficulties in 
gaining access to justice, and faced long delays in civil cases. Some Roma alleged having 
been victim of discriminatory attitudes and language directed against them in court.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Detention of migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p>61. The detention of migrants is regulated by Law No. 3386/2005, in the case of those 
detained upon entry at an external border, and Law No. 3907/2011, which implements the 
European Union Returns Directive for those detained while already residing in Greece. The 
Working Group noted that Law No. 3907/2011, if properly implemented, would provide 
more safeguards for migrants than Law No. 3386/2005, because it included the provision of 
alternatives to detention.  
</p>
<p>62.  Law No. 3386/2005 allows for the detention of irregular migrants pending their 
deportation if they have infringed the provisions of the said law (art. 76.3). Law No. 
3907/2011 provides for migrants who are subject to return procedures to be detained 
pending their return and enforcement of the removal procedure, unless other sufficient, less 
coercive measures can be implemented in a specific case (art. 30.1). During its visit, 
however, the Working Group learned that, in practice, no &#8220;less coercive&#8221; measures exist; 
migrants are routinely detained also under Law No. 3907/2011. In most cases, the 
authorities consider that being in an irregular situation automatically constitutes sufficient 
reason for detention.  
</p>
<p>63.  Law No. 4075/2012 amended Presidential Decree 114/2010 and Law No. 
3386/2005, providing for migrants and asylum seekers to also be detained if they represent 
&#8220;a danger to public health&#8221; if they are &#8220;suffering from an infectious disease&#8221;, &#8220;belong to 
groups vulnerable to infectious diseases&#8221; or are living in conditions that do not meet 
&#8220;minimum standards of hygiene&#8221;. The Working Group concurs with the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants that these measures are discriminatory and target the most 
vulnerable migrants, and lead to even more stigmatization. Furthermore, the majority of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>medical problems of migrants in detention are caused by or directly linked to their 
conditions of detention in Greece. 
</p>
<p>64.  The police conduct large-scale round-up operations and temporarily detain 
hundreds of foreigners, sometimes in crowded and dirty conditions, while determining their 
residency status. The Working Group is aware of the recent findings of the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants in relation to sweep operations in the context of 
operation Xenios Zeus, which had led to widespread detention of migrants in different parts 
of the country, many of whom have lived and worked in Greece for years.1 The operation 
was conducted in public places, in particular in buses and metro stations. Between August 
and November 2012, 54,751 foreigners, including tourists, were temporarily detained. It 
was alleged that detention was motivated by the physical appearance of these individuals. 
Of that number, 4,000 foreigners were found to be in an irregular migratory situation, while 
the others were released.  
</p>
<p>65. Some foreigners complained to the Working Group about the deliberate destruction 
of their residence permits by police agents during routine identity checks in the street or 
during house searches.  
</p>
<p>66.  The Working Group deeply regrets the policy the Government of systematically 
detaining all irregular migrants detected entering the territory of Greece, including families 
and unaccompanied children, as well as the sweep operations and subsequent detentions in 
the context of operation Xenios Zeus. Owing to limited detention capacity, in some parts of 
the country migrants are released relatively quickly and issued with an order to leave the 
country. This is particularly the case for families with children arriving in the Aegean 
islands. Several pre-removal centres were built in 2012 and 2013, and there are plans to 
build more, to increase the detention capacity in the country to 10,000 persons. The 
construction of these centres is partly financed by the European Return Fund.  
</p>
<p>67. The Working Group expresses its concern that the above situation will lead to long-
term detention for most, or even all, migrants in an irregular situation detected in Greece. 
According to the national plan of action on asylum and migration management elaborated 
in 2010, the new policy will be implemented in order to &#8220;send a strong signal to third-
country nationals willing to illegally enter Greece&#8221;; to &#8220;warn all immigrants who do not fall 
under the status of international protection that they will be arrested, detained and returned 
to the countries of origin&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group regrets the excessive duration of detention of migrants &#8211; six 
months, which may be extended to up to 18 months if the person refuses to cooperate or if 
there are delays in obtaining necessary documentation (Law No. 3907/2011, arts. 30.5 and 
30.6, and No. Law 3386/2005, art. 76.3), which is the maximum provided for in the 
European Union Directive 2008/115/EC (see para. 37 above). In many instances, the 
Working Group found that the refusal to cooperate or the delays in obtaining necessary 
documentation could not be attributed to the migrant in question but rather to the consular 
authorities or legal or practical obstacles. The long duration has been justified as a deterrent 
mechanism for other potential migrants, whether or not a durable solution can be found in 
each individual case.  
</p>
<p>69.  In addition, owing to a change made in October 2012 to the provisions governing 
the maximum length of detention for asylum seekers, such individuals may now be 
detained for up to 18 months pending a decision on their application in Greece (Presidential 
Decree 114/2012). During interviews with a significant number of actual and potential 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
  A/HRC/23/46/Add.4, para. 6. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>asylum seekers, the Working Group learned that these persons were often informed that 
they would remain in detention for 18 months if they chose to apply for asylum.  
</p>
<p>70.  Furthermore, migrants whose deportation is unlikely owing to, inter alia, the 
situation in their country of origin or the non-cooperation of consular authorities, are 
routinely detained. This practice does not seem to comply with the purpose of detention as 
stated in the law, namely, to prepare for deportation. Law No. 3907/2011 states that when a 
reasonable prospect of removal no longer exists, detention ceases to be justified and the 
person concerned is to be released immediately (art. 30.4). This does not seem to be 
implemented in practice. Law No. 3907/2011 further provides for a mechanism to deal with 
non-removable irregular migrants in the form of issuance of a certificate of suspension of 
removal (art. 24). Significant improvements have been made by amendments to articles 74 
and 99 of the Criminal Code through the provisions of Law No. 4055/2012, introducing 
specific time limits for the duration of detention of detainees who cannot be deported (18 
months). Compliance with these provisions is monitored by a judicial body.  
</p><p>71.  The Working Group encountered instances where persons had been detained for 
long periods of time pending their deportation. In many cases, countries of origin are 
reluctant or unwilling to accept their nationals, and the implementation of the deportation 
order takes a long time. Frequently, the person concerned does not have valid 
documentation for the issuance of a passport or entry permit.  
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group found that asylum seekers were detained until their asylum 
procedure had been concluded. Migrants in an irregular situation are often not informed on 
the grounds or the length of their detention.  
</p>
<p>73.  Provisions should always be made to render detention unlawful if the obstacle for 
identifying immigrants in an irregular situation or carrying out removal from the territory 
does not lie within their sphere; for example, when the consular representation of the 
country of origin does not cooperate or legal considerations &#8211; such as the principle of non-
refoulement barring removal if there is a risk of torture or arbitrary detention in the country 
of destination &#8211; or factual obstacles, such as the unavailability of means of transportation, 
render expulsion impossible. 
</p>
<p>74. Although the administrative detention of migrants in an irregular situation does not 
contravene international human rights instruments,, the principle of proportionality requires 
that it be used as a last resort, permissible only for the shortest period of time, and that 
alternatives to detention be sought whenever possible.  
</p>
<p>75. The Working Group is of view that the imprisonment of a migrant or an asylum 
seeker for up to 18 months in conditions that are found to be even worse than in the regular 
prisons (see paras. 81 &#8211; 92 below) could be regarded as punishment imposed on a person 
who has not committed any crime. This would be a serious violation of the principle of 
proportionality, and may render the deprivation of liberty arbitrary. In addition, through 
interviews with detainees, the Working Group found that prolonged detention was often 
perceived by potential asylum seekers as a deterrent to discourage them from submitting an 
application. 
</p>
<p>76.  According to domestic law, migrants in an irregular situation may be detained for 
up to 18 months. The maximum period of detention for asylum seekers awaiting a decision 
on their application was recently extended from six to up to 18 months. The Working 
Group encountered some instances where the obstacle for identifying or removing a 
particular migrant from Greek territory was not attributable to the person, including through 
non-cooperation of the consular representation of the third countries.  
</p>
<p>77.  The Working Group also found that detainees had little or no information about 
why they were in detention nor of its duration. It is the position of the Working Group that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>all detainees, including irregular migrants and asylum seekers, must be informed on the 
reasons for their detention and their rights, including the right to challenge its legality, in a 
language they understand, and they must have access to legal assistance.  
</p>
<p>78. As mentioned above, during its visit, the Working Group also learned about a 
number of round-up operations where the police would detain members of the Roma 
community with Greek citizens and release them soon after without charge. In this regard, 
the Working Group recalls that any detention on discriminatory grounds constitutes 
arbitrary detention, and furthermore, that detention without any legal basis also renders the 
detention arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>79. In 2010, the Government elaborated a plan of action on asylum and migration 
management (see para. 67 above), which was aimed at regulating the situation through the 
establishment of three different centres: first reception centres, operated by civilians; 
detention centres and pre-removal centres. The plan was subsequently revised in December 
2012 with the objective of establishing an effective response to the migration challenges 
faced by the country. The revised plan focuses on the new autonomous asylum ervice, 
which reports directly to the Minister for Public Order and Citizens&#8217; Protection.  
</p>
<p>80. With regard to migrants in a regular situation, the Working Group was informed 
that there were 140,000 files pending at the Directorate of Naturalization and Migration of 
the Ministry of the Interior.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Detention conditions 
</b></p>
<p>81. Although domestic law provides for proper conditions for persons deprived of their 
liberty, the Working Group found that, in practice, the law is not observed. In most 
detention facilities visited by the Working Group, the conditions were well below those 
required by international human rights standards, and were severely overcrowded. In 
detention centres for asylum seekers, the conditions were often appalling and unhygienic, 
and facilities were in a poor state of repair. Long-term detention was often the result of 
delays due to lack of cooperation of the consular authorities of the detainee&#8217;s home country.  
</p>
<p>82. In this respect, the Working Group notes the decision of January 2013 of the 
Criminal Court of First Instance of Igoumenitsa to acquit 15 immigrants who had escaped 
from a detention facility mainly to flee the appalling conditions of detention they were 
forced to endure.  
</p>
<p>83. The Working Group often found pretrial and convicted detainees together in the 
same cell, or administrative detainees, including migrants in an irregular situation and 
asylum seekers, held with criminal detainees, in violation of relevant national and 
international standards. Detainees were held for months in police holding cells and border 
guard stations, even though these facilities were designed for a maximum stay of 72 hours. 
The Working Group notes that this situation also affects the proper preparation for the trial, 
given that defendants cannot communicate with counsel in private. 
</p>
<p>84. Migrants in an irregular situation are detained for up to several months in various 
establishments, such as police stations, border guard stations and coast guard facilities, 
which are clearly not suitable for long-term detention. Some dedicated migration detention 
centres do exist, some of which are converted military camps or police academies. As 
common standards are not applied, the detention conditions and the safeguards available 
vary significantly according to the facility and the location. 
</p>
<p>85. The Working Group visited a significant number of detention facilities for irregular 
migrants and asylum seekers. In general terms, detention conditions in all facilities were </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>inappropriate. Migrants were locked in their cells for most of the day, with no activities to 
keep them occupied. Several of the detention centres did not have an outdoor area.  
</p>
<p>86. In some of the detention facilities, the migrants had limited access to toilets; some 
had no artificial lighting, so that, in winter, detainees were in the dark as of the early 
afternoon. Most of the detention facilities visited lacked heating and hot water, and 
detainees complained about insufficient and poor quality food, lack of soap and other 
hygiene products, and of insufficient clothing, shoes and blankets. The Working Group met 
with several detainees who had visible health problems but who had not received 
appropriate medical care. It noted the urgent need for specialized staff in each detention 
facility, including doctors, nurses, psychologists, social workers and interpreters.  
</p>
<p>87. The detention centres in the Evros region, particularly Fylakio, were overcrowded 
and run by the police. Although the detention centre for migrants and asylum seekers in 
Thessaloniki has a maximum capacity of 54 persons, it was holding 96 foreigners at the 
time of the visit of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>88. It should be noted that, in 2012, the rate of detention of migrants in an irregular 
situation was 22.63 per cent lower than in 2011 (76,878 persons in 2012 against 99,368in 
2011). In 2013, detention of migrants in an irregular situation dropped by a further 44.06 
per cent (with detentions down to 43,002). 
</p><p>89. In general terms, overcrowding in Greek prisons has increased and is now a chronic 
problem. At 1 September 2011, Greek prisons were at a 151.7 per cent of their maximum 
capacity, with 12,479 inmates (including 4,254 pretrial detainees) crammed into 8,224 
available places. The number of inmates continues to rise. According to the Ministry of 
Justice, Transparency and Human Rights, in January 2010, Greek prisons held 11,364 
inmates. By 1 November 2012, this number had risen to 13,147 (including711 women 
detainees).  
90. At the time of the visit of the Working Group, Thessaloniki prison held 592 
inmates (including 385 in pretrial detention), even though its maximum capacity is 280.. 
The penal population included persons of 31 different nationalities. 
</p>
<p>91. The Korydallos and Halkida prisons reportedly rejected additional inmates owing 
to serious overcrowding. Korydallos has room for 800 inmates, but was holding 2,345 
detainees in very poor conditions of detention at the time of the visit of the Working Group. 
Although Komotini prison has a maximum capacity of 100 inmates, the Working Group 
found 327 detainees during its visit, including 74 in pretrial detention. In many detention 
centres, there is no separation between pretrial and convicted detainees.  
</p>
<p>92. In one police station visited in Thessaloniki, the Working Group found 10 persons 
detained on suspicion of having committed common offences, as well as 90 migrants in an 
irregular situation.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Procedural safeguards 
</b></p>
<p>93. According to the Government, representatives of UNHCR and non-governmental 
organizations dealing with migration issues are granted access to detention facilities where 
they may interact freely with migrants and provide them with legal assistance. The 
Working Group received information, however, that detainees were allowed limited contact 
with their families, limited access to legal assistance and consular services and little or no 
professional interpretation services.  
</p>
<p>94. In general, the detainees whom the Working Group met had little or no information 
in a language they could understand about the reasons for detention, its duration or the right </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>to challenge their detention and deportation, despite the fact that article 76.3 of Law No. 
3386/2005 provides for the right to be informed about the reasons for detention in a 
language that that the detainee understands. While some detention centres had information 
posted on the walls near the entrance or in booklets, information was rarely available inside 
the cells or anywhere else. Those who had applied for asylum often had no information 
about the status of their case, and others could not apply for asylum from the detention 
facility. 
</p>
<p>95. According to deliberation No. 5, Principle 1 of the Working Group, any asylum 
seeker or immigrant, when held for questioning at the border, or inside national territory in 
the case of illegal entry, must be informed at least orally and in a language that he or she 
understands of the nature of and grounds for the decision refusing entry at the border, or 
permission for temporary residence in the territory, that is being contemplated with respect 
to the person concerned. In Principle 2 of deliberation No. 5, the Working Group pointed 
out that any asylum seeker or immigrant must have the possibility, while in custody, of 
communicating with the outside world, including by telephone, fax or electronic mail, and 
of contacting a lawyer, a consular representative and relatives. 
</p>
<p>96. Migrants may be detained on the decision of the competent police authority (Law 
No. 3386/2005, art. 76.2); no automatic judicial review of the decision is provided for. 
Although migrants may present an objection to their detention (Law No. 3386/2005, art. 
76.3 and Law No. 3907/2011, art. 30.2), it is not automatic, and no direct review of the 
lawfulness of the detention is provided for.  
</p>
<p>97. Moreover, objections must to be submitted in writing and drafted in Greek. Access 
to an interpreter and lawyer is not guaranteed, which makes any objection to the detention 
virtually impossible, particularly given that detention and deportation orders are written in 
Greek.  
</p>
<p>98. Law No. 3907/2011 introduced an automatic judicial review of the legality of 
detention (art. 30.3); however, it regulates only the extension of detention and not the 
detention per se. The review is conducted automatically, with no reference to the 
specificities of each case, and the fact that the migrant has not yet been expelled constitutes 
sufficient grounds for the judge to extend the period of detention. 
</p><p>99. In its deliberation No. 5, Principle 6, the Working Group stated that the decision 
must be taken by a duly empowered authority with a sufficient level of responsibility and 
must be founded on criteria of legality established by the law. Furthermore, in Principle 8 
of the same deliberation, the Working Group specified that notification of the custodial 
measure must be given in writing, in a language understood by the asylum seeker or 
immigrant, stating the grounds for the measure; it should set out the conditions under which 
the asylum seeker or immigrant must be able to apply for a remedy to a judicial authority, 
which will make a prompt decision on the lawfulness of the measure and, where 
appropriate, order the release of the person concerned. 
</p>
<p>100.  Some of the migrants who had engaged private lawyers complained that the 
lawyers would simply take their money and not follow up on their cases. The Working 
Group heard these allegations from several migrants in different detention centres. It urges 
the Greek authorities to take these allegations seriously and to find a solution to the 
problems relating to effective legal representation of detained migrants. 
</p>
<p>101. Although the treatment of vulnerable groups (such as women, single-parent 
families and unaccompanied minors) is a subject of particular concern for the relevant 
services, the Working Group notes with concern the insufficient training and sensitization 
of staff in detention centres on international human rights law principles and standards, as 
well as on principles relating to the rights and treatment of persons deprived of their liberty, 
with respect to both detention conditions and safeguards.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/48/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>102. Regular independent monitoring of all detention facilities is crucial to ensure the 
implementation of international standards. In this respect, the Working Group welcomes the 
recent ratification by Greece of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Ombudsman&#8217;s office, 
as the designated national preventive mechanism under the Optional Protocol, should 
conduct regular unannounced visits to detention facilities throughout the territory of 
Greece, including all places where migrants are deprived of their liberty. Civil society 
organizations should also be guaranteed access to all places where migrants are detained. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Alternatives to detention 
</b></p>
<p>103. As noted above, despite the fact that Law No. 3907/2011 provides for the detention 
of migrants only when less coercive measures cannot be implemented, in practice, no such 
measures exist, and irregular migrants are systematically detained. The Working Group 
strongly urges the Greek authorities to undertake an individual assessment of the necessity 
of detention in each case, in accordance with international human rights standards and its 
own laws. Non-custodial measures should always be considered before detention.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Unaccompanied minors 
</b></p>
<p>104. Under Greek law, adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years may be held 
criminally responsible, even though their acts will always be considered misdemeanours 
rather than felonies. The law requires that educational and therapy measures be preferred 
instead of correctional ones. Minors are detained solely in the case of commission of 
serious crimes. Their detention is always under the supervision of a prosecutor. Individuals 
aged between 18 and 21 years are considered young adults.  
</p>
<p>105. Law No. 220/2007, which also incorporates European Union Directive 9/2003/EC, 
applies to unaccompanied minors, stipulating that a prosecutor is to be notified of the case 
whether or not the minor has submitted an asylum application. The prosecutor is appointed 
temporary guardian; at a later stage, in cooperation with social services and non-
governmental organizations, another person, usually a social worker, will be appointed the 
permanent guardian.  
</p>
<p>106. During its visit, however, the Working Group found that unaccompanied minors 
were often not properly registered and were systematically detained. It notes with concern 
that the current national legislation does not provide for a statutory prohibition of the 
detention of minors. According to the Government, in practice, unaccompanied minors are, 
after some weeks in detention centres, placed under the responsibility of the Ministry of 
Labour, Social Security and Welfare and transferred to a guest house for minors. During its 
visit, however, the Working Group found that, owing to the limited capacity of existing 
reception facilities, unaccompanied minors often remained in detention for a prolonged 
period of time waiting for a place to become available.  
</p>
<p>107. Unaccompanied minors who do not apply for asylum or who were refused asylum 
and not granted protective status are subject to deportation or to recurrent detention.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Conscientious objection 
</b>108. The Working Group was informed that conscientious objectors were frequently 
prosecuted. On 1 February 2012, the Athens Military Court convicted Avraam Pouliasis to 
six months of imprisonment, suspended for three years, for objecting to compulsory 
military service. The Court found him guilty of failing to serve compulsory military service </p>

appeared personally before the Court to hear its decision, but did not file an appeal before 
the Military Court of Appeals. According to the Government, Mr. Pouliasis could have 
opted to serve alternative military service for conscientious objectors, but had chosen not to 
do so.

<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Working Group recognizes that Greece is has endured a difficult 
economic and social period owing to the financial crisis, which has forced the 
Government to implement austerity measures a number of times without adequate 
international support. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Working Group was informed of the positive legislative changes made in 
relation to the issue of deprivation of liberty in Greece. It encourages the Government 
to ensure that such developments are accompanied by effective implementation 
measures in strict compliance with international human rights standards. The new 
asylum service, appeals authority and first reception service are also positive 
developments. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>With regard to criminal justice, despite the constitutional provision 
establishing limits for pre-trial detention (one year in the case of felonies, six months 
in the case of misdemeanours), the Working Group observed that accused persons 
often spent relatively long periods in pretrial detention, even several years. The 
Working Group found that this is one of the main reasons for the serious 
overcrowding witnessed in Greek prisons, which is now a chronic problem.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Arbitrary detention in Greece is particularly linked to migration and to the 
mass arrival of undocumented migrants. This phenomenon has placed great pressure 
on the police and border guards. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Working Group is of the view that much remains to be done to ensure full 
respect for the human rights of migrants and asylum seekers in Greece. A proper 
network for the reception of arrivals, adequate physical and sanitary conditions in the 
centres and adequate procedures for repatriation seem to be lacking.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>The Working Group found that a detention period of 18 months for 
undocumented migrants was excessive, particularly in the light of the very harsh 
conditions in detention centres, including those in the Evros region.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The imprisonment of a migrant or an asylum seeker for up to 18 months in 
conditions that are usually found to be even worse than in the regular prisons could be 
considered a punishment imposed on a person who has not committed any offence. 
This appears to be a serious violation of the principle of proportionality and may 
render the deprivation of liberty arbitrary. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Failure to apply alternatives to detention, lack of effective judicial review and 
the excessive length of detention may also render the detention of an individual 
arbitrary. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>With regard to the vast number of round-up operations leading to the 
detention by the police of foreigners and members of the Roma community (including 
those who are Greek citizens), the Working Group recalls that any detention on 
discriminatory grounds constitutes arbitrary detention and furthermore, that 
detention without any legal basis may also render the detention arbitrary.  </b></p>

<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>In the light of the information received and the concerns expressed, the 
Working Group make recommends that the Government of Greece: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Reform the judicial system to guarantee that all persons in pretrial 
detention receive a fair and speedy trial; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Consider the possibility of decriminalizing certain offences, reducing 
prison sentences, and applying non-custodial measures in order to combat the severe 
overcrowding in prisons and the inappropriate utilization of police stations to hold 
detainees for periods beyond 72 hours; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) End the policy of systematic detention of all migrants in an irregular 
situation, and instead explore alternatives to detention. Detention should be a measure 
of last resort, limited to cases where there is a risk of the person absconding or when 
the person poses a threat to her or his own security or public security. The duration of 
detention should be limited to the minimum time necessary to carry out removal or 
other proceedings. Less coercive measures should always be considered before 
resorting to detention, in accordance with Law No. 3907/2011; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Significantly improve detention conditions and procedural safeguards, 
and develop appropriate regulations for all detention facilities, in accordance with 
international human rights standards. In particular, it should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)</b> <b>Systematically inform detained migrants in writing, in a language 
that they understand, of the reason for their detention, its duration, their right 
to have access to a lawyer, the right to promptly challenge their detention, and 
to seek asylum;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Ensure that all migrants deprived of their liberty are able to 
contact promptly their family, consular services and a lawyer, free of charge; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Ensure that all detained migrants have access to proper medical 
care, an interpreter, adequate food and clothes, hygienic conditions, adequate 
space to move around and access to outdoor exercise.  
</b></p>
<p>119.<b>  The Working Group also recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) At the time of detention, detainees be provided in writing, in a language 
they understand, with the grounds for their detention, clearly and exhaustively 
defined;</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Detainees be provided with a written explanation of their rights and how 
to exercise them. 
</b></p>
<p>120.<b> The legality of detention must be open for challenge before a court, and a 
regular review should be conducted within a fixed time limit. Each decision to detain 
should be reviewed to confirm its necessity and compliance with international legal 
standards by means of a prompt oral hearing by a court or similar competent 
independent and impartial review, accompanied by appropriate legal aid. In the event 
that continued detention is authorized, detainees should be able to initiate further 
challenges against their detention. 
</b></p>
<p>121.<b>  Detainees should be held in special immigration detention centres in 
conditions appropriate for their status, and not together with persons charged with or 
convicted of criminal offences (unless so charged or convicted themselves). </b></p>

</p>
<p>122.<b>  Detainees should be given adequate access to their legal representatives, 
relatives and officials of UNHCR. 
</b></p>
<p>123.<b>  The Government should limit the use of detention to appropriate cases, 
such as of asylum seekers whose application has been rejected after the asylum 
determination process (namely, when the incentive to abscond has increased) or where 
removal is imminent and there are reasons to believe it cannot be effected unless the 
individual is detained. The power to detain should not be exercised if the person 
concerned is, on the basis of substantiated evidence, fully integrated into the society 
from which that person&#8217;s removal is sought. 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b> Alternative and non-custodial measures, such as reporting requirements, 
should always be considered before resorting to detention. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b> Detaining authorities should be required to establish a compelling need 
to detain that is based on the personal history of each individual asylum seeker. 
</b></p>
<p>126.<b>  Any review body should be independent of the detaining authority. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b> Specialized non-governmental organizations, UNHCR and legal 
representatives should have access to all places of detention. 
</b></p>
<p>128.<b>  All staff members of detention facilities should receive training on the 
special situation and needs of asylum seekers in detention. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b> Effective measures should be taken to ensure that migrants have full 
access to lawyers and interpreters to appeal deportation decisions, and to prevent the 
refoulement of persons in need of international protection. 
</b></p>
<p>130.<b> The Government should refrain from detaining unaccompanied minors and 
families with children, in conformity with the principles of the best interests of the 
child and of family unity. 
</b></p>
<p>131. <b> The Government should continue to facilitate, where possible, the 
voluntary return of migrants who are willing to return to their countries, as opposed 
to deportation proceedings, in full accordance with international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>132.<b>  Lawyers and civil society organizations should be ensured full access to 
all detention facilities, and a systematic, independent monitoring system should be 
established for them. 
</b></p>
<p>133. <b> All detained persons claiming protection concerns should be adequately 
informed of their right to seek asylum and be able to file an asylum application and 
communicate with UNHCR, lawyers and civil society organizations. 
</b></p>
<p>134.<b>  The Government should strengthen, through the provision of competent 
staff and resources, the Office of the Ombudsman and the National Commission for 
Human Rights in order to allow them to effectively accomplish their mission of human 
rights protection and promotion for all, including migrants, regardless of their 
administrative status, including by undertaking regular unannounced visits to 
detention facilities throughout national territory.
