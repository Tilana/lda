Accused in person

JUDGMENT

[1]     
The Accused is charged for the offence of attempted murder contrary to Section 214(b) of the Penal Code.

[2]     
The three assessors have unanimously found him guilty of the offence of attempted murder.

[3]     
I remind myself in terms of the direction I gave the assessors and I have considered the evidence at the trial.

[4]     
On the evidence adduced I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the intent to kill Malti Devi and secondly it was the accused and no one else who inflicted the injuries with a knife on Malti Devi. I also am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt judging by the injuries and evidence of Dr. Patel that these injuries were likely to endanger human life.

[5]     
I concur with the unanimous opinion of the three assessors and convict the accused of attempted murder contrary to section 214(b) of the Penal Code.
