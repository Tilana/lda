PROFIRE ENERGY, INC. AND SUBSIDIAIES
 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016
 
NOTE 1 - CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include
only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at June 30, 2016 and for all periods
presented have been made.
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in
conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's March 31, 2016 audited financial statements.  The results of
operations for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full years.
NOTE 2 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
This Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Profire Energy, Inc. and Subsidiary (the "Company") is presented to assist in
understanding the Company's consolidated financial statements.  The Company's accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (US GAAP).
Profire Energy, Inc. was established on October 9, 2008 upon the closing of an Acquisition Agreement between The Flooring Zone, Inc. and Profire
Combustion, Inc. and the shareholders of Profire Combustion, Inc. (the "Subsidiary").   Following the closing of the agreement The Flooring Zone, Inc. was
renamed Profire Energy, Inc. (the "Parent").
 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Agreement, 35,000,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company were issued to the three
shareholders of the Subsidiary in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Subsidiary. As a result of the transaction, the Subsidiary
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent and the shareholders of the Subsidiary became the controlling shareholders of the Company.
Organization and Line of Business
The Parent was incorporated on May 5, 2003 in the State of Nevada. The Subsidiary was incorporated on March 6, 2002 in the province of Alberta, Canada.
The Company provides burner and chemical management products and services for the oil and gas industry in the Canadian and US markets.
 
Reclassification
Certain balances in previously issued consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation.

NOTE 2 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reportable amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include our wholly-owned subsidiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share
The computation of basic loss per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods presented
using the treasury stock method. The computation of fully diluted loss per share includes common stock equivalents outstanding at the balance sheet date.
As of June 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company had 332,794 and 69,190 common stock equivalents from equity awards that have been excluded from the
calculation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Basic and diluted loss per share are as follows:
Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders $(605,295
Weighted average shares outstanding
Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding

Foreign Currency and Comprehensive Income
The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries in the U.S. and Canada are the U.S. Dollar ("USD") and the Canadian Dollar ("CAD"), respectively. 
The financial statements of the Company were translated to USD using period end exchange rates for the balance sheet, and average exchange rates for the
statements of operations.  Equity transactions were translated using historical rates.  The period-end exchange rates of 0.772081 and 0.7711 were used to
convert the Company's June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 balance sheets, respectively, and the statements of operations used weighted average rates of
0.772962 and 0.811950 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All amounts in the financial statements and footnotes are
presumed to be stated in USD, unless otherwise identified.
Foreign currency translation gains or losses as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and
Comprehensive Income (Loss), and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.

 June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016
 
 
NOTE 2 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value
measurements do not include transaction costs. A fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair
values. Categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value
hierarchy is defined into the following three categories:
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
Fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial
instruments. As these estimates are subjective in nature, involving uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, they cannot be determined with
precision.  Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair value.
The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. Management is of the opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial
instruments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and all debt securities with an original maturity of 90 days or less. As of
June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $22,043,090 and $21,292,595 respectively.
Accounts Receivable
Receivables from the sale of goods and services are stated at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts.  The allowance is calculated based on past collectability and customer relationships.  The Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts
of $268,464 and $250,646 as of June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.
 
Inventories
In accordance with ARB No. 43 "Inventory Pricing," the Company's inventory is valued at the lower of cost (the purchase price, including additional fees) or
market based on using the entire value of inventory.  Inventories are determined based on the average cost basis.  Inventory consists of finished goods held
for sale and includes the following:

Long-Lived Assets
We periodically review the carrying amount of our long-lived assets for impairment. An asset is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are
less than the asset's carrying amount. In the event the carrying amount of such asset is not considered recoverable, the asset is adjusted to its fair value. Fair
value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flow.
Other Intangible Assets
The Company accounts for Other Intangible Assets under the guidance of ASC 350, "Intangibles—Goodwill and Other". The Company capitalizes certain
costs related to patent technology, as a substantial portion of the purchase price related to the Company's acquisition of VIM assets has been assigned to
patents.  Under the guidance, Other Intangible Assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives
are tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill
Goodwill, representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets (tangible and intangible) and liabilities at the date of
acquisition, is reviewed for impairment annually, and more frequently as circumstances warrant, and written down only in the period in which the recorded
value of such assets exceed their fair value. The Company does not amortize goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
"FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, "Intangibles—Goodwill and Other" ("ASC 350").
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company's two operating segments comprise the reporting unit for goodwill impairment
testing purposes.
 
Revenue Recognition
The Company records sales when a firm sales agreement is in place, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, and collectability of the fixed or
determinable sales price is reasonably assured.  If customer acceptance of products is not assured, the Company records sales only upon formal customer
acceptance.

 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016
NOTE 2 – ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Cost of Sales
The Company includes product costs (i.e. material, direct labor and overhead costs), shipping and handling expense, production-related depreciation
expense and product license agreement expense in cost of sales.
Advertising Costs
The Company classifies expenses for advertising as general and administrative expenses.  The Company incurred advertising costs of $32,141 and $20,240
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, "Share-Based Payment." which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.  The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model for
determining the fair value of stock based compensation.
Income Taxes
The Parent is subject to US income taxes on a stand-alone basis.  The Parent and its Subsidiary file separate stand-alone tax returns in each jurisdiction in
which they operate.  The Subsidiary is a corporation operating in Canada and is subject to Canadian income taxes on its stand-alone taxable income.  The
effective rates of income tax expense (benefit) are (29%) and (25%) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company utilizes an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for
temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities as reported for financial statement and income tax purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax
effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any. The Company
makes estimates and judgments in determining the need for a provision for income taxes, including the estimation of our taxable income for each full fiscal
year.
Research and Development
All costs associated with research and development are expensed when incurred.  Costs incurred for research and development were $250,722 and
$304,489 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs
The Company records all amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling fees as revenue.  The Company classifies expenses for shipping and
handling costs as cost of goods sold.  The Company incurred shipping and handling costs of $37,715 and $85,326 during the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements and their adoption has not had or is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Property and Equipment Useful Lives
 
Property and equipment is stated at cost.  Depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the diminishing balance method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets.  The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:
Estimated useful life
Assets
Furniture and fixtures
7 Years
Machinery and equipment7 Years
Buildings
30 Years
5 Years
Vehicles
3 Years
Computers
Software
2 Years
Beginning in fiscal year 2016, we revised the estimated useful lives from 5 to 7 years for furniture and fixtures, and machinery and equipment, 25 to 30 years
for buildings, 3 to 5 years for vehicles, and added a software asset type that has a useful life of 2 years.  The change in depreciable lives is considered a
change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis from April 1, 2015 and had an immaterial impact on overall financial statements for the period ended
June 30, 2016.

business.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of
activity, performance or achievements.  Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these
forward-looking statements and we hereby qualify all our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.
These forward-looking statements speak only as of their dates and should not be unduly relied upon.  We undertake no obligation to amend this report or
revise publicly these forward-looking statements (other than pursuant to reporting obligations imposed on registrants pursuant to the Exchange Act) to reflect
subsequent events or circumstances, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Overview of Products & Services
Summary
We design, assemble, install, service, and sell oilfield-management technologies. Our flagship products are burner-management systems that monitor and
manage burners found throughout the industry. We believe our products provide major benefits to our customers including improved efficiency, increased
safety, and enhanced compliance with evolving industry regulation. We also sell related products such as flare ignition systems, fuel train components,
secondary airplates, valve actuators, solar packages, and chemical-management systems. Our products and services aid oil and natural gas producers in
the safe and efficient production and transportation of oil and natural gas.
Principal Products and Services
In the oil and natural gas industry, there are numerous demands for heat generation and control.  Oilfield vessels of all kinds, including line-heaters,
dehydrators, separators, treaters, amine reboilers, and free-water knockout systems require heat to satisfy their various functions, which is provided by a
burner flame inside the vessel.  This burner flame is integral to the operation of the vessel because these vessels use the flame's heat to facilitate the proper
function of the vessel. Such functions include separating, storing, transporting and purifying oil and gas (or even water).  For example, the viscosity of oil and
moisture content (and temperature) of gas are critical to a number of oilfield processes, and are directly affected by the heat provided by the burner flame
inside the vessel. Our burner-management systems help ignite, monitor, and manage this burner flame, reducing the need for employee interaction with the
burner, such as for the purposes of re-ignition or temperature monitoring.
As a result, oil and gas producers can achieve increased safety, greater operational efficiencies, and improved compliance with changing industry
regulations.  We believe, despite the industry down turn, there is a growing trend in the oil and gas industry toward enhanced control, process automation,
and data logging, partly for potential regulatory-satisfaction purposes. We continue to assess compliance-interest in the industry, especially given the
budgetary constraints we have observed over the last year. We believe that enhanced burner-management products and services can help our customers be
compliant with such regulatory requirements, where applicable. In addition to selling products, we train and dispatch service technicians to address this
industry need in Canada and throughout the United States.
19
After providing installation and maintenance services for several years, we decided to pursue the development of burner-management technologies, and we
began work on a proprietary burner-management system to ignite, monitor, and manage the burner flames used in oilfield vessels.  Our principal objectives
in developing our proprietary burner-management system were to:
·provide a safe, efficient and code-compliant method to ignite, monitor, and/or manage burner flames in the industry; and
·ensure the system could be easily controlled by oilfield operators.
With these objectives in mind, we initially developed our first burner-management system in 2005.  Since 2005, we have released several iterations of our
initial burner-management system, increasing features and capabilities, while maintaining compliance with Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) ratings.
Our burner-management systems have become widely used in Western Canada, and well-received in the United States market, with sales to such
companies as Anadarko, Chesapeake Energy, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Encana, Exxon-Mobil, Petro-Canada, Shell and others.  Our systems have
also been sold or installed in other parts of the world, including France, Italy, Ukraine, India, Nigeria, the Middle East, Australia, and Brazil. While we have an
interest in expanding our long-run international distribution capabilities, our current principal focus is on the North American oil and gas market.
Recent Product Extension: PF3100
In September of 2015, the Company unveiled its next generation burner-management system which is designed to operate, monitor, and control more
complex, multi-faceted oilfield applications. The newly announced management system, the PF3100, is an advanced management system designed to work
with any number of Profire-engineered modules, specific to different applications, thus allowing the system to expertly manage a wide variety of applications
and possibly whole new environments in future years.
Throughout the industry, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are used to operate and manage custom-built oilfield applications. Though capable, PLC's
can be expensive, tedious, and difficult to use. Our unique solution, the PF3100, can help manage and synchronize custom applications helping oilfield
producers meet deadlines and improve profitability through an off-the-shelf solution with dynamic customization.  The Company has begun selling the
PF3100 for initial use in the oil and gas industry's natural-draft market, with additional modules, including forced-air modules, planned for the near-future.
The Company frequently assesses market needs by participating in industry conferences and soliciting feedback from existing and potential customers and
looks for opportunities to provide quality solutions to the oil and gas producing companies it serves. Upon identifying a potential market need, the Company
begins researching the market and developing products that might have feasibility for future sale.
20
Additional Complementary Products
In addition to our burner-management systems, we also sell complementary oilfield products to help facilitate improved oilfield safety and efficiency. Such
products help manage fuel flow (e.g., valves and fuel trains), meter air flow (e.g., airplates), generate power on-site (e.g., solar packages), ignite and direct
flame (e.g., flare stack igniter and nozzles), and other necessary functions. We have invested heavily to develop innovative complementary products, which
we anticipate will help bolster continued long-term growth.
Some of these products are resold from third parties (e.g., solar packages), while some are proprietary (e.g., flare stack igniter) or patent-pending (e.g., inline
pilot and valve technologies). We intend to continue developing proprietary products to help enhance our margin on some of these complementary products.
Chemical-Management Systems
In addition to the burner-management systems and complementary technologies we have sold historically, we extended our product line by acquiring the
assets of VIM Injection Management ("VIM") in November 2014, which extended our brand to include chemical-management systems.
Chemical injection is used for a wide variety of purposes in the oil and gas industry including down-hole inhibition of wax, hydrates, and corrosion agents, so
that product can flow more efficiently to the wellhead. Once at the wellhead, chemical injection can also be used to further process the oil or gas before it is
sent into a pipeline, and with other applications.
Currently, a variety of pumps are used to meter the chemicals injected, but are often inaccurate in injecting the proper amount of chemical, as they may not
account for all of the variables that affect how much chemical should be injected (e.g., pressure, hydrogen sulfide concentration, etc.) nor the optimal
efficiency rates of varying pump systems.
Inaccurate injection levels are problematic because the chemicals injected are expensive; over-injection causes unnecessary expense for producers.
However, under-injection can often result in the creation of poor product (i.e., with wax, hydrate, or corrosion agents) and cause problems with pipeline
audits.
Our chemical-management systems monitor and manage this chemical-injection process to ensure that optimal levels of chemicals are injected. This
improves the efficiency of the pump and production quality of the well, improves safety for workers that would otherwise be exposed to these chemicals, and
improves compliance with pipeline operators. Like our burner-management systems, our chemical-management systems can be monitored and managed
remotely via SCADA or other remote-communication systems. A patent was issued domestically related to our chemical management system and its process
for supplying a chemical agent to a process fluid.  Other international patents are pending.

Results of Operations
Comparison of the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Total Revenues
Total revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $2,903,200 or 42%, compared to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015.  This
decrease was principally attributable to decreased sales of goods, net, as well as decreased sales of services, net.  Though we expect to continue to deal
with a difficult industry environment for some time, we are focusing our resources in geographic areas that we believe will produce the highest level of total
revenues and return on investment.

Sales of goods, net during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $2,749,077 or 44%, compared to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015.
This decrease was principally attributable to the reduced purchasing from companies in the oil and gas industry stemming from budget constraints due to the
drastic decline in the underlying commodity prices year over year.
Sales of Services, Net
Sales of services, net during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $154,123 or 23%, compared to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015.
The decrease in sales of services, net, was principally attributable to the decrease in overall purchasing by our customers, as services are generally
provided on the installation of newly purchased systems. Although the primary purpose of our service team is to support product sales, our service team also
provides valuable feedback for our sales and research and development teams as well as a number of auxiliary services for our customers.
Total Cost of Goods Sold
Total cost of goods sold during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $1,503,664 or 42%, compared to the comparable period ended June 30,
2015.  As a percentage of total revenues, total cost of goods sold was 52% during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Cost of Goods Sold-Products
Cost of goods sold-products during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $1,255,275 or 42%, compared to the comparable period ended June
30, 2015, primarily as a result of decreased sales. As a percentage of revenues from product sales, cost of goods sold-products increased to 50% during the
three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 48% for the comparable period ended June 30, 2015. This change is largely attributable to the improved
allocation of overhead costs of some product-related fixed assets associated with storage and inventory management.
 
Given the current and expected industry conditions in the oil and gas industry, we have been and will continue to work with our suppliers to control our
inventory costs, which has the largest impact on margin.  We have been relatively successful in maintaining our price during the industry volatility, though
customers have sought prices reductions.  We anticipate holding prices relatively stable, within the confines of normal sales operations. We anticipate
returning to a more historical margin in the long-run, especially with increased sales, though quarterly results will vary. We expect this migration to historical
margin levels will take several quarters.
22
Cost of Goods Sold-Services
Cost of goods sold-services during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $248,388 or 42%, compared to the comparable period ended June 30,
2015, as a result of decreased sales of service.  As a percentage of service revenues, cost of goods sold-service decreased to 68% during the three months
ended June 30, 2016, compared to 90% for the comparable period ended June 30, 2015. The change in cost of goods sold-service was achieved by cost
cutting measures to right size our service division for the current industry context and make it more profitable.
Gross Profit
Gross profit during the three months ended June 30, 2016 remained unchanged at 48% compared to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015.
Total Operating Expenses
Our total operating expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $1,057,556 or 27%, compared to the comparable period ended June
30, 2015.  As a percentage of total revenues, total operating expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased from 56% to 70%, compared
to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015. Despite significant efforts to control and manage operating costs which brought total operating costs down by
27%, revenue declined 42% which caused total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues to increase sharply.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $1,055,573 or 31% compared to the comparable period
ended June 30, 2015.  As a percentage of total operating expenses, general and administrative expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016
decreased from 89% to 85% compared to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in overall costs were due to cost management and
reduction efforts in professional fees, sales and marketing expenses, stock based compensation, travel and payroll costs.  We will continue to closely
evaluate expenses and determine what expense-reduction actions, if any, need to be taken.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $53,767 or 18%, compared to the comparable period ended
June 30, 2015.  As a percentage of total operating expenses, research and development expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased
from 8% to 9% compared to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015.  This decrease in total cost was due to cost cutting efforts across the department
while maintaining the prioritization of research and development projects.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense during the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased $51,784 or 48%, compared to the comparable period ended
June 30, 2015. As a percentage of total operating expenses, depreciation increased from 2.8% to 5.7% due to the decrease in the allocation of depreciation
to cost of goods sold mostly related to operational changes made to the service department.
23
Total Other Income (Expense)
 
Total other income during the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased $99,336 compared to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015. The majority
of this increase is due to the impact of Foreign Exchange gains and losses in each period.
 
Net Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes
The decreases we realized in total revenues, gross profit and total operating expenses combined to lead to a net loss before income taxes during the three
months ended June 30, 2016 of $851,172 compared to net loss before income taxes of $608,527 during to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015.
 
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income tax benefit during the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased $96,163 or 64%, compared to the comparable period ended June 30, 2015. The
increase was due to the larger net loss before tax during the period and due to changes in various deferred tax items.
 
Foreign Currency Translation Gain (Loss)
Our consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars ("USD").  Our functional currencies are the USD and the Canadian dollar
("CAD").  Transactions initiated in other currencies are translated to USD using period ending exchange rates for the balance sheet and weighted average
exchange rates for the statements of operations.  Equity transactions were translated using historical rates. Therefore, the translation adjustment in our
consolidated financial statements represents the translation differences from translation of our financial statements. As a result, the translation adjustment is
commonly, but not always, positive if the average exchange rates are lower than exchange rates on the date of the financial statements and negative if the
average exchange rates are higher than exchange rates on the date of the financial statements. Foreign currency translation gains or losses as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rates are reflected in the Statement of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
We recognized a foreign currency translation gain of $773 during the three months ended June 30, 2016.  By comparison, during the three months ended
June 30, 2015 we recognized a gain of $333,372 in foreign currency translation. The changes in translation gain were the result of volatility in foreign
exchange rates, specifically between the USD and CAD.
 
Total Comprehensive Income (Loss)
For the foregoing reasons, we realized a total comprehensive loss during the three months ended June 30, 2016 of $604,522 compared to total
comprehensive loss of $125,441 during the comparable period ended June 30, 2015.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Total current assets were $36,009,336 and total assets were $45,936,465 including cash and cash equivalents of $22,043,090 at June 30, 2016.  Total
current liabilities were $979,362 and total liabilities were $1,612,094 at June 30, 2016. Working capital at June 30, 2016 was $35,029,974 compared to
$35,205,517 at March 31, 2016.

    (23,526 )
   (3,082 )   158,248  
 $750,495  $3,041,442
Net cash provided by our operating activities was $736,681. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 we realized an increase in cash primarily derived
from changes in accounts receivable and inventory. These increases were partially offset by decreases in cash resulting from our net loss and a significant
pay down of accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the period.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $16,896 and was primarily driven by proceeds from
disposal of equipment during the period. We do not have plans to make significant purchases of fixed assets in the short-term.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, no cash was received in financing activities for the issuance of stock options.
As a result of the net cash provided from operating and investing activities, we realized a net increase in cash during the three months ended June 30, 2016
of $750,495 compared to a $3,041,442 net increase during the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of business. These risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates. In addition, international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax
structures and other regulations and restrictions.
To date we have not utilized derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments. We do not expect to employ these or other strategies to
hedge market risk in the foreseeable future. Cash is held in checking, savings, and money market funds, which are subject to minimal credit and market risk.
We believe that the market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial, although there can be no guarantee that these market risks will
be immaterial to us.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period
covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end of the period
covered by this Report, our disclosure and control procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses identified as part of fiscal year 2016 year-end
review of internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over
financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant's annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. For more information on material weaknesses identified by management during our internal assessment, see our
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
25
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management's Remediation Initiatives
Management has been actively developing a remediation plan and been implementing new controls and processes to address the aforementioned
deficiencies. Upon receiving the results of our internal controls review, we have taken actions to strengthen our internal control structure, including the
following:
·            Hired third parties to provide advice on COSO framework and risk control matrices;
 
·            Implemented company-wide trainings over internal controls in relation with new accounting standard operating procedures including the requirement
of supplying supporting evidence, proving the level of precision with which a control is performed, etc.;
 
·            Required evidence of review in nearly all controls; and
 
·            Reviewed and updated each employee's access within the enterprise resource management system.
Management continues to meet with key managers and control owners to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and to ensure implementation of
remediation initiatives.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the
individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls
also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
To the best of our knowledge, there are no legal proceedings pending or threatened against us; and there are no actions pending or threatened against any
of our directors or officers that are adverse to us.
 
Item 1A.  Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this quarterly report on Form10-Q, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. These risks are not the
only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.
 
Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
As previously reported, on June 26, 2014, the SEC declared effective our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-196462).  The registration
statement related to 6,000,000 shares of our common stock; 4,500,000 shares were sold by the Company and 1,500,000 shares were sold by certain selling
stockholders.  On July 2, 2014, we sold 4,500,000 shares of our common stock at the price of $4.00 per share, for an aggregate sale price of $18,000,000.
We expect to use the proceeds from this offering for expansion of our sales and service team to match the demand for our product in regions where
legislation has passed, requiring the use of our technology, and for other working capital purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund
possible investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, solutions or technologies. In addition, the amount and timing of what we actually
spend for these purposes may vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future revenue and cash generated by operations and
other factors.  Accordingly, our management will have discretion and flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending any uses, as described
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality, investment grade, short-term fixed income instruments which include corporate, financial
institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations.
