Note 1 – Description of Business
FFIN Securities, Inc. (“FFIN”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 25, 2014, for the
purpose  of  primarily  serving  brokerage  clients  referred  from  foreign  brokerage  firms  under
common ownership as part of a strategy to provide foreign customers with access to the U.S.
securities markets. FFIN is currently determining whether to submit a new application to become
a  member  of  Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority,  Inc.  (“FINRA”)  and  a  licensed  securities
broker-dealer with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the
Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended  (the  “Exchange  Act”).  Currently  we  anticipate
FFIN will submit a new application to FINRA, but there is no guarantee that it will do so. If FFIN
determines to submit a new application for broker-dealer registration, we anticipate it would do so
before the end of calendar 2016.
BMB Munai, Inc. (“BMBM”) is a Nevada corporation that originally incorporated in the State of
Utah in 1981. From 2003 to 2011, BMBM’s business activities focused on oil and natural gas
exploration  and  production  in  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  through  its  then  wholly-owned
subsidiary Emir Oil LLP (“Emir Oil”). In September 2011, BMBM sold all of its interest in Emir Oil,
including its right, title, and interest in and to the oil and gas licenses and licensed territory owned
by Emir Oil, to an independent third party for cash of about $170 million. The proceeds of the sale
were  used  to,  among  other  things,  repay  outstanding  obligations,  satisfy  certain  post-closing
undertakings,  meet  ongoing  expenses,  and  make  two  separate  cash  distributions  totaling
approximately $74,750,000 to its stockholders.
On November 23, 2015, BMBM entered into a Share Exchange and Acquisition Agreement with
Timur Turlov (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with the intent to build an international, broadly based
brokerage and financial service firm to meet the growing demand from an increasing number of
investors  in  Russia  and  Kazakhstan  for  access  to  the  financial  opportunities,  relative  stability,
and comprehensive regulatory reputation of the U.S. securities markets.
Pursuant  to  the  Acquisition  Agreement,  BMBM  acquired  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding
common stock of FFIN from Mr. Turlov in exchange for 224,551,913 shares of BMBM common
stock, which constituted approximately 80.1% of BMBM’s outstanding common stock after giving
effect to the transaction. BMBM and its wholly-owned subsidiary FFIN are collectively referred to
herein as the “Company” unless otherwise specifically indicated or as is otherwise contextually
required.

BMB MUNAI, INC.
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
The  Acquisition  Agreement  also  provides,  subject  to  the  satisfaction  of  various  closing
conditions, for the possible acquisition by the Company of Mr. Turlov’s 100% equity interests in
Investment Company Freedom Finance LLC, a Russian limited company (“Freedom RU”), and
the securities brokerage and financial services business conducted by it in Russia, and its wholly
owned subsidiary, Freedom Finance JSC, a Kazakhstan joint stock company (“Freedom KZ”),
and the securities brokerage and financial services business conducted by it in Kazakhstan, and
FFINEU  Investments  Limited,  a  Cyprus  limited  company  (“Freedom  CY”)  and  the  securities
brokerage and financial services business conducted by Freedom CY. Freedom RU, Freedom
KZ,  and  Freedom  CY  and  the  securities  brokerage  and  investment  services  businesses
conducted  by  each  of  them,  in  each  case,  are  collectively  referred  to  herein  as  the  “Freedom
Companies” unless otherwise specifically indicated or as is otherwise contextually required.  The
acquisition  of  the  Freedom  Companies  is  not  contingent  upon  FFIN’s  decision  to  pursue
licensure to operate as a broker-dealer in the U.S. or whether FFIN is ultimately successful in
becoming a U.S. registered broker-dealer in the event it elects to pursue licensure.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the
Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business  one  year  from  June  30,  2016.  The  Company  has  incurred  a  loss  since  inception
resulting  in  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $880,932  as  of  June  30,  2016,  and  further  losses  are
anticipated  in  the  development  of  its  business  raising  substantial  doubt  about  the  Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary
financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations
when  they  come  due.  Management  intends  to  finance  operating  costs  over  the  next  twelve
months  with  existing  cash  on  hand,  capital  contributions  from  Mr.  Turlov  and/or  a  private
placement of Company common stock.
There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise any capital through any type of
offering or to receive additional capital contributions from Mr. Turlov.
As a result of the closing of the acquisition of FFIN, Mr. Turlov was issued approximately 80.1%
of  the  outstanding  common  stock  of  BMBM  after  giving  effect  to  the  transaction.  He  was  also
appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors. The
Company  has  determined  to  treat  the  acquisition  of  FFIN  as  a  reverse  merger  and
recapitalization,  with  FFIN  as  the  acquirer  for  accounting  purposes.  Consequently,  the  assets
and  liabilities  and  the  historical  operations  that  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  financial
statements  are  those  of  FFIN.  These  financial  statements  are  presented  as  a  continuation  of
FFIN. The equity of FFIN is presented as the equity of the combined company and the capital
stock account of FFIN is adjusted to reflect the par value of the issued and outstanding common
stock of the Company, being the legal acquirer, after giving effect to the number of shares issued
in connection with the acquisition of FFIN.

Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The  Company’s  consolidated  financial  statements  present  the  consolidated  results  of  FFIN
Securities, Inc., including the results of its parent, BMB Munai, Inc., starting November 24, 2015.
All  significant  inter-company  balances  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated  from  the
consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Principles
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America
(“US  GAAP”)  for  interim  financial  information  and  pursuant  to  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the
SEC.    Accordingly,  they  are  condensed  and  do  not  include  all  of  the  information  and  notes
required  by  US  GAAP  for  complete  financial  statements.    In  the  opinion  of  management,  all
adjustments considered necessary for a fair and comparable presentation have been included
and are of a normal recurring nature. The accompanying financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company’s most recent audited annual financial statements included in its
annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on July 14, 2016.  Operating results for the three-
month  period  ended  June  30,  2016,  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  the  results  that  may  be
expected for the year ending March 31, 2017.
Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  US  GAAP  requires  management  to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes
that  the  estimates  utilized  in  preparing  its  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and  prudent.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue and Expense Recognition
 
Subject to compliance with regulatory requirements and the commencement of securities broker-
dealer activities, revenues and expenses from all securities transactions will be recorded on the
trade  date  of  the  transaction.  The  Company  does  not  participate  in  any  proprietary  securities
transactions. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had not yet
established  an  ongoing  source  of  revenue  sufficient  to  cover  its  operating  costs  as  it  pursues
the application and licensure process to become a registered broker-dealer in the United States.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are generally comprised of certain highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less at the date of purchase.
Fixed Assets
Fixed  assets  are  carried  at  cost,  net  of  accumulated  depreciation.  Maintenance,  repairs,  and
minor  renewals  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Depreciation  is  computed  using  the  straight-line
method  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  the  assets,  which  range  between  three  and  seven
years.
 
Advertising Expense
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has had no expenses related
to advertising. The Company does not anticipate engaging in any advertising activities until after
regulatory  approval  is  received.  At  that  point  all  costs  associated  with  advertising  will  be
expensed in the period incurred.
Impairment of Long Lived Assets
In accordance with the accounting guidance for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets,
the Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used
when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset
is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is less than
its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the
anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-
lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are
reduced for the cost of disposal. As of June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company had not
recorded any charges for impairment of long-lived assets.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the difference between the
financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for
the  year  in  which  the  differences  are  expected  to  reverse.  The  measurement  of  deferred  tax
assets  is  reduced,  if  necessary,  by  the  amount  of  any  tax  benefits  that,  based  on  available
evidence, are not expected to be realized.

BMB MUNAI, INC.
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
Income  tax  expense  differs  from  amounts  that  would  be  calculated  by  applying  the  federal
statutory  rate  because  of  the  federal  surtax,  state  income  tax  rates,  certain  nondeductible
expenses, and net operating loss carrybacks, if any.
The Company will include interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes
in the statement of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2016 and March
31, 2016, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
Tax years that remain subject to examination are years 2012 through 2015.
Financial Instruments
Financial instruments include employee receivables, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, and
accrued  expenses.  Management  estimates  that  the  carrying  amount  of  these  financial
instruments represents their fair values, which were determined by their near term nature or by
comparable financial instruments’ market value.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update  (ASU)  2014-09,  “Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers.”  Revenue  is  an  important
number  to  users  of  financial  statements  in  assessing  an  entity’s  financial  performance  and
position.  Previous  revenue  recognition  guidance  in  US  GAAP  comprised  broad  revenue
recognition  concepts  together  with  numerous  revenue  requirements  for  particular  industries  or
transactions,  which  sometimes  resulted  in  different  accounting  for  economically  similar
transactions. Accordingly, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
initiated a joint project to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common
revenue  standard  for  US  GAAP  and  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  that
would:
 
 1. Remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements.
 2. Provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues.
 3.Improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions,
and capital markets.
4.Provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure
requirements.
5.Simplify  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  by  reducing  the  number  of  requirements  to
which an entity must refer.

BMB MUNAI, INC.
NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
To meet these objectives, the FASB is amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
(ASC) and creating a new Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”  The Company
will  be  evaluating  the  impact  of  ASU  2014-09  as  it  pertains  to  the  Company’s  financial
statements and other required disclosures on an ongoing basis until its eventual adoption and
incorporation.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, “Development Stage Entities.”  The amendments
in this update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the
ASC,  thereby  removing  the  financial  reporting  distinction  between  development  stage  entities
and  other  reporting  entities  from  US  GAAP.  In  addition,  the  amendments  eliminate  the
requirements for development stage entities to: (1) present inception-to-date information in the
statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity; (2) label the financial statements as
those of a development stage entity; (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities
in which the entity is engaged; and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a
development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The Company
has  elected  early  adoption  of  ASU  2014-10.  As  a  result,  the  Company  has  not  included  any
references to the development stage.
In  August  2014,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2014-15,  “Presentation  of  Financial  Statements  –
Going  Concern  (Subtopic  205-40):  Disclosure  of  Uncertainties  about  an  Entity’s  Ability  to
Continue  as  a  Going  Concern.”  The  amendments  in  this  update  define  management’s
responsibility  to  evaluate  whether  there  is  substantial  doubt  about  an  organization’s  ability  to
continue as a going concern and provides related footnote disclosure requirements. Under US
GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization
will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting
under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The
going  concern  basis  of  accounting  establishes  the  fundamental  basis  for  measuring  and
classifying  assets  and  liabilities.  This  update  provides  guidance  on  when  there  is  substantial
doubt  about  an  organization’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  how  the  underlying
conditions and events should be disclosed in the footnotes. It is intended to reduce diversity that
existed in footnote disclosures because of the lack of guidance about when substantial doubt
existed.  The  amendments  in  this  update  are  effective  for  the  Company  beginning  in  the  first
quarter of 2017. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect
that  the  updated  standard  will  have  on  its  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related
disclosures.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments
to the Consolidation Analysis.” The amendment eliminates the deferral of certain consolidation
standards  for  entities  considered  to  be  investment  companies  and  modifies  the  consolidation
analysis  performed  on  certain  types  of  legal  entities.  The  guidance  is  effective  beginning
January 1, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of the new guidance on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

the  Accounting
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, “Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Simplifying 
for  Measurement-Period  Adjustments.”  This  ASU  requires
adjustments  to  provisional  amounts  that  are  identified  during  the  measurement  period  of  a
business combination to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts
are  determined.  Acquirers  are  no  longer  required  to  revise  comparative  information  for  prior
periods  as  if  the  accounting  for  the  business  combination  had  been  completed  as  of  the
acquisition  date.  The  guidance  is  effective  beginning  January  1,  2016,  with  early  adoption
permitted. The adoption of this FASB guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance
Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.”  This new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities
and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current
requirement  that  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  of  a  tax-paying  component  of  an  entity  be
offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the new guidance. The new guidance
is effective for the Company on April 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of
an interim or annual reporting period. The new guidance may be applied either prospectively to
all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is
evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic
825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” This ASU
requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not
accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in
net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicability exception. Entities will also
have to record changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured under
the  fair  value  option  in  other  comprehensive  income.  In  addition,  entities  will  be  required  to
present  enhanced  disclosures  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities.  The  guidance  is
effective  beginning  January  1,  2018,  with  early  adoption  of  certain  provisions  of  the  ASU
permitted.  The  Company  is  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  the  new  guidance  on  its
consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires
lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than
12  months.  Recognition,  measurement  and  presentation  of  expenses  will  depend  on
classification as a finance or operating lease. The amendments also require certain quantitative
and qualitative disclosures. Accounting guidance for lessors is largely unchanged. The guidance
is effective beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

Item 2.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and
our present financial condition. Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain additional
information that should be referred to when reviewing this material and this document should be
read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in
this report and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K filed on July 14, 2016.
Throughout this report, unless otherwise indicated by the context, references herein to “we,” our,”
and “us” mean BMB Munai, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and our subsidiaries and predecessors.
Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations all references to dollar amounts ($) refers to U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.
Special Note About Forward-Looking Information
Certain information included herein contains statements that may be considered forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”) such as statements relating to our anticipated revenues, gross margin and
operating results, estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, future
performance and operations, plans for future expansion, capital spending, sources of liquidity,
and financing sources.  Forward-looking information involves important risks and uncertainties
that could significantly affect anticipated results in the future, and accordingly, such results may
differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made herein.  These forward-
looking statements can sometimes be recognized by the use of words such as “anticipate,”
“believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” and similar expressions.  Such statements are
subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including the meaningful
and important risks and uncertainties discussed in this report.  These forward-looking statements
are based on the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information
currently available to management.  These statements include, among other things:
●the ability of our subsidiary to become a member of FINRA and licensed with the SEC and state
securities authorities to transact business as a registered securities broker-dealer in the United
States, should it elect to pursue such registration;
●the ability of our acquisition targets to obtain necessary regulatory approvals to maintain their
foreign licensing in connection with the transfer of ownership from the current owner to us;
●the ability of our acquisition targets to prepare required financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting standards (GAAS) and generally accepted accounting practices
in the United States (US GAAP);
15
●our ability to launch operations as a fully functioning securities broker-dealer able to serve our
proposed customers;
●our ability to attract and retain key management and other properly licensed and experienced
personnel to satisfy applicable regulatory standards;
● our financial performance, including our limited operating history;
●possible  lack  of  interest  by  foreign  investors  to  invest  in  securities  of  U.S.  publicly  traded
companies; and
●our ability to comply with the extensive and pervasive regulatory requirements in the various
jurisdictions where we may operate.
Although we have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially, there may be other factors that cause the forward-looking statements not to come true
as described in this report.  These forward-looking statements are only predictions. Should one
or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove
incorrect, actual results may vary materially.
You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.  While we
believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we
cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance and achievements.  Moreover,
neither we nor any other person assumes any responsibility for the accuracy and completeness
of these statements or undertakes any obligation to revise these forward-looking statements to
reflect events and circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.
Overview
As discussed in Note 1 – Description of Business of the notes to our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements accompanying this report, on November 23, 2015, we entered
into the Acquisition Agreement pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding
common stock of FFIN Securities, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“FFIN”) from Timur Turlov in
exchange for 224,551,913 shares of our common stock, which comprised approximately 80.1%
of our outstanding common stock after giving effect to the transaction.  We entered into the
Acquisition Agreement with the intent to build an international, broadly based brokerage and
financial services firm to meet the growing demand from an increasing number of investors in
Russia and Kazakhstan for access to the financial opportunities, relative stability, and
comprehensive regulatory reputation of the U.S. securities markets.
 
16
The Acquisition Agreement provides, subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions, for
the possible acquisition by us of Mr. Turlov’s 100% equity interests in Investment Company
Freedom Finance LLC, a Russian limited company (“Freedom RU”), Freedom RU’s wholly
owned subsidiary, Freedom Finance JSC, a Kazakhstan joint stock company (“Freedom KZ”),
FFINEU Investments Limited, a Cyprus limited company (“Freedom CY”) (collectively, the
“Freedom Companies”), and the securities brokerage and financial services businesses
conducted by them.  We believe the Freedom Companies serve an emerging capitalistic and
investing segment of the economies of Russia and Kazakhstan that is interested in saving,
investing, and diversifying risk through foreign investment. Under the existing regulatory regimes
in Russia and Kazakhstan, Freedom RU and Freedom KZ are limited in their ability to grant their
customers access to the U.S. securities markets.
Mr. Turlov is seeking a more sustainable, long-term strategy to allow his customer base in Russia
and Kazakhstan to participate in the U.S. markets because of what he perceives to be the
growing disfavor of omnibus clearing accounts for foreign financial institutions among regulators
and U.S. financial institutions as well as customer concerns that the Freedom Companies
expose them to attendant political, regulatory, currency, banking, and economic risks and
uncertainties in their respective countries of operation.  To meet this perceived need, Mr. Turlov
organized FFIN in August 2014, to serve primarily foreign clients referred from Freedom RU and
Freedom KZ as part of a strategy to provide foreign customers with access to the U.S. securities
markets within a single vertically integrated financial services firm.
In December 2015, FFIN applied to become a member to FINRA and a licensed securities
broker-dealer with the SEC.  In June 2016, FFIN withdrew its application to provide itself
additional time to collect information requested by FINRA and to assess whether to reapply for
licensure.  Currently we anticipate FFIN will submit a new application to FINRA, but there is no
guarantee that it will do so.  If FFIN determines to reapply for broker-dealer registration, we
anticipate it would do so before the end of calendar 2016.  In addition to FINRA membership and
SEC licensure, FFIN would also be required to comply with the state securities licensure
requirements.
We continue to work toward successful completion of the acquisition of Freedom RU, and its
wholly-owned subsidiary Freedom KZ, and Freedom CY.  The acquisition of Freedom RU and
Freedom CY are separate transactions that are not interdependent, so we may acquire either,
both or none of such companies.  The acquisition of the Freedom Companies is also not
contingent upon FFIN’s decision whether to pursue licensure to operate as a broker-dealer in the
U.S., or whether FFIN is ultimately successful in becoming a U.S. registered broker-dealer in the
event it elects to pursue such licensure.  In the event FFIN elects not to pursue licensure, or if it is
ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining licensure if pursued, we anticipate the Freedom Companies
would continue to provide their clients access to the U.S. markets in the same manner they do
currently.
The completion of the acquisition of Freedom RU and Freedom CY is dependent on the express
conditions that:
(i)           the particular Freedom Company to be acquired completes and provides to us audited
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP and GAAS, so that we
can include such audited financial statements in our periodic reports filed with the SEC;
 
17
(ii)           the particular Freedom Company to be acquired has received all required governmental
and regulatory approvals for the change of ownership from its current ownership to us;  and
(iii)           if, at the time of the proposed closing, we do not have sufficient authorized but unissued
shares to issue the number of shares as we agreed in the Acquisition Agreement, we will effect a
recapitalization consisting of: (i) a reverse split of our outstanding common stock in such amount
as our board of directors may determine; and (ii) a possible increase in the number of our
authorized common stock in such amount as our board may determine.
Completion of each acquisition is also conditioned on the continuing accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the respective parties to the Acquisition Agreement, and the
satisfaction of certain conditions and other covenants, many of which may be waived by either
party.
We may abandon the acquisition of either Freedom RU or Freedom CY if it is not completed by
December 31, 2016.  If we do not complete either of such acquisitions, we may nevertheless
execute securities transactions of the customers of such Freedom Companies not acquired under
introducing, execution, clearing, and settlement arrangements common in the securities industry
and at competitive rates if FFIN determines to reapply for and is approved to become  a
registered securities broker-dealer in the United States and satisfies applicable regulatory
requirements.  The Acquisition Agreement does not grant to us any right or remedy to rescind our
acquisition of FFIN if we do not complete the acquisition of the Freedom Companies because of
their failure to provide required audited financial statements or meet other pre-closing conditions.
Results of Operations
This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity and capital resources during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
accompanying this report.
Three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015
Revenue
We did not generate any revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.
Expenses
Operating Expenses.  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, operating expenses totaled
$251,278 compared to operating expenses of $150,666 during three months ended June 30,
2015. The increase was primarily attributable to a $69,917 increase in professional fees resulting
from increased accounting and audit fees, and a $30,641 increase in general and administrative
expenses, due to higher payroll, rent, and general office expenses.
 
18
Loss from Operations.  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a loss from
operations of $251,278, compared to a loss from operations of $150,666 during the three months
ended June 30, 2015. This increase in loss from operations during the three months ended June
30, 2016, was the result of the increases in professional fees and general and administrative
expenses described above.
Total Other Income.  During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized total other
income of $979, compared to total other income of $22 during the three months ended June 30,
2015.  The increase resulted from higher interest income on our cash balances.
Net Loss.  For the reasons discussed above, during the three months ended June 30, 2016, we
realized a net loss of $250,299 compared to a net loss of $150,744 for the three months ended
June 30, 2015.  Because we have no revenue, we expect to continue to realize net losses in
upcoming fiscal periods until we start generating revenue from our planned business activities.
Cash Flows
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, cash was primarily used to pay for current
expenses.  See below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow.

NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH
EQUIVALENTS
 
Net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended June 30, 2016, was lower
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily as a result of a $151,958 increase
in accounts payable, which was only partially offset by a $99,555 increase in net loss and a
$47,038 increase in prepaid expenses.
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was
$85,000 compared to $0 during the three months ended June 30, 2015.  All funds provided by
financing activities resulted from capital contributions to the Company by Mr. Turlov.
 
Our principal source of liquidity during the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, was cash
and cash equivalents. At June 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $169,066 compared
to $99,679 at March 31, 2016.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates
We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully
understanding and evaluating this “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.”
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Because we are a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information
required by this Item.
 
20
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of June 30, 2016, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the 2013 framework of the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.   Based on this
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e)) our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report
in timely alerting them to information required to be included in the Company’s periodic filings
with the Commission.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months
ended June 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1A. Risk Factors
