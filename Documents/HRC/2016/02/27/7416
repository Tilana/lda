<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 7/13 
</p>
<p>and 25/6. It describes the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur since her effective 
</p>
<p>appointment on 2 June 2014 and provides an outline of the direction that she intends to give 
</p>
<p>to her work during her tenure. The second part of the report provides a thematic update on 
</p>
<p>the issue of information and communication technologies and the sale and sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. The outgoing Special Rapporteur conducted a follow-up visit to Honduras from 21 
</p>
<p>to 25 April 2014. The report of that visit is presented as an addendum 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/56/Add.1) to this report.  
</p>
<p>3. The new Special Rapporteur sent requests for visits to Armenia, Bulgaria, the 
</p>
<p>Dominican Republic, Georgia, Japan and Mozambique. She highly appreciates the positive 
</p>
<p>responses received from Armenia and Georgia, and looks forward to agreeing on official 
</p>
<p>dates for visits. In addition, as part of her commitment to continuing the work of her 
</p>
<p>predecessors, the Special Rapporteur proposed new dates for a visit to India in 2015, and 
</p>
<p>renewed requests for visits to Gambia, Thailand and Viet Nam. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>recalls that the Human Right Council resolution 7/13 encourages States to respond 
</p>
<p>favourably to these requests in order to enable her to fulfil her mandate effectively. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur appreciates the invitations extended by the Governments of Belarus and 
</p>
<p>Egypt to undertake an official visit to those countries, and will take them into consideration 
</p>
<p>in the planning of future country visits.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Conferences, meetings and engagement with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur participated in numerous conferences and expert meetings 
</p>
<p>related to her mandate, which allowed her to exchange information on developments, share 
</p>
<p>good practices and raise awareness of issues of concern in relation to her mandate. On 9 
</p>
<p>and 10 June, she attended an expert consultation on information and communication 
</p>
<p>technologies and violence against children organized in San Jos&#233; by the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children. On 9 and 
</p>
<p>10 September, she participated at the Third Expert Meeting on Returns and Transfers in 
</p>
<p>Practice: Case examples of children exposed to exploitation, trafficking and children at risk, 
</p>
<p>organized in Vilnius by the Council of the Baltic Sea States. On 12 September, she 
</p>
<p>participated at the day of general discussion on digital media and children&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>organized in Geneva by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. On 10 October, she 
</p>
<p>participated in the Annual Conference on the Rights of the Girl Child: A World without 
</p>
<p>Child Marriage: How do we get there?, organized in Oslo by Plan Norway.  
</p>
<p>5. On 15 October, the Special Rapporteur presented her annual report (A/69/262) to the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly. On 16 October, she participated at a high-level panel on information 
</p>
<p>and communication technologies, the Internet and violence against children organized by 
</p>
<p>the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children. On 21 </p>


<p>October, the Special Rapporteur participated at a session on cybercrime and children during 
</p>
<p>the Law, Justice and Development Week of the World Bank in Washington, D.C. On 30 
</p>
<p>October, she gave a keynote speech in London at the Seventh International Consultation of 
</p>
<p>Child Helplines. On 4 November, she attended the event on the thirtieth anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment, organized in Geneva by the Committee against Torture.  
</p>
<p>6. On 20 November, the Special Rapporteur addressed the General Assembly high-
</p>
<p>level meeting on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child and participated in a high-level panel discussion on the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child organized by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
</p>
<p>Violence against Children. On 24 November, the Special Rapporteur participated at the 
</p>
<p>event on children on the move and information and communication technologies organized 
</p>
<p>in Stockholm by Save the Children. On 2 December, she participated at the International 
</p>
<p>Assembly of End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for 
</p>
<p>Sexual Purposes (ECPAT International) in Paris. On 10 December, she participated at the 
</p>
<p>opening of the Children Online Global Summit to tackle online child sexual exploitation 
</p>
<p>organized in London by the Home Office of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland.  
</p>
<p>7. Since her appointment, the Special Rapporteur has conducted four working visits to 
</p>
<p>Geneva and two working visits to New York, where she held initial consultations with 
</p>
<p>many stakeholders relevant to her mandate, including the Special Representative of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for Violence against Children, the Special Representative of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, the Special Representative of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
</p>
<p>(UNICEF), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Population Fund, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
</p>
<p>Women (UN-Women), the International Telecommunication Union, the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its 
</p>
<p>causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
</p>
<p>women and children, the Trustee of the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on 
</p>
<p>Contemporary Forms of Slavery and various non-governmental organizations.1  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>8. Summaries of communications sent and replies received during the period covered 
</p>
<p>by the present report appear in the communications reports of special procedures 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/74 and A/HRC/26/21).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Mandate on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Approach and scope 
</b></p>
<p>9. As reported to the General Assembly (A/69/262, paras. 8&#8211;20), the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur intends to ensure the continuity of the work of her predecessors. At the same 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 International Catholic Child Bureau, Caritas Internationalis, Casa Alianza Suisse, Child Rights 
</p>
<p>Connect, Child Rights Information Network, Defence for Children International, ECPAT, 
</p>
<p>International Dalit Solidarity Network, Oak Foundation, Plan International, Save the Children, Terre 
</p>
<p>des Hommes Federation Internationale, Under the Same Sun Fund and World Vision International. </p>


<p>time, she will explore new directions in which to develop the mandate based on her vision 
</p>
<p>and interaction with stakeholders concerned. She will take a consultative and participatory 
</p>
<p>approach in the implementation of her mandate, and will engage in constructive dialogue 
</p>
<p>with Member States and relevant partners. Her intention is to act as a facilitator of action-
</p>
<p>oriented dialogue among key stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur will adopt a child-centred approach in the implementation of 
</p>
<p>her mandate. All activities will be developed incorporating the principles and rights 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Children will be treated as rights 
</p>
<p>holders, and not as passive recipients, victims or dependants. The Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>use child participation mechanisms to establish a direct relationship with children to take 
</p>
<p>into account their suggestions in an effective and meaningful way. She will integrate a 
</p>
<p>gender perspective into her work, taking into account the different needs and opportunities 
</p>
<p>of boys and girls through, inter alia, the collection and analysis of disaggregated data and 
</p>
<p>the proposal of gender-specific recommendations. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur intends to work in close coordination with various United 
</p>
<p>Nations partners who deal with violations affecting children, in particular, the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
</p>
<p>Violence against Children. She also intends to ensure complementarity with the special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders who address cross-cutting issues of concern. She will deploy 
</p>
<p>efforts to mainstream the protection of children&#8217;s rights within the special procedures 
</p>
<p>system. The Special Rapporteur also aims at strengthening cooperation with regional 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, such as the Special Rapporteur on Child Marriage of the African Union and 
</p>
<p>the Rapporteur on the Rights of the Child of the Inter-American Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. In addition, she will advocate the establishment of a permanent regional mechanism 
</p>
<p>for the protection of children&#8217;s rights in Asia and the Pacific. 
</p>
<p>12. The scope of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur is determined by the resolutions 
</p>
<p>on the establishment and renewal of the mandate, in particular Commission on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights resolution 1990/68 and Human Rights Council resolution 7/13. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur will continue to analyse the root causes of the sale and sexual exploitation of 
</p>
<p>children; address all the contributing factors, including demand; make recommendations on 
</p>
<p>preventing and combating new patterns of the phenomena; identify and promote good 
</p>
<p>practices on measures to combat them; promote comprehensive prevention strategies; and 
</p>
<p>make recommendations on aspects relating to the rehabilitation of child victims.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>13. For the strategic implementation of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur intends to 
</p>
<p>maximize the potential of established methods of work of the special procedures system 
</p>
<p>(see A/69/262, paras. 21&#8211;37). She will continue to take a holistic approach towards 
</p>
<p>effectively combating the sale and sexual exploitation of children. That involves promoting 
</p>
<p>the implementation of comprehensive strategies aimed at the establishment of rights-based 
</p>
<p>national child protection systems. She will aim to propose specific and action-oriented 
</p>
<p>recommendations, and promote good practices. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur will determine her thematic priorities based on the gaps and 
</p>
<p>needs identified in relation to issues of concern covered by her mandate. Through her 
</p>
<p>country visits, the Special Rapporteur intends to assist States in better preventing and 
</p>
<p>combating the sale and sexual exploitation of children, and to enhance the preventive role 
</p>
<p>of the special procedures system by highlighting situations that have the potential to 
</p>
<p>degenerate into gross human rights violations. The Special Rapporteur intends to react to 
</p>
<p>information on allegations of individual violations and human rights concerns regarding 
</p>
<p>legislation, policies and practices that fall within the scope of her mandate through </p>


<p>communications sent to the Governments and other stakeholders concerned with preventing 
</p>
<p>violations and protecting children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur intends to maximize awareness-raising opportunities offered 
</p>
<p>by two commemorative dates in 2015, namely the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation 
</p>
<p>of her mandate and the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography. In addition, 2016 will mark the twentieth anniversary of the first World 
</p>
<p>Congress against Sexual Exploitation of Children, and she intends to support advocacy 
</p>
<p>activities calling for the implementation of the political commitments adopted at relevant 
</p>
<p>world congresses. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur will closely follow negotiations on the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda in order to ensure that putting an end to sexual abuse, violence and 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children becomes a reality by 2030.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Information and communication technologies and the sale 
and sexual exploitation of children 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Objective and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>17. Building upon the work of her predecessors, the Special Rapporteur submits her first 
</p>
<p>thematic report on the issue of information and communication technologies and the sale 
</p>
<p>and sexual exploitation of children. In the present section, she updates the studies presented 
</p>
<p>on the topic by her predecessors in 2005 (E/CN.4/2005/78, Corr.1 and Corr.2) and 2009 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/12/23), and aims to reflect new trends, forms, challenges, threats and responses to 
</p>
<p>the phenomenon, available legal instruments and good practices that assist in preventing 
</p>
<p>and combating the scourge. 
</p>
<p>18. The present report was prepared on the basis of a comprehensive literature review 
</p>
<p>focused on the issue of online child sexual exploitation. Specific studies on the different 
</p>
<p>regions of the world were sought. Consultations were held with stakeholders that are 
</p>
<p>conducting research and informing policy on the topic. The expert meetings attended by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur allowed the gathering of additional up-to-date elements. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the following stakeholders for the 
</p>
<p>information provided: ECPAT International, the International Centre for Missing and 
</p>
<p>Exploited Children, Save the Children, the INHOPE network, the Virtual Global Taskforce, 
</p>
<p>the Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Online, the International 
</p>
<p>Telecommunication Union, UNICEF and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
</p>
<p>(UNODC). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Background 
</b></p>
<p>20. Children are among those who are most familiar with new technologies. They use 
</p>
<p>them to facilitate their social lives, seek access to information and express their identity.2 
</p>
<p>However, technology also poses risks to children. The thematic report seeks to identify 
</p>
<p>those harms and how they occur and trace responses developed to tackle them.

</p>
<p>p. 8. </p>


<p>21. Information and communication technologies allow users to communicate with each 
</p>
<p>other and, in particular, to access the Internet. The most significant advance in the Internet 
</p>
<p>is the growth of mobile technologies, which include laptops, tablets and mobile telephones. 
</p>
<p>The latter have gone through major developmental changes since 2.5G phones, which 
</p>
<p>introduced access to the Internet. The advent of 3G and 4G mobile phones has meant that 
</p>
<p>the speed of access to the Internet is almost as fast as traditional Internet technologies. 
</p>
<p>22. By 2013, the number of Internet users worldwide had risen to 2.8 billion, meaning 
</p>
<p>that nearly 40 per cent of the world&#8217;s population had access to the Internet. However, there 
</p>
<p>are significant regional variations in Internet penetration. Europe has a penetration rate of 
</p>
<p>nearly 70 per cent and North America of nearly 85 per cent. Africa has a penetration rate of 
</p>
<p>21 per cent and Asia of 32 per cent.3 Those figures reflect trends at regional levels but they 
</p>
<p>mask penetration differences within each region. 
</p>
<p>23. It is estimated that on average one third of children have had access to the Internet in 
</p>
<p>the past five years,4 although that figure masks those countries where child use of Internet is 
</p>
<p>almost universal. In Europe, 70 per cent of children aged 6&#8211;17 used the Internet regularly, 
</p>
<p>with some variations among countries.5 In Africa, for the vast majority of children, access 
</p>
<p>is not at home or school but through a cybercaf&#233;,6 although mobile technologies are leading 
</p>
<p>to a change in African use of the Internet.7 Estimates from the Asian region show a wider 
</p>
<p>discrepancy among countries, with Malaysia as an example of a developing economy where 
</p>
<p>the use of new technologies is increasing and China having one of the highest growth rates 
</p>
<p>of technology in the world.8 In Latin America, there is similar discrepancy, which replicates 
</p>
<p>the different economic development of the countries. In general, the youth are leading the 
</p>
<p>emergence of the use of new technologies in developing economies; therefore they are 
</p>
<p>more likely to be leading the way to Internet usage.9 
</p>
<p>24. The growth in mobile technology has meant that more children have access to 
</p>
<p>personal use of Internet, and that the average time that children are spending on the Internet 
</p>
<p>continues to grow.10 The actual use made of the Internet seems to differ between children. 
</p>
<p>Younger children are less likely to use the social aspect of the Internet and are more likely 
</p>
<p>to use it to access information.11 Older children (aged 14&#8211;18) primarily use it as a 
</p>
<p>communication tool and will regularly use social media.

<p><b> C. Overview of the issues and trends relating to the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>25. While new technologies offer a myriad of opportunities for children, they can also 
</p>
<p>facilitate harm against them, including the commission of criminal activities such as the 
</p>
<p>sale and sexual exploitation of children. Moreover, information and communication 
</p>
<p>technologies have also created new threats or forms of abuse, such as the solicitation of 
</p>
<p>children and the live streaming of child abuse. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>26. Child pornography can be considered as the exploitative behaviour committed or 
</p>
<p>facilitated through new technologies which captures most attention. Article 2 (c) of the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
</p>
<p>prostitution and child pornography defines child pornography as &#8220;any representation, by 
</p>
<p>whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any 
</p>
<p>representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes&#8221;. It is a wide 
</p>
<p>definition which may include non-visual depictions, such as text and sound. Some regional 
</p>
<p>instruments, such as the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children 
</p>
<p>against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (art. 20, para. 2) and the Draft African Union 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Establishment of a Legal Framework Conducive to Cyber Security in 
</p>
<p>Africa (art. III-1), apply only to visual depictions, usually photographs, but increasingly 
</p>
<p>such instruments also refer to &#8220;virtual child pornography&#8221;. Likewise, few domestic 
</p>
<p>countries define child pornography as including expressly non-visual depictions.12  
</p>
<p>27. Article 3, paragraph 1 (c), of the Optional Protocol requires States to criminalize 
</p>
<p>producing, distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling or possessing 
</p>
<p>child pornography. A previous mandate holder called for the criminalization of all steps in 
</p>
<p>the child pornography process (E/CN.4/2005/78, para. 123), including simple possession, 
</p>
<p>as done by the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual 
</p>
<p>Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (art. 20, para. 1). However, new technologies have 
</p>
<p>transformed what is meant by possession, since the growth in Internet speeds means that it 
</p>
<p>is no longer necessary to download images because they can be viewed online. Some 
</p>
<p>regional instruments require the intentional accessing of child pornography,13 and that 
</p>
<p>model has been followed by some countries.14 
</p>
<p>28. New technologies have revolutionized the way child pornography is created and 
</p>
<p>traded. On the Internet, collections of child abuse material can contain millions of images.15 
</p>
<p>In addition, there has been a shift in the way material is traded, moving away from the web 
</p>
<p>to peer-to-peer networks, which facilitates evading filtering and other detection software, 
</p>
<p>therefore reducing risk to those seeking and distributing child pornography. Online virtual 
</p>
<p>currencies also allow measures taken by the financial industry to combat commercial online 
</p>
<p>child sexual exploitation to be evaded, as they are often subject to less transparency. The 
</p>
<p>Internet also allows for anonymous payment methods which render even more difficult to 
</p>
<p>trace the purchaser of exploitative material. 
</p>
<p>29. The overwhelming majority of those seeking child pornography are male,16 and the 
</p>
<p>vast majority of victims are female.17 The age of child victims is becoming ever younger 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>and the content more graphic.18 It should be noted that many stakeholders prefer to use the 
</p>
<p>term &#8220;child abuse material&#8221; instead of &#8220;child pornography&#8221;, since the latter trivializes the 
</p>
<p>abuse suffered by children, and can be misleading as to its illegal nature, as the term 
</p>
<p>&#8220;pornography&#8221; covers largely consensual activities among adults. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>endorses using a more child rights-compliant term, such as &#8220;child abuse material&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>30. Article 2 (b) of the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
</p>
<p>child pornography defines child prostitution as the use of a child in sexual activities for 
</p>
<p>remuneration or any other form of consideration. The consideration need not be financial 
</p>
<p>but could include other forms of payment, such as benefits in kind, including 
</p>
<p>accommodation or drugs. The definition covers payment given to the child and the 
</p>
<p>controlling adult. Article 3, paragraph 1 (b), of the Optional Protocol requires that States 
</p>
<p>criminalize the offering, obtaining, procuring or providing a child for child prostitution, 
</p>
<p>which covers most of the supply aspects of child prostitution. 
</p>
<p>31. Child prostitution is facilitated by the Internet in a number of ways, including 
</p>
<p>mobile telephone applications and websites which offer children for prostitution on online 
</p>
<p>classified advertising sites. Technology has also led to changes by those who control 
</p>
<p>prostitution. Traffickers use technology to advertise their services widely and develop new 
</p>
<p>methods to recruit, manipulate and lure potential victims.19 The Internet allows for these 
</p>
<p>clandestine illegal activities to be more shrouded in secrecy, with advertisements being 
</p>
<p>restricted to niche sites to hide their activities from law enforcement.20 As a result, 
</p>
<p>identifying the number of children who are trafficked over the Internet for prostitution is 
</p>
<p>very difficult.21 
</p>
<p>32. The Internet presents new challenges to the international protection framework, in 
</p>
<p>particular, in relation to those who control some of the activities of a child who is 
</p>
<p>prostituted. For instance, when someone creates a website that advertises a child for 
</p>
<p>prostitution, he or she is facilitating the offering of a child. Some States have adopted 
</p>
<p>legislation to criminalize these acts,22 which is welcome. Another aspect not covered by 
</p>
<p>international instruments is the criminalization of those who knowingly seek and pay to 
</p>
<p>have sex with a child who is prostituted, the so-called demand factor. It is important that 
</p>
<p>those who seek to sexually abuse or exploit a child are the subject of criminal sanctions. 
</p>
<p>33. As in the case of child pornography, many stakeholders consider more appropriate 
</p>
<p>the term &#8220;children who are prostituted&#8221; because it reflects more truthfully the lack of choice 
</p>
<p>of child victims and the control exercised over them by adults. In addition, child 
</p>
<p>prostitution can be misleading to the extent that prostitution of adults is lawful in certain 
</p>
<p>countries. As in the previous case, the Special Rapporteur endorses using a child rights-
</p>
<p>compliant term.

<p><b> 3. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>34. Article 3, paragraph 1 (a), of the Optional Protocol requires that States criminalize 
</p>
<p>the sale of children, in particular, the offering, delivering or accepting of a child for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of sexual exploitation, transfer of organs or the engagement of a child in forced 
</p>
<p>labour, and improperly inducing consent for the illegal adoption of a child. New 
</p>
<p>technologies have a significant impact on the different forms of the sale of children. It is 
</p>
<p>estimated that up to 10 million children are victims of child sexual exploitation. Forty-three 
</p>
<p>per cent of victims of trafficking are trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation, 
</p>
<p>which is an illegal activity estimated to be worth between US$7 and US$19 billion a year.23  
</p>
<p>35. The Internet has led the expansion of the sale and trafficking of children for the 
</p>
<p>purposes of illegal adoption, partly because it allows the creation of websites which offer 
</p>
<p>children as commodities across borders. People in one country may seek to give a child a 
</p>
<p>better life without knowing the truth about the origin of the child.24 With prospective 
</p>
<p>parents being prepared to pay up to $70,000 per child in adoption fees, illegal activities 
</p>
<p>around adoption can be a lucrative business.  
</p>
<p>36. The Internet facilitates the sale of children in numerous ways. The trade in organs is 
</p>
<p>a global phenomenon25 worth US$75 million per year.26 New technologies facilitate the 
</p>
<p>secrecy in that illegal trade, making it difficult to identify the number of cases, including 
</p>
<p>cases of sale of children for the purpose of transfer of organs. In cases of sale for the 
</p>
<p>purposes of child labour, the Internet may be used to identify job opportunities or facilitate 
</p>
<p>communication between traffickers. Deceit through advertising jobs is also a concern in 
</p>
<p>cases of sale for sexual exploitation, where job opportunities in hospitality or domestic 
</p>
<p>service may constitute covers for forced servitude, including sexual servitude.27 
</p>
<p>37. Trafficking and sale of children are gendered crimes which generate significantly 
</p>
<p>more female than male victims.28 Statistically, there is a significant number of female 
</p>
<p>perpetrators, but there continues to be more male perpetrators than female.29 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Solicitation of children </b>or &#8220;grooming&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>38. A form of exploitation and abuse that is not expressly mentioned by the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography is the solicitation 
</p>
<p>of children, also known as &#8220;grooming&#8221;. That is not a new form of exploitation since the 
</p>
<p>grooming of a child &#8212; which involves conditioning the child to ensure he or she acquiesces 
</p>
<p>to sexual contact &#8212; is an inherent part of the process of abusing a child. The Internet 
</p>
<p>allows for that process to be quickened, partly because offenders can pretend to be children 
</p>
<p>initially.30 The grooming is the &#8220;wooing&#8221; of a child and persuading them that they are in a

<p>relationship. While initial concern was in respect of offenders who sought to meet the child 
</p>
<p>offline and sexually assault them, the behaviour has changed. It is common now for the 
</p>
<p>solicitation to consist of persuading the child to engage in sexual activity in front of a 
</p>
<p>webcam, the footage of which will then be recorded, or to send sexualized photographs to 
</p>
<p>the offender. Once the footage or photographs have been gathered they will either be 
</p>
<p>distributed or used by an offender for &#8220;sextortion&#8221;, namely the sexual blackmailing of a 
</p>
<p>child or his or her family. 
</p>
<p>39. Identifying how often grooming occurs is problematic because many victims will 
</p>
<p>not report the abuse. Almost one in three children in Europe aged 9&#8211;16 communicated with 
</p>
<p>someone they did not know online.31 In Latin America a slightly higher percentage (some 
</p>
<p>40  per cent) did so.32 Not all of those contacts may be harmful but it has been estimated 
</p>
<p>that between 13 and 19 per cent of children have experienced unwanted sexual 
</p>
<p>solicitation.33 However if countries become aware of the problem and adopt measures to 
</p>
<p>tackle grooming, such as awareness-raising and the establishment of specialist training 
</p>
<p>programmes, a reduction of harm can be achieved.34 
</p>
<p>40. It seems that girls are more likely to be at risk of grooming than boys.35 Most victims 
</p>
<p>of grooming tend to be post-pubescent, partly because groomers play on the fact that 
</p>
<p>children who are going through puberty are interested in sex. Group-localized grooming 
</p>
<p>can lead to trafficking in children by offenders within the locality of child victims. Such 
</p>
<p>trafficking is often facilitated through new technologies, particularly mobile telephones.36 
</p>
<p>41. Grooming is featured in the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (art. 23). A number of countries 
</p>
<p>have also developed specific legislation designed to tackle that behaviour,37 which can have 
</p>
<p>an important deterrent effect, especially by raising awareness that this type of behaviour is 
</p>
<p>explicitly criminalized. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Online streaming of child abuse 
</b></p>
<p>42. The growth of Internet speed has meant that live streaming &#8212; which can be broadly 
</p>
<p>equated to broadcasting over the Internet &#8212; becomes technically feasible. There have been 
</p>
<p>reported instances of people having a child in a room while a number of users log onto the 
</p>
<p>video feed to interact with those in the room and suggest ways that a child can be abused.38 
</p>
<p>The online streaming of child abuse is an emerging threat with the potential to involve large 
</p>
<p>numbers of offenders. For instance, in 2014, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection 
</p>
<p>Centre of the United Kingdom conducted three investigations into that type of abuse which 
</p>
<p>identified over 733 suspects.39 Those operations have shown that child victims are often in

<p>developing countries. Online child streaming appears to be a form of child sex tourism in 
</p>
<p>that it allows offenders to abuse children across national boundaries without the need to 
</p>
<p>travel. 
</p>
<p>43. Few international instruments specifically tackle that form of abuse. Classifying it as 
</p>
<p>child pornography does not fully recognize the nature of the harm because offenders are not 
</p>
<p>simply viewing abusive images; they are participating in their real-time abuse and therefore 
</p>
<p>facilitating it. The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against 
</p>
<p>Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse allows for the prosecution of those who aid or abet 
</p>
<p>the abuse of a child (art. 24), which constitutes a more comprehensive approach towards 
</p>
<p>tackling the online streaming of child abuse.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Comprehensive strategies to prevent and combat the sale and sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of children facilitated through new technologies 
</b></p>
<p>44. While it has been noted that there are numerous ways in which new technologies can 
</p>
<p>facilitate the commission of the crimes of sale and sexual exploitation of children and other 
</p>
<p>harms, there have been many instances of good practices in trying to combat that 
</p>
<p>exploitative behaviour. The Special Rapporteur advocates a holistic approach towards 
</p>
<p>effectively combating the sale and sexual exploitation of children facilitated through new 
</p>
<p>technologies. That involves promoting the design and implementation of comprehensive 
</p>
<p>child protection strategies which encompass adequate legislation, detection and reporting, 
</p>
<p>prosecution of offenders (including their treatment to avoid recidivism), rehabilitation and 
</p>
<p>reintegration of victims, prevention and protection programmes with the involvement and 
</p>
<p>empowerment of children, international cooperation and engagement of the business sector. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Adequate legislation 
</b></p>
<p>45. States need to adopt adequate national legislation to effectively combat the sale and 
</p>
<p>sexual exploitation of children which is committed or facilitated through new technologies. 
</p>
<p>States should criminalize those activities through the ratification and domestication of 
</p>
<p>relevant international instruments, in particular the Optional Protocol on the sale of 
</p>
<p>children, child prostitution and child pornography;40 the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
</p>
<p>Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing it; the International 
</p>
<p>Labour Organization Convention No. 182 (1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate 
</p>
<p>Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour; and the Convention on 
</p>
<p>Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. 
</p>
<p>46. At the regional level, some instruments, such as the Council of Europe Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse, offer 
</p>
<p>additional protection through the criminalization of activities not specifically covered by 
</p>
<p>international instruments. National laws should ensure the protection of children from new 
</p>
<p>threats and criminalize new forms facilitated by new technologies. In that context, States 
</p>
<p>should criminalize child pornography, including its visual and non-visual depiction, 
</p>
<p>possession, offering, facilitation and accessing. Unfortunately, there are still national and 
</p>
<p>regional gaps and differences in legislation which make it difficult to effectively combat, 
</p>
<p>including through transnational cooperation, the sale and sexual exploitation of children 
</p>
<p>online. Similarly, national laws should ensure that a person who either uploads or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 40 169 States are party to the Optional Protocol, 9 are signatories only, while 19 States have taken no 
</p>
<p>action.  </p>


<p>downloads child abuse material from another jurisdiction, or who makes it available to 
</p>
<p>those within a jurisdiction, can be prosecuted for an appropriate offence.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Detection and reporting 
</b></p>
<p>47. As noted above, owing to its criminal and clandestine nature, the sale and sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children facilitated through new technologies is difficult to quantify. 
</p>
<p>However, it is important that stakeholders identify opportunities to detect that type of 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children in order to assist and protect victims.  
</p>
<p><b> (a) Helplines 
</b></p>
<p>48. Helplines are invaluable in detecting and reporting abuse but also helping meet the 
</p>
<p>right of the child to be heard and express his or her concerns. Child Helpline International is 
</p>
<p>a global network of 179 child helplines in 143 countries covering all regions of the world. It 
</p>
<p>is contacted approximately 14 million times by children each year.
41
</p>
<p> Europe accounted for 
</p>
<p>most calls, which reflects knowledge of the helplines, the ability of children to easily access 
</p>
<p>technology and the readiness of society to discuss those issues publicly. The Childline 
</p>
<p>service developed by Childline India Foundation is another good example of child 
</p>
<p>helplines.42 Globally, most calls came from girls, which shows that girls are more likely to 
</p>
<p>be victims of exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Hotlines 
</b></p>
<p>49. Hotlines allow the reporting of exploitative practices, often starting the law 
</p>
<p>enforcement process. Two particular good examples are the INHOPE network and the 
</p>
<p>Virtual Global Taskforce. INHOPE is a network of 51 hotlines covering 45 countries, 
</p>
<p>principally in Europe and North America but it also includes hotlines in South America, 
</p>
<p>Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Its sister organization, the INHOPE Foundation, 
</p>
<p>provides assistance to countries to develop hotlines and comply with INHOPE standards. 
</p>
<p>Four hotlines have so far been established by the Foundation in Colombia, Kazakhstan, 
</p>
<p>Peru and Thailand.  
</p>
<p>50. The INHOPE network is dedicated to the eradication of child pornography. Each 
</p>
<p>hotline receives reports of child pornography being hosted on the Internet. The hotline 
</p>
<p>determines whether the pornography is hosted within the territory which it covers and, if so, 
</p>
<p>the case is passed to law enforcement and Internet companies for them to remove the 
</p>
<p>material from the web. If the case is not within the territory of the hotline, it is logged in the 
</p>
<p>INHOPE Report Management System. The report is analysed to determine the likely host 
</p>
<p>of the material and sent to the relevant authorities of the country concerned. 
</p>
<p>51. In 2013, INHOPE received over 1.2 million reports of illegal content and it 
</p>
<p>identified nearly 40,000 unique images hosted on the Internet.
43
</p>
<p> The INHOPE network 
</p>
<p>allows for fast results. In Europe, 98 per cent of reported content was passed to law 
</p>
<p>enforcement within one day of being reported, and 91 per cent of material was removed 
</p>
<p>from the Internet within three days.

<p>52. The Virtual Global Taskforce is an alliance of law enforcement agencies, non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and the private sector, which has developed a reporting 
</p>
<p>button.
45
</p>
<p> That button is common to all its members, and Internet platforms are encouraged 
</p>
<p>to include it. Upon the reception of a report, the location of the reported material is 
</p>
<p>identified and the case is referred to the relevant partner to follow up with investigation. If 
</p>
<p>the user of the material does come under the jurisdiction of a member of the Taskforce, the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) helps refer the information to the 
</p>
<p>national authority concerned. 
</p>
<p><b> (c) Image analysis 
</b></p>
<p>53. In recent years, considerable work has been undertaken on image analysis, in 
</p>
<p>particular on analysing child pornography collections to identify victims or perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>Law enforcement has stepped up efforts to engage in victim identification, as identification 
</p>
<p>allows children to be rescued from abusive situations. Several national police forces 
</p>
<p>developed image databases which amalgamated into a single international database 
</p>
<p>operated by INTERPOL. Known as the International Child Sexual Exploitation image 
</p>
<p>database, police in over 40 countries can access it and upload images to it. By cross-
</p>
<p>referencing, it can identify duplicates and provide comparable images. INTERPOL has also 
</p>
<p>established the Victim Identification Laboratory, a mobile platform that allows images to be 
</p>
<p>displayed at conferences to identify children or information that can lead to their 
</p>
<p>identification. The success of victim identification is difficult to quantify. INTERPOL has 
</p>
<p>identified in excess of 3,000 victims, which is believed to be a small fraction of the total 
</p>
<p>number of victims. 
</p>
<p>54. Similar systems have also begun to be used for identification of offenders. 
</p>
<p>Identification can include computer analysis to remove masking placed on the images used 
</p>
<p>to hide an identity.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Investigation and prosecution of offenders 
</b></p>
<p>55. As noted above, much of the exploitative behaviour identified in the present report 
</p>
<p>should be criminalized through adequate national legislation in order to combat impunity. 
</p>
<p>While many countries have done so, it is also important that specialist police force units are 
</p>
<p>created to investigate those offences and that they work closely with specialist agencies that 
</p>
<p>are specifically trained to work with child victims of exploitation. Investigations of those 
</p>
<p>offences involve dealing with particularly vulnerable children and therefore investigators 
</p>
<p>need specialized training to deal with them in a child-sensitive manner. In addition, those 
</p>
<p>investigations require highly technical techniques, such as forensic computer analysis, to 
</p>
<p>gather the appropriate electronic evidence. Only by building up a framework of dedicated 
</p>
<p>officers can those offences be properly tackled. INTERPOL and the Virtual Global 
</p>
<p>Taskforce undertake specialist global training courses to ensure that national officers have 
</p>
<p>the technical abilities to investigate those crimes and identify child victims.
46
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>56. Countries must also take appropriate steps to tackle criminal behaviour that 
</p>
<p>transcends borders thanks to the Internet. Article 4 of the Optional Protocol on the sale of 
</p>
<p>children, child prostitution and child pornography requires States to consider adopting the 
</p>
<p>principle of extraterritoriality to combat the sale and sexual exploitation of children. That is 
</p>
<p>particularly important to combating criminal activities such as the trade in organs and child 
</p>
<p>sex tourism, where the offender is likely to travel to another country for a relatively short 
</p>

<p>time. As the abuse may not be detected until the offender has returned to his country of 
</p>
<p>origin, it is essential that countries have the capability to prosecute them. However, the 
</p>
<p>Internet poses new challenges to territoriality. An offender can be in one country watching 
</p>
<p>the live streaming of a child who is being abused in another country<i>. </i>National laws should 
</p>
<p>prohibit those who watch the abuse of children wherever in the world it occurs.  
</p>
<p>57. In addition, to ensure the prosecution of offenders, should there be statute of 
</p>
<p>limitations in respect of those offences, they should be adjusted to the particular nature of 
</p>
<p>the crime, since it can take many years before victims are willing or able to disclose the 
</p>
<p>abuse.
47
</p>
<p> Similarly, part of any appropriate criminalization policy must be the imposition of 
</p>
<p>appropriate penalties. While the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution 
</p>
<p>and child pornography does not mandate minimum penalties, other instruments have done 
</p>
<p>so.48 Lastly, there must be political will and a proactive strategy to prosecute those offences, 
</p>
<p>since few countries with adequate legislation report effective prosecutions.49  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Reparation and rehabilitation of victims 
</b></p>
<p>58. Article 8 of the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography requires the rights and interests of child victims to be secured throughout the 
</p>
<p>legal process. The criminal prosecution of a perpetrator should not adversely affect the 
</p>
<p>health and recovery of the child victim. The Optional Protocol requires special measures to 
</p>
<p>be adopted to assist child victims in testifying and to protect their privacy. Article 14 of the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation 
</p>
<p>and Sexual Abuse provides additional procedural rights to victims, such as short and long-
</p>
<p>term physical and psychosocial recovery. Recovery and non-re-victimization of the child 
</p>
<p>should be given due consideration when deciding whether and when to prosecute an 
</p>
<p>offender. In the best interest of the child, that may entail allowing the victim a period of 
</p>
<p>recovery to receive the necessary support, as well as assistance in cases where the child 
</p>
<p>victims will interact with the justice system, which assistance should be child-sensitive and 
</p>
<p>respect the rights of children. 
</p>
<p>59. While the majority of international law is focused on criminalization of the activities 
</p>
<p>and the punishment of offenders, there should also be recognition of the need to provide 
</p>
<p>redress to child victims and to compensate them for the harm suffered. Compensation and 
</p>
<p>restitution measures can ensure that child victims have the means to seek rehabilitation, 
</p>
<p>recovery and reintegration. The ability to bring a civil action should be provided regardless 
</p>
<p>of the economic status of the victim, including through the provision of legal aid or through 
</p>
<p>the establishment of a State-operated compensation system. For instance, certain pieces of 
</p>
<p>legislation recognize that those who download child pornography are contributing to the 
</p>
<p>harm suffered by the victim and are thus liable for reparation to him or her.50 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Prevention and protection programmes 
</b></p>
<p>60. Adequate legislation, detection and reporting, and effective investigations and 
</p>
<p>prosecution can only be a partial solution without prevention and protection programmes 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 47 See art. 33 of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual 
</p>
<p>Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. 
</p>
<p> 48 See ibid., art. 27. 
</p>
<p> 49 UNODC, <i>Global Report</i>, p. 54.  
</p>
<p> 50 In the United States, the requirement that those who download child pornography should be obliged 
</p>
<p>to compensate the child has been ruled constitutional provided that the proximity of damage can be 
</p>
<p>shown (see 1977 Mandatory Restitution,18 USC &#167; 2259). </p>


<p>aimed at empowering children to respond to exploitative situations and to report abuse to 
</p>
<p>the appropriate authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> (a) Safer Internet Day 
</b></p>
<p>61. Safer Internet Day is a day of the year when all countries across Europe concentrate 
</p>
<p>on raising awareness about online safety. It is organized by the Safer Internet Programme 
</p>
<p>and, in particular, Insafe, a network of safer Internet centres throughout Europe. Safer 
</p>
<p>Internet Day also offers an opportunity for safer Internet centres to release good practice 
</p>
<p>guides and statistics. Schools normally get involved in the awareness-raising activity to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the message gets out among different stakeholders, including children, parents 
</p>
<p>and teachers.  
</p>
<p>62. The success of Safer Internet Day has led to it being replicated in other parts of the 
</p>
<p>world. The Asia Internet Coalition has begun to hold a safer Internet day. That type of 
</p>
<p>cross-regional awareness-raising initiative should be further encouraged. Moreover, an 
</p>
<p>international safer Internet day could be badged as a day of action against the abuse and 
</p>
<p>exploitation of children through new technologies, to raise awareness and call for the 
</p>
<p>adoption of necessary measures to ensure a safe Internet for children. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Empowering children 
</b></p>
<p>63. Various organizations have begun to develop empowerment programmes for 
</p>
<p>children. A good example is the New Jersey Child Assault Prevention organization,
51
</p>
<p> which 
</p>
<p>developed their initial programmes to empower children to be protected against (offline) 
</p>
<p>child sexual exploitation into an empowerment programme for online abuse. The 
</p>
<p>programme is a series of tailored training activity workshops that seek to help children 
</p>
<p>understand how to keep safe online, including by providing case studies and role play. Safe 
</p>
<p>Internet usage is at the heart of many programmes of non-governmental organizations, most 
</p>
<p>notably ECPAT International52 and RedNATIC.53 There is recognition that there must be a 
</p>
<p>multi-faceted approach. Key professionals such as the police, social workers, teachers and 
</p>
<p>health-care workers must be aware of the types of exploitation that occur and how to detect 
</p>
<p>them and assist child victims. Parents also need to be supported and encouraged to discuss 
</p>
<p>such issues with their children. More importantly, resources specifically for children allow 
</p>
<p>them to understand the behaviour, and identify and report when perpetrators are trying to 
</p>
<p>abuse or exploit them. 
</p>
<p>64. A good example of this approach is the 2014 ECPAT International guide &#8220;Stay Safe 
</p>
<p>from Online Sexual Exploitation&#8221;, specifically aimed at children and young persons and 
</p>
<p>written in child-friendly language. Crucially, it also presents case studies from across the 
</p>
<p>world, with a series of questions to children to help them to work out the solutions. 
</p>
<p>65. The most successful empowerment programmes work on the regional and 
</p>
<p>community levels, as they ensure that people in neighbouring countries and locations are 
</p>
<p>able to identify the same behaviour. RedNATIC is a grouping of charities from 10 Latin 
</p>
<p>American countries dedicated to offering resources to children to safeguard them from 
</p>
<p>abuse and exploitation. Such regional groupings are better placed to work with schools and 
</p>
<p>communities to ensure the message gets through at the local level and that the message is 
</p>
<p>seen by children.  
</p>

<p>66. Technology offers new opportunities to empower children. They are advanced users 
</p>
<p>of the Internet and they actively participate in social media. Initiatives must be adopted 
</p>
<p>which harness the energy that accompanies the use of social media networks by children 
</p>
<p>and encourages them to discuss those issues online and support each other in reporting 
</p>
<p>exploitative behaviour to the authorities. Young persons supporting other young persons 
</p>
<p>can only be a positive experience, especially when some children believe that &#8220;adults don&#8217;t 
</p>
<p>get technology&#8221; and therefore may be sceptical about messages produced by adults.  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Filtering 
</b></p>
<p>67. Filtering technologies are another example of the opportunities offered by the 
</p>
<p>Internet to combat child sexual abuse and exploitation. Their purpose is to prevent child 
</p>
<p>abuse content from being accessed. A popular method is the use of the INTERPOL &#8220;worst-
</p>
<p>of&#8221; list, a directory of known sites that host child sexual abuse content.54 The Internet 
</p>
<p>Watch Foundation uses the &#8220;gold-standard&#8221; approach55 and operates a list that is updated 
</p>
<p>twice daily.56 Many companies across the globe use the list. 
</p>
<p>68. Filtering to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation does not constitute 
</p>
<p>censorship or a violation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. As noted by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression, child protection concerns have been used as a cover for inappropriate or 
</p>
<p>disproportionate blocking and filtering.57 However, the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression can be restricted on the basis of the right of children to be protected from harm. 
</p>
<p>Children who are the subject of child pornography are harmed in its production, 
</p>
<p>distribution, download and visualization. It is legitimate therefore to restrict access to those 
</p>
<p>images, and States must prohibit them as a criminal act.
58
</p>
<p> States should establish clear rules 
</p>
<p>governing filtering, including judicial scrutiny, to prevent filtering and blocking systems 
</p>
<p>being used to include material other than child pornography.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>69. Article 10 of the Optional Protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and 
</p>
<p>child pornography requires States to strengthen cooperation by multilateral, regional and 
</p>
<p>bilateral arrangements. Article 6 further requires States to cooperate in the investigation, 
</p>
<p>extradition or criminal proceedings brought in respect of the abuse or exploitation of 
</p>
<p>children. The issue of mutual legal assistance is crucial in combating child exploitation. 
</p>
<p>Extraterritorial jurisdiction for those crimes could have a deterrent effect, but requires 
</p>
<p>effective international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>70. As noted above, the role of INTERPOL in the field of combating child exploitation 
</p>
<p>has become prominent. The European Police Office (Europol) also has established 
</p>
<p>expertise in that field, including through the provision of training and advice. North 
</p>
<p>American law enforcement &#8212; most notably the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United 
</p>
<p>States Postal Inspection Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police &#8212; have also 
</p>

<p>adopted the approach of facilitating the investigation of those crimes through the provision 
</p>
<p>of mutual legal assistance and training. 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Virtual Global Taskforce 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Virtual Global Taskforce is a key example of international cooperation. It 
</p>
<p>consists of 12 law enforcement partners
59
</p>
<p> and a number of private sector partners, including 
</p>
<p>Blackberry, Microsoft and PayPal, and a variety of child protection agencies. The 
</p>
<p>Taskforce helps to share intelligence and coordinate law enforcement, which has resulted in 
</p>
<p>successful investigations. For instance, &#8220;Operation Endeavour&#8221; led to the arrest of 
</p>
<p>29 persons in January 2014 for the live streaming of child sexual abuse committed in the 
</p>
<p>Philippines on demand. Another good initiative is &#8220;Operation Pin&#8221;, which has been 
</p>
<p>successful in seeking to identify those who try to access child pornography. Pin is a site that 
</p>
<p>purports to offer child pornography, but when a person seeks access to the material, his or 
</p>
<p>her communication details are transmitted to a local law enforcement agency. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Global Alliance 
</b></p>
<p>72. A recent important initiative is the creation in 2012 of the Global Alliance against 
</p>
<p>Child Sexual Abuse Online, an alliance of 52 countries from across the world60 with the 
</p>
<p>objective of tackling online abuse through inter alia enhancing efforts to identify victims, 
</p>
<p>investigate child sexual abuse online, prosecute offenders, increase awareness about the 
</p>
<p>risks and reduce the availability of child pornography online.
61
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>73. The alliance marks a significant step for countries to work closely together, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the investigation and prosecution of offenders and the criminal networks. 
</p>
<p>The alliance could play a useful role in assisting other States who are trying to combat 
</p>
<p>online child sexual exploitation, through specialized training and the development of 
</p>
<p>investigative processes. It is important that the alliance grows to encompass members in all 
</p>
<p>geographic areas.  
</p>
<p>74. In any case, there appears to be further room for international cooperation among 
</p>
<p>governments in that regard, for instance, through the establishment of a permanent global 
</p>
<p>task force to combat sexual exploitation of children, including online. The task force would 
</p>
<p>be in charge of conducting peer review of policies, legislation and practices (which would 
</p>
<p>allow good practices and gaps to be identified), and mentoring other countries developing 
</p>
<p>legislation, policy and strategies to combat online sexual exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Corporate social responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>75. Initiatives seeking to strengthen corporate social responsibility have developed 
</p>
<p>considerably, building concurrently on the private sector&#8217;s voluntary efforts to take action. 
</p>
<p>Industry has a long tradition of working with key child protection partners.62 Those partners 
</p>
<p>make considerable financial contributions to combating child exploitation and provide 
</p>
<p>technical expertise to supplement law enforcement. In coming years, efforts should focus 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 59 Europol, INTERPOL and law enforcement agencies from Australia, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, 
</p>
<p>New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>and the United States. 
</p>
<p> 60 The majority of the countries are European or North American: Asia is represented by Cambodia, 
</p>
<p>the Philippines and Thailand, and Africa is represented by Ghana and Nigeria.

<p>on the consolidation of successful initiatives and good practices which are compliant with 
</p>
<p>international standards, including the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(contained in A/HRC/17/31, annex). 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Financial Coalition against Child Pornography 
</b></p>
<p>76. Credit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard have long adopted the approach 
</p>
<p>of not profiting from child sexual exploitation, which reflects a degree of social 
</p>
<p>responsibility. They have developed technology to detect transactions that are related to 
</p>
<p>child sexual abuse and exploitation, to either block them or alert the authorities.  
</p>
<p>77. Financial institutions have adopted more coordinated approaches. In 2006, the 
</p>
<p>Financial Coalition against Child Pornography was established in the United States, which 
</p>
<p>is a coalition of the major banks and financial clearing houses. They were brought together 
</p>
<p>by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the International Centre for 
</p>
<p>Missing and Exploited Children with a shared commitment to fight child pornography by 
</p>
<p>blocking the commercial element. It currently covers 90 per cent of the United States 
</p>
<p>financial industry.
63
</p>
<p> Since its inception there has been a 50 per cent reduction in 
</p>
<p>commercial websites reported to the National Center,
64
</p>
<p> demonstrating significant impact. 
</p>
<p>78. The success of the Financial Coalition led to Europe creating its own financial 
</p>
<p>coalition. The European Financial Coalition against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of 
</p>
<p>Children Online was established in 2009 and consists of some of the major online payment 
</p>
<p>providers but with fewer banks. Other regions have also developed their own versions, the 
</p>
<p>latest being the Asia Pacific Financial Coalition. Each region should establish a coalition to 
</p>
<p>make it increasingly difficult for people to exploit children for financial benefit. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Guidelines for industry 
</b></p>
<p>79. The guidelines for industry on child online protection created by the International 
</p>
<p>Telecommunication Union and UNICEF
65
</p>
<p> assist industry in understanding how to act in a 
</p>
<p>corporately responsible way. They develop five key areas for protecting and promoting 
</p>
<p>human rights: (a) integrating child rights considerations into all corporate policies and 
</p>
<p>management processes; (b) developing standard processes to handle child sexual abuse 
</p>
<p>material; (c) creating a safer and age-appropriate online environment; (d) educating 
</p>
<p>children, parents and teachers about children&#8217;s safety and their responsible use of 
</p>
<p>information and communication technologies; and (e) promoting digital technology as a 
</p>
<p>mode for increasing civic engagement. The guidelines are important in that they recognize 
</p>
<p>the power that industry has over the consumer, both adult and child. The Internet industry is 
</p>
<p>uniquely placed to get messages across to children and parents, but also to act as a conduit 
</p>
<p>for reporting suspicions and blocking inappropriate material. 
</p>
<p>80. Industry has the potential to reinforce key Internet safety messages but also to 
</p>
<p>develop new methods of keeping children safe. Good examples of this include Netclean,
66
</p>
<p> a 
</p>
<p>Swedish company that has developed new ways of filtering and blocking harmful content, 
</p>
<p>including within offices and hotels.
67
</p>
<p> Those means could be used not only to prevent the 
</p>
<p>downloading of child pornography but also to detect those who are seeking to solicit child 
</p>

<p>victims of prostitution within tourist areas. Netclean has also developed sophisticated 
</p>
<p>forensic tools for police to identify abusive behaviour and those who perpetrate them. 
</p>
<p>81. Initiatives aimed at enhancing engagement with industry in its wider form, including 
</p>
<p>not only Internet service providers and Internet content providers, but also application 
</p>
<p>developers, should be encouraged. As mobile devices become increasingly popular the 
</p>
<p>development of applications offer real opportunities but also threats. Applications can be 
</p>
<p>used to facilitate the reporting of abuse, the understanding of exploitation and awareness-
</p>
<p>raising. However, applications can also pose harms and allow, for example, the swapping of 
</p>
<p>illegal contacts and content. Initiatives must be put in place to involve not only Internet 
</p>
<p>providers, but most importantly, application developers and hosts, to ensure that they do not 
</p>
<p>produce or distribute applications that facilitate the exploitation of children.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>In the present report, the new Special Rapporteur has endeavoured to provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>an outline of the strategic directions for her three-year tenure.</b> <b>She will ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>continuity of the work of her predecessors, and will explore new directions. She will 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue to adopt a consultative, participatory, child-centred and holistic approach in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the implementation of her mandate, and will strive to ensure coordination and 
</b></p>
<p><b>complementarity with relevant special procedures mandates and United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and bodies.</b>  
</p>
<p>83. <b>While</b> <b>2015 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate, its continuous renewal underscores the need for the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community to step up efforts to combat the increasing phenomena of sexual abuse and 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of children. Stronger support to the mandate will be essential to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate follow-up and effective implementation of the mandate in the coming 
</b></p>
<p><b>years.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Children are among those who are most familiar with information and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communication technologies. While new technologies offer a myriad of opportunities 
</b></p>
<p><b>for children, they also present new risks and threats. Criminal behaviour facilitated 
</b></p>
<p><b>by new technologies includes online child abuse material and online sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of children. Moreover, information and communication technologies 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitate new forms of criminal behaviour, such as the live streaming of child abuse 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the online solicitation of children.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Whilst recognizing that considerable progress has been made in recent years, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Special Rapporteur advocates a holistic approach towards combating effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>the sale and sexual exploitation of children facilitated through new technologies. That 
</b></p>
<p><b>involves promoting the design and implementation of comprehensive child protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies which encompass adequate legislation, detection and reporting, prosecution 
</b></p>
<p><b>of offenders, rehabilitation and reintegration of victims, prevention and protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes with the participation of children, active involvement of the business 
</b></p>
<p><b>sector and effective international cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>To that end, the Special Rapporteur recommends the actions listed below. </b></p>


<p><b> 1. At the national level  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites all States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ratify all relevant regional and international instruments, and establish 
</b></p>
<p><b>clear and comprehensive legal frameworks which take account of technological 
</b></p>
<p><b>advancements, in particular, by adopting laws that prohibit all forms of sale and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual exploitation of children online, and criminalize accessing child pornography, 
</b></p>
<p><b>making child pornography available, grooming, the viewing of online streaming of 
</b></p>
<p><b>child abuse, the advertising of the sale of children and the facilitation of child 
</b></p>
<p><b>prostitution, including the creation or maintaining of websites which prostitute the 
</b></p>
<p><b>child;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that national legislation does not criminalize child victims of 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual abuse and exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Support the creation and maintenance of helplines and hotlines to report 
</b></p>
<p><b>child sexual abuse and exploitation;

<p><b> 2. At the international level  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the international community to establish a

</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Establishing a comprehensive and global legal framework preventing, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibiting and protecting children from sale and sexual exploitation online;

<p><b>and criminal networks responsible for the sale and sexual exploitation of children; </b></p>


<p><b>(c) Supporting alliances such as the Virtual Global Taskforce and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Online for the effective cooperation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation and prosecution of criminal networks and perpetrators; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Establishing a global permanent task force to harmonize practices and 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures, share expertise and scale up good practices, and provide assistance to

<p><b>States for the development of national legislation, policies and strategies to effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>combat online child sexual exploitation; 
</b></p>

<p><b> 3. Regarding corporate social responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of enhancing corporate 
</b></p>
<p><b>social responsibility involving Internet service and content providers,

<p><b>safety online. The Special Rapporteur encourages the business sector to develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>applications for mobile devices which allow children to report cases of online sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuse and exploitation, and to ensure that applications do not facilitate the sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of children.
