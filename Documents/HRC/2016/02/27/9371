<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>The Working Group wishes to thank the Chilean Government for its invitation, which 
enabled the Working Group to visit Chile from 9 to 13 July 2007, as well as for the level of 
cooperation received and the constructive dialogue maintained during the consultations. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group commends the actions taken by the Chilean State with a view to 
curtailing the phenomenon of the recruitment of former Chilean military and police personnel to 
work in Iraq. Such actions include: the preliminary draft of a bill submitted to the Defence 
Commission of the Chamber of Deputies concerning Chile&#8217;s accession to the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries; the 
establishment of an inter-agency working party, charged with examining legislative measures 
needed at the domestic level to develop up-to-date and efficient system of rules for the 
criminalization, deterrence and punishment of new practices related to mercenarism; efforts to 
replace the current law concerning private guards with a private security act; and the preparation 
of preliminary drafts of bills aimed at reforming the military career. The Working Group also 
noted that there was a broad system of laws, regulations and oversight of private security 
companies in Chile. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group is concerned at the recruitment, training and contracting of Chileans 
to work abroad with private security companies in Iraq - a phenomenon that emerged in 2003. A 
review of the information reveals the existence of contractual irregularities and poor working 
conditions, including overcrowding, excessively long working hours, non-payment or partial 
payment of wages, degrading treatment and isolation, and neglect of basic needs, such as health. 
Although hired as &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; or &#8220;security guards&#8221;, these persons were provided 
military training in the United States of America, Jordan or Iraq and ultimately carried out 
military functions. The Working Group expresses its concern at the potential continuation of 
such recruitment. The two companies that recruited hundreds of Chileans to work with American 
companies in Iraq operated out of Chile but were headquartered in Uruguay and Panama. The 
Working Group is also concerned at information it has received alleging abuses of the human 
rights of indigenous communities by employees of private security firms contracted by forestry 
companies. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group recommends that, as soon as possible, the inter-agency working party 
should complete the study on the domestic criminalization of and enactment of legislation 
concerning activities related to mercenarism; ensure Chile&#8217;s accession to the Convention; as 
soon as possible, complete investigations by the competent authorities - particularly in the 
military courts - into the companies of Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro, who recruited Chilean nationals to 
go to Iraq for the companies Blackwater and Triple Canopy of the United States; take urgent 
steps to protect the rights of Chileans currently in Iraq; establish a body at the highest executive 
level - ministry or vice-ministry - endowed with authority and charged with monitoring both 
private security companies and new forms of mercenarism; ensure the universal right of all 
people to security as a public good through the adoption of a new private security act; ensure that </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.4 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>the new act contains measures aimed at providing suitable training for officials responsible for 
private security that includes instruction in international human rights standards and the concept 
of equity; establish a mechanism competent to monitor the activities of private security 
companies and to which complaints may be submitted; as soon as possible, establish a national 
human rights institution that conforms to the Paris Principles; and consider holding a 
multidisciplinary seminar to disseminate the conclusions of the inter-agency working party and 
the report on Chile by the United Nations Working Group on mercenaries, with a view to 
incorporating the recommendations of the seminar into public policy. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Working Group, represented by its 
Chairperson-Rapporteur, Mr. Jos&#233; Lu&#237;s G&#243;mez del Prado, and one of its members, 
Ms. Amada Benavides P&#233;rez, visited Chile from 9 to 13 July 2007. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to obtain information that would contribute to fulfilling the 
Working Group&#8217;s mandate to study and identify emerging issues, indications and trends with 
regard to mercenaries, mercenary-related activities and the functioning of private military and 
security companies and their impact on human rights.<b>1</b> The visit to Chile forms part of a regional 
assessment undertaken by the Working Group on the tendency towards the privatization of 
security in Latin America, which includes a phenomenon observed in recent years consisting of 
the contracting of nationals from the countries in the region by private military and security 
companies.<b>2</b> These companies are subsidiaries of, or have themselves been subcontracted by 
foreign-based companies that operate in armed conflict or post-conflict situations, such as those 
in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
</p>
<p>3. The following topics were addressed: 
</p>
<p> (a) The recruitment and military training of Chileans by private security companies with 
the aim of providing security services in Iraq; 
</p>
<p> (b) Private security in Chile; 
</p>
<p> (c) The involvement in social conflicts of private security companies that provide 
protection services to forestry companies; and  
</p>
<p> (d) Chile&#8217;s accession to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group held meetings with legislative, executive and judicial authorities and 
with other State bodies. It had meetings with: ministers, vice-ministers, senior and State officials 
from the Office of the Minister and Secretary-General of the Presidency, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Ministry of National Defence, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of 
Labour and Social Insurance; the Human Rights, Nationality and Citizenship Commission of the 
Senate and the chairperson of the National Defence Commission of the Senate; the Human 
Rights Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, the president of the Supreme Court, the 
public prosecutor, the commander-in-chief of the army, the chief of the defence staff, the

<p><b>1
</b>  The Working Group refers to private military and private security companies as enterprises 
</p>
<p>that provide all types of security assistance, training, procurement and consulting services, 
ranging from unarmed logistical support to armed guards participating in defensive or offensive 
military operations.  
<b>2
</b>  The Working Group has requested invitations from Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and

<p>Peru (E/CN.4/2006/11/Add.1, para. 23). </p>

</p>
<p>assessor-general of the army, the assessor of the Second Military Court of Santiago and the 
prosecutor of the Fifth Military Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Santiago, the director-general of the 
carabineros and the director-general of the criminal investigation police. The Working Group 
delegation also had the opportunity to meet with various members of Chilean civil society, 
including representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics, private 
security companies, individuals and the media, as well as representatives of the United Nations 
system in Chile. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>5. The mandate of the Working Group includes monitoring and studying the activities of 
private military and security companies and their impact on all human beings.<b>3</b> With the 
privatization of security functions that have traditionally been carried out by the army or the 
police, the boundaries between public and private are becoming blurred, giving rise to a 
dangerous confusion - or a &#8220;grey area&#8221; - between State public services and those provided by 
private commercial entities. As indicated in the Working Group&#8217;s reports,<b>4</b> in conformity with 
international law<b>5</b> and domestic law, States bear the primary responsibility for maintaining public 
security and law and order.  
</p>
<p>6. The trend toward the privatization of security and the use of force is cause for concern, as 
is the violation of human rights with impunity in connection with the involvement of private 
military and security companies in armed conflict or post-conflict situations, in ensuring national 
security or in other situations. This phenomenon is often associated with the establishment by 
transnational companies of satellite subsidiaries that have legal status in one country, provide 
services in another and hire personnel in a third country.  
</p>
<p>7. Another new practice engaged in by some of these companies or their employees involves 
committing offences against personal liberty, by coercing, harassing or threatening members of 
human rights organizations - particularly defenders of economic, social, cultural and 
environmental rights and members of indigenous communities - in connection with social 
protests. 
</p>
<p>8. It is essential to establish or strengthen oversight and control at the national level by 
creating systems for registering and licensing these types of companies and their employees. 
Such rules should include minimum requirements for transparency and accountability of firms, 
screening and vetting of personnel, and establishing a monitoring system that includes 
parliamentary oversight.

</p>
<p><b>II. POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRATEGY AND 
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>9. Chile is a party to seven of the principal human rights treaties. It has accepted individual 
complaints mechanisms under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>10. The 1980 Constitution of the Republic of Chile stipulates that international treaties are an 
integral part of national legislation and that rights and freedoms must be interpreted in 
conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all international human rights 
treaties ratified by Chile. Article 5 of the Constitution states that &#8220;the exercise of sovereignty 
recognizes as a limitation the respect for the basic rights inherent in human nature. It is the duty 
of the organs of the State to respect and promote such rights, which are guaranteed by this 
Constitution and by the international treaties ratified by Chile and currently in force. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National level 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Working Group emphasizes that the State is responsible for the safety of all 
individuals within its jurisdiction, and that when it transfers this right to private companies, it 
must monitor and control both parent companies and their subsidiaries. 
</p>
<p>12. The Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs informed the Working Group that his Ministry had 
set up and currently presided over an inter-agency working party composed of the various 
ministries and institutions responsible for overseeing activities related to security and defence. Its 
purpose is to identify measures that must be incorporated into domestic legislation in order to 
develop an up-to-date and efficient system of rules for the criminalization, deterrence and 
punishment of new practices related to mercenarism. During the meeting held by the Working 
Group with the inter-agency working party, reference was made to the preliminary draft of a bill 
submitted to the Defence Commission of the Chamber of Deputies concerning Chile&#8217;s accession 
to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries. Taking a multidisciplinary approach and with input from the various ministries that 
comprise it, the working party examines and analyses the ways in which the Convention can 
impact domestic law. Also discussed at the meeting were lacunae noted in the Convention and 
the need to adapt Chile&#8217;s domestic law and to develop up-to-date and efficient system of rules 
with a view to curtailing activities related to mercenarism. Without excluding the possible 
accession of Chile to the Convention in the medium term, Chile has given priority to drafting 
domestic legislation aimed at combating the new forms of the phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>13. In this connection, at the meeting held by the Working Group with the chief of the defence 
staff, the latter reported that, in an attempt to discourage the recruitment of military personnel, 
many of whom retire before the age of 45 and see the opportunities proposed by private security 
companies to work in conflict or post-conflict areas as incentives to remain active and 
supplement their pensions, efforts were under way to consider lengthening the military career </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.4 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>and offering servicemen better rewards by providing them sufficient pensions to ensure a decent 
retirement.<b>6</b> Emphasis was placed on the fact that the Chilean armed forces have no authority 
over the activities of military retirees, given the total lack of jurisdiction in this regard. Several 
preliminary drafts aimed at reforming the military career had already been prepared with a view 
to enhancing the utilization of military human resources. In addition, the Chilean authorities 
noted that the current law concerning private guards would be replaced by a private security act. 
</p>
<p>14. The office of the director-general of the carabineros informed the Working Group that, 
pursuant to Decree Law No. 3607, it is responsible for the regulation, control and supervision of 
private security services. The deputy director of the carabineros and the chief of the private 
security division of the carabineros provided information on the establishments that make up the 
private security system overseen by division OS.10 of the office of the director-general of the 
carabineros. The system currently comprises 21 types of establishments. The private security 
sector has grown rapidly over the past several years (66,563 establishments in 2002; 
116,502 in 2007). According to the Decree Law No. 3607 concerning private guards, guards who 
can and must carry weapons in performing their work are referred to as <i>vigilantes</i> (armed 
guards), while those who do not carry weapons while on duty are designated as <i>guardias de 
seguridad</i> (security guards). The number of private armed guards has remained stable, and has 
even declined, over the past five years (6,864 in 2002; 6,540 in 2007). Conversely, the number of 
security guards has almost doubled, increasing from 48,882 in 2002 to 92,864 in 2007. The 
system recognizes two types of training establishments: training enterprises (210 in 2007 - 
virtually the same number as in 2002) and training instructors (1,143 in 2007 - a figure that has 
nearly doubled in five years). Once they have obtained authorization from the respective 
carabineros prefecture, training enterprises and training instructors can provide initial and 
refresher training to private <i>vigilantes</i> (the only ones authorized to use firearms) and <i>guardias de 
seguridad</i> (who are not authorized to use weapons). Decree Law No. 3607 stipulates that 
strategic enterprises, valuables transport companies, government services, and banking and 
financial institutions may hire private armed guards directly. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES IN CHILE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Recruitment and military training of Chileans  
by private security companies with the aim  
of providing security services in Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>15. Towards the end of 2003, Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro&#8217;s company Red T&#225;ctica Inc. began 
recruiting former Chilean military and police personnel to work as &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; in 
Iraq for the American private military company Blackwater. Red T&#225;ctica Inc., which was 
established in 2001 in the United States by Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro Ovalle with other partners, was 
apparently responsible for setting up contacts between Latin American Governments and 
American weapons manufacturers. In Chile, Pizarro established a subsidiary known as 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Over the last few years, Chilean military personnel have reportedly lost not only political 
</p>
<p>power but also economic power. A senior executive in a private enterprise is said to earn easily 
three times more than a senior officer in the army. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.4 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>Grupo T&#225;ctico Chile. However, for the purposes of transactions with Blackwater and to avoid 
problems with the Chilean authorities, Pizarro, who conducted his business from Santiago, set up 
a company called Neskowin that was domiciled in Montevideo and whose president and chief 
executive officer was none other than Pizarro himself. Although former Chilean<b>7</b> military and 
police personnel were recruited to work for Blackwater in Iraq, the contracts they signed to work 
as &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; or &#8220;security guards&#8221; were subject to Uruguayan law. Moreover, the 
hiring location was not Santiago, Chile, but rather North Carolina (United States of America), 
where Blackwater has its headquarters. The first 150 Chileans recruited and trained by 
Blackwater at its base in Moyock, North Carolina, departed for Iraq in February 2004 in two 
separate groups of 77 each, bound for the destinations of Diwaniyah, Al-Hillah, Karbala and 
Basra. Prior to this, Pizarro had already demonstrated the military preparedness of the Chileans 
he had selected to Blackwater agents, who had travelled expressly from the United States to 
Chile, and who had attended several testing sessions in Chile referred to as &#8220;castings&#8221;. 
Convinced of the professionalism of the Chileans, Blackwater and Pizarro obtained one-year 
visas from the Embassy of the United States of America in Chile for the first two groups of 
Chileans, which included multiple entries in order for them to &#8220;attend meetings at Blackwater in 
Moyock, North Carolina&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. Without severing ties with Blackwater, in late 2004, Pizarro began working simultaneously 
with Triple Canopy, another American private military company. He recruited Chileans to work 
for Triple Canopy in Iraq or Afghanistan as &#8220;private guards&#8221; under the name of a different 
company than the one he used to contract for Blackwater - a company known as Global Guards 
Corporation, which he represented and which was domiciled in Panama and subject to the laws 
of that country. At that time, both the contracting and training of the Chileans selected by 
Pizarro were being conducted in Amman. There were differences in salaries as well: Blackwater 
was paying approximately US$ 3,000 a month, whereas Triple Canopy paid only about 
US$ 1,000 a month. 
</p>
<p>17. Through Neskowin in Uruguay and Global Guards in Panama, Pizarro was providing 
Blackwater and Triple Canopy, respectively, with &#8220;independent private security agents&#8221; to go 
work as &#8220;private security guards or armed guards&#8221; in Iraq, Jordan, Afghanistan and/or Kuwait - 
although they could conceivably be sent to any other location where those companies had 
operations. The Blackwater contracts indicate that they were signed in Moyock, North Carolina 
(United States of America) and the Triple Canopy contracts, in Amman (Jordan). Further down 
in the contracts, other clauses stipulate that: (a) the parties agree to resolve all differences, 
disagreements and disputes arising from the contract through the Arbitral Tribunal of Uruguay 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  According to information received by the Working Group, thousands of Chileans replied to 
</p>
<p>the ads published in the Chilean press (the first of which was reportedly published in 
<i>El Mercurio</i> on 12 December 2003) and appeared in person at Pizarro&#8217;s offices. As a result, he 
was required to hire several job placement agencies to handle the selection process. Despite this, 
he is alleged to have previously already begun contacting active military personnel through 
former military colleagues, given that he had been a captain in the Chilean army, and through the 
alleged contacts of his sales director, Herman Brady Machiavello, son of the former minister of 
defence under General Pinochet.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.4 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>(for Neskowin) and the Arbitral Tribunal of Panama (for Global Guards); and (b) the contract is 
subject to the laws of Uruguay (for Neskowin) and Panama (for Global Guards). By signing 
these contracts, Chileans were not only renouncing some of their most fundamental rights - such 
as the right to be subject to their country&#8217;s laws, given that its courts did not have jurisdiction - 
but were also, in effect, incapacitating themselves in the event they had to file a claim against the 
company. 
</p>
<p>18. In another of the clauses common to the two companies&#8217; contracts, the guards 
acknowledge that they are offering their services &#8220;in a highly dangerous environment that poses 
a risk to their personal safety and/or integrity and that they freely give their consent and assume 
full responsibility for working in such conditions&#8221;. They also acknowledge that they will be 
working in &#8220;countries that are at war, in which there are occupation forces and pockets of 
resistance&#8221;. However, as stipulated in another clause common to the two companies&#8217; contracts, 
the guards expressly and irrevocably declare that they release the company that hired them 
(Neskowin or Global Guards) and the company for which they are working (Blackwater or 
Triple Canopy), as well as their related enterprises, etc., from any liability, payment, 
compensation or assistance in connection with any damage or injury to their personal safety 
and/or integrity, which, in the course of performing their duties, may result from any foreseen or 
unforeseen action on the part of third parties (beyond what is covered by their life insurance). 
</p>
<p>19. It is interesting to examine these life insurance policies, since the Working Group has 
received allegations that, in some cases, compensation has not been provided. Under the federal 
law of the United States, companies are required to obtain insurance against injury and death in 
conformity with the Defense Base Act. However, the procedures for doing so are complex. For a 
start, the employer must deduct a certain amount each month from the &#8220;security guard&#8217;s&#8221; wages 
for this insurance. To that end, employers are required to include a clause in the contract 
indicating that the job is covered by the Defense Base Act and to inform an insurance broker, 
who, in turn, negotiates an insurance policy between the employer and an insurance provider 
working with the U.S. State Department. This labyrinth of claims for life insurance, disability or 
incapacity is then added to that of private security companies, agents and subsidiaries. 
</p>
<p>20. When demand was at its highest, Pizarro was estimating that he could send 
some 3,000 Chileans in 2006. How many did he actually manage to send? According to his own 
estimates, he selected and contracted 756 Chileans for Blackwater and Triple Canopy, and 
perhaps for others, such as Boots and Coots International Well Control, Inc. (an American 
company based in Texas). This figure coincides with the estimate of 749 supplied by the 
criminal investigation police.  
</p>
<p>21. Nevertheless, the number of Chileans who have actually gone to Iraq is probably higher, 
for various reasons. Grupo T&#225;ctico Chile, Neskowin and Global Guards were reportedly not the 
only companies recruiting Chileans to go to Iraq. In 2005, for example, the company Your 
Solutions Honduras SRL. - an agent of the American company Your Solutions Inc., based in the 
state of Illinois (United States) - selected and recruited 105 former members of the Chilean 
military and police to work in Iraq for Triple Canopy. These Chileans, who entered the country 
on tourist visas, were trained in Honduras along with other Hondurans before departing to Iraq. 
At this same time, another 50 Chileans were in El Salvador, also for the purpose of receiving </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.4 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>training in Honduras.<b>8</b> It is interesting to note that Oscar Aspe, an old friend of Pizarro&#8217;s who had 
already worked with him in Iraq, was among the Chileans in charge of operating Your Solutions 
in Honduras.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>22. Moreover, according to information received by the Working Group, a number of 
companies were currently operating clandestinely in Chile and recruiting Chileans to go to Iraq, 
such as Your Solutions, Loft Security, Land and Fire Integral Services and Britain Security, in 
Vi&#241;a del Mar and Santiago. Some of the individuals managing those companies are thought to 
have worked closely with Pizarro in the past. The Working Group transmitted these data, which 
it received during its visit to Chile, to the private security division of the carabineros.  
</p>
<p>23. Very early on, in 2003, Televisi&#243;n Nacional de Chile broadcast an initial report in which it 
showed military exercises being conducted with rifles on a private estate near Santiago. The 
individuals training were apparently former servicemen, but it was thought that military 
personnel still on active duty might also have participated, owing to the fact that Pizarro had 
reportedly placed posters inside some barracks and had consequently been barred entry to them. 
According to the testimony gathered by the Working Group from one of the &#8220;security guards&#8221; 
who had been in Iraq after being contracted by one of Pizarro&#8217;s companies, 17 active military 
troops, like himself, from a single unit had requested leave in order to be recruited.  
</p>
<p>24. The commander-in-chief of the army General Oscar Izurieta corroborated this information, 
indicating to the Working Group that, in one case, efforts had been made to hire active military 
personnel from a naval base by means of e-mail. The incident was investigated following 
requests for early retirement from a number of servicemen, all of whom were stationed at the 
same base. It was found that one of the soldiers was acting as a recruiting agent for 
Grupo T&#225;ctico. As a result, the army launched an internal campaign to discourage military 
personnel from retiring, informing them of the risks they faced and the long-term benefits of 
staying in the army. In addition, the agent who had been recruiting in the barracks was expelled. 
In late 2003, the Department of National Mobilization filed a complaint with the Military 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>25. A few months later, Televisi&#243;n Nacional de Chile broadcast another report with statements 
from 15 &#8220;security guards&#8221; who had returned from Iraq or from relatives of security guards still in 
Iraq in which they complained of failed promises and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>26. However, it was as a result of the programme &#8220;Informe Especial&#8221; presented on the national 
television channel that, at the instruction of the Minister of National Defence, the Military 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office filed a complaint on 21 October 2005 with the military courts against 
Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro on charges of establishing an armed combat group and encroaching on the 
functions of the armed forces and security forces.<b>10</b> In its application to the military court, the

</p>
<p>military prosecutor argued that the televised report &#8220;is accurate and conclusive in that it shows a 
group of former servicemen training and preparing for war with hand weapons and, in some 
cases, combat weapons. Furthermore, we are compelled to mention a fact that increases the 
gravity of this situation. The images indicate the presence of at least one English-speaking 
foreigner, whose nationality appears to be American, interacting with the others in training and 
carrying out certain offensive and defensive exercises alongside Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro Ovalle. 
From the context of the news report, one gets the impression that he is a former serviceman in 
the armed forces of that country&#8221;.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>27. According to this same document, the establishment of an armed combat group violates 
article 8 of Act No. 17798 on the control of weapons. It also points out that offensive and 
defensive exercises, the use of light and heavy weaponry and door-to-door combat techniques, 
which fall within the sphere of the military, encroach upon areas that the Chilean Constitution 
has designated for the armed forces and security forces. The Military Prosecutor subsequently 
requested, inter alia, that: 
</p>
<p> (a) A restriction order should immediately be issued against Pizarro and his Chilean 
aides who were involved in providing military instruction;<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p> (b) Official notice should be sent to the Ministry of National Defence for it to determine 
whether the United States Government had requested authorization or informed the Chilean 
Government of the presence of former United States military personnel in Chile in connection 
with military activities linked to Pizarro&#8217;s companies; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Embassy of the United States of America in Chile should investigate the matter; 
</p>
<p> (d) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be requested to determine whether the 
activities of Pizarro and his companies constituted the international offence of the recruitment of 
mercenaries. 
</p>
<p>28. The Chilean authorities explained to the Working Group that it was difficult to judge the 
activities carried out by Pizarro&#8217;s companies since there was no well-defined classification of the 
corresponding offences in Chile&#8217;s legal system. Pizarro&#8217;s prosecution was conducted on the basis 
of three areas of the law: 
</p>
<p> (a) Under article 8 of the Weapons Control Act, since it was possible to prove that the 
weapons were made of plastic. However, in the &#8220;Informe Especial&#8221; report, Pizarro is seen 
dressed as an &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; at a civilian artillery range in Santiago and using a

<p><b>11
</b>  According to Pizarro, three Blackwater representatives evaluated in Chile the 300 former

<p>military weapon to test the firmness of a bulletproof vest for his recruits. According to 
information transmitted to the Working Group by General Izurieta, it was as a result of these 
scenes showing Pizarro with military weapons, that Lieutenant Colonel Martin, who had 
wrongly issued authorization, was forced to resign; 
</p>
<p> (b) Under the Criminal Code - for encroachment on the functions of the armed forces, 
such as training combat troops and unlawful agreement; 
</p>
<p> (c) Under article 5 bis of Decree Law No. 3607 (1981) regulating private security 
activities in Chile. 
</p>
<p>29. The action against Pizarro and the activities of his companies, which was initially brought 
in the military justice system, is currently being conducted in two proceedings: one in the 
ordinary courts<b>13</b> and a second in the military courts. 
</p>
<p>30. <i>Ordinary system of justice</i>. According to information provided by the Supreme Court of 
Chile, the action instituted by the Military Prosecutor&#8217;s Office alleging a violation of article 5 bis 
of Decree Law No. 3607 concerning private guards was referred by the Second Military Court of 
Santiago to the Seventeenth Criminal Court of Santiago. Article 5 bis prohibits &#8220;the act of 
providing or offering the services of private armed guards, in any form or designation, by any 
natural or artificial person&#8221;. In this action, which was merged with another existing case in the 
above-mentioned ordinary court, Pizarro was sentenced to 61 days&#8217; medium-term rigorous 
imprisonment within the minimum range, a fine equivalent to 200 times his minimum monthly 
income and permanent disqualification for positions requiring approval of Decree Law No. 3607 
concerning private guards. On 23 August 2006, Pizarro appealed this sentence, and the matter is 
currently before the Court of Appeal. Replying to the question that the Working Group had put 
to the authorities concerning the mildness of the sentence handed down at first instance, the 
Working Group was informed that, although the sentence was mild, its legal effects were 
considerable since, if Pizarro was convicted a second time, he would lose whatever benefits he 
had acquired, and this time, he would have to serve his sentence in prison without being able to 
appeal on the basis of extenuating circumstances. The above-mentioned article specifically 
stipulates that a repeat offence &#8220;shall be punishable by medium-term rigorous imprisonment 
within the medium-to-maximum range and a fine equivalent to between 500 and 1,000 times the 
minimum monthly income&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>31. The complaint filed against Pizarro for unlawful association by then member of the 
Chamber of Deputies Alejandro Navarro and Chamber of Deputies member Antonio Leal 
on 8 April 2004 was also heard in the ordinary courts before the Seventeenth Criminal Court. 
On 5 October 2005, a temporary dismissal was ordered and the case was closed.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  Since the institution of the actions against Pizarro, the Chilean criminal justice system has 
</p>
<p>undergone reforms transforming it from an inquisitorial system into an accusatory system. The 
case before the ordinary courts will reportedly continue to be prosecuted under the former 
system of criminal procedure.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.4 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>32. <i>Military system of justice</i>.<b>14</b> Case Nos. 1731-05 and 916-06 against Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro are 
currently on file with the Fifth Military Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. Both have been merged under 
case No. 1731-05, which is at the stage of pretrial proceedings. The court must determine 
whether there has been a violation of the Weapons Control Act. According to our interpretation, 
there are grounds for the following three offences: (a) training armed combat groups; 
(b) possession of prohibited weapons; and (c) unlawful agreement. 
</p>
<p>33. According to information received from various sources, Pizarro continues to pursue his 
activities, which currently consist of training dogs to detect car bombs. The explosives allegedly 
used in the training sessions are said to be genuine explosives stolen from the army. On the same 
grounds where the dogs are trained, paramilitary training with AK-47 and M-16 rifles is 
reportedly carried out. On the basis of these reports, Senator Navarro is said to have requested 
that the case against Pizarro, which had been dismissed temporarily, should be reopened.  
</p>
<p>34. According to testimony gathered by the Working Group, between 6 and 10 &#8220;security 
guards&#8221; who had already been to Iraq and who, at that time, were working in Chile directly for 
Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro but without a contract, had filed a complaint with the Chilean Labour 
Inspectorate in June and July 2005 for unjustified dismissal. The Labour Inspectorate reportedly 
informed them that they had 11 days to file the complaint through a lawyer. According to 
information provided to the Working Group during its meeting with the head of the Labour 
Department, the Ministry of Labour did not have any record of a complaint against Pizarro&#8217;s 
companies. 
</p>
<p>35. With respect to complaints against Pizarro&#8217;s companies for breaches of the terms of 
contracts signed by private &#8220;security guards&#8221; who had been in Iraq, as already indicated 
previously, the companies were registered in Uruguay or in Panama, and it was the courts of 
those countries that were competent to settle any dispute. Moreover, the contracts had been 
signed outside Chile - some in the United States and others in Amman, Jordan. As observed at 
the time by the former head of the Labour Department, the contracts were virtually 
unenforceable in Chile. The only request that could be made of a Chilean court, in the event it 
was declared to have jurisdiction, was to nullify the contracts. Some of the testimony gathered by 
the Working Group from &#8220;security guards&#8221; indicates that, faced with the prospect of filing a 
complaint with an Uruguayan or Panamanian court, they preferred to relinquish their claim and 
to forfeit any amounts they were due. 
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group also collected the testimony of a &#8220;security guard&#8221;, who, together with 
other former servicemen contracted to go to Iraq, had filed a complaint through National 
Congress representative, Laura Soto Gonz&#225;lez. The complaint was reportedly before a court in 
Valparaiso. In an interview conducted by the Working Group with the above-mentioned 
representative, she confirmed this information and indicated that the details of the case presented 
before the courts would be transmitted to the Working Group in due course.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  A bill has been drafted to restrict the competence of the military courts and prohibit the 
</p>
<p>prosecution of civilians under military law.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.4

</p>
<p>37. With the exception of an alleged breach of insurance policy in connection with an 
accident sustained in Iraq by a &#8220;security guard&#8221; working for Blackwater, the allegations received 
by the Working Group concerned (a) Pizarro&#8217;s companies, were made by &#8220;security guards&#8221; 
contracted by Neskowin or Global Guards to work in Iraq and related for the most part to the 
non-payment of wages; and (b) the company Triple Canopy, were made by &#8220;security guards&#8221; 
hired by Global Guards or Your Solutions to work in Iraq and related to contractual 
irregularities, poor working conditions, overcrowding, excessively long working hours, 
non-payment of wages, degrading treatment and isolation, and neglect of basic needs, such as 
health and hygiene. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Private security in Chile 
</b></p>
<p>38. In 2006, the total number of private security agents in Chile, including private armed 
guards (6,300) and private security guards (88,600), was 94,900, accounting for more than 
double the combined number of carabineros (27,000) and criminal investigation police forces 
(7,300 - 3,600 of which were operational). These private security agents were said to be involved 
in guarding progressively larger areas forming part of the daily lives of the population.<b>15</b> 
According to data provided by the carabineros, private security generates 116,502 jobs each 
year. The Working Group asked the private security division of the carabineros (OS-10) to 
provide a geographical breakdown of private armed guards and security guards over the 
past 20 years. According to the information it received, the database was being developed but 
was not yet functional.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>39. Over the course of the past 10 years, private security in Chile has experienced a rapid surge 
in growth. Data supplied by the office of the director-general of the carabineros shows that 
116,502 individuals are currently employed in the private security sector. The private security 
industry in Chile generates some US$ 800 million each year and grew by more than 46 per cent 
over the last three-year period. In 2005, annual per capita spending on private security in Chile 
exceeded US$ 25,000, and revenues generated by private security accounted for 
approximately 0.63 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).<b>17</b>

<p>  The consultancy firm of Jorge Lee Mira indicates that, in the past two years, the highest 
demand has come from the Metropolitan Region, which accounted for more than 
46,000 security guards, followed by the regions of Maule (seventh region) and Valparaiso 
(fifth region).

</p>
<p>40. Since it is the market in Chile that determines what needs there are and how to satisfy 
them, the carabineros contributes its quality-oriented expertise and experience to those private 
security components that have been selected.<b>18</b> The liberalization of the Chilean economy during 
the 1970s apparently contributed to boosting the demand for private security.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>41. According to reports, the carabineros view private security not as a parallel police force but 
rather as a complement to public safety. The expansion of the private security industry in Chile is 
said to be more likely the result of the difference between citizens&#8217; expectations of security and 
their perception of the level of security that the public forces<b>20</b> can provide. This information has 
apparently been confirmed by the results of the national public opinion survey taken in 
December 2006, which indicated that safety (crime, assault and robbery) was the number one 
problem for Chileans.  
</p>
<p>42. The expansion of private security in Chile is thought to be attributable in large part to 
efforts to prevent property crime, as well as to the growth of semi-public areas, such as 
residential communities, shopping centres, supermarkets, sports complexes and amusement 
parks, which are accessible to the public but are governed by regulations and patrolled by private 
guards.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>43. The security industry in Chile comprises regulated and unregulated sectors.<b>22</b> In 
accordance with Decree Law No. 3607 (1981) and Act No. 19303 (1994), the carabineros is the 
agency responsible for monitoring and supervising the regulated sectors of the private security 
system. To that end, the carabineros have developed a manual outlining the functions 
corresponding to each category of the system.<b>23</b> Approximately 1,350 private training instructors

and 8 per cent in Europe and between 7 and 9 per cent in North America). A. Abelson, op. cit. (see footnote 15 above). According to Inter-American Development Bank estimates, of the 
US$ 140,000 to 170,000 million (between 12 and 14 per cent of GDP), corresponding to the cost 
of armed violence in Latin America, the largest share is accounted for by private security 
services, which only the privileged classes can afford. Sources: J.L. Londo&#241;o et al<i>., Assault to

<p>and training enterprises provide initial instruction and refresher training courses to private armed 
guards and security guards according to the requirements and curricula specified in the legal 
framework established by the OS-10 division of the office of the director-general of the 
carabineros.  
</p>
<p>44. According to the data analysed, 78.5 per cent of guards are employed by subcontracting 
firms, and the rest (21.5 per cent) are hired by the firms requiring their services. Apparently there 
are only a few large transnational corporations, while the rest are made up of a fragmented 
collection of some 1,000 domestic companies. This fragmentation is reported to have a negative 
impact, particularly in terms of the low wages and level of training provided to the security 
guards.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>45. According to information transmitted to the Working Group by the private security branch 
of the carabineros, three stages of control are exercised by various carabineros divisions 
(oversight authority, operations department, duty officer) from the moment an employing agency 
requests authorization from carabineros to instruct private security agents through a training 
course. It is the responsibility of the relevant carabineros prefecture to grant the appropriate 
accreditation document (identity card) to private armed guards and security guards who have 
successfully completed the tests. Training instructors and enterprises receive a permit from the 
carabineros prefecture that is valid for two years. New regulations that went into effect in 
January 2006 stipulate that private security guards must follow refresher training courses, for 
which there had previously been no provision. 
</p>
<p>46. Training curricula have reportedly taken international standards into account; however, the 
Working Group has not found any reference to the international instruments it considers 
pertinent to this type of training, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and the Code of 
Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials.  
</p>
<p>47. Moreover, within the private security sector, there are more than 1,100 human or technical 
resource enterprises acting as job placement agencies for the sector. The Working Group has 
received no information concerning the modus operandi of these companies or how they are 
registered or licensed. It infers from the information transmitted to it that the company 
Grupo T&#225;ctico might have fallen into this category within the Chilean private security sector, and 
that the only administrative sanction imposed on it when its activities were disclosed was to 
delete it from the registry. 
</p>
<p><b>C. The involvement in social conflicts of private security companies  
that provide protective services to forestry companies 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Working Group has received information on the involvement of Chilean private 
security companies, which have been contracted by forestry companies, in incidents against 
indigenous communities, especially the Mapuche population in the south of the country.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>49. In 2000, nine members of the Mapuche community were charged and convicted under the 
Anti-Terrorism Act for the offence of setting a forest fire. According to the expert report of the 
carabineros, in case No. 38774-L, filed in the court of Yumbel (2001) for the alleged setting of a 
forest fire, it was established that &#8220;four individuals from the company, Empresa Forestal Santa 
Ana Ltda., Rut (tax number) 77,386.030-0, whose business is the private guarding of forest 
properties, issued threats and forced a third party to set various forest fires, reportedly for the 
purpose of justifying contracts signed by the above-mentioned security firm with the forestry 
companies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>50. Among the conclusions of the report, it was determined that &#8220;Empresa Forestal Santa 
Ana Ltda., which provides on-site guarding services at the premises of various forestry 
companies, including Forestal Mininco, Forestal Celco S.A., Bosques Arauco S.A. and Forestal 
Bio Bio, was reportedly not authorized to carry out guard duties, thereby violating article 5 bis of 
Decree Law No. 3607 [&#8230;] and contravening Act No. 17798 on the control of weapons as a result 
of the illegal carrying of weapons by some individuals&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>51. The sentences handed down against nine members of the Mapuche community were called 
into question by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people during his visit to Chile in 
November 2003,<b>25</b> by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights at its thirty-third 
session (November 2004)<b>26</b> and by reports published by Human Rights Watch <b>27</b>and the 
International Federation of Human Rights Leagues.<b>28</b> Despite the fact that some members of 
Congress have called for reopening the case in order to punish the security firm allegedly 
involved, no action has been taken in this regard. 
</p>
<p>52. In his report, the Special Rapporteur stated that &#8220;one of the most pressing problems 
affecting the native peoples of Chile concerns their ownership of land and territorial rights, 
particularly in the case of the Mapuche. (&#8230;) The communities&#8217; lands are in remote locations on 
private property, mostly inside vast forest plantations that are fenced off and protected by private 
guards (leading to transit problems and harassment and cutting off access to the woods)&#8221;.<b>29</b>

<p>53. According to information supplied by the director-general of the carabineros to the 
Working Group during its visit, forestry companies do not employ either private security guards 
or private armed guards (the latter are authorized exclusively for strategic institutions, such as 
banks). It appears that the security officers acted as armed guards and not as security guards in 
order to circumvent controls. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Working Group wishes to thank the Chilean authorities for their invitation to visit 
Chile and their cooperation, and commends the State for its efforts to regulate private security 
companies. 
</p>
<p>55. The Working Group recognizes that the preliminary draft of a bill on Chile&#8217;s accession to 
the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries, which was deposited in the Defence Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, 
cannot be adopted without the necessary amendments that will be recommended by the 
inter-agency working party. The latter is charged with examining the measures included in 
Chile&#8217;s domestic legislation with a view to developing an efficient and up-to-date system of rules 
for the criminalization, deterrence and punishment of new practices related to mercenarism. In 
this connection, if the Government considers it necessary, it may request technical assistance 
from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in preparing for the 
legal classification of mercenarism as a criminal offence and its inclusion in domestic legislation. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group believes that the adoption of a new private security act, which is 
currently being drafted in the Ministry of the Interior with technical support from the University 
of Chile and which will replace the current law concerning private guards, represents an 
opportunity to strengthen the existing legislation, regulation and control of private security 
companies in the country, as well as to improve public policies on private security. The 
preliminary drafts of bills concerning reform of the military career will help to discourage 
military personnel from recruitment by those private companies. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group expressed concern at the recruitment and training of hundreds of 
Chileans by private security companies in order to carry out duties in Iraq. It believes that the use 
of Chilean &#8220;independent contractors&#8221; or &#8220;security guards&#8221; by transnational private security 
companies in Iraq represents new expressions of mercenarism in the twenty-first century. 
</p>
<p>58. The aim of the contracts can be interpreted as generally to implement the same features or 
other very similar features as those specified in article 1 of the 1989 Convention. The Chilean 
&#8220;independent contractors&#8221; were recruited abroad and were motivated by the desire for private 
gain<b>30</b> to offer their services &#8220;in countries in a state of war, in which there are occupation forces 
and pockets of resistance&#8221;. If attacked, they could, at any time, become combatants in an armed 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>30
</b>  Those who benefit most are the private security companies and subcontracting firms. They 
</p>
<p>reportedly divide among themselves the lion&#8217;s share of the original tendered contract with the 
Government of the United States of America for each Chilean &#8220;independent contractor&#8221;; see 
document A/HRC/4/42, para. 36. </p>

</p>
<p>conflict (offering their services in a highly dangerous environment that poses a risk to their 
safety and/or personal integrity) and could take part in hostilities. Contrary to article 47 of the 
Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection 
of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, the 1989 Convention does not specify what is 
meant by the word &#8220;directly&#8221;. Independent contractors may very well carry out passive functions 
that would involve taking part in hostilities. 
</p>
<p>59. Some Chileans recruited by the private companies in question and who had been in Iraq 
informed the Working Group that they had been armed with automatic rifles, sometimes with 
anti-tank bazookas, that they had returned fire every time they had been attacked by insurgents 
and had even used weapons banned by international laws on war. All this indicates that they 
were being prepared to take part in hostilities and that the line between passive and active 
participation in hostilities in an armed conflict or post-conflict area is very tenuous. Chileans 
recruited in this manner are neither nationals nor residents of a country that is a party to the 
conflict. Moreover, they are not soldiers, members of the United States Army, parties to the 
conflict or civilians - given that they are armed - and have not been sent by a State on official 
duty. 
</p>
<p>60. The legal subtlety of the matter resides in the fact that Blackwater and Triple Canopy, the 
contracting companies, admit to working directly on behalf of the State Department of the 
Government of the United States of America, which had contracted them with the objective of 
providing protection services in armed conflict or post-conflict zones, such as Afghanistan and 
Iraq.<b>31</b> Once they had obtained a contract from the United States Government, these companies, 
in turn, subcontracted other companies abroad. Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro&#8217;s companies, Grupo T&#225;ctico, 
Neskowin and Global Guards, which selected and contracted Chileans, were based either in 
Uruguay or Panama. Neskowin had signed a contract with Blackwater, and Global Guards had 
signed one with Triple Canopy. Of course, information concerning the nature of the 
organizational relationship or contracts between Neskowin and Blackwater, on the one hand, and 
between Global Guards and Triple Canopy, on the other, is considered to be private, and the 
companies are not willing to disclose it. 
</p>
<p>61. The activities of the companies that hired Chileans as private &#8220;security guards&#8221; allegedly 
constitute practices related to mercenarism, such as the recruitment, training, financing and use 
of individuals as part of a profit-making arrangement. 
</p>
<p>62. It would be interesting to know to which authority of the Iraqi Government, the coalition in 
Iraq or the United States Government the companies that contracted Chileans were accountable 
in the event their employees or the companies themselves committed criminal offences. In this 
maze of contracting and subcontracting it would also be interesting to know whether there are 
any mechanisms available to Chileans whose rights have been violated and to which American 
authorities they can submit their complaints. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>31
</b>  Private military and security companies do not consider the protection of convoys, buildings 
</p>
<p>or individuals as direct involvement in hostilities. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/7/Add.4 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>63. The Working Group has received allegations of contractual irregularities, poor working 
conditions, overcrowding, excessively long working hours, non-payment of wages, degrading 
treatment and isolation, as well as the neglect of basic needs, such as health and hygiene. This is 
despite the fact that the persons in question had been hired as security guards, received military 
training in the United States, in Iraq or in a third country, and ended up performing functions not 
provided for in their contracts. 
</p>
<p>64. Jos&#233; Miguel Pizarro&#8217;s companies apparently took advantage of lacunae and legal loopholes 
in Chilean domestic legislation to hire Chilean nationals as private &#8220;security guards&#8221; for 
American transnational corporations and to send them to armed conflict or post-conflict areas, 
such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group expressed concern at information it had received indicating that new 
Chilean job placement agencies apparently continue to recruit former Chilean military and police 
personnel for American private military and security companies in order to work as private 
&#8220;security guards&#8221; in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>66. The fact that, despite having reacted promptly to the phenomenon, the Chilean authorities 
initially treated it as a private matter, along with the fact that the manager of Grupo T&#225;ctico, 
Neskowin and Global Guards continues to pursue similar activities regardless of the cases 
pending before the ordinary and military courts, may have contributed to a certain climate of 
&#8220;tolerance&#8221;. This has led to the paradoxical situation in which, on the one hand, the Chilean 
Government&#8217;s official position in the Security Council discussions of 2003 was to oppose 
waging a preventive war in Iraq, and on the other, the fact that some 1,000 former members of 
the Chilean military and police have taken part in that conflict as &#8220;independent contractors&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>67. In this regard, the Working Group commends the Chilean authorities for the unambiguous 
statement of Mr. Jos&#233; A. Viera-Gallo, Minister and Secretary-General of the Presidency, which 
prompted the Working Group&#8217;s visit to Chile, and in which Mr. Viera-Gallo underscored the 
paradoxical nature of the situation in which Chile finds itself. On the one hand, there is the 
official Chilean position to reject the war in Iraq, and on the other, the current situation in which 
some 1,000 Chileans are &#8220;protecting private security in Iraq (&#8230;) and are involved in a dirty war 
(&#8230;) of violent acts in which there are no clear boundaries between friends and enemies&#8221;. In his 
statement Mr. Viera-Gallo called for &#8220;efforts to facilitate Chile&#8217;s accession to the Convention&#8221; 
and, at the domestic level, &#8220;categorically and unequivocally to classify as a criminal offence 
actions undertaken by these types of private companies, which are sometimes based in developed 
countries, to recruit and, in some cases, trick Chileans into fighting wars that are not their own&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>68. The Working Group is aware of the fact that the practices in which some private security 
companies engage represent new forms of mercenarism and that these may have initially come 
as a surprise to the Chilean authorities. It is concerned, however, at the failure of the Chilean 
State to take appropriate steps to protect the right to life and physical integrity of the hundreds of 
former members of the military and police who were recruited to work in Iraq, as well as 
deficiencies noted in terms of Chile&#8217;s compliance with its obligations under international law. 
</p>
<p>69. With respect to the transfer of the use of force and/or authority to non-State actors, the 
Working Group wishes to point out the responsibility of States regarding the privatization of 
security, which is a public good and a human right. When security is privatized, there is the risk </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.4 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>that it will no longer be available as a public service to those who cannot afford to pay for it, 
thereby violating the right to equity, in the sense that its access by the poorest members of 
society has been reduced. It should also be borne in mind that private security guards and armed 
guards do not defend common interests and the common good, but rather the private interests of 
those who hire and pay them, and in so doing they transform security into a commodity. 
</p>
<p>70. In conformity with international human rights standards, the privatization of public 
services must not at any time prevent such services from being made available to the general 
public in sufficient quantity. Moreover, public services must be accessible to all without 
discrimination of any kind (economic or information-based); culturally acceptable; and of good 
quality - in other words, privatization should not result in lower quality services.<b>32</b> The 
privatization process must also be transparent, and information must be disseminated with the 
aim of ensuring the right to seek, receive and impart information<b>33</b> and avoid corruption - an 
aspect that is often present in the privatization process. 
</p>
<p>71. With regard to social protests engaged in by indigenous communities in defence of their 
lands and environmental rights, the Working Group is concerned at the fact that legitimate social 
protests are being confused with unlawful or terrorist activities, that their leaders are being 
subjected to accusations and intimidation, and that, when States transfer the use of force and 
security to private security companies, unlawful acts may be committed. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Working Group wishes to make the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) That, as soon as possible, the inter-agency working party should complete the 
study on the domestic criminalization of and enactment of legislation concerning activities 
related to mercenarism, adopting the broadest possible normative interpretation that 
includes not only the offence of mercenarism but also its new manifestations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) That Chile should, without delay, take steps to accede to the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) That the competent authorities, particularly in the military courts, should, 
without delay, complete investigations into the case still pending concerning the 
recruitment of private security guards to work in Iraq by the companies Neskowin and 
Global Guards;</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (d) That urgent measures should be taken to protect the rights of Chilean citizens 
still in Iraq;

</b></p>

security as a public good through the adoption of a new private security act, which must 
incorporate the principles of efficiency - in relations between public and private sectors - 
and transparency, responsibility and accountability. The new act should also contain 
measures aimed at providing suitable training to officials responsible for private security 
(private armed guards and security guards) that includes: human rights, the Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials and the Code of 
Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials of the United Nations, as well as the notion of 
equity in order to ensure the accessibility of security as a public good to the entire 
population; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) That steps should be taken to establish a mechanism, whether a parliamentary 
committee or a commissioner, with authority to monitor the activities of private security 
companies and to which complaints may be submitted; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) That, as soon as possible, steps should be taken to establish a national human 
rights institution that conforms to the Paris Principles and whose objective is the 
promotion and protection of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) That consideration should be given to the possibility of organizing a 
multidisciplinary seminar in order to disseminate the findings of the inter-agency working 
party and the report on Chile by the Working Group on mercenaries, with a view to 
incorporating the recommendations of the seminar into public policy.
