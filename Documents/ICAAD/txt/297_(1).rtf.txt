[1]     
All three assessors have given their unanimous opinion that 1st Accused is guilty of Count No. 1 as charged and that the 2nd Accused is guilty of Count No. 2 as charged.

[2]     
I direct myself in accordance with my summing up and the evidence placed before this Court. I find that the unanimous opinion of the assessors are not perverse and I agree with them. 

[3]     
I find the 1st Accused guilty of Count No. 1.

[4]     
I find the 2nd Accused guilty of Count No. 2

 [5]    
 I find that this is fit and proper case to convict the 1st and 2nd Accused on their finding of guilty.

[6]     
Therefore I convict the 1st Accused on count 1 and convict the 2nd Accused on Count 2.
