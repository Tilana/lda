 <p></p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing </i>the development goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in 
particular the four health-related development goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with</i> <i>concern</i> that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full enjoyment 
of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health remains a distant goal 
and that, in many cases, especially for those living in poverty, this goal is becoming increasingly 
remote, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the Declaration on the Right to Development, which establishes that States 
should take, at the national level, all necessary measures for the realization of the right to 
development and should ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic 
resources, such as health services, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also </i>its resolution 6/29 of 14 December 2007, in which the Council extended the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> Council resolution S-10/1 of 23 February 2009, and reiterating its 
concern that financial and economic crises are having a negative impact on the ability of States 
to provide social services, such as health, 
</p>
<p> <i>Regretting</i> the high number of people still without access to medicines, and underscoring 
that improving access to medicine could save millions of lives every year, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Recognizes</i> that access to medicine is a fundamental element in achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Stresses </i>the responsibility of States to ensure access to all, without discrimination, of 
medicines, in particular essential medicines, that are affordable and of good quality; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3. <i>Recognizes </i>that the human rights perspective of access to medicines should be 
applicable to communicable and non-communicable diseases alike; 
</p>
<p> 4. C<i>alls</i> <i>upon</i> States, at the international level, to take steps, individually and/or through 
international cooperation, in accordance with applicable international law, including 
international agreements, to ensure that their actions as members of international organizations 
take into due account the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, and that the application of international agreements is supportive of 
public health policies that promote broad access to safe, effective and affordable medicines; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes </i>that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the Agreement on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health confirms that the 
Agreement does not and should not prevent members from taking measures to protect public 
health and that the Declaration, while reiterating the commitment to the Agreement, affirms that 
it can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of the rights of States 
Members of the World Trade Organization to protect public health and, in particular, to promote 
access to medicines for all; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages</i> all States to apply measures and procedures for enforcing intellectual 
property rights in such a manner as to avoid creating barriers to the legitimate trade of medicines, 
and to provide for safeguards against the abuse of such measures and procedures; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Invites </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
convene an expert consultation, within existing resources, open to the participation of 
</p>
<p>Governments, regional and international organizations, relevant United Nations bodies and civil 
society organizations, in order to identify challenges related to the realization of access to 
medicines as an integral part of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health, and invites the Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to 
present a summary of the discussions of the expert consultation to the Council; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur to continue his analysis, within his existing 
</p>
<p>mandate, of the human rights dimensions of the issues of access to medicines; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages </i>all Member States to include in their national reports, to be submitted to 
the universal periodic review mechanism, information on the right of everyone to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, particularly on measures taken 
to realize access to medicines; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of this matter.
