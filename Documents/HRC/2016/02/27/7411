<p><b>  Mission to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam: Comments by 
the State on the report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom 
of religion or belief, Heiner Bielefeldt 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Inputs by the Government of Viet Nam to the Draft Report of 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Government of Viet Nam reaffirms its consistent policy to respect and protect 
</p>
<p>all fundamental human rights and freedoms, including freedom of religion and belief in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international standards. All policies are to serve the people and for the 
</p>
<p>people. This is clearly stipulated in the Constitution and law and guaranteed by policies, 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and in practices.  
</p>
<p>2. The Government of Viet Nam views the visit by Mr. Heiner Bieledfeldt, Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur (SR) on freedom of religion or belief as a continuation of the cooperation 
</p>
<p>momentum between Viet Nam and Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>This is the 6th country visit of the Special Procedures to Viet Nam within 4 years from 
</p>
<p>2010 to 2014. This is an opportunity for the SR to understand religions and beliefs 
</p>
<p>practiced by local people and the situation of religious freedom in Viet Nam, and more 
</p>
<p>importantly to update with new developments since the last visit by the late Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur Amor Abdelfatah in 1998. To the Government, it is also a chance for relevant 
</p>
<p>Ministries, agencies, localities, political and social organizations, religious organizations 
</p>
<p>and worshipping establishments to share with the SR experiences, lessons learnt, 
</p>
<p>difficulties and challenges that Viet Nam is facing in this area.  
</p>
<p>3. In that light, the Government of Viet Nam has cooperated and created most 
</p>
<p>favourable conditions for the SR&#8217;s visit. At the request of the SR, seven government 
</p>
<p>agencies (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Public Security, the Government 
</p>
<p>Committee for Religious Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Culture, Sports and 
</p>
<p>Tourism, Ministry of Education and Training, and the Committee on Ethnic Minority 
</p>
<p>Affairs), two bodies of the National Assembly (the Ethnic Council and the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Social Affairs), the People&#8217;s Supreme Court and 3 provinces (Ho Chi Minh City, Tuyen 
</p>
<p>Quang, Vinh Long) had candid and open meetings with the SR.1 Arrangements were made 
</p>
<p>for the SR to visit a detention camp, 8 religious organizations and worshipping 
</p>
<p>establishments in Viet Nam (the Catholic Solidarity Committee, Viet Nam Buddhist 
</p>
<p>Sangha, Chantaransey Pagoda, Pothiwon Pagoda, Institution of Bible and Theology, 
</p>
<p>Evangelical Church, Hindu Temple, Cao Dai Sacerdotal Council).2 The Government of 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam always listened to and met the SR&#8217;s requests at the highest level during the visit 
</p>
<p>while respecting his independence and privacy. Neither intervention nor request for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 At the request of the SR, arrangements were made for the SR to visit and meet An Giang, Gia Lai and 
</p>
<p>Kon Tum provincial officials. The meetings, however, did not take place since the SR changed his 
</p>
<p>schedule. 
</p>
<p> 2 Also at the request of the SR, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam had contacted in advance 
</p>
<p>with the Xuan Loc Monastery, Jamiul Muslimin Mosque, and Hoa Hao Administrative Council to 
</p>
<p>arrange appointments with the SR; the meetings however did not take place because the SR cancelled 
</p>
<p>them without prior notice.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>information on his private meetings was made, which complied with Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2.  
</p>
<p><b>  The Government of Viet Nam acknowledged positive assessments that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the SR made in the draft report  
</b></p>
<p>4. The draft report affirms that &#8220;many representatives of different religious 
</p>
<p>communities acknowledged that there is generally more space for the exercise of religious 
</p>
<p>freedom in Viet Nam nowadays, especially when compared to the situation post-1975. 
</p>
<p>Religious life is a visible reality, especially when compared to the situation post-1975. 
</p>
<p>Religious life is a visible reality &#8211; as evidenced by places of worship that belong to various 
</p>
<p>religions and denominations and by the participation of people from diverse religious and 
</p>
<p>belief practices&#8221;; &#8220;In recent years, there have apparently been attempts to preserve or revive 
</p>
<p>such traditional rituals among the ethnic or religious minorities&#8221;; &#8220;acknowledging the 
</p>
<p>internal diversity within the Viet Nam Buddhist Sangha&#8221;&#8230; 
</p>
<p>5. The draft report recognises that the Constitution of Viet Nam which was approved 
</p>
<p>on November 28th 2013 contains a chapter on &#8220;human rights and citizen&#8217;s fundamental 
</p>
<p>rights and duties&#8221; and &#8220;Article 24 of the new Constitution in relation to freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>or belief are all human beings, unlike the provision of the 1992 Constitution that was 
</p>
<p>confined to the citizens of Viet Nam. This was presented as an indicator of a more positive 
</p>
<p>attitude towards freedom of religion or belief as well&#8221;; &#8220;its adoption symbolized a move 
</p>
<p>towards the legal accommodation of religious and belief communities&#8221;; &#8220;Article 38 of the 
</p>
<p>Ordinance provides that the stipulations of any concluded international treaty or acceded to, 
</p>
<p>prevail over the provisions of the Ordinance whenever they contravene. A decree detailing 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the Ordinance on measure of belief and religion (Decree 92), of 8 
</p>
<p>November 2012, further specifies the measures for the implementation of Ordinance 21&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Other officials have also expressed their willingness to consider substantive changes of 
</p>
<p>Ordinance 21 in the process of the law making.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>6. The draft report also states that &#8220;the number of training institutions for the clergy of 
</p>
<p>different religious &#8211; Buddhism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Cao Daism and others has 
</p>
<p>significantly increased in recent decades&#8221;; and acknowledges that &#8220;religious communities 
</p>
<p>can appoint and ordain their clergy in accordance with their own internal rules and laws. 
</p>
<p>They reportedly do not need approval for their decisions from the authorities in general.&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Concerning dismissals of clergy or monks, which are apparently rare, decisions are also 
</p>
<p>generally taken by religious communities, in accordance with their religious laws&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>7. The draft report also acknowledges that &#8220;representatives of the VBS explained they 
</p>
<p>would increasingly offer services in prisons, including lectures for the social and moral 
</p>
<p>edification of prisoners. Catholic priests, too, seem to have occasionally offered religious 
</p>
<p>services to prison inmates.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  However, the Government of Viet Nam deeply regrets that the contents 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the draft report are seriously unbalanced and discriminatory. 
</b></p>
<p>8. When discussing efforts of the Government of Viet Nam to promote and protect the 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion and belief, or when describing the religious life in Viet Nam, the SR 
</p>
<p>only provided a vague and scattered description which are supported by little illustrative 
</p>
<p>evidence and information, even though this type of information has been provided to the SR 
</p>
<p>during his stay in Viet Nam. Therefore, the draft report failed to depict a balanced 
</p>
<p>panorama of the religious and belief situation in Viet Nam, particularly Viet Nam&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>substantive progress since the Doi Moi/Reform in 1986, especially the period following the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>visit to Viet Nam in 1998 by the late Special Rapporteur Amor Abdelfatah. Meanwhile, the 
</p>
<p>draft report highlighted what the SR referred to as &#8220;violations&#8221; of the freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>and belief based on the biased and unverified information. 
</p>
<p>9. Viet Nam respects the independence of the Special Procedures and always supports 
</p>
<p>the mandate-holders&#8217; professionalism, objectivity and impartiality as stipulated in 
</p>
<p>Resolution 5/1 and the Code of Conduct in Resolution 5/2. Viet Nam understands that 
</p>
<p>report on the visit to Viet Nam should be developed in a fair and universal manner based on 
</p>
<p>the same criteria for visits to other United Nations member countries that the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs had conducted prior to the Viet Nam visit. Article 3.e) of the Code of Conduct 
</p>
<p>specifies that the Special Rapporteurs must uphold the highest standards of efficiency, 
</p>
<p>competence and integrity, meaning, in particular, though not exclusively, probity, 
</p>
<p>impartiality, equity, honesty and good faith. 
</p>
<p>As such, Viet Nam believes the draft report would satisfy better the requirements in 
</p>
<p>Article 3.e) of the Code of Conduct and would contribute to promoting dialogue and 
</p>
<p>cooperation if it does not include some sections, the titles of which are, in itself, of negative 
</p>
<p>meaning such as section VI &#8220;Reports about violations of freedom of religion or belief&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. The SR acknowledges that Viet Nam has a diverse belief and religious life. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, during the visit and its planning, the SR only focused attention on some 
</p>
<p>specific groups and individuals without considering other important religions, for instance 
</p>
<p>the Muslim Community in Viet Nam. The SR did not show his interest in the Vietnamese 
</p>
<p>traditional beliefs such as ancestors worshipping, commemorating and honoring people 
</p>
<p>with meritorious contribution to the country, worshipping of Village Gods, the spiritual 
</p>
<p>symbols. Therefore, the draft report has yet to reflect fully the diverse and lively nature of 
</p>
<p>the religious and belief life in Viet Nam 
</p>
<p><b>  The draft report includes various inaccurate information, observations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and assessments 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Government of Viet Nam regrets that a great deal of information, assessments 
</p>
<p>and judgments in the draft report are not objective, accurate and relevant to the reality in 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam. One of the reasons is that an 11-day visit could be not enough to draw an overall 
</p>
<p>picture on the exercise of the freedom of religion or belief in a multi-religious country such 
</p>
<p>as Viet Nam.  
</p>
<p>In the spirit of cooperation, dialogue and in order to have a better understanding of 
</p>
<p>the overall landscape of freedom of   belief and religion in Viet Nam, the Government of 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam would like to comment on a number of paragraphs in the draft report as follows: 
</p>
<p> Regarding the &#8220;Introduction&#8221;: </p>
<p>- Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Viet Nam met 
</p>
<p>and had frank discussions with the SR on the related issues. The MOFA stated that there 
</p>
<p>had been regretful misunderstandings and it provided objective information on the incidents 
</p>
<p>mentioned in the draft report. The MOFA also stressed that as the host country, Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>was responsible for ensuring absolute security and safety for the Special Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p> Regarding the &#8220;Brief overview on the religious landscape in Viet Nam&#8221;: </p>
<p>The content in this section does not fully reflects the open, rich and diverse belief or 
</p>
<p>religious life in Viet Nam. Viet Nam is a multi-religious country with the presence of 
</p>
<p>almost all major religions in the world. There is a wide diversity of religions in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>Many of them came from abroad such as Buddhism, Catholicism and Protestantism. Others </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>are endogenous such as Caodaism, Hoa Hao Buddhism. Many religions have a long history 
</p>
<p>of development such as Buddhism and Islam. Others have been recently developed such as 
</p>
<p>Cao Dai, Baha&#8217;i &#8230;.. Foreigners living in Viet Nam and tourists are surprised and impressed 
</p>
<p>by the vibrant and diverse belief or religious life in Viet Nam with around 9000 traditional 
</p>
<p>belief festivals held per year. The people usually go to pagoda or to church, and fully 
</p>
<p>participate to the traditional belief festivals. 
</p>
<p> - Paragraph 6: Some statistics in this section are not accurate. There are currently 38 
</p>
<p>religious organizations and one dharma-door practice that are recognized by the State. 
</p>
<p>Around 95% out of 90 million people in Viet Nam have belief or religious life, the majority 
</p>
<p>of them practice traditional beliefs and over 24 million followers of various religions in 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam. The religious communities include 11 million Buddhists, 6.5 million Catholics, 
</p>
<p>2.5 million Cao Dai followers, 1.5 million Protestants, over 1.3 million Hoa Hao Buddhists, 
</p>
<p>78 thousand Muslims, 7 thousand Baha&#8217;i followers. There are around 25 thousand places of 
</p>
<p>worship and 83 thousand religious dignitaries, 250 thousand administrative assistants of 
</p>
<p>religious organizations, 46 training institutions for religious dignitaries. 
</p>
<p> - Paragraph 8: The statement by the SR that &#8220;the number of people practicing 
</p>
<p>religions outside registered communities &#8211; or wishing to do so &#8211; may be up to several 
</p>
<p>millions&#8221; is inaccurate since the Special Rapporteur only &#8220;heard conjectures&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>- Paragraph 9: The SR mentioned:&#8220;one of the most striking features of recent 
</p>
<p>religious developments in Viet Nam is the enormous growth of Protestantism, in particular 
</p>
<p>among some ethnic or religious minorities. At the same time, this has led to some 
</p>
<p>worrisome cases of religious persecution.&#8221; In fact, if there had been any religious 
</p>
<p>persecution, there would not have been such a huge increase in the number of Protestants. 
</p>
<p>There are over one million Protestants in Viet Nam. In the Northwest region, there are 
</p>
<p>nearly 200 thousand Protestants, the majority of whom are ethnic minorities with 90% are 
</p>
<p>H&#8217;Mong people. Over the past time, the authorities at all levels have created favorable 
</p>
<p>conditions for Protestants to practice their religion at home or by groupings. To date, the 
</p>
<p>majority of Protestant groupings in the Northwest region are conducting normal religious 
</p>
<p>practices, with over 400 groupings already registered with the local authorities. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Persecution&#8221; mentioned by the SR may be a misunderstanding of the normal conflict 
</p>
<p>between Protestantism and other traditional beliefs of ethnic minority.  
</p>
<p> - Paragraph 10: The SR states:&#8220;the conditions under which in individuals or groups 
</p>
<p>can exercise their right to freedom of religion or belief remain unpredictable, often 
</p>
<p>depending on the good will of the local authorities, nor least relevant Government 
</p>
<p>agencies.&#8221;. This judgment is ungrounded as the freedom of religion and belief is written in 
</p>
<p>the Constitution and the law as noted by the Special Rapporteur. During the 2nd UPR 
</p>
<p>Review, the international community has also recognized Viet Nam&#8217;s remarkable progress 
</p>
<p>in improving the legal framework to guarantee the freedom of religion or belief. Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>is drafting the Law on Belief and Religion which is expected to be adopted in 2016.  
</p>
<p>- Paragraph 11: Under the Constitution and the law, the freedom of belief or religion   
</p>
<p>is protected, all individuals enjoy favorable conditions to   practice their religions and 
</p>
<p>beliefs. There is no such thing as &#8220;tight control&#8221; or &#8220;religious persecution&#8221;. This explains 
</p>
<p>why at present around 95% of Viet Namese people has belief or religious life, out of them 
</p>
<p>more than 24 million followers of different religions. Besides, also in this paragraph, the SR 
</p>
<p>acknowledged &#8220;the broadening of the space for religious and belief practices&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Regarding the &#8220;restrictions of freedom of religion or belief&#8221; (paragraphs 16 &#8211;<i> 25): 
</i></p>
<p>The SR reports that there are many clauses in Vietnamese legal framework that can 
</p>
<p>be interpreted to restrict or forbid the exercise of freedom of religion or belief; and that 
</p>
<p>Articles 87, 88 and 258 of the Viet Nam Penal Code (VPC) are vague and often applied </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>arbitrarily to punish people who are accused of violating the restrictions set out in 
</p>
<p>regulations on freedom of religion or belief. These assessments of the SR are inaccurate. 
</p>
<p> The State of Viet Nam sees belief or religion as a legitimate need of human being 
</p>
<p>and pursues the consistent policy to respect and create favorable conditions for all Viet 
</p>
<p>Namese people to practice the freedom of belief or religion. The State also attaches 
</p>
<p>importance to the policy of promoting unity and harmony among religions and ensuring 
</p>
<p>equality and non-discrimination. This was enshrined in the first Constitution of Viet Nam in 
</p>
<p>1946 (even before it was mentioned in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights) 
</p>
<p>and has been reflected throughout all Constitutions until the 2013 Constitution as well as in 
</p>
<p>other relevant legal documents under the basic principles as follows: 
</p>
<p>- Everyone shall enjoy freedom of belief and of religion, he can follow any religion 
</p>
<p>or follow none. All religions are equal before the law. 
</p>
<p>- Lawful places of worship, bibles and worshipping objects of beliefs and religions 
</p>
<p>are protected by law. 
</p>
<p>- The State respects the internal affairs of all religions as well as their cultural and 
</p>
<p>moral values. 
</p>
<p>- The State respects and ensures the freedom to practice religion and conduct 
</p>
<p>religious activities in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p>- All acts of discrimination based on religion or belief, forcing citizens to follow or 
</p>
<p>renounce a faith, violation of the freedom of religion or belief; the abuse of the freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief to sabotage peace and social order, instigate violence, hatred, and create 
</p>
<p>division among communities as well as superstitious activities are strictly prohibited 
</p>
<p>The Government of Viet Nam also emphasizes that the 2013 Constitution had a 
</p>
<p>separate chapter on human rights and citizen's rights. This Constitution has been adopted by 
</p>
<p>the National Assembly following wide public consultations with 26 million inputs and 
</p>
<p>comments, reflecting the will and aspiration of the people. In addition, Articles 87, 88 and 
</p>
<p>258 of the VPC contain clear and specific provisions. The National Assembly also 
</p>
<p>approved the VPC based on wide public consultations. 
</p>
<p>  As mentioned above, Viet Nam is moving towards the Law on Belief and Religion 
</p>
<p>based on the following principles: 
</p>
<p>- The international treaties to which that Viet Nam has been a party; 
</p>
<p>- Respect for the freedom of belief or regional of all (in accordance with the 2013 
</p>
<p>Constitution); 
</p>
<p>- The belief or religious practices in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>The Government of Viet Nam again emphasizes that in Viet Nam there were no 
</p>
<p>prisoner of conscience. The cases in which individuals have been prosecuted, tried and 
</p>
<p>sentenced are based on these individuals' violation of the law, not on their own opinion 
</p>
<p>neither religion, and such legal proceedings have been conducted in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>legal procedures and the law.  
</p>
<p> Regarding &#8220;Administrative stipulations on religious or belief activities and practices 
</p>
<p><i>(paragraphs 26 </i>&#8211;<i> 35):  
</i></p>
<p>- Paragraph 26: The draft report said that religious and belief communities are 
</p>
<p>required to register with the Government&#8217;s Committee on Religious Affairs. This is not 
</p>
<p>correct. Religious communities register their activities with different local authorities level 
</p>
<p>according to their size and operating range. For instance, religious grouping (which are not </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>considered as an administrative level of religious organizations, but only gatherings of 
</p>
<p>individuals with religious faith) register their activity with the communal authority.  
</p>
<p> - From paragraphs 27 to 32: The SR raised concern over registration of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief communities and legal status of communities that have yet been recognized as 
</p>
<p>religious organizations. The Government of Viet Nam is of the view that the visit was so 
</p>
<p>short for the SR to study thoroughly the relevant regulations of Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p> The SR used the term &#8220;religious communities&#8221; with no distinction between 
</p>
<p>&#8220;religious organizations&#8221;, &#8220;religious associations&#8221; and &#8220;religious groupings&#8221;. The draft 
</p>
<p>report also failed to take into account the difference between &#8220;religious practice&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;religious activity&#8221;. This has by chance created a distorted picture of Viet Nam&#8217;s legal and 
</p>
<p>administrative stipulations on religion or belief.  
</p>
<p> In reality, the Viet Namese law, particularly Ordinance 21, Decree 92 and Directive 
</p>
<p>01/TTCP of the Prime Minister provided clear distinction between &#8220;religious 
</p>
<p>organizations&#8221;, &#8220;religious associations&#8221; and &#8220;religious groupings&#8221;; and between &#8220;religious 
</p>
<p>activity&#8221; and &#8220;religious practice&#8221;, and also contained clauses on procedures of registration 
</p>
<p>for &#8220;religious practice&#8221; or &#8220;religious activity&#8221; by either &#8220;religious organizations&#8221;, &#8220;religious 
</p>
<p>associations&#8221; or &#8220;religious groupings&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>According to the regulations, religious activities at private houses are not subject to 
</p>
<p>registration. However, when there is a need for grouping to practice mass rituals, pray, 
</p>
<p>expression of religious faith, it is only required that a representative of the group registers 
</p>
<p>with the communal authority in order to ensure public security, safety and order in the 
</p>
<p>vicinity and fire-fighting purpose. Moreover, under Paragraph 1, Article 12 of Decree 92, 
</p>
<p>religious associations, which are formed by religious organizations to serve religious 
</p>
<p>ceremonies, including clarion band, drum band, flower-offering team, choir, funeral service 
</p>
<p>team, ritual music band, children&#8217;s choir and similar groupings shall not be required to 
</p>
<p>register with competent agencies for operation.  
</p>
<p> With regard to the legal status and operation of organizations that have not been 
</p>
<p>recognized as religious organizations, according to Decree 92, these organizations have the 
</p>
<p>right to register for religious practice (which is higher and broader than religious activity 
</p>
<p>and includes preaching, practicing tenets, canon, ceremonies, and organization works of the 
</p>
<p>religion). After registration, these organizations have obtained full rights to conduct 
</p>
<p>religious rituals, preaching, organize congresses, adopt the charter, hold elections for their 
</p>
<p>leaders, organize training courses, renovate religious establishments, and conduct charity 
</p>
<p>works. 
</p>
<p> The SR views that excessive administrative requirements amount to a high burden 
</p>
<p>for the functioning of religious communities. This does not reflect the reality. In fact, 
</p>
<p>administrative procedures relating to religion in Viet Nam have been significantly reformed 
</p>
<p>and simplified to best serve the needs of the people for religious practice. The procedural 
</p>
<p>reforms include the one-stop shop, the deadline for the authorities to reply in writing for 
</p>
<p>registration cases, specify the reasons why if the registration applications are rejected. 
</p>
<p>These are the noteworthy steps forward. 
</p>
<p> Regarding &#8220;legal recourse&#8221; (paragraphs 36 &#8211;<i> 39): 
</i></p>
<p>The SR reports that members of the People&#8217;s Supreme Court were not aware of a 
</p>
<p>single case of infringement of the right to freedom of belief and religion. The Government 
</p>
<p>of Viet Nam stressed that there was a misunderstanding here. At the meeting with the 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Supreme Court on 22 July 2014, the representative of the People&#8217;s Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>informed that the Courts at different levels had handled about 200 cases related to religion 
</p>
<p>and belief in recent years. At paragraph 39, the Special Rapporteur also states that &#8220;a few </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>cases in which petitions filed with higher authorities, including the Prime Minister, have 
</p>
<p>helped to ease conflicts&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>In Viet Nam, the Courts operate independently and only abide by the law during 
</p>
<p>trials. The conduct of legal proceedings is based on the principle of guaranteeing that those 
</p>
<p>who participate in the process can exercise their rights and obligations in a full, fair and 
</p>
<p>equal manner, and that the trials are conducted in a transparent manner where perpetrators 
</p>
<p>should be given penalties corresponding with the severity of their crimes under the law. 
</p>
<p>This spirit is fully enshrined in the Constitution and related legal documents.  
</p>
<p>The issue of complaints and denunciations is subject to clear and concrete provisions 
</p>
<p>of the Law on Complaints and Law on Denunciations, both released in 2011. The oversight 
</p>
<p>of state agencies&#8217; performance in various areas is strengthened and carried out at different 
</p>
<p>levels, including by the National Assembly and mass organizations. Due attention is paid to 
</p>
<p>dealing with citizens&#8217; complaints to ensure that all cases are examined and to prevent 
</p>
<p>wrong decisions. However, it is also critical that the settlement of complaints and 
</p>
<p>denunciations follows due legal process from the grassroots to provincial, central levels 
</p>
<p>with a view to avoid the situation in which complaints and denunciations are filed at 
</p>
<p>irrelevant levels of jurisdiction, resulting in inefficiency and protraction.  
</p>
<p> Regarding &#8220;Negative attitudes toward non<i>-</i>recognized religious communities&#8221; (paragraphs 
</p>
<p><i>40-49): 
</i></p>
<p> The Government of Viet Nam holds that the draft report would be more objective if 
</p>
<p>the word &#8220;negative&#8221; is omitted from the title of section IV.A and the approach of this 
</p>
<p>section is revised in line with that spirit. Accordingly, unverified contents should be 
</p>
<p>removed, including: &#8220;majority interests was invoked with the obvious intention to dismiss 
</p>
<p>claims of minorities or dissenting individuals&#8221;, &#8220;heavy repression&#8221;, &#8220;Government 
</p>
<p>interference&#8221;, &#8220;face pressure to join official organizations&#8221;, among others.  
</p>
<p>The Government of Viet Nam always pursues the policy of non-interference into the 
</p>
<p>internal affairs of religious organizations. Religious organizations, including the Cao Dai 
</p>
<p>Sacerdotal Council of Tay Ninh Holy See stationing in Vinh Long province and the Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam Buddhist Sangha confirmed this fact during their meetings with the SR.  
</p>
<p> The State of Viet Nam always guarantees, facilitates and supports the operation and 
</p>
<p>development of religions through concrete legal regulations and policies. No religion is 
</p>
<p>discriminated against and all religions are equal before the law. As a law-governed State, 
</p>
<p>any law violation in Viet Nam shall be strictly handled and sanctioned. This is totally in 
</p>
<p>conformity with international human rights norms, including the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  
</p>
<p>Besides, in paragraph 46, the SR is requested to replace the term &#8220;Khmer Krom&#8221; by 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Khmer people in the Mekong Delta&#8221; because there is no Khmer Krom ethnicity in Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam. There is only the Khmer ethnic minority. The term &#8220;Krom&#8221; is associated with a 
</p>
<p>separatist group of Khmer people. The Government of Viet Nam would like to take this 
</p>
<p>opportunity to reaffirm that the equality and religious freedom of the ethnic minorities are 
</p>
<p>guaranteed and their religious activities are protected and promoted by the State. As far as 
</p>
<p>the Khmer people are concerned, the authorities at all levels have facilitated the Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>Buddhist Sangha to establish the Academy of Khmer Theravada Buddhism in Can Tho and 
</p>
<p>imported Buddhist texts printed in Khmer language to meet the needs for religious training 
</p>
<p>and practices of the Khmer Theravada communities in Southwestern Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>As far as paragraphs 48 and 49 are concerned, the Government of Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>emphasizes that Cao Dai churches have been recognized by the State as legal entities. 
</p>
<p>However, there is a portion of sub-dignitaries and followers who have conducted opposing 
</p>
<p>activities against the Sacerdotal Council of Cao Dai Tay Ninh Holy See because there are </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>differences in their perceptions of religious tenet, rules and their personal purposes. This is 
</p>
<p>an internal affair of the religious organization. Local authorities in Vinh Long province or 
</p>
<p>other provinces and cities all respect the right to freedom of religion of all Cao Dai groups. 
</p>
<p>Their needs for normal religious practices at home are guaranteed, but religious practices in 
</p>
<p>mass gatherings must be notified and subject to approval by the authorities for public 
</p>
<p>security, safety and order, and fire-fighting purpose.  
</p>
<p> Regarding &#8220;Religious education and trainings&#8221; (Paragraphs 50<i>-52) 
</i></p>
<p>The SR states: &#8220;The Education Law prohibits the preaching of religion in schools 
</p>
<p>and other institutions in Viet Nam&#8221;. Viet Nam is a multi-religious country where all 
</p>
<p>religions are equal and protected by the law. All people have the right to follow a religion 
</p>
<p>or to follow none. Reality has showed that there have always been harmony and peaceful 
</p>
<p>co-existence among religions in Viet Nam, and there has never been religious conflict nor 
</p>
<p>religious war in the history of Viet Nam. For the purpose of harmony and equality among 
</p>
<p>religions, the Education Law as well as other laws prohibit the preaching of religion in 
</p>
<p>schools to guarantee that all students and pupils have the independence and freedom to 
</p>
<p>choose to follow a religion or to follow none. This is popular in many countries in which no 
</p>
<p>religion is chosen as a national religion, and this is absolutely not contrary to the 
</p>
<p>international standards on human rights. 
</p>
<p> Regarding &#8220;Training and appointment of clergy&#8221; (Paragraph 53) </p>
<p>The SR stated that Article 22 of Ordinance 21 with general provisions on the 
</p>
<p>standard of appointed clergies such as strictly abiding by the law, having the spirit of 
</p>
<p>national unity and harmony is too vague and inappropriate and that the State shall not 
</p>
<p>intervene in the internal affairs of religious organizations. The Government of Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>always respects the internal affairs of religious organizations. This standard of appointed 
</p>
<p>clergies is useful in a multi-religious country like Viet Nam, and that is also a general 
</p>
<p>requirement to any citizen for the benefit of peace, stability and development of the 
</p>
<p>country. 
</p>
<p> A number of cases in which monks were defrocked still take place within religious 
</p>
<p>organizations in Viet Nam  as well as overseas due to their violation of the rules of these 
</p>
<p>religious organizations. The Government of Viet Nam is always stick to the principle of 
</p>
<p>non-interference into the internal affair of religious organizations.  
</p>
<p><i>  Regarding &quot;Property and land issues&quot; (Paragraphs 55-58):  
</i></p>
<p> The SR notes: &#8220;the fact that in Viet Nam all lands are managed by the State and no 
</p>
<p>one can own any land creates an additional elements of legal insecurity for communities, 
</p>
<p>including officially registered communities, as the State can take back the land whenever it 
</p>
<p>seems opportune&#8221;, &#8220;the lack of effective legal recourse&#8221;, or &#8220;in the interest of economic 
</p>
<p>development and other modernization projects, some religious communities have lost &#8211; or 
</p>
<p>in danger of losing &#8211; large part of their land, along with places of worship of historical 
</p>
<p>value&#8221;. These assessments does not truly reflect the positive reality of property and land 
</p>
<p>related to religious organizations in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p> Beliefs and religions in Viet Nam have developed rapidly in the past decades, 
</p>
<p>resulting in the increasing demand for land to serve the conduct of belief or religious 
</p>
<p>activities of the people. In this regard, the State of Viet Nam has created favorable 
</p>
<p>conditions and supported these activities in accordance with the law. In particular, on 31 
</p>
<p>December 2008, the Prime Minister issued Directive 1940/CT-TTg on land and housing 
</p>
<p>related to religion. The Directive reaffirms that the State respects and  guarantees the right 
</p>
<p>to conduct religious practices in accordance with the law and the legitimate demands in 
</p>
<p>housing and land for religious purposes of religious organizations and religious followers. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>At the same time, the local authorities are entrusted to develop plans for land use and land 
</p>
<p>allocation for local religious establishments in accordance with the legal procedures and the 
</p>
<p>law, and to notify the religious establishments and followers for implementation. In the 
</p>
<p>legal normative documents on land, the State of Viet Nam clearly identifies that land is 
</p>
<p>State property; the State shall not handle cases in which individuals or organizations 
</p>
<p>reclaim the land allocated and used by the State before 1991; the provision of land for 
</p>
<p>religious establishments and organizations must be handled on the basis of the practical 
</p>
<p>needs, planning and land availability in each local area. 
</p>
<p> In addition, the Land Law 2013 has specific regulations on land for religious 
</p>
<p>facilities (Article 157) and land for belief facilities (Article 158); on the allocation of land 
</p>
<p>without charge for non-agricultural land-use tax for belief and religious facilities (Article 
</p>
<p>54). Article 3 of the Law on non-agricultural land-use tax 2010 regulates the subjects which 
</p>
<p>are not liable to land-use tax, including land used by religious facilities; land used for the 
</p>
<p>building of communal houses, temples, shrines, ancestral worship houses and halls. The 
</p>
<p>Law on Forest Protection and Development regulates the allocation of forest land for rural 
</p>
<p>communities having similar customs, practices, traditions attached to forest in terms of 
</p>
<p>production, livelihood, culture, beliefs; being capable of forest management, having 
</p>
<p>demand and applying for forest land allocation (Article 29). 
</p>
<p> Recently, the authorities at all levels have allocated land of large area for many 
</p>
<p>organizations for religious purposes, such as the provision of 15 hectares of land to build 
</p>
<p>the La Vang pilgrimage center in Quang Tri Province, the allocation of 10,000m2 of land to 
</p>
<p>the DakLak Bishopric, the allocation of 2,000m2 of land to build religious schools for the 
</p>
<p>Christian Missionaries of Viet Nam, etc. 
</p>
<p> Regarding &#8220;religious activities in some special cases&quot; (paragraphs 59<i>-61):  
</i></p>
<p> The Government of Viet Nam continues to create conditions for prisoners to 
</p>
<p>exercise the right to freedom of belief or religion. 
</p>
<p><i>  Regarding the &quot;Report on the violation of religious and belief freedom&quot; (paragraphs 64-
</i></p>
<p><i>79): 
</i></p>
<p> This section does not reflect the reality of practicing the right to freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>or belief in Viet Nam, and contains no specific evidence. The Government of Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>suggests that this entire section be deleted. 
</p>
<p>The fact that draft report has a separate section on violation of religious and belief 
</p>
<p>freedom runs counter to the objective of promoting dialogue and cooperation. These 
</p>
<p>allegations in this section may stem from misunderstanding. Another important reason is 
</p>
<p>that a number of groups and individuals have taken advantage of the role of the SR and the 
</p>
<p>visit to set up and exaggerate many incidents to cause unnecessary misunderstanding and 
</p>
<p>directly undermine the cooperation between the SR and Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>Besides, in this section, many issues were clarified and explained by relevant 
</p>
<p>ministries and agencies of Viet Nam through exchanges with the SR, which were not 
</p>
<p>reflected in the draft report. This section also refers to a number of incidents occurring in 
</p>
<p>places that the Special Rapporteur did not have the opportunity to visit within the 
</p>
<p>framework of this visit.  
</p>
<p><i>  Paragraph 64 mentions Unit PA41, which in reality does not exist in any Vietnamese 
</i></p>
<p><i>agencies at any level. 
</i></p>
<p>Paragraph 69 refers to the Ede ethnic minority in the Central Highlands while the SR 
</p>
<p>had cancelled the visit to the Central Highlands. In fact, the right to freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief is ensured in the Central Highlands and this was recognized by the international </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>community. There are approximately 448,000 Protestants, the majority of whom are ethnic 
</p>
<p>minority. Around 95% of the followers are practicing their religions and beliefs in 201 
</p>
<p>registered congregations and 1331 registered groupings. This accounts for 95% followers. 
</p>
<p>Approximately 30,000 bilingual bibles (in Viet Namese-Banar, Viet Namese-Ede, and Viet 
</p>
<p>Namese-Jrai languages) have been circulated to meet the need for religious or belief 
</p>
<p>practicing of ethnic minority followers. 
</p>
<p>Paragraph 69 also mentions the &#8220;harsh persecution of the followers of &#8220;Montagnard&#8221; 
</p>
<p>churches such as the Ede ethnic minority&#8221;. This information is incorrect. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is requested not to use the term &#8220;Montagnard&#8221; as this term was only used to 
</p>
<p>serve the policy of &#8220;dividing for ruling&#8221; during the colonial period, and there is no 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Montagnard&#8221; ethnicity in the list of 54 ethnic groups in Viet Nam.  
</p>
<p>Paragraph 71 mentions the H&#8217;mong people who practice the so-called Duong Van 
</p>
<p>Minh theory. In fact, Duong Van Minh&#8217;s organization has been trying to mobilize the 
</p>
<p>H&#8217;mongs to convert from their traditional belief towards the goal of establishing the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmong Kingdom&#8221;. This organization has threatened and prevented children from going to 
</p>
<p>school, incited and prevented the local people and students from taking assistance from the 
</p>
<p>authorities, organizations and associations; conducted activities aiming at undermining 
</p>
<p>public order, dividing the solidarity among ethnic groups. These activities have clearly 
</p>
<p>violated the law. 
</p>
<p> Paragraph 72 states that the Cham temple towers have been turned into touristic 
</p>
<p>spots. In fact, using historical and cultural sites for tourism development is a legitimate 
</p>
<p>demand to serve the socio-economic development and is a normal practice in many 
</p>
<p>countries. Furthermore, representatives of religious communities are participating in the 
</p>
<p>management of those heritage sites, hence the interest of religious communities are secured. 
</p>
<p>The fact that the Cham temple towers become touristic spots is endorsed by the dignitaries 
</p>
<p>and followers in the Cham community as this would help introduce the beauty of Cham 
</p>
<p>culture and people. 
</p>
<p>Paragraph 72 also mentions some land issues relating to the Chams, especially the 
</p>
<p>cemeteries and locking up of mosques during the Ramadan. Those were incorrect pieces of 
</p>
<p>information. In fact, over the past years, the local authorities have pursued the policy of 
</p>
<p>providing incentives to the local people to increase production, allocating more production 
</p>
<p>land for job creation and improvement of the ethnic minority living standards. As for the 
</p>
<p>old Cham cemeteries which are no longer used to bury dead people, the local authorities 
</p>
<p>have made refurbishments such as building protecting fences, building roads to those 
</p>
<p>cemeteries in order to facilitate the dignitaries and followers in practicing traditional rituals 
</p>
<p>there. The allegation &#8220;due to resistance of the communities to relocate the cemeteries, all 
</p>
<p>mosques were allegedly locked up during the Ramadan and would only be accessible if 
</p>
<p>they agreed to the relocation plan&#8221; is incorrect. In fact, the local authorities at all levels 
</p>
<p>have been creating the most favorable conditions for dignitaries and followers to practice 
</p>
<p>their religions. Opening or locking up churches or mosques is the business of religious 
</p>
<p>organizations. The authorities never interfere in this business nor use the relocation of 
</p>
<p>cemeteries to put pressure on dignitaries and followers. The cause of the mosques being 
</p>
<p>locked up as mentioned by the SR  was in essence  the protracted internal disputes among 
</p>
<p>the dignitaries and followers. Along with that was the misconduct of the Hakim who failed 
</p>
<p>to observe the teachings and rules of Bani Islam, thus resulting in disputes and oppositions 
</p>
<p>among the dignitaries and followers, some of whom even had undertakings that threatened 
</p>
<p>the life and well-being of others. Therefore, at the request of the provincial Council of Bani 
</p>
<p>Hakims and to protect the life of the people, the local authorities had to suspend the 
</p>
<p>operation of the mosques in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p> Therefore, the Government of Viet Nam believes that the conclusions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the SR are inaccurate and irrelevant since they are based on biased </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>information as explained above. At the same time, these conclusions and recommendations 
</p>
<p>by the SR also run counter to the goal of promoting dialogue and cooperation in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b>  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>12. <b>The Government of Viet Nam reaffirms its goodwill and readiness to exchange 
</b></p>
<p><b>views and dialogue with the Special Procedures in the spirit of mutual respect and 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding, the United Nations Charter, Resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council. The Government of Viet Nam believes that dialogue and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>are only truly effective and possible if all stakeholders show their sincerity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>willingness. 
</b></p>
<p>13. <b>The Government of Viet Nam applauds some contents in the draft report. 
</b></p>
<p>However, Viet Nam&#8217;s efforts and achievements in realization of the right to freedom

</b></p>
<p><b>were widely recognized by the international community, especially the diplomatic

</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Viet Nam regrets that there are inaccurate and biased information 
</b></p>
<p><b>and assessments with inappropriate recommendations and conclusions in the draft 
</b></p>
<p><b>report, which therefore do not contribute to promoting dialogue and cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Given the fact that a short visit was not enough for the SR to have an overall and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accurate picture of the realization of the right to freedom of belief or region in Viet 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nam, the Government of Viet Nam would like to provide the above-mentioned

</b></p>
<p><b>Nam with the Special Rapporteur in particular and the United Nations Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council mechanisms in general.

<p>14. <b>The Government of Viet Nam, being a responsible country, is willing to
