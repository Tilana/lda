adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate

United Kingdom (29 August- 11 September 2013)  
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. Since 2010 the Coalition Government has made significant progress in housing.  
Notable achievements so far include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Nearly 420,000 homes1 have been delivered since April 2010.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The latest official figures show that new housing construction orders have risen to 
the highest level since 20072. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; House building starts in the year to December 2013 are 23 per cent higher than the 
same period last year.3 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Significant investment in building new homes for private rent such as through the 
&#163;10 billion Housing Guarantees Scheme and the &#163;1 billion Build to Rent Fund. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Under the previous government, the number of social homes fell by 420,0004.  This 
Government has already delivered over 170,000 affordable homes over the last three 
years5. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Further investment of &#163;23 billion to help ensure another 165,000 new affordable 
homes are started between 2015 and 2018. This will be the fastest annual rate of 
building for over 20 years. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living undertook an official visit to the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland from 29 August to 11 September 2013.  At the time of the 
UNSR&#8217;s visit the government expressed strong concerns about inaccuracies in her interim 
report.   
</p>
<p>3. The government believes that the UNSR&#8217;s final report also contains a number of 
inaccuracies and omissions.  For example, the report refers to &#8216;increasing unemployment&#8217; 
yet the number of unemployed people aged 16 or over has fallen by 161,000 (6.5%) over 
the year to December 2013 from 2.5 million to 2.34 million.6The UNSR&#8217;s 
recommendations are therefore not sound.

<p>4. Also the UNSR&#8217;s report does not recognise the approach we are taking to encourage 
a localist approach towards housing development, by empowering local authorities and 
communities to influence what is built and where.   
</p>
<p>5. Our response to some of the key areas in the report is set out below. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Reforming the welfare system 
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b><i>6. The UNSR&#8217;s report recommends the government should: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Assess and evaluate the impact of the welfare reform in relation to the right to 
adequate housing of the most vulnerable individuals and groups, in light of existing 
data and evidence; consider whether particular measures are having a 
disproportionate impact on specific groups; assess whether the overall costs of the 
implementation of some reforms might outweigh the savings intended, thereby 
violating the State&#8217;s obligation to use the maximum of available resources; and 
consider alternative avenues to achieve similar objectives without affecting the 
poorest or most vulnerable 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Immediately suspend the removal of the spare-room subsidy and fully re-evaluate in 
light of the evidence of its negative impacts on the right to adequate housing and 
general well-being of many vulnerable individuals and households 
</i></p>
<p>7. The UNSR makes a number of comments relating to the impact of our welfare 
reforms on housing but does not recognise the full range of actions the government is 
already taking to ensure that the impact of these policies on a wide range of individuals is 
carefully considered. 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i> Housing benefit 
</i>8. In 2010, as part of our welfare reforms, the government took steps to manage 
housing benefit expenditure. Between 2000 and 2010 expenditure had almost doubled in 
cash terms, reaching &#163;21 billion. Unreformed, by 2014-15, Housing Benefit would have 
cost over &#163;25 billion (in cash terms). By 2014-15 the reforms will save over &#163;2 billion 
annually. 
</p>
<p>9. To help to manage expenditure we are putting limits on the amount of housing 
benefit that people in the private and social rented sector are entitled to. 
</p>
<p>10. This will encourage people, based on their household size, to make sensible 
decisions about what they can reasonably afford as well as improve work incentives. 
</p>
<p>11. Even after these reforms housing benefit will be able to meet rents on &#163;21,000 a 
year. 
</p>
<p><b>  </b><i>Removal of the spare room subsidy 
</i>12. The removal of the spare room subsidy affects working age social sector tenants 
who have all, or part of, their rent met by housing benefit, and live in accommodation 
which is larger than their needs. 
</p>
<p>13. This policy is about fairness; we are not forcing people to move but social sector 
tenants must make the same choices about affordability as those in the private rented sector 
already do; it is about making better use of social sector housing stock.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/54/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>14. Another benefit of this policy is that it will encourage greater mobility within the 
social sector.  We expect that as social sector tenants begin to take active decisions about 
what they need and can afford, larger properties will become available on a more frequent 
basis and so help the hundreds of thousands of families currently living in overcrowded 
conditions within both the private and social rented sectors. This group are often 
conveniently overlooked by opponents of this policy but with estimates suggesting that 
there are 249,0007 overcrowded households, and 1.7 million households on social housing 
waiting lists in England alone,8 something had to be done. At the same time there are 1.5 
million spare bedrooms, in working age households in the social rented sector, across Great 
Britain as a whole, with 820,000 of these paid for by Housing Benefit9. 
</p>
<p>15. We are implementing this policy fully aware that some households require 
additional support in adjusting to it. 
</p><p>16. For people needing overnight care: We have allowed an additional bedroom for 
claimants and their partners where one or both require regular overnight care. 
</p>
<p>17. For children with a disability who are unable to share: An extra room is allowed for 
a disabled child in receipt of the middle or higher rate care component of the Disability 
Living Allowance, where the nature of their disabilities mean that they would disturb the 
sleep of the child they are normally expected to share with i.e. they need constant overnight 
care and attention, or where there is a threat of violence i.e. the disabled child may have a 
cognitive impairment which affects the safety of the other child. 
</p>
<p>18. For families who foster or have children in the armed forces: in recognition of their 
role in the community and further afield, we have also allowed an additional room for 
approved foster carers, and for parents of adult children in the armed forces (or reservists) 
who normally live with them but are deployed on operations. 
</p>
<p>19. For people who need help to make the transition: We have trebled the support 
available with a total of &#163;180 million available in Discretionary Housing Payment this year 
(2013/14); and &#163;165 million for next year (2014/15). This will enable local authorities to 
provide additional support to households in most need and those requiring extra time to find 
suitable alternative accommodation, and so they can provide longer term support to 
vulnerable households. 
</p>
<p>20. For people who will need support longer term: &#163;25 million of the Discretionary 
Housing Payment funding for 2013/14 is targeted specifically at disabled people who live 
in significantly adapted accommodation, and where it would be more costly for them to 
relocate while still remaining within their community and close to support. The amount of 
Discretionary Housing Payment funding available for the removal of the spare room 
subsidy will not be reduced for the next two years, which will help local authorities to make 
longer term awards to such households. 
</p>
<p>21. Furthermore in July 2013, the Divisional Court ruled that the provision of extra 
Discretionary Housing Payment funding is a proportionate approach to people affected by 
this policy and that the department had fulfilled its equality duties to disabled people who 
are affected by the policy.

</b></p>
<p><b>  </b><i>Impact assessments and evaluation 
</i></p>
<p>22. In advance of introducing policies the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) 
undertakes impact assessments; these include examining the effects of the proposed 
changes on various key equality criteria such as age, gender and disability. These impact 
assessments are published and scrutinised during, and updated after, each stage of the 
legislative process. DWP also reviews estimates of costs and savings generated from policy 
changes as part of the process around key fiscal events such as the annual Budget and 
Chancellors' Autumn Statement; these estimates are subject to scrutiny and challenge by the 
independent Office for Budgetary Responsibility before they can be included in these 
events.   
</p>
<p>23. The government carefully monitors and reviews the implementation of all its 
programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Supporting people to buy their own home 
</b><i>24. The UNSR&#8217;s report recommends that the Government should &#8216;put in place targeted 
measures to increase the supply of housing in the private market for those individuals and 
households who face unaffordable alternatives, especially the young and those in the 
middle and lower ends of the spectrum.&#8217; 
</i>25. The government is committed to encouraging a strong and stable housing market.  
The latest figures show that the number of  first-time buyers is at a five-year high 10,  the 
number of repossessions are at their lowest since 200711 and that UK house price rises are 
below inflation rises in many places.12 
</p>
<p>26. However, transactions remain 40 per cent below pre-crunch levels in England13 and 
we have introduced a range of initiatives to help homebuyers to purchase a new home. 
</p>
<p>27. Over 22,000 families have already reserved a new-build home under the Help to 
Buy - Equity Loan scheme and developers are responding to this demand by increasing 
their output of new-build homes. 
</p>
<p>28. A further 6,000 homebuyers have applied for mortgages under the Help to Buy - 
Mortgage Guarantee scheme14. The government has ensured that there are robust controls 
in place to review the impact of these schemes on the housing market and to make any 
changes if necessary. 
</p>
<p>29. The government also remains committed to enabling social tenants to purchase their 
homes through Right to Buy.  So far this has helped nearly 2 million households to realise 
their aspirations to own their homes with over 13,400 sales having been achieved under our 
new re-invigorated scheme15.  In addition, under this scheme, every additional home sold 
will be replaced by a new home for affordable rent nationally.

<p><b> IV. Improving the private rented sector 
</b></p>
<p><i>30. The UNSR&#8217;s report recommends that the government should &#8216;Increase regulation 
and enhance information and accountability in relation to the private rented sector; adopt 
regulatory tenancy protections, including minimum length of contracts, restraints on rent 
increases and strict limits on eviction; encourage the use of standardized human rights-
compliant rental contracts; enhance mechanisms of registration of landlords and letting 
agents, and establish clear accountability mechanisms to eliminate discrimination in the 
private rented sector&#8217; 
</i></p>
<p>31. The government is clear that increasing the burden of regulation and making 
significant changes to the legislative underpinnings of the private rented sector are not the 
way to improve conditions for the growing number of people living in privately rented 
homes.  The government&#8217;s position is supported by recognised experts in the sector such as 
Professor Michael Ball (Henley Business School, University of Reading) and the findings 
of Sir Adrian Montague&#8217;s review of the private rented sector. 
</p>
<p>32. The private rented sector now accounts for 17 per cent of housing16.  Prior to the 
Housing Act 1988, the private rental market was in long-term decline in England, having 
dropped to just 9 per cent of the housing market in 1988. A return to such low levels in the 
supply of private rented housing would see rent levels, for those tenants who were able to 
find a home to live in, rise steeply and would hurt hard-working tenants. Prior to 1988, 
regulated rents and lifetime tenancies had meant that being a landlord was simply not 
commercially viable for many property owners and investors. By enabling landlords to 
charge market rents and introducing assured shorthold tenancies, the 1988 Act arrested this 
decline. Consequently, regulatory approaches such as rent control have been discredited 
and ruled out by successive administrations.  The House of Commons&#8217; Select Committee 
gathered evidence on the private rented sector and published recommendations in July 
</p><p>2013. The Committee, having considered all of the evidence before it, found itself to be in 
full agreement with the government that additional regulation on rent levels and security of 
tenure should be avoided. 
</p>
<p>33. The rapid growth of the sector has been accompanied by improvements in the 
quality of rented accommodation, and satisfaction levels compare well to other tenures.  
Over 80 per cent of private tenants are very or fairly satisfied with their accommodation17.   
</p>
<p>34. Nonetheless, the government recognises the importance of the private rented sector 
and is keen to encourage further growth through the supply of new high quality large scale 
development for private rent.  Where abuses by landlords are taking place, then these need 
to be tackled, using the ample powers already available to local authorities.  And the 
government is taking action to ensure that landlords and tenants are better informed of their 
rights and responsibilities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Regulatory tenancy protections and minimum length of contracts 
</b></p>
<p>35. Whilst assured shorthold tenancies may have a fixed period of as little as six 
months, most tenancies in practice last for much longer - the median length of time that 
respondents to the English Housing Survey had been living in their accommodation is two

</b></p>
<p>years18.  When tenancies do eventually come to an end, this is at the instigation either of the 
tenant or by mutual agreement in over 90 per cent of cases.  Only 9 per cent of tenants 
move because they are asked to leave by the landlord19 
</p>
<p>36. Assured shorthold tenancies offer tenants a level of security even in the small 
minority of cases where the landlord wants the tenant to leave.  So long as the tenant pays 
the rent and meets his obligations, a landlord cannot seek possession of the property 
through the courts during a fixed period of at least six months.  Beyond the fixed period, the 
landlord must give at least two months&#8217; notice of wishing to take possession.  Once the 
landlord gives notice, he cannot evict without obtaining a possession order from the court.  
If the landlord wishes to seek possession for &#8216;grounds&#8217; (such as non-payment of rent), then 
he needs to go to court to seek possession, and the courts have discretion available to them, 
depending on the circumstances. 
</p>
<p>37. The processes by which an occupier of a property is evicted are governed by the 
Housing Act 1988 and the Protection from Eviction Act 1977.  It is an offence to 
unlawfully evict or harass the residential occupier of a property.  In October 2013, the 
government announced it would produce extra guidance for local councils on how to 
protect tenants from illegal eviction.  The government is also considering how to ensure 
that tenants do not face the threat of eviction because they have asked the landlord to rectify 
a fault in the property or have asked the council to investigate. 
</p>
<p>38. Many tenants in the private rented sector value the flexibility that this 
accommodation provides and would oppose any change which would force them to stay in 
a property for longer than they would want.  Nonetheless, the government recognises that, 
as a growing range of families live in the private rented sector, more tenants may want the 
stability afforded by longer term tenancies.  There is nothing to stop landlords and tenants 
agreeing to longer tenancies already.  However, a recent academic report commissioned by 
the Residential Landlords Association shows how some of the most vulnerable groups 
would be amongst the greatest losers if mandatory fixed-term contracts were introduced20. 
</p>
<p>39. The government is actively encouraging investment in new-build privately rented 
property by institutional investors.  As pioneering developments such as East Village and 
Stratford Halo in east London are showing, this will lead to greater availability of long-term 
tenancies, from investors who are looking for a stable long-term income stream.  
Furthermore, recognising that some people would welcome a standardised contract, the 
government is preparing a model tenancy agreement that will be available for landlords and 
tenants to use (although they will not be required to use it) as the basis for longer family-
friendly tenancies, where that is what they choose.  The government is working with 
mortgage lenders to overcome the restrictions on longer term tenancies that are included in 
most mortgage agreements. 
</p>
<p>40. The government has consulted on a draft Tenants&#8217; Charter, which will be used to 
ensure that tenants and landlords are better informed of their rights and responsibilities.  
This will make clear that longer tenancies can be considered, and sign-post where to 
complain if landlords do not fulfil their responsibilities.

 Why governments should not enforce long-term contracts in the UK&#8217;s private rented sector - 
</p>
<p>Professor Michael Ball, October 2013. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/54/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Rent increases 
</b></p>
<p>41. Levels of private rent are actually declining in real terms and rose by only 1.0 per 
cent in England in the 12 months to December 201321 compared to inflation of 2 per cent as 
of December22.  Even in London, where pressures on privately rented accommodation are 
greatest, private rents are only increasing at 1.6 per cent.  The number of tenants in severe 
rental arrears has fallen sharply - 26 per cent fewer households were in severe arrears in the 
final quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 201223.  
</p>
<p>42. Whilst the government is not in favour of a new system of rent controls, 
mechanisms already exist for tenants to challenge excessive rent increases via the First Tier 
Tribunal (Property). 
</p><p>43. However, the best way of keeping the level of rent increases at a moderate level is to 
boost the supply of housing to the sector. The government has been encouraging investment 
in building new homes for rent in a number of ways: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It set up a Private Rented Sector Taskforce, which has so far identified over  30 
organisations, with aspirations to invest over &#163;10 billion in the private  rented sector; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It has established Housing Guarantees schemes totalling &#163;10 billion, of which &#163;3.5 
billion is for affordable housing and &#163;3.5 billion for the private rented  sector, with 
&#163;3 billion in reserve for either scheme. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It has established a Build to Rent Fund totalling &#163;1 billion.  Already, two contracts 
from the first round of bids have been signed (in Southampton and  Manchester) 
and more are in the pipeline. Furthermore, 126 bids were received under a second 
round, seeking total funding of approximately &#163;2.8 billion. 
</p>
<p><b>  Rogue landlords, letting agents, discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>44. The government recognises that there is a small minority of private landlords who 
fail to meet their basic obligations to their tenants, accommodating them in overcrowded 
and unsafe accommodation.  Local authorities have an extensive range of powers, mainly 
under the Housing Act 2004, to deal with these rogue landlords.  They have extensive 
enforcement powers against properties that are in an unsafe condition, and have the 
discretion to introduce licensing regimes in areas where the private rented sector is causing 
difficulties of low demand or anti-social behaviour. 
</p>
<p>45. The government has provided additional funding to supplement local authorities&#8217; 
resources in tackling rogue landlords.  &#163;4.1 million was allocated to 23 local authorities in 
December 2013 to tackle rogue landlords.  This follows an earlier allocation of &#163;2.6 million 
to crack down on landlords who force tenants into unsuitable properties, known as &#8216;beds in 
sheds&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>46. The government has announced a review of the system for ensuring that privately 
rented homes are safe and healthy and is currently consulting interested organisations 
including local authorities, landlord associations, housing charities, tenant groups and 
professional bodies.  It is anticipated that the outcome of the review will be announced in 
the summer.  Consideration is being given to requiring landlords to repay rent where a 
property is found to have serious hazards.

<p>47. The government is aware that a minority of letting agents offer a poor service to 
landlords and tenants, charging fees that are not always transparent.  It is introducing 
legislation to require all letting and property management agents to become members of an 
approved redress scheme, so that consumers can complain and seek compensation if agents&#8217; 
fees are not transparent.  These requirements will come into force from October 2014.  A 
new code of practice will be published, setting standards for the management of property in 
the private rented sector.  It is anticipated that this will eventually be given a statutory basis, 
to provide greater confidence for tenants in what they can expect. 
</p>
<p>48. On the subject of discrimination, the government is aware of allegations that some 
letting agents are willing to act unlawfully in accepting instructions from clients to 
discriminate against certain races in letting out properties.  This is currently being explored 
by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, and the government looks forward to the 
EHRC&#8217;s findings.  The government will also issue a code of practice on discrimination as 
part of an introduction of new requirements on landlords to check the migration status of 
new tenants.

<p><i>49. The UNSR&#8217;s report recommends that the government should &#8216;extend and expand 
grants and subsidies for social housing (for local councils and housing associations), as 
these have been essential in responding to the housing need of the most vulnerable. More 
resources and allocations are needed in this area to ensure that new developments address 
the specific needs of those individuals and households, and that a variety of tenure forms 
are encouraged, promoted and protected. Special attention must be given to the situation of 
low-income people and households, especially children&#8217; 
</i></p>
<p>50. Our approach is to significantly expand the provision of affordable homes by 
increasing the contribution from private investment whilst empowering local authorities to 
play a strong role in assessing what is needed in their local area.   
</p>
<p>51. In June 2013, the Government underlined its long term commitment to affordable 
housing, by providing &#163;3.3 billion of public money which, alongside around &#163;20 billion of 
private investment, to support the delivery of 165,000 additional affordable homes from 
April 2015.  This builds on the already strong track record of this Government, with over 
170,000 affordable homes delivered over the last three years24. 
</p>
<p>52. The &#163;3.3 billion of government funding up to 2018, alongside long term rent 
certainty up to 2025, provides the investment framework that providers need to make 
longer term building plans.  There is no reduction compared to the current programme, 
which provided &#163;4.5 billion over 4 years.  The competition for grant will drive efficiencies 
and secure the maximum amount of private finance.  
</p>
<p>53. Affordable Rent, introduced in 2011, allows the government to deliver more homes 
for every pound of upfront government investment, so more people benefit from subsidised 
housing - with lower rents and more security - than if they were in the private rented sector.  
Housing Benefit still covers the full rent for tenants who cannot afford to pay, where they 
are not under occupying.

</p>
<p>54. Rent levels in the Affordable Homes Programme are at a range of levels up to 80% 
of local market rents, to ensure fit with local circumstances, with, for example, average 
affordable rents of 65% in London. 
</p>
<p>55. This government has also introduced a more flexible approach to social tenancies to 
enable tenancies to be matched more closely to local needs.  Councils and housing 
associations can now offer shorter fixed term tenancies (usually of at least five years) as 
well as &#8216;lifetime&#8217; tenancies to new tenants where that makes more sense. Those who were 
tenants at 1 April 2012 will see no changes to their rights to lifetime tenancy. 
</p>
<p>56. As well as building more new affordable homes, the government is also continuing 
to invest significantly in improving the quality of the existing social housing stock.  
</p>
<p>57. Over &#163;2 billion is being invested for 2011-15 to support local authorities and 
housing associations in bringing homes up to the Decent Homes standard and a further 
&#163;160 million has been committed for 2015-16.  
</p>
<p>58. The proportion of council homes which do not meet the standard has fallen to 11% 
and we expect this to reduce further25.  Nearly 99% of the social rented stock of housing 
associations now meets the Decent Homes Standard. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Supporting Gypsy and Traveller Communities 
</b><i>59. The UNSR&#8217;s report recommends that the government should &#8216;strengthen efforts to 
address stigma and discrimination for the Gypsy and Traveller communities in relation to 
the wider spectrum of rights, starting with the recognition that cultural adequacy in 
housing is a pillar for inclusion, and that legislation and policy are not enough to overcome 
local obstacles.&#8217; 
</i></p>
<p>60. Improving social mobility is a principal goal of the government&#8217;s social policy. We 
are determined to give everyone the ability and aspiration to prosper, breaking down 
barriers to social mobility. Across government we are very concerned that Gypsies and 
Travellers experience some of the worst outcomes of any group across a range of social 
indicators and in November 2010, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local 
Government brought together ministers from key government departments to look at ways 
to reduce and tackle these inequalities.  
</p>
<p>61. In April 2012 the Ministerial Working Group published a progress report setting out 
28 commitments from across government. These include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Piloting a 'virtual headteacher' who will champion the interests of Gypsy, Roma and 
Traveller pupils across their local authority and respond to issues of low attainment 
and attendance 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promoting improved health outcomes for Gypsies and Travellers within the new 
structures of the National Health Service 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Improving knowledge of how Gypsies and Travellers engage with employment 
services 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Preventing hate crime, increasing reporting of incidents and challenging the attitudes 
that underpin it 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring access to appropriate rehabilitation activities in prison and on probation. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>62. We are reviewing progress on meeting these commitments and will publish a further 
progress report in due course. 
</p>
<p>63. In terms of providing authorised sites, we believe that local authorities are best 
placed to assess and plan for what is needed in their local areas and our national planning 
policy requires them to do that, as they would for a settled community.  Seventy five per 
cent of local planning authorities now have a Local Plan at the publication stage or beyond. 
</p>
<p>64. To encourage the provision of new sites the government has secured a &#163;60 million 
Traveller Pitch Fund to help local authorities and other registered providers build traveller 
sites.  The programme is currently forecast to deliver around 600 new and 400 refurbished 
pitches by 2015.  
</p>
<p>65. Local authorities also have a financial incentive to provide sites under the New 
Homes Bonus. In addition, the government has funded the Local Government Association 
to deliver courses for elected councillors on their leadership role around traveller site 
provision and almost 30 sessions have been delivered to around 900 people.   
</p>
<p>66. In April 2011 we brought into force section 318 of the Housing and Regeneration 
Act 2008 which applies the Mobile Homes Act 1983 to traveller sites owned by local 
authorities. This means that residents of these sites now have greater protection against 
eviction, and other rights and responsibilities that already applied to residents of other 
residential mobile sites. 
</p>
<p>67. We remain concerned about unauthorised sites and the disruption and expense they 
can cause for local communities. Too often, local authorities and landowners feel powerless 
to stop unauthorised encampments and development but in fact there are extensive powers 
available to deal with them. The government has reviewed those powers and recently sent 
all council leaders updated guidance, reminding them to act swiftly and setting out the 
strong powers councils and landowners have to remove illegal and unauthorised sites on 
both public and private land. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Preventing and tackling homelessness 
</b></p>
<p><i>68. The UNSR&#8217;s report recommends the government should &#8216;promote and protect the 
right to adequate housing without discrimination on any grounds; in particular, refrain 
from establishing mechanisms that can result in indirect discrimination against migrants or 
Roma in access to adequate housing.&#8217; 
</i></p>
<p>69. The government is committed to preventing and tackling homelessness and has 
retained a strong safety net underpinned by legislation that protects vulnerable people.  
Councils have a legal duty to house families and vulnerable people who are unintentionally 
homeless and in priority need.   
</p>
<p>70. The government has made available nearly &#163;1 billion over the current spending 
round to prevent and tackle homelessness.  The most recent statistics show a 4 per cent drop 
in homelessness acceptances across England compared with same quarter last year26 and 
homelessness is lower now than in 27 of last 30 years.27 Repossessions fell to 33,900 in 
201228, the lowest annual total since 2007.

</p>
<p>71. We also remain committed to tackling roughsleeping and are supporting the wider 
roll out of a scheme which started in London, &#8216;No Second Night Out&#8217;, which helps get 
rough sleepers off the streets quickly.  We are also investing in hostels for rough sleepers, 
with &#163;42.5 million being spent nationally for 1,500 new and refurbished bed spaces. 
</p>
<p>72. The government believes that migrants who come to the UK should be well prepared 
before they arrive and to help promote this message we are supporting a campaign &#8216;Before 
You Go&#8217; that aims to provide information to migrant workers from Eastern Europe. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Building more homes through increasing land availability 
</b></p>
<p><i>73. The UNSR&#8217;s report recommends that the government should: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Ensure that current measures to release public land to tackle lack of availability of 
housing favour social and affordable housing, including through local councils, 
housing associations, cooperatives and community land trusts; 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>Consider the inclusion in planning and land management systems of strict 
conditions for immediate development of land with planning permits, &#8220;build-or-
lose&#8221; safeguards and priority for affordable housing&#8217; 
</i></p>
<p>74. Local authorities are well placed through their planning role to influence the housing 
development and land supply in their local area.  Our national planning policies require 
local authorities to determine locally what is needed in terms of housing, including 
affordable housing, and to identify and maintain a five year supply of land that is suitable 
for development. 
</p>
<p>75. To support them we are releasing land for housing development by supporting the 
development of large housing sites and releasing public sector land. 
</p>
<p>76. To support the development of large housing sites: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The government has made &#163;474 million available through the local infrastructure 
investment to unlock development on stalled housing sites and commercial 
developments.   
</p>
<p>&#8226; We have already invested &#163;76.7 million capital and nearly &#163;6 million of capacity 
funding to enable 11 large-scale, locally supported housing schemes which will help 
unlock 69,000 new homes. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; We are also working to finalise investment deals on a further 10 stalled schemes, to 
deliver up to 35,000 more homes.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In addition, we recently announced a &#163;1 billion recoverable capital investment over 
6 years, to 2019-20 to fund the infrastructure needed to release large scale sites in 
areas of high housing demand.  We expect this to support delivery of around 
250,000 new homes. 
</p>
<p>77. To release public sector land the government has identified land with capacity for 
over 100,000 homes that we are aiming to release by March 2015.  At the end of December 
2013 we had released enough land to build 68,000 homes.   </p>
<p>78. We are also helping to create the right conditions for growth by increasing the 
incentives for developers to start their housing schemes on site before planning permission 
expires, which is usually after three years.  To achieve this, in September 2013, we 
withdrew the temporary measure (introduced by the previous Administration) that allowed 
developers to roll forward their planning permissions. The expiration of planning </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/54/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>permissions after a certain period of time is a well established feature of the planning 
system and this is the right time to reinstate this. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Devolved administrations 
</b></p>
<p><i>79. The UNSR&#8217;s report recommends that in Northern Ireland the government should 
&#8216;put in place additional efforts to address challenges to overcome persistent inequalities in 
housing in North Belfast. For this purpose, active, free and meaningful participation of all 
in decisions made about housing should be promoted, including in relation to the collection 
of official data, that should be disaggregated, open and accessible to all&#8217; 
</i>80. The UNSR make various references to the housing situation in Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland.  As housing is a matter for the devolved administrations, it is not 
appropriate for the UK government to respond to these points.
