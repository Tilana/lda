<p><b>  Report of the independent expert on the situation of human 
rights in Mali, Suliman Baldo 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/18, the present report gives an 
account of the independent expert&#8217;s first visit to Mali from 20 October to 3 November 
2013. Covering the period from 1 July to 30 December 2013, it examines the political and 
security situation as well as the institutional reforms undertaken by Mali since the end of 
the severe crisis triggered in January 2012 by the occupation of the north of the country by 
armed groups and the return to constitutional order. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert also reports on human rights violations in the country, 
including summary executions, enforced disappearances, rapes, looting, arbitrary arrests 
and detentions, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment perpetrated by the 
Malian armed forces and armed groups in the country. 
</p>
<p> Despite the complex causes of the conflict between the Government and the armed 
groups of the north and the mistrust arising from a number of historical episodes of the 
conflict, the protagonists have demonstrated the political will to find lasting solutions to the 
multidimensional crisis that has shaken Mali. The Malian stakeholders must persevere in 
seeking negotiated solutions to their internal problems of governance while urging their 
neighbours in the Sahel and in the Arab Maghreb as well as the international community to 
take seriously the problems of transnational crime and terrorism that threaten to destabilize 
both Mali and the States of the region. 
</p>
<p> The recent crisis has revealed the underlying causes that almost led to the collapse 
of the State: years of deteriorating public institutions, including those that govern the rule 
of law, which allowed corruption to become generalized and impunity to take root. In 
addition to judicial prosecution of the perpetrators of the most serious crimes and abuse 
committed in the course of the last crisis, consolidation of peace in Mali will require 
reforms of the justice and security sectors, efforts to combat the endemic corruption of civil 
servants brought about by international trafficking and the criminalization of the economy 
of the north, as well as other institutional reforms.

</p>
<p> From the point of view of security, the international military campaign and the 
Malian armed forces have succeeded in dispersing the armed groups and jihadis, but not in 
eliminating them entirely. The latter have reorganized and, scarcely one month after the 
presidential elections, they have launched attacks against military and civilian targets in the 
north. Tensions between the Malian armed forces and the armed groups in the north, 
although signatories of a preliminary peace agreement with the Government, have also 
given rise to deadly clashes. The independent expert notes the destabilizing impact of 
terrorist attacks and the resumption of military operations on the situation of human rights 
and the restoration of State authority in the north. He calls on Mali to speed up the 
negotiation of an equitable, credible programme for the reform of the security sector, 
disarmament and the social reintegration of former combatants. 
</p>
<p> Malian justice took an important step towards the restoration of the rule of law and 
recognition of the rights of victims and their families by opening independent 
investigations and legal proceedings in the cases of enforced disappearances and other 
serious human rights violations that took place at the Kati military barracks in April&#8211;May 
2012 and September&#8211;October 2013. The independent expert calls on Mali to protect the 
independence of its judiciary and to provide it with the material, technical and logistic 
means &#8212; which are seriously lacking &#8212; to conduct thorough investigations into the crimes 
committed by armed groups and Malian armed forces during the crisis in the north. The 
Government of Mali should mobilize the resources needed to ensure tight security for 
members of the criminal justice system responsible for trying sensitive cases concerning 
international crimes, impunity or corruption of high civil or military officials and 
international terrorism. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert notes the decision of the Government of Mali to restructure 
the Dialogue and Reconciliation Commission so as to enlarge its mandate and incorporate 
the components of truth and justice. All these principles are necessary to enable the Malians 
to confront a past marked by the socioeconomic and cultural marginalization of certain 
regions and communities in the country, which is one of the world&#8217;s poorest. 
</p>
<p> The historical grievances of certain population groups in the north having led to 
repeated armed rebellions followed by at times collective reprisals, the mechanisms of 
transitional justice are best able &#8212; if the new Truth, Justice and Reconciliation 
Commission fulfils its mandate &#8212; to help the Malians address past injustices and to 
recognize the rights of the victims to justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report has been submitted in conformity with Human Rights Council 
resolution 22/18 of 21 March 2013, pursuant to which the Council established a one-year 
mandate for an independent expert on the situation of human rights in Mali and requested 
him to report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session.  
</p>
<p>2. The present report covers the period between 1 July 2013 and 30 December 2013 
and gives an account of the independent expert&#8217;s first visit to Mali from 20 October to 3 
November 2013. It is based on information collected from governmental and religious 
authorities, United Nations specialized agencies, and national and international non-
governmental human rights organizations, as well as witnesses and victims of human rights 
violations.  
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert expresses appreciation to the Government of Mali, which 
facilitated his stay in the country and his meetings with national and local authorities. He 
met with the highest authorities of the country. The independent expert is grateful to the 
President of Mali, Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, for having taken the time to share with him 
his vision of the promotion and protection of human rights in Mali.  
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert also met with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, the 
Minister for the National Reconciliation and Development of the Regions of the North, the 
Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Minister of Security, the 
Minister for Territorial Administration, the Minister of Labour and Social and 
Humanitarian Affairs, the Minister of Education and the Minister of Health and Hygiene. 
</p>
<p>5. In addition, the independent expert met with the Public Prosecutor, the Chief of Staff 
of the Armed Forces of Mali, the President of the Dialogue and Reconciliation 
Commission, the Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission and 
representatives of civil society, religious leaders, political parties, armed groups and the 
diplomatic corps as well as representatives of the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS), the African Union and United Nations specialized agencies. He also 
visited the north of the country, in particular the regions of Kidal and Timbuktu. 
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert spoke with many witnesses and victims of human rights 
violations, both in Bamako and in the north of the country, and visited places of detention 
in Bamako, where alleged members of jihadi groups and elements of the Malian armed 
forces involved in the mutiny of 30 September 2013 are detained. He also met with a 
delegation of Malian refugees living in Mauritania. 
</p>
<p>7. The independent expert thanks in particular Albert Gerard Koenders, Special 
Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Mali and Head of the United 
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), 
Abdoulaye Bathily, his deputy for political affairs, and the staff of the Human Rights 
Division of MINUSMA in Bamako, Timbuktu and Kidal. The first visit to Mali would not 
have been a success without the technical, logistical and security-related support of the 
United Nations system in Mali. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General situation in the country 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The challenge of the return to constitutional order 
</b></p>
<p>8. Mali is gradually emerging from a severe, multidimensional crisis which led to the 
collapse of the State, with considerable political, economic, security-related, humanitarian, </p>


<p>GE.14-10118 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>social and cultural consequences. The epicentre of the crisis is in the north of the country, 
where for many years the weak State presence has made possible the emergence of a whole 
range of criminal enterprises, drug trafficking and smuggling of migrants to Europe, 
lucrative abductions for ransom, and the illegal circulation of weapons and goods of various 
kinds from neighbouring countries.  
</p>
<p>9. It was in that environment that on 17 January 2012, armed groups such as the 
National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), the Ansar Dine, Al-Qaida in 
the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa 
(MUJAO) occupied the north of the country, a development which was accompanied by 
serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law as well as major 
population displacements from the north to other regions in Mali or to neighbouring 
countries.  
</p>
<p>10. On 21 March 2012, a mutiny at the Kati military barracks led to the overthrow of the 
regime of General Amadou Toumani Tour&#233;, although he was at the end of his term of 
office. A group of non-commissioned officers led by Captain Amadou Haya Sanogo 
suspended the constitutional order and the democratic process in the country. This situation 
divided the political class and civil society, undermined the country&#8217;s economy and 
fragmented the defence and security forces. In April&#8211;May 2012, violent clashes broke out 
in Bamako between the &#8220;red berets&#8221; and the &#8220;green berets&#8221; of the Malian army, resulting in 
several persons killed, wounded or missing. The red berets, supporters of Captain Amadou 
Haya Sanogo, suspected the red berets, loyal to General Amadou Toumani Tour&#233;, of 
fomenting a counter-coup against the military junta. 
</p><p>11. The framework agreement of 6 April 2012, signed under the auspices of ECOWAS, 
resulted in the establishment of transitional institutions under interim President Dioncounda 
Traor&#233;. After a brief period in power, the military junta withdrew to Kati barracks, near 
Bamako, while retaining considerable influence in the Transition Government and the 
defence and security forces. The intervention of the French army in January 2013 in 
Operation Serval, in support of African troops, halted the offensive of armed jihadi groups 
towards the south and liberated localities in the north of the country. 
</p>
<p>12. On 18 June 2013, the Transition Government and the armed groups of northern Mali 
(MNLA, the Supreme Council for the Unity of Azawad (HCUA), the Arab Movement of 
Azawad and the Patriotic Forces of Resistance) signed a preliminary agreement in 
Ouagadougou on presidential elections and inclusive peace negotiations in Mali, and 
presidential elections were held on 28 July and 11 August 2013 throughout the country. The 
elections were an essential step towards resolving the crisis in Mali, restoring constitutional 
order and strengthening the legitimacy of the State. Despite many challenges associated 
with a tight election schedule and a fragile security context, the elections were held in 
satisfactory conditions and in a peaceful climate, and with an exceptional level of 
participation of 48 per cent. On 12 August 2013, Souma&#239;la Ciss&#233; conceded defeat and went 
to the home of President-Elect Ibrahim Boubacar Ke&#239;ta to congratulate him.  
</p>
<p>13. In his inaugural address, the President of Mali declared that a settlement of the 
problem of the north continued to be the most pressing priority. As soon as it was 
established on 8 September 2013, the new Government adopted a number of measures to 
promote inter- and intra-communal dialogue and engage with the armed groups and other 
actors in the crisis in the north, including through the organization in Bamako of national 
consultations on decentralization from 21 to 23 October 2013 and a national conference on 
the north from 1 to 3 November 2013.  
</p>
<p>14. The electoral process was completed with the holding of legislative elections on 24 
November and 15 December 2013. Approximately 6.5 million voters were called upon to 
vote in order to build on efforts to restore the constitutional order and State institutions. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.14-10118 
</p>
<p>According to the provisional official results of the second round, announced on Tuesday 17 
December by the Minister for Territorial Administration, the presidential party, the 
Rassemblement pour le Mali (RPM), and its allies had an absolute majority.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The security challenge in the north 
</b></p>
<p>15. Scarcely a month and a half after the presidential election, the armed groups 
reorganized and resumed their destabilizing activities with a series of attacks aimed at 
military and civilian targets. Clashes between MNLA and the Malian armed forces also 
resumed, with at least five incidents in September alone, resulting in the deaths of 18 
MNLA and Malian army combatants. No civilian victims were reported. Another major 
incident took place on 8 November 2013 in the village of Egazargane, in the Gao region, 
resulting in the deaths of three MNLA members and three wounded. 
</p>
<p>16. The threat of improvised explosive devices remains high, with five incidents 
reported in July 2013. Two such devices were found and defused on 27 and 29 July near the 
village of Aguelhok, north of Kidal, by French soldiers of Operation Serval. 
</p>
<p>17. The independent expert travelled to Kidal on 26 October 2013 and met there with 
MINUSMA, MNLA and HCUA, as well as organizations of civil society, having 
previously held a working meeting in Bamako with the Governor of Kidal, who was there 
in connection with his participation in the national consultations on decentralization. At the 
time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit, the situation in Kidal, where Tuareg rebellions have 
broken out repeatedly since independence, remained fragile and was characterized by a 
weak State presence and limited State control over the region.  
</p>
<p>18. MNLA continued to occupy the governorate and most of the public buildings in the 
town. It also controlled the regional stations of the Mali Radio and Broadcasting Office, 
which it regularly used to disseminate messages fomenting hatred and violence.  
</p>
<p>19. On 14 November 2013, the restitution by MNLA of the governorate of Kidal, the 
official residence of the Governor and Kidal&#8217;s ORTM radio station appeared to indicate a 
willingness of the groups involved to find peaceful solutions for the restoration of State 
authority. However, MNLA and HCUA still occupy other State buildings, including the 
regional assembly, the youth centre and the prison.  
</p>
<p>20. On 14 December 2013, a vehicle loaded with explosives was used to launch an 
attack on a MINUSMA troop transport vehicle parked in front of the bank of Kidal. The car 
transporting the assailants reportedly crashed into the MINUSMA vehicle, which had 
stopped to relieve the guards of the bank&#8217;s outer perimeter; soldiers of the Malian army 
were guarding the inner perimeter. The toll was two dead and three wounded MINUSMA 
soldiers and three wounded Malian soldiers. The bank and a school across from the bank 
sustained heavy damage.  
</p>
<p>21. On the evening of 16 December 2013, three explosions were heard in the vicinity of 
the MINUSMA base at Kidal. According to reports, artillery or mortar shells were fired at 
positions held by MINUSMA peacekeepers and landed nearby, without harming 
MINUSMA personnel or damaging MINUSMA equipment.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The challenge of the restoration of State authority 
</b></p>
<p>22. The independent expert found that during the occupation of the north by armed 
groups, the authority of the State had weakened considerably in the regions of Kidal, Gao 
and Timbuktu, as well as in part of the regions of Mopti and S&#233;gou. Despite the liberation </p>


<p>GE.14-10118 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>of a large part of the north, the Malian State has not yet been able to recover control over 
the entire territory.  
</p>
<p>23. It is still difficult for government authorities to travel to the region of Kidal on 
official visit. In mid-September 2013, the convoy of a delegation of members of the 
Government of Mali was attacked by stone-throwing demonstrators &#8211; MNLA sympathizers 
demanding independence for Azawad. On 28 November, an airplane transporting the Prime 
Minister was unable to land in Kidal because of demonstrators at the airport protesting his 
visit in the region.  
</p>
<p>24. In the north, the consequence of the occupation has been the systematic destruction 
of all State presence. State functions such as the territorial administration, security, justice, 
education and health care were particularly hard hit, since they were strategic targets for 
jihadi groups seeking to replace the judicial order by the sharia. Many public service 
buildings and infrastructures were destroyed. The civil servants and State officials assigned 
to the north fled to Bamako. 
</p>
<p>25. The independent expert noted that the Malian authorities were gradually 
reintroducing institutions in the north for security and public order, justice, public health 
and education, notwithstanding problems encountered in the rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of administrative infrastructure and other public service buildings destroyed 
during the occupation. The authorities were planning to reinforce the presence of police and 
gendarmerie stations in the north. One of the main focal points is the establishment of a 
fully operational prison system based on new integrated units designed to provide support 
for the judicial system and the security sector.  
</p><p>26. The authorities have also introduced incentives to encourage civil servants to return 
to their posts in the north. However, those who have been able to do so encounter many 
obstacles on the ground which impede the resumption of State services, such as the lack of 
basic computer infrastructures and equipment or functioning offices. The authorities also 
aim to ensure public order and security by opening police stations and prisons.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The challenge of the fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Judicial mechanisms 
</b>27. The Transition Government has had mixed results and an ambivalent attitude 
towards combating impunity. On the one hand, it has filed an application with the 
International Criminal Court to bring to justice suspected perpetrators of international 
crimes committed in the north. On the other hand, a Council of Ministers decision of 14 
August 2013 went in the opposite direction by exceptionally promoting Captain Amadou 
Haya Sanogo to the rank of lieutenant general, despite a number of reports of his 
involvement in human rights violations since the coup of 22 March 2012.  
</p>
<p>28. Moreover, the Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement provides that the parties 
undertake to adopt appropriate confidence-building measures to facilitate the 
implementation of the Agreement, and to release the persons detained in connection with 
the armed conflict. On 29 October, the Government released 11 members of armed groups 
detained in connection with the events in the north, and it annulled arrest warrants issued 
against a number of Tuareg rebel chiefs, including 4 former members of parliament 
affiliated with MNLA and HCUA. 
</p>
<p>29. The independent expert noted with concern that such a measure opens the door to 
granting impunity and constituted a de facto amnesty for acts committed by armed groups 
in northern Mali that might potentially be considered international crimes.  </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.14-10118 
</p>
<p>30. Despite these challenges, the independent expert found during his visit to Mali that 
the fight against impunity had been stepped up considerably in the context of the mutiny of 
30 September 2013 at the Kati military barracks by elements of the junta hostile to General 
Sanogo. That incident had enabled the new authorities of the country to restore State 
authority over the Kati barracks, which had become the headquarters of the junta since the 
coup of 22 March 2012, and thus to weaken General Sanogo.  
</p>
<p>31. On 31 October 2013, the judge investigating the enforced disappearances of 23 
soldiers following the counter-coup of 30 April 2012 issued arrest warrants against 17 
members of the armed forces, including General Sanogo. On 27 November 2013, General 
Sanogo was arrested and brought before the investigating judge, who indicted him and 
ordered him to be placed in detention. 
</p>
<p>32. In a communiqu&#233; of 6 December 2013, the Government of Mali informed national 
and international public opinion that on the night of 3 to 4 December 2013, the 
investigating judge of the second chamber of the court of first instance of Commune III 
(Bamako District), with the assistance of the forensic experts of the national gendarmerie&#8217;s 
judicial investigation service, and in the presence of the public prosecutor of the Bamako 
Court of Appeals and the Minister of Justice, had proceeded to exhume 21 bodies 
(including some in military uniform) found in a common grave in the rural community of 
Diago, near Kati.  
</p>
<p>33.  The independent expert met with courageous members of the judicial system who, 
mindful of their responsibilities, were determined to avail themselves of all institutional 
resources at their disposal to help advance the fight against impunity, a prerequisite to 
lasting peace and true reconciliation in Mali. That attitude resulted in some of them 
receiving death threats or threats of abduction in the context of sensitive cases and 
proceedings to which they had been assigned.  
</p>
<p>34. Despite considerable progress made in investigating the serious crimes with which 
the junta is charged, Malian courts, handicapped by the lack of resources and protection, 
have made little headway in their inquiries into crimes attributed to armed and jihadi groups 
since the beginning of the crisis in January 2012. For the same reasons, the courts have not 
followed up credible reports by witnesses and victims of ill-treatment or torture or cases of 
enforced disappearances of persons detained by Malian armed forces during the conflict in 
the north. As long as this situation is not remedied, it will continue to be a serious obstacle 
to the fight against impunity in Mali.  
</p>
<p>35. The independent expert has also noted that the judicial system does not have the 
capacity or resources to deal with the diversity and complexity of crimes committed in 
northern Mali, which include international crimes such as crimes against humanity, 
terrorism, abductions and drug trafficking. Generally speaking, the judicial system faces a 
number of challenges that limit its ability to function. These include inadequate financial 
and material resources, the insufficient independence of the judiciary, corruption, high legal 
costs, the remoteness of the courts, inadequate training and the lack of human rights 
training. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to the procedure before the International Criminal Court, on 13 July 
2012 the Transition Government, by means of a letter addressed by the Minister of Justice 
to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, referred the most serious crimes 
committed in northern Mali since January 2012 to the Court. On 16 January 2013, the 
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced his decision to initiate an 
investigation and to prosecute all crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court committed on 
Malian territory since January 2012. </p>


<p>GE.14-10118 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Non-judicial mechanisms 
</b>37. On 6 March 2013, the Transition Government established a Dialogue and 
Reconciliation Commission with a two-year mandate to identify the political and social 
forces concerned by the dialogue and reconciliation process as well as armed groups 
eligible to participate in that dialogue in conformity with the roadmap for the transition, 
register cases of human rights violations committed in Mali between the commencement of 
hostilities and the complete recovery of control over the country, and propose any measures 
likely to help the victims overcome their traumatic experiences. 
</p>
<p>38. Many persons who met with the independent expert expressed reservations about the 
procedure for the establishment and composition of the Dialogue and Reconciliation 
Commission. The procedure was criticized for being carried out unilaterally, without the 
participation of civil society or the victims of human rights violations and without a request 
for the technical assistance of partners such as the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, despite the Office&#8217;s presence in Mali and its recognized 
expertise in the field.  
</p>
<p>39. The independent expert is pleased to note that the new Government has become 
aware of the importance of reforming the Dialogue and Reconciliation Commission, and he 
welcomes the efforts by the Malian authorities to give the Commission fresh impetus. The 
Ministry for the National Reconciliation and Development of the Regions of the North has 
been mandated to define and implement a strategy of coexistence based on equity and 
justice. In the course of the meeting with the authorities, the independent expert drew their 
attention to the need for the Commission to put greater focus on the truth dimension, to 
place the victims at the centre of the process and to adopt a participatory approach in order 
to enhance the new Commission&#8217;s legitimacy.  
</p>
<p>40. On 13 December 2013, the Council of Ministers restructured the Commission, 
adopting bills for the establishment, organization and functioning of the Truth, Justice and 
Reconciliation Commission. According to the communiqu&#233; of the Council of Ministers of 
13 December, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission will take into account the 
dimensions of truth and justice and will contribute to establishing a lasting peace by 
seeking truth, reconciliation and the consolidation of democratic values.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights violations committed by the Malian armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>41. In the course of the period under consideration, the independent expert received 
reports of human rights violations, including summary executions, enforced 
disappearances, rapes, looting, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture and cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment perpetrated by the Malian armed forces against the civil 
population in the north, mainly members of the Arab and Tuareg communities of the 
regions of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu.  
</p>
<p>42. On 30 September 2013, a mutiny broke out at the Kati military barracks, started by a 
dissident group belonging to the former Comit&#233; national pour le redressement de la 
d&#233;mocratie et la restauration de l&#8217;&#201;tat (National Committee for the rehabilitation of 
democracy and the restoration of the State), which included members of the junta. The 
mutineers demanded promotions and material benefits for the soldiers who had participated 
in the coup of 22 March 2012 as well as the revocation of General Sanogo&#8217;s status. The 
mutineers wounded a colonel whom they had abducted and threatened with their weapons. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-10118 
</p>
<p>The men faithful to General Sanogo reacted with brutality: at least 4 soldiers were executed 
and 11 others are unaccounted for, including colonel Youssouf Traor&#233;. 
</p>
<p>43. On 2 October 2013, a Tuareg member of MNLA was reportedly killed in the locality 
of Aguelhok by members of the Malian armed forces. According to witnesses, the incident 
took place when a group of Malian soldiers approached two unarmed members of MNLA 
and mistreated them. One of the men fled, and the other was killed by a Malian soldier. The 
incident caused considerable tension in Aguelhok, where other serious incidents were 
reported on 5 October.  
</p>
<p>44. On 28 November 2013, 5 civilian members of the Tuareg community, 2 women 
(aged 23 and 26) and 3 men (aged 16, 19 and 30), were critically injured during violent 
demonstrations organized at Kidal airport by some 300 MNLA sympathizers to protest the 
arrival of the Prime Minister in their region. MINUSMA troops and Malian armed forces 
were deployed in the area to ensure security. The demonstrators reportedly threw stones at 
the MINUSMA troops and the Malian armed forces that were attempting to prevent them 
from occupying the runway. The soldiers of the Malian armed forces reportedly opened fire 
on the demonstrators, critically wounding five persons. One of the victims, a woman, died 
of her injuries after being evacuated to Bamako.  
</p><p>45. The independent expert is concerned about the recent waves of arrests and arbitrary 
detentions by the Malian armed forces of persons belonging mostly to Tuareg, Songhai and 
Arab communities in northern Mali. The arrests are usually ordered following at times false 
accusations made by members of local militia or the population. The arrests and arbitrary 
detentions are having an adverse impact on the return of displaced persons and refugees to 
their region of origin.  
</p>
<p>46. The independent expert noted the case of a traditional Tuareg chief who earlier had 
fled to Burkina Faso and who was arrested on 16 November after returning to northern Mali 
to take part in the legislative election campaign. He was reportedly accused by the local 
population of collaboration with armed jihadi groups during the occupation. The detainee, 
who later was transferred to Bamako, denied the allegations and maintained that he had 
been living in Burkina Faso since February 2011. Owing to the weak presence of the 
judicial system in the north, it is not possible to verify such allegations expeditiously or to 
free the persons concerned in the absence of evidence. In fact, in many cases, persons freed 
by the gendarmerie after an inconclusive investigation have then been arrested by the 
Malian armed forces on the basis of the same allegations. This interference by the army in 
legal proceedings concerning civilians also gives cause for concern.  
</p>
<p>47. The independent expert has also received reports of cases of ill-treatment and 
abductions. For example, it was reported that on 3 November 2013 three Tuareg dignitaries 
of the Ifoghas community were badly beaten about the head by two members of the Malian 
armed forces during a patrol in Tarssek, near Kidal. One of them lost consciousness and the 
other fell to the ground and was unable to stand up. Cases of ill-treatment inflicted by the 
Malian armed forces have also been reported in a number of villages in the north.  
</p>
<p>48. On 23 July, members of the Malian armed forces who were part of a military 
assistance and training detachment reportedly stopped their vehicle and arrested a 28-year-
old teacher of Songhai origin in Mopti. The family still has no news of the victim. The 
victim&#8217;s mother lodged a complaint at the Mopti police station and court, but no action was 
taken. 
</p>
<p>49. The independent expert also received consistent reports of the exhumation in July 
2013 in the vicinity of Timbuktu of the bodies of six Arab dignitaries, including an elderly 
man named Ali Ould Kabbad. The victims were last seen alive when they were being 
arrested by soldiers of the Malian armed forces.  </p>


<p>GE.14-10118 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Human rights violations committed by armed groups  
</b></p>
<p>50. Armed groups continue to be involved in serious human rights violations in northern 
Mali, including violations of the right to life, abductions, rapes, ill-treatment, violations of 
the right to own property and suicide attacks resulting in the deaths of 47 persons, including 
2 peacekeepers, 2 French reporters and 1 minor as well as numerous civilians. Human 
rights observers have also collected information on nine cases of serious human rights 
violations committed by MNLA, in particular in Kidal and Timbuktu, involving 21 
civilians and 1 member of the Malian armed forces. MNLA elements were also implicated 
in cases of arrest and arbitrary detention, torture, recruitment and employment of children, 
looting, extortion and intimidation.  
</p>
<p>51. At about one o&#8217;clock on the afternoon of 28 September 2013, a vehicle exploded 
next to the entrance to the garrison of the Fifth Military Region of Malian armed forces in 
Timbuktu. Three suspected jihadis were in the vehicle, which apparently was heavily 
loaded with explosives. Travelling at high speed, the vehicle crashed into a military 
building adjoining the garrison&#8217;s checkpoint and blew up. The preliminary toll was five 
persons killed &#8211; the three suspected jihadis and two civilian passers-by. AQMI claimed 
responsibility for the attack.  
</p>
<p>52. On 7 October, six shells were fired at the town of Gao, seriously injuring one Malian 
soldier. MUJAO claimed responsibility for the attack. That same day, a bridge near the 
locality of Ansongo was damaged by an improvised explosive device. On 23 October, four 
persons blew up their vehicle, which was filled with explosives, at a roadside checkpoint of 
MINUSMA peacekeepers in Tessalit, resulting in the deaths of seven persons, including 
two MINUSMA soldiers from Chad and a 6-year-old child. On 1 November, violent 
demonstrations were held in Gao and Menaka to protest the lack of basic services such as 
access to water, electricity and the courts as well as the deterioration of security conditions 
and the economic situation.  
</p>
<p>53. The illegal circulation of firearms in the town of Kidal seems to have had an impact 
on the security of civilians. On 24 October, a 35-year-old man, a member of MNLA, was 
reportedly murdered in his home in the Abeibara Cercle, 50 kilometres from Kidal, by three 
armed members of AQMI who came on motorcycles. Two days later, an Arab truck driver 
was reportedly killed in similar circumstances by armed men on motorcycles. The incident 
took place on the Anefis road, approximately 110 kilometres from Kidal. The three 
surviving passengers reported the incident to the Kidal gendarmerie.  
</p>
<p>54. On 2 November, two French reporters working for Radio France international were 
abducted and murdered by four armed men in the Kidal region. Their bodies were found 
some 15 kilometres from Kidal, on the Tin-Essako road. This serious incident constitutes 
the ultimate obstacle to freedom of expression, including freedom to inform and the right of 
access to information. 
</p>
<p>55. On 4 November, four civilians, including a woman and a child, were killed when the 
transport vehicle in which they were riding hit an improvised explosive device 
approximately 110 kilometres west of Menaka, in the Gao region. On 26 November 2013, 
three members of the Tuareg community were reportedly abducted in Kidal and two of 
them executed by members of AQMI between Talahandak and Borhassa, 285 kilometres 
north of Kidal, near the Algerian border. The bodies of the two victims, aged 25 and 29, 
who were members of the Ifoghas community, were found by the local population and 
turned over to members of their families. The third victim is still unaccounted for.  
</p>
<p>56. The independent expert also received reports about the murder of a traditional chief 
in Gourma Rharous, in the Timbuktu region. The incident occurred on 28 November 2013, 
when two armed men forced their way into a Tuareg camp and reportedly fired two shots, 
killing the head of the Tinaliderene community, 65 kilometres northeast of Ouinarden </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.14-10118 
</p>
<p>(Gossi Commune). In another incident in the Timbuktu region, 20 kilometres north of 
Gossi, a Fulani businessman was reportedly abducted and murdered on 2 December 2013. 
His house was looted before he was killed. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Inter- and intra-communal clashes 
</b></p>
<p>57. The independent expert is particularly concerned about recent waves of violence 
between ethnic and racial communities in northern Mali, notably between Arabs, Fulani, 
Tuaregs and Songhai, which have resulted in loss of life in each of those communities. Six 
serious clashes were reported during the period covered by this report in Kidal, Gao and 
Timbuktu, with a death toll of at least 20 persons. The clashes are exacerbated by criminal 
activities, raids, drug and human trafficking and the circulation of firearms, all of which 
fuel conflicts.  
</p>
<p>58. One of the most worrisome aspects of these clashes is the failure to distinguish 
between members of each community, who are no longer perceived as individuals 
responsible for their own acts. In such situations, there is a very high risk of serious human 
rights violations, because acts by individuals are attributed to an entire community, whose 
members are then in danger of being targeted, not for acts that they are suspected of 
committing, but for being members of that community.  
</p>
<p>59. One emblematic case of such inter-communal violence occurred on 31 October 2013 
in the village of Ekawayane, which is located in the Aljounoub Commune in the Timbuktu 
region. It involved a punitive expedition following the alleged murder of a young Tuareg on 
30 October 2013 by an Arab in the village of Tilemsi, about 190 kilometres from Goundam. 
Young armed Tuaregs reportedly attacked the village of Ekawayane, which is mainly 
inhabited by Arabs. Two Arabs, including the head of the village, were reported to have 
been killed. Six other Arabs were reportedly abducted by MNLA elements in Tilemsi on 30 
October for their alleged involvement in the death of the Tuareg. There is no information 
on the fate of these persons.  
</p>
<p>60. There have also been clashes within the Tuareg community, between Ifoghas and 
Idnans, in particular in Tin-Essako, Talahandak and Tinzahouatene, causing insecurity and 
leading on 27 November 2013 to the abduction and summary execution of two persons. 
Both communities are affiliated with MNLA, but do not agree on whether the movement 
should be secular or Islamic in nature.  
</p>
<p>61. The independent expert notes with concern that Tuareg society is composed of clans 
and a confederation of clans with a rigid hierarchical structure that ensures that the Bellas, 
dark-skinned Tuaregs still regarded as slaves and who are denied their inherent human 
rights and dignity, are kept at the bottom of the social scale. That hierarchical structure also 
has a generational dimension, since MNLA appears to be composed chiefly of young 
people determined to overthrow the established order in their community and impose social 
mobility by force of arms.  
</p>
<p>62. These internal dynamics of Tuareg society lead to competition between clans for 
power in the region. The absence of a strong presence of the Malian State in the north has 
accelerated and radicalized these intra-communal tensions, which have flared up 
periodically in Malian society since independence in the form of armed rebellion. This has 
a destabilizing effect on the entire country. At the same time, some Tuareg soldiers in 
Mali&#8217;s defence and security forces do not hesitate to use the army and their position in the 
armed forces to enhance the power of their clan within their community and thus settle 
accounts, sometimes to the detriment of human rights.  </p>


<p>GE.14-10118 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>63. During the occupation of northern Mali in January 2012, armed groups committed 
sexual violence, including rape, gang rape, sexual slavery and forced marriage. These 
conflict-related acts reflect the poor status of women in Malian society and the heritage of 
slavery. Women and girls of the Bella community, who are regarded as descendants of the 
slaves of Tuaregs, have often been targeted by rebel groups. In another case, which is 
expected to be the subject of investigations and prosecutions, members of the &#8220;green 
berets&#8221; are accused of raping dozens of spouses and daughters of &#8220;red berets&#8221; during the 
attempted counter-coup as a form of reprisal.  
</p>
<p>64. Allegations of sexual violence have declined significantly since the liberation of 
northern Mali. The deterioration of the security situation seems to have been an important 
factor in many cases of sexual violence reported in the north, in particular in Gao and the 
vicinity, the perpetrators of which are usually members of armed groups.  
</p>
<p>65. The victims are often minors who are attacked at the home of their parents. In other 
cases, women were singled out by armed men who attacked the bus in which they were 
travelling. For example, in the Timbuktu region, five women were raped by armed men in 
civilian clothing. One victim reported that at around 4 o&#8217;clock on the afternoon of 2 
November 2013, she was on board a bus on the road between Tonka and Bouna, in the 
Timbuktu region, in the company of four other women, the driver and an elderly person, 
when two white vans suddenly appeared with eight armed men on board who ordered the 
driver to stop, forced the five women to leave the vehicle and raped them for 5 hours. One 
of the victims told investigators that she had been raped several times by three men who 
spoke Songhai, Arabic and Tamasheq. 
</p>
<p>66. Another typical case concerns a 21-year-old woman detained in a rape case since 28 
February 2011 in Djenn&#233; prison (Mopti region) who claims to have been the victim of 
repeated physical and sexual violence since March 2013. The victim alleges that when she 
complained to the prison director after the first rape, he told her to take contraceptive 
measures. She also contends that she was forced to perform domestic work in the prison 
and that her earnings were extorted by prison guards and the prison director.  
</p>
<p>67. On 1 December 2013, three women were abducted and raped during an attack on the 
Inamoussa of Bozo, a village 44 kilometres north of Gossi (Timbuktu region). The attack 
was reportedly carried out by a group of armed men identified by the victims as being 
Tuaregs. There was widespread looting of property during the attack, which caused a panic 
in the village and led to the closing of schools.  
</p>
<p>68. The independent expert is concerned about the impunity still enjoyed by the alleged 
perpetrators of sexual violence in Mali. The victims invariably encounter numerous 
obstacles to taking their cases to court, in particular in the north, where there is a minimal 
presence of judicial authorities and a fragile security situation. Many victims and 
organizations of civil society have reported their frustration about the failure to prosecute 
known cases of rape, a circumstance which may impede endeavours to achieve national 
reconciliation. Government efforts, supported by the United Nations, to enhance the 
capacity of the security forces and ex-combatants to prevent sexual violence and protect 
women and girls must be conducted in the framework of a global strategy that focuses on 
the victims, provides for reparation and guarantees non-recurrence of such acts.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The situation of children 
</b></p>
<p>69. Children are one of the biggest categories of victims of the Malian crisis. The 
resurgence of violence and the insecurity in the north greatly increased the risk of abuse and </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.14-10118 
</p>
<p>violation of children&#8217;s rights. Although in many respects the protection of children&#8217;s rights 
gave cause for concern even before the crisis, the occupation of the north by armed groups 
led to a serious deterioration in the situation of children, as well as to new serious problems, 
such as separation from parents, displacement, recruitment by armed groups, ideological 
and religious indoctrination, violence, including sexual violence, and the risk of violation of 
the right to life.  
</p>
<p>70. Many of the victims of recent attacks by armed groups in the north, in particular in 
Tessalit, Kidal, Timbuktu and Gao, were children. Numerous cases of sexual violence 
against children were reported, mainly in northern Mali. The United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF) reported 767 children separated from their parents and 77 children injured 
by explosives abandoned during military clashes, sometimes in schools.  
</p>
<p>71. The recruitment of children by armed groups has resulted in a considerable number 
of arrests of minors since the beginning of the crisis. The independent expert welcomes the 
signing by the Government and the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-
General, on 1 July 2013, of the protocol for the release, transfer and protection of children 
associated with armed forces and groups. A request has been made to the authorities to 
examine the case of children arrested prior to the signing of the protocol. Ten children 
associated with armed groups are still in detention, including five adolescents detained at 
Gendarmerie Camp 1, in Bamako. 
</p>
<p>72. In October 2013, five children associated with armed groups were returned to their 
families after spending time in transit centres supported by UNICEF until their parents were 
found. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Prison conditions 
</b></p>
<p>73. The independent expert has closely followed the cases of persons, usually members 
of the Tuareg and Arab communities, arrested in the context of the crisis in northern Mali 
by Malian armed forces. He visited the places of detention where these persons are held, 
including the Bamako central prison and the Gendarmerie Camp 1 detention centre in 
Bamako. The Human Rights Division of MINUSMA also regularly visits detainees around 
the country to gather information on detention conditions and on the progress of the legal 
proceedings instituted against them.  
</p>
<p>74. As of 2 December 2013, the Human Rights Division, through its regular visits to 
detention centres in the country, had registered the names of 400 persons arrested since 
2012 in connection with the conflict in northern Mali. Human rights teams collected 
information enabling them to determine the situation of 332 persons: 138 had been 
released, 185 were detained in Bamako, 3 were detained in Gao and 6 had died in 
detention; it had not been possible to establish the whereabouts of 68 detainees.  
</p>
<p>75. Of the 138 released detainees, 3 received a presidential pardon. The period between 
September and October 2013 witnessed the largest number of releases of detainees, both by 
the Malian authorities and MNLA. All told, the Malian authorities released 93 detainees, 
and MNLA released 30 detainees from various detention centres in Kidal.  
</p>
<p>76. The independent expert is closely following the release of members of armed groups 
in the context of the implementation of the Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement signed in 
June 2013. MNLA and HCUA communicated to the mediator a list of 120 names of their 
members and sympathizers to be released in order to facilitate the peace negotiations. As of 
2 December 2013, 38 persons on that list had been released; 1 of the persons concerned by 
those measures had died in prison.  </p>


<p>GE.14-10118 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>77. The independent expert regrets that he did not receive authorization to visit the 
detention centres of the State security intelligence agency, despite numerous requests. He 
notes with concern that no organization has been able to obtain access to the persons 
detained in State security facilities, despite many allegations that torture is practised there. 
The independent expert and the human rights teams of MINUSMA were able to meet with 
eight detainees who had been held by the State security and who alleged that they had been 
tortured and subjected to other ill-treatment during interrogations. For example, it was 
reported that one person had had his ear pierced with a pen and had been severely beaten 
during interrogation. The detainees met with also asserted that the State security had torture 
facilities, including a &#8220;punishment room&#8221;, in which an electric chair and other torture 
equipment were used. 
</p>
<p>78. Many detainees who were members of armed groups stated that they had been 
subjected to torture and ill-treatment by the Malian armed forces after their arrest in the 
north. Those acts ceased once they were transferred to the gendarmerie in the north and, 
later, to Bamako.  
</p>
<p>79. The independent expert is deeply concerned about problems of hygiene and 
cleanliness in many prisons and places of detention, as was evident during his visit to 
Bamako central prison, and about the lack of regular medical care for detainees.   
</p>
<p><b> F. Refugees and internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>80. Since 2012 the armed conflict in northern Mali has displaced 424,000 persons: 
255,000 persons were internally displaced, and 168,000 persons (as of 30 November 2013) 
fled to Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Niger. The Government has undertaken to encourage 
refugees and displaced persons to return to their regions of origin voluntarily in order to 
participate in presidential and legislative elections. A special initiative was launched 
between 15 and 31 October to bring returned persons to polling stations of their choice; 
163,423 voters were brought to electoral districts under this measure.  
</p>
<p>81. The Government also facilitated election participation for refugees in camps. In 
cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM), the authorities visited camps in Burkina Faso, 
Mauritania and Niger to arrange for refugee participation in elections. Thanks to that 
initiative, 19,020 refugees were able to register to vote.  
</p>
<p>82. The resurgence of violence and false accusations followed by arrests and arbitrary 
detentions are likely to discourage the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>83. Even before the political and security crisis of January 2012, Mali had already faced 
a severe food crisis throughout the Sahelian band of its territory because of the poor 
agricultural harvest of 2011&#8211;2012. Food insecurity and the living conditions of the 
population worsened with the occupation of the north by armed groups.  
</p>
<p>84. The economic sanctions that followed the military coup included the suspension of 
development assistance by technical and financial partners and an economic and financial 
embargo by ECOWAS. 
</p>
<p>85. The reduced presence of State officials also poses considerable problems. Of the 176 
health-care centres in the areas affected by the conflict, only 121 are open, and many 
schools in the north are still not operational, although the school year started on 17 October </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.14-10118 
</p>
<p>in Timbuktu and on 1 November in Gao. To date, 85 of Timbuktu&#8217;s 460 schools and 195 of 
Gao&#8217;s 569 schools may have to remain closed for security reasons. In Kidal, no school has 
opened, although MNLA has expressed its intention to do so.  
</p>
<p>86. Some progress has been made with the provision of basic services thanks to efforts 
by the authorities and their humanitarian and development partners. However, much 
remains to be done to continue to meet the urgent needs of the population and help the 
authorities to reintroduce and ensure lasting rehabilitation of basic services and 
infrastructures and restore the means of subsistence of persons affected by the crisis.  
</p>
<p>87. On 27 November 2013, the Council of Ministers adopted bills on the establishment, 
organization and operation of a National Employment and Training Observatory. This new 
body is responsible for coordinating the collection, processing, storage and dissemination of 
information on the labour market in order to ensure a better balance between needs and 
possibilities. On 16 October 2013, the Council of Ministers of the new Government also 
adopted a draft decree regulating the collection and sale of raw diamonds in line with the 
Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in order to prevent the purchase of diamonds 
placed by rebel movements on the world market to finance their activities.  
</p>
<p>88. With regard to cultural rights, the independent expert noted that during the 
occupation of northern Mali by armed groups, the cultural heritage and cultural practices 
and expressions in Timbuktu and Gao were prime targets of systematic and generalized 
attacks by jihadi groups. In Timbuktu, 11 of 16 mausoleums on the list of World Heritage 
Sites were destroyed, as were the 2 mausoleums of the Djingareyber mosque and the El 
Farouk monument. The sacred door of the Sidi Yahia was broken down. Approximately 
4,200 manuscripts from the Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research 
were burned by armed groups. In the Gao region, the El Kebir mausoleum was destroyed in 
October 2012. In Douentza, the big toguna in the centre of the town was pillaged and its 
sculpted pillars burned. The intangible cultural heritage was also affected by the events.  
</p>
<p>89.  The independent expert welcomes the efforts being made by the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and MINUSMA to establish 
an inventory of Mali&#8217;s intangible cultural heritage and to restore and protect the country&#8217;s 
cultural heritage. He also notes with appreciation that the cultural dimension is taken into 
account in the mandate of MINUSMA. Security Council resolution 2100 (2013) is the first 
to include the protection of cultural and historical sites in the mandate of a peacekeeping 
operation.  
</p>
<p>90. The independent expert noted in particular that the President of Mali had explained 
to him his vision of how important it was for modern human rights to be based on the solid 
cultural bedrock of humanism and tolerance which the Malian people, with its rich 
diversity, has developed over time. In that connection, the new Manden Charter, 
proclaimed in Kurukan Fuga at the beginning of the thirteenth century by the founder of the 
Mandinka Empire and inscribed in 2009 in the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of 
Humanity, is a real source of inspiration for contemporary human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The dramatic events of January and March 2012 highlighted the vulnerability 
of Mali, a developing country with weakened State structures, in the face of an 
alliance of convenience between Malian rebels and armed jihadi groups from outside 
the country. Although routed in early 2013 through the intervention of France and </b></p>


<p>GE.14-10118 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>African forces, these groups are still in a position to conduct terrorist and guerrilla 
operations in the north against military and civilian targets. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The major challenges which Mali must address in 2014 are the consolidation of 
security in the north and the strengthening of constitutional order, which the country 
had restored with the help of presidential and legislative elections. Mali must also 
reinforce the rule of law and the fight against impunity and make major efforts to 
reform the judicial system and the security sector. A frank dialogue with the armed 
groups which agreed to support the Malian State and recognized its sovereignty, 
secular nature and the indivisibility of its territory, as well as with the communities in 
northern Mali, is the only way of promoting national unity and creating favourable 
conditions for an effective introduction of State services throughout the country.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>In establishing the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, Mali has set 
out on the path to transitional justice by seeking to obtain redress, with reparation 
and guarantees of non-recurrence, for the victims of the massive violations of human 
rights and international humanitarian law committed in the north of the country since 
independence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations for the Malian authorities 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b><i>Concerning the fight against impunity</i>, the independent expert recommends 
that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The technical capacities and budgetary and logistical allocations made 
available to members of the penal system active in the investigation and prosecution of 
crimes committed by members of armed groups and the Malian armed forces should 
be strengthened; measures should be taken to ensure that judges responsible for 
hearing sensitive cases are protected and that such investigations and prosecutions are 
conducted with due regard for international norms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Resources should be immediately allocated so that military courts can 
conduct investigations and prosecute members of the State security forces implicated 
in serious violations, including those who, on the pretext of obeying their superiors, 
are responsible for not having prevented or punished crimes committed before, 
during or after the crisis; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Measures should be taken to ensure that persons placed in police custody 
or detained during military operations, including during rapid pretrial detention 
procedures, are treated humanely and guaranteed due process, in line with 
international norms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The deployment of the police, gendarmerie and judicial personnel in 
towns and villages in the north should be stepped up to enable the judicial system to 
resume functioning in accordance with national and international law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The reform of the judicial system should be undertaken at the same time 
as that of the security sector, in particular the army, the police, the gendarmerie and 
State security services; such reforms are needed if the Malian Government is to meet 
the paramount objective of combating impunity.

Security Council resolution 1960 (2010), in which the Security Council called upon the 
Member States of the United Nations to issue clear orders, through chains of 
command and Codes of Conduct or their equivalent, prohibiting sexual violence by 
members of the security forces and armed groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Government of Mali should examine without delay allegations of 
sexual violence with a view to prosecuting alleged perpetrators; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Government of Mali should appoint a person responsible for 
ensuring the implementation of these commitments at a high level;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government of Mali should cooperate with the United Nations and 
facilitate its access in order to ensure compliance with these obligations; 
</b></p>

victims of sexual violence have access to HIV-related legal assistance and medical 
services as well as psychosocial rehabilitation; 
</b></p>

Commission should consider the question of redress for the victims and their families 
through a multisectoral approach rather than the granting of purely legal 
compensation.

</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Build the capacities of the Malian judicial system, in particular by 
providing it with considerable financial, technical, logistic and security-related 
support; this will make it possible to collect evidence of crimes committed in northern 
Mali by armed groups and the Malian armed forces;

<p><b> (b) Assist Malian initiatives aimed at reforming the security sector; </b></p>


<p>GE.14-10118 <b>19
