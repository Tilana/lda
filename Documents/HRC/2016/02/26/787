<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In accordance with the mandate described by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 6/14, and at the invitation of the Government of Ghana, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on contemporary forms of slavery, its causes and consequences, Gulnara Shahinian, 
</p>
<p>conducted an official visit to Ghana from 22 to 29 November 2013. The objective of the 
</p>
<p>visit was to examine, in a spirit of cooperation, the current situation and the programmes 
</p>
<p>and challenges in eradicating contemporary forms of slavery in the country. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations are based on her findings during her visit.  
</p>
<p>2. In the course of her visit, the Special Rapporteur sought to obtain information on 
</p>
<p>issues pertaining to her mandate, with a focus on child labour in the artisanal fishing sector, 
</p>
<p>the situation of kayayee (porters) and sexual exploitation. She also touched upon other 
</p>
<p>areas requiring further attention, including domestic and ritual servitude, and servile 
</p>
<p>marriage. In that context, she held consultations with government representatives, civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations, traditional leaders, academics and the United Nations country team 
</p>
<p>with a view to studying the efforts undertaken on those issues. 
</p>
<p>3. In addition to Accra, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to conduct field 
</p>
<p>visits to various sites, where she was able to discuss first-hand the experiences and views of 
</p>
<p>affected communities and individuals. Areas visited included Sokapoke, Kpandu, Swedru, 
</p>
<p>and different sites in and around Accra.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to express her appreciation to all her 
</p>
<p>interlocutors, and in particular, the Government of Ghana for their invitation and 
</p>
<p>cooperation during the visit. She would also like to thank the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Resident Coordinator, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), UN Women, the United Nations Population Fund 
</p>
<p>(UNFPA), and other members of the United Nations country team, who provided support 
</p>
<p>towards the visit. In addition, she would like to express her gratitude to the various 
</p>
<p>communities she engaged with during her visit, and the persons affected by exploitation 
</p>
<p>and slavery who shared their experiences, concerns and hopes with her.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p>5. Over the past decade, Ghana has achieved a regional reputation for political 
</p>
<p>stability, economic growth and a favourable trend towards democratic governance. In 2012 
</p>
<p>Ghana enjoyed approximately 7 per cent growth in gross domestic product, due in part to 
</p>
<p>good cocoa production and gold output, and the commercialization of oil. As a result of 
</p>
<p>those factors, the country has attained a lower middle-income status.  
</p>
<p>6. Despite those achievements and the medium-term development frameworks adopted 
</p>
<p>by the Government since the late 1990s, a number of challenges have emerged as of 2008, 
</p>
<p>including substantial fiscal and balance of payment deficits, rising food prices and poor 
</p>
<p>performance in sectors such as agriculture. That resulted in an increase in poverty levels, 
</p>
<p>negatively affecting the achievement of some of the United Nations Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals. On the Human Development Index Ghana ranks in 135th position out 
</p>
<p>of 187 countries, while the poverty level stands at 28.6 per cent of the population.1 Other 
</p>
<p>persistent challenges include the lack of quality and timely statistical data, weak country 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), <i>Human Development Report 2013</i> (New 
</p>
<p>York, UNDP, 2013); and www.gh.undp.org/content/ghana/en/home/countryinfo/. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>systems to deliver aid, and the lack of functioning domestic accountability systems to 
</p>
<p>prevent corruption and election-year fiscal expenditures.2  
</p>
<p>7. Ghana has a young population, 45 per cent of which are under 18 years of age.3 
</p>
<p>Enrolment in primary school is high. However, dropout rates are high and the quality of 
</p>
<p>education is a concern, especially in public schools, where some students may pass basic 
</p>
<p>school while being functionally illiterate.<footnote name="4">4 While boys are occasionally given to shrines, the practice predominantly sacrifices girls. 
</footnote> The adult literacy rate stands at 67.3 per cent.<footnote name="5">3 See A/HRC/7/6/Add.3, paras. 35&#8211;<footnote name="4">3 Unabridged, &#8220;Child slavery in Ghana: the scope of the problem&#8221; (21 July 2009), available from 
 
 http://emilyrgeorge.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/child-slavery-in-ghana-the-scope-of-the-problem/. 
</footnote>1.  
</footnote> A 
</p>
<p>key issue is unequal access to quality education and educational resources, particularly the 
</p>
<p>disparity between the north and the south of the country, and between economically well-
</p>
<p>off and underprivileged children; the latter constituting 70 per cent of children in Ghana.6  
</p>
<p>8. High unemployment rates among youth (40 per cent), increasing alcohol addiction 
</p>
<p>and drug abuse, and high child marriage rates are other challenges facing the young in 
</p>
<p>Ghana.7 The adolescent birth rate stands at 69.7.8 Child marriage and lack of adequate 
</p>
<p>access to health services in rural areas contribute to high maternal mortality rates.9  
</p>
<p>9. The majority of the country&#8217;s labour force (56 per cent) is engaged in agriculture, 
</p>
<p>with cocoa exports constituting a key part of the economy. Ghana also has significant 
</p>
<p>mineral resources, including gold, diamonds, aluminium and bauxite, rendering mining an 
</p>
<p>important sector. Urbanization is taking place at a steady pace, with slightly over half the 
</p>
<p>population living in urban centres.10 Housing and other infrastructure deficits, 
</p>
<p>unemployment, and the lack of sufficient social protection systems in Ghana render 
</p>
<p>populations, including those migrating from rural areas to large urban centres, particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to exploitation and slavery-like practices. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Frameworks addressing contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International and regional legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. Ghana has ratified many of the core international human rights treaties and 
</p>
<p>protocols,11 and International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. It has also acceded 
</p>
<p>to or become a signatory to: the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the 
</p>
<p>Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery (1956); the Protocol to 
</p>
<p>Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
</p>
<p>supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
</p>
<p>(2000); and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale 
</p>
<p>of children, child prostitution and child pornography (2000). The Special Rapporteur urges 
</p>
<p>Ghana to ratify these at the earliest opportunity.

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>11. In the area of international labour standards, the country has ratified a total of 
</p>
<p>51 ILO conventions, including: Convention No. 105 (1957) concerning the abolition of 
</p>
<p>forced labour; Convention No. 182 (1999) concerning the prohibition and immediate action 
</p>
<p>for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour; Convention No. 138 (1973) 
</p>
<p>concerning minimum age for admission to employment; and Convention No. 144 (1976) 
</p>
<p>concerning tripartite consultations to promote the implementation of international labour 
</p>
<p>standards. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that Ghana has not yet ratified a number 
</p>
<p>of other important ILO conventions, including inter alia: Convention No. 189 (2011) 
</p>
<p>concerning decent work for domestic workers; Convention No. 129 (1969) concerning 
</p>
<p>labour inspection in agriculture; and a number of conventions relating to the rights of 
</p>
<p>migrant workers.12 
</p>
<p>12. At the regional level, Ghana is a State party to the African Charter on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, both of 
</p>
<p>which prohibit slavery-like practices. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National legal framework: key provisions  
</b></p>
<p> (<i>a</i>)<i> Constitution 
</i></p>
<p>13. The Constitution of Ghana, which came into force in 1993 (amended in 1996), 
</p>
<p>provides for &#8220;Fundamental human rights and freedoms&#8221; in chapter 5. In particular, it 
</p>
<p>provides protection against slavery and forced labour, stipulates the rights of workers, and 
</p>
<p>the rights of children, including protection against exposure to physical and moral hazards 
</p>
<p>(art. 28).13 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)<i> The Labour Act (No. 651, 2003) 
</i></p>
<p>14. The 2003 Labour Act updates and consolidates the various pieces of previous 
</p>
<p>legislation, and introduces new provisions which reflect ratified ILO conventions. The Act 
</p>
<p>covers all employers and employees, with the exception of those in strategic positions (e.g. 
</p>
<p>police service). It stipulates general conditions of employment, the rights and duties of 
</p>
<p>workers and employers, including specific provisions relating to women, youth and persons 
</p>
<p>with special needs, and provides for labour inspection and the establishment of a National 
</p>
<p>Tripartite Committee and National Labour Commission.14 Article 116 of the Act prohibits 
</p>
<p>the use of forced labour; an offence liable to a fine (not exceeding 250 penalty units). 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Children&#8217;s Act (No. 560, 1998) </p>
<p>15. The Children&#8217;s Act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age, and sets the 
</p>
<p>general minimum age of employment at 15 (art. 89). However, the minimum age for 
</p>
<p>&#8220;hazardous work&#8221; is set at 18, and defined as work which &#8220;poses a danger to the health, 
</p>
<p>safety or morals of a person&#8221;, including inter alia, going to sea, mining and quarrying, and 
</p>
<p>porterage of heavy loads (art. 91). The Act explicitly prohibits &#8220;exploitative child labour&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>defined as labour which &#8220;deprives the child of its health, education or development&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(arts. 12 and 87). 
</p>
<p>16. Article 1 of the Human Trafficking Act defines &#8220;human trafficking&#8221; as the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, trading or receipt of persons within and 
</p>
<p>across borders&#8221; by inter alia, the use of threat, force or other forms of coercion, deception,

</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>the exploitation of vulnerability, or by paying to achieve consent. The provision specifies 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;exploitation&#8221; includes &#8220;induced prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation, 
</p>
<p>forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of 
</p>
<p>organs&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. Acting as an intermediary, participating in the provision of a person for the purposes 
</p>
<p>of trafficking (even if a parent), and the use of a trafficked person are all offences which are 
</p>
<p>specifically prohibited (arts. 2&#8211;<footnote name="5">2 Ibid.  
</footnote>). Complaints can be filed with the police by the victim or 
</p>
<p>any person having information regarding acts of trafficking. Articles 14 to 33 of the Act 
</p>
<p>pertain to the rescue, rehabilitation and reintegration of trafficked persons and the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a fund to provide basic support to victims of trafficking (family tracing, 
</p>
<p>skills training, etc.). Sanctions for offences related to human trafficking include 
</p>
<p>imprisonment for no less than 5 years.15 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>)<i> Other laws and regulations 
</i></p>
<p>18. Ghana has also adopted a number of other relevant laws and regulations, including: 
</p>
<p>the Hazardous Child Labour Activity Framework for the Cocoa Sector; a list of the worst 
</p>
<p>forms of child labour occupations (e.g. domestic labour, urban informal work activities 
</p>
<p>such as portering); the Criminal Code (1998) which criminalizes practices such as ritual 
</p>
<p>servitude (e.g. trokosi), and the procurement of a person under 21 years of age for 
</p>
<p>prostitution (on condition the youth is not already known to be a prostitute or person of 
</p>
<p>immoral character).16 The 2007 Domestic Violence Act (Act 732) criminalizes various 
</p>
<p>forms of violence, including physical, sexual, and psychological, as well as intimidation, 
</p>
<p>harassment and threats between spouses, intimate partners and family members. It also 
</p>
<p>provides for interventions to rescue and assist victims.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Policy, programme and institutional frameworks 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Social protection programmes  
</b></p>
<p>19. In 2007, the Government of Ghana launched the National Social Protection Strategy, 
</p>
<p>which aims to provide protection to persons living in extreme poverty through a social 
</p>
<p>grant scheme which secures a basic income and a package of complementary inputs. The 
</p>
<p>scheme includes poverty reduction and livelihood empowerment programmes, and is 
</p>
<p>intended to contribute towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>Within this context, the Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty programme (LEAP), a 
</p>
<p>cash transfer programme aimed at providing a safety net for the bottom 20 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>extreme poor in Ghana, was launched in March 2008. As of June 2013, the programme had 
</p>
<p>reached approximately 71,000 households in the 10 regions of the country.17 LEAP grants 
</p>
<p>are conditional on children&#8217;s school attendance and not engaging in child labour. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed, however, that since their establishment programmes 
</p>
<p>under the National Social Protection Strategy had not been monitored for compliance, 
</p>
<p>adjusted to the evolution of recipients&#8217; needs, nor been subject to an impact assessment.

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Policies and programmes on the worst forms of child labour 
</b></p>
<p>20. Ghana launched the National Plan of Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms 
</p>
<p>of Child Labour in 2011, which set out a framework to substantially reduce that 
</p>
<p>phenomenon by 2015. Initiatives were also undertaken to address the problem in specific 
</p>
<p>sectors such as agriculture (cocoa), with the National Plan of Action to Eliminate the Worst 
</p>
<p>Forms of Child Labour in the Cocoa Sector.18  
</p>
<p>21. The Government has in addition participated in a number of projects in cooperation 
</p>
<p>with partners such as the United States of America and international organizations. Many of 
</p>
<p>those have addressed the worst forms of child labour, and targeted the commercial 
</p>
<p>agricultural (cocoa, coffee) sectors, mining and to a lesser extent, fishing. They include a 
</p>
<p>range of activities to strengthen prevention through better access to education, livelihoods 
</p>
<p>for families, teacher-training on child labour, surveys, and awareness-raising through 
</p>
<p>community child protection committees.19 Some other collaborative projects have focused 
</p>
<p>on anti-trafficking of children, child porters (kayayee), and rescue and rehabilitation 
</p>
<p>services for victims.20 Child labour concerns have also been mainstreamed into national 
</p>
<p>agendas such as the Medium-Term National Development Framework of Ghana, and the 
</p>
<p>Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>22. Ghana has developed a number of institutional mechanisms to promote prevention, 
</p>
<p>coordination and law enforcement on issues pertaining to contemporary forms of slavery. 
</p>
<p>First established in 2001, the Ministry of Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs has recently seen 
</p>
<p>its mandate expanded to include social protection, which encompasses the general social 
</p>
<p>welfare system and the management of related programmes, such as the national cash 
</p>
<p>transfer programmes. Now entitled the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, 
</p>
<p>it is the focal point on gender issues, the promotion of equal status for women, and 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights. It is composed of various directorates responsible for, inter alia: domestic 
</p>
<p>violence; human trafficking; child protection; the development of related policies, advocacy 
</p>
<p>tools and statistics; and the monitoring and evaluation of relevant programmes. The 
</p>
<p>Ministry has been consistently challenged by a lack of adequate financial and human 
</p>
<p>resources.  
</p>
<p>23. Other key government institutions include the Ministry of Employment and Labour, 
</p>
<p>and its Child Labour Unit. The latter is responsible for overseeing activities addressing 
</p>
<p>child labour and serves as the secretariat of the National Steering Committee on Child 
</p>
<p>Labour. The Committee includes three subcommittees in charge of awareness-raising, 
</p>
<p>education and skills training, and the worst forms of child labour in the cocoa, fishing and 
</p>
<p>mining sectors. The Ministry has offices at the district level, where it also oversees child 
</p>
<p>protection committees. Labour inspectors within the Ministry enforce labour laws and can 
</p>
<p>inspect both formal and informal workplaces such as private homes. A total of 36 
</p>
<p>institutions and government agencies have signed a memorandum of understanding with the 
</p>
<p>Ministry in order to promote better coordination and implementation of the National Plan of 
</p>
<p>Action (2009&#8211;2015) to Combat the Worst Forms of Child Labour.  
</p>
<p>24. According to information received, challenges faced by the Ministry of Employment 
</p>
<p>and Labour include lack of sufficient funding, weak coordination between ministries party 
</p>
<p>to the memorandum of understanding, failure to draft and share reports, and an insufficient

</p>
<p>number of labour inspectors and material resources (e.g. transportation).21 A further 
</p>
<p>important gap is the almost complete lack of government shelters for victims of illegal 
</p>
<p>labour practices. Although three shelters exist, they are not adequately equipped, so that 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are largely relied upon to assist victims. A similar 
</p>
<p>situation was also described with regard to the lack of shelters for victims of other forms of 
</p>
<p>modern slavery, trafficking and domestic abuse.  
</p>
<p>25. Those various insufficiencies have also resulted in a general lack of disaggregated 
</p>
<p>and reliable data on illegal labour practices and modern forms of slavery, assistance to 
</p>
<p>victims and penalties imposed &#8212; and according to interlocutors render it unlikely that 
</p>
<p>Ghana will achieve its goal to substantially reduce the worst forms of child labour by 2015. 
</p>
<p>26. Government institutions combating human trafficking include the Human 
</p>
<p>Trafficking Secretariat under the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, which 
</p>
<p>coordinates anti-trafficking activities, and the Anti-Trafficking Unit of the Ghana Police 
</p>
<p>Service responsible for enforcement activities. The latter includes nine regional units. Over 
</p>
<p>the past several years, some investigators and prosecutors have received training which has 
</p>
<p>enhanced their investigation capacities, rescues and prosecutions. However, chronic 
</p>
<p>challenges such as the lack of adequate human and material resources (e.g. vehicles, 
</p>
<p>computers), and facilities to shelter and care for victims, as well as weak coordination, 
</p>
<p>reporting practices and sharing of information have also affected the Unit. Although some 
</p>
<p>sporadic information is available on specific cases of rescue and prosecution, to date no 
</p>
<p>database or comprehensive statistics have been maintained, including on prosecutions and 
</p>
<p>sentencing for violations of the Trafficking Act.22 According to interlocutors, these 
</p>
<p>challenges are particularly acute with respect to domestic human trafficking, which is 
</p>
<p>predominant in Ghana, but which receives relatively less attention and resources.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Issues of concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Child labour in the artisanal fishing sector 
</b></p>
<p>27. Critical sectors of Ghana&#8217;s economy, such as the mining, agricultural and fishing 
</p>
<p>sectors use the worst forms of child labour. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur has 
</p>
<p>focused on the artisanal or small-scale fishing sector, which has received comparatively 
</p>
<p>little attention. It is estimated that thousands of children work in the fishing sector, 
</p>
<p>including deep-sea, lagoon and lake fishing. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur found that children, usually boys ranging in age from 3 to 
</p>
<p>12 years old, were entrusted by parents to a middleman who would promise to arrange for a 
</p>
<p>family to take care of the child in return for a few hours of daily work. According to 
</p>
<p>information received, the parents who are generally extremely poor, are sometimes given or 
</p>
<p>promised a small amount of money, in compensation for the work of the child (e.g. ranging 
</p>
<p>from US$ 1 to US$ 25). Many parents however receive no money at all, as they are so 
</p>
<p>destitute they agree to hand over the child simply because they can no longer support the 
</p>
<p>child. In other cases, they trust the trafficker&#8217;s false promises to return with compensation 
</p>
<p>once the child has worked for some years. Promises of compensation for two or three years 
</p>
<p>of work, though rarely honoured, amount to US$ 40 or US$ 50. In cases where there is 
</p>
<p>some form of monetary payment for the child&#8217;s labour it is given to the parents and not the 
</p>
<p>child. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>29. Child labour in the fishing sector is sometimes the result of debt bondage and 
</p>
<p>kidnapping. Children may be given to a middleman for a number of years in payment for 
</p>
<p>money lent to the mother (e.g. to buy bread over a period of time), to pay for a funeral, or to 
</p>
<p>save the family&#8217;s honour (e.g. in payment of an uncle&#8217;s debt). This is frequently 
</p>
<p>accompanied by threats to call the police unless the parent acquiesces. Extended family 
</p>
<p>members, such as an uncle, sometimes use deceit to take the child to the market and sell the 
</p>
<p>child to a middleman, such as when the child is not given voluntarily by the parents in 
</p>
<p>return for forgiveness of his debts. In the above cases, the middleman or intermediary is 
</p>
<p>often a member of the community or a neighbouring community. Random kidnappings of 
</p>
<p>young children by unknown middlemen are also known to occur. 
</p>
<p>30. Lack of effective access to school owing to insufficient places or teachers, distances 
</p>
<p>or related expenses (fees, books, uniforms), was cited by many communities as a key 
</p>
<p>reason why parents sent their children to fishing villages or used them to work in their own 
</p>
<p>community. In two communities the Special Rapporteur visited, 110 children out of over 
</p>
<p>200 reportedly did not go to school due to insufficient access &#8212; there were two teachers for 
</p>
<p>over 200 children &#8212; and lack of means. Parents unable to afford necessary equipment (e.g. 
</p>
<p>tractors, motors for boats) were also more likely to rely on their children to assist with 
</p>
<p>fishing or agriculture. The cost of customary rites, such as those related to marriage and 
</p>
<p>funerals (e.g. officiator fees, dowry) was also noted as another reason. 
</p>
<p>31. While many families near Lake Volta know their child will work on the lake, others 
</p>
<p>are given false information on the location or the type of work the child will be doing. In 
</p>
<p>some cases, the parents may never reunite with their children again as they do not know 
</p>
<p>where they are, due to their young age, the fact that they were moved or retrafficked, or 
</p>
<p>because the child is unwilling to reconnect with parents who had &#8220;sold&#8221; them.  
</p>
<p>32. Once in the fishing village, the child lives with the receiving family. The fishing 
</p>
<p>communities visited by the Special Rapporteur were in remote areas with little road access, 
</p>
<p>or access to services (e.g. health, education). Receiving families in these communities are 
</p>
<p>usually poor themselves, so that children are at risk of malnutrition, poor living conditions, 
</p>
<p>sickness, and little if any education. The small fishing boats are usually old rudimentary 
</p>
<p>wooden rowing boats, most of which have no motors. Interlocutors noted that it was often 
</p>
<p>the poorest fishing families without motor boats that used child labour, since the work for 
</p>
<p>those with motor boats was easier and faster, thereby making it unnecessary to use 
</p>
<p>hazardous child labour. 
</p>
<p>33. Fishing activities present multiple dangers for children, including physical injuries 
</p>
<p>or death due to tree stumps in the water, dangerous fish, diving and untangling of nets 
</p>
<p>underwater. The latter can result in drowning when children get trapped in nets which travel 
</p>
<p>with water currents, or which cannot be seen at the bottom of the lake due to the muddy 
</p>
<p>waters. The paddling and hauling of boats can cause permanent physical damage to a young 
</p>
<p>child when it is too demanding, in some situations even death. Children are at risk of 
</p>
<p>physical abuse, which includes beatings with boat paddles or ropes.  
</p>
<p>34. Young children of 4 or 5 years of age are usually preferred as they are docile and 
</p>
<p>more willing to accept the new &#8220;family&#8221;. At that age, they begin by scooping water from 
</p>
<p>the boat, then move to paddling as they get older and later to diving. Workdays can begin in 
</p>
<p>the middle of the night and end at 8 p.m. Some girls are also sent to fishing villages. They 
</p>
<p>are used to do household chores, mend fishing nets, smoke fish, and are often subject to 
</p>
<p>rape and sexual slavery. 
</p>
<p><b>  Responses and challenges  
</b></p>
<p>35. A number of projects have been developed for sending communities in order to stem 
</p>
<p>the practice of child exploitation in the fishing sector. During her field visits, the Special </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur had the opportunity to observe two such projects, namely the Tree of Life 
</p>
<p>project, and a child protection programme which is being rolled out in six communities in 
</p>
<p>the Volta region by IOM and UNICEF. Both seek to raise awareness of communities at 
</p>
<p>risk, improve understanding of child development, and protect against child trafficking and 
</p>
<p>the worst forms of child labour. The implementation of these programmes relies on a 
</p>
<p>network of trained local volunteers. The Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection 
</p>
<p>also implements awareness-raising activities using a Committee Model Approach, whereby 
</p>
<p>local communities which have been trained, in turn expand and raise awareness in 
</p>
<p>neighbouring communities. 
</p>
<p>36. Those programmes have had a measure of success in that they have contributed to 
</p>
<p>prevention, but also to rescue operations of affected children and the establishment of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;slavery-free&#8221; fishing communities. In one fishing community visited by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, 74 children had been rescued from slavery in 2012. Under the leadership of the 
</p>
<p>community chief, the village was subsequently declared a child slavery-free community. In 
</p>
<p>another fishing village, a policy of no child slavery was adopted due to the awareness-
</p>
<p>raising activities of local volunteers and members of the community&#8217;s teacher-parent 
</p>
<p>association. To be sustainable however, the Special Rapporteur stresses the need to support 
</p>
<p>the important work being done by these networks of local volunteers with logistical, 
</p>
<p>material and financial support (e.g. for transportation, training materials, stipend). In some 
</p>
<p>communities where the lack of access to education was a key issue, projects to combat the 
</p>
<p>worst forms of child labour focused on establishing a school, equipping it, and ensuring 
</p>
<p>sufficient teachers. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur found that the Government social protection programmes 
</p>
<p>(e.g. cash transfer, microcredits) were benefited by some residents of the sending and 
</p>
<p>fishing communities she visited. However, it was noted that the payments were not received 
</p>
<p>at scheduled intervals, making it difficult for families to plan, and that there was confusion 
</p>
<p>regarding the criteria for receiving and calculating the amount of the benefits.  
</p>
<p>38. While the Police Human Anti-Trafficking Programme Fund was established to 
</p>
<p>provide assistance and support services to victims of human trafficking, those activities 
</p>
<p>have never been adequately implemented due to insufficient funds. This has resulted in a 
</p>
<p>chronic gap in the Government&#8217;s response to child labour in the fishing and in other sectors, 
</p>
<p>namely, the lack of adequate government shelters and care services to assist victims once 
</p>
<p>they are rescued.23 As such, it is largely NGOs who assist children through the first months 
</p>
<p>following their rescue. In addition to material needs (e.g. shelter, food, education), children 
</p>
<p>are generally provided with counselling services, family reconciliation or alternative care 
</p>
<p>arrangement (foster parents), and livelihood or other assistance to the family (e.g. 
</p>
<p>microcredits). The duration of children&#8217;s stay at a shelter will often depend on the situation 
</p>
<p>they have been exposed to, trauma suffered, how long they have been trafficked, and their 
</p>
<p>medical condition. Girls often stay longer due to the trauma and medical problems suffered 
</p>
<p>as a result of sexual abuse. However, local NGOs in this field can often be in a precarious 
</p>
<p>financial situation as their activities are dependent on stable donor funding. It is therefore 
</p>
<p>critical that the Government ensure State protection and care for the most vulnerable 
</p>
<p>persons in society by providing adequate resources towards assistance for victims. Some 
</p>
<p>interlocutors noted that despite legislative provisions (in human trafficking and domestic 
</p>
<p>violence laws) stipulating that those services be rendered free of charge to the victim, the 
</p>
<p>current practice is to request a fee (approximately 100 cedis) for those services, as well as 
</p>
<p>to launch a formal complaint for the purposes of a prosecution. Further challenges relate to 
</p>

<p>the worst forms of child labour, and the need to strengthen law enforcement and NGO legal 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Portering/kayayee 
</b></p>
<p>39. Kayayee is the name given to girls or young women in Ghana who work in city 
</p>
<p>marketplaces as a head porter, i.e. carrying the loads of market vendors and shoppers in 
</p>
<p>buckets or baskets balanced on their head for a fee. Mainly undertaken in the past by young 
</p>
<p>men pushing carts as a temporary livelihood strategy (during high unemployment following 
</p>
<p>Ghana&#8217;s independence), the practice was overtaken in the 1970s by young women willing 
</p>
<p>to accept lower fees.24 Their situation has worsened over time, as the growing number of 
</p>
<p>kayayee has forced wages to plummet further; average daily earnings are estimated at 10 to 
</p>
<p>30 cedis (US$ 3&#8211;9).25 
</p>
<p>40. Estimates on the number of girls and women working as kayayee are difficult to 
</p>
<p>ascertain, in part due to the rapid rate of spontaneous urbanization and the often seasonal 
</p>
<p>nature of the work, as they tend to migrate during the dry season in the north. While one 
</p>
<p>estimate places the number of kayayee at nearly 8,000, others estimate that there are tens of 
</p>
<p>thousands of kayayee in Ghana.26 They are between 10 and 35 years of age, although the 
</p>
<p>vast majority are younger than 25. Most girls are functionally illiterate and between 10 and 
</p>
<p>14 years old when they first migrate to work as kayayee.27 
</p>
<p>41. An urban slum phenomenon, the majority of kayayee migrate to Accra and other 
</p>
<p>cities in the south from rural areas in the country&#8217;s northern regions. They belong chiefly to 
</p>
<p>the Mamprusi group and Muslim communities, though a minority come from other ethnic 
</p>
<p>backgrounds, regions and religions.28 Uneven regional development and lack of 
</p>
<p>employment opportunities, which have fuelled poverty, are the overriding reason for the 
</p>
<p>practice. Family violence, escape from forced or bad marriages, and better access to 
</p>
<p>services in the city than in areas of origin, have also been noted as motivating factors.  
</p>
<p>42. Most girls appear to migrate voluntarily, on their own, to work as kayayee. 
</p>
<p>However, there are indications that organized networks are increasingly recruiting girls 
</p>
<p>from poor families29 on false promises of good jobs or an education in the city. Once in the 
</p>
<p>markets, they are subject to exploitation. Without sufficient support and resources, many 
</p>
<p>are reduced to living on the streets and sleeping in the open in the markets where they 
</p>
<p>work, or in the most polluted and dangerous slums of the city. Kayayee are vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>forced evictions, disease, work injuries, physical harm including sexual violence, 
</p>
<p>unplanned pregnancies, illegal abortions and human trafficking. They often have to accept 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;protection&#8221; of older street boys or self-appointed protectors, which they pay for 
</p>
<p>through sex or a monetary sum. In some cases, girls can also be lured or coerced into child 
</p>
<p>prostitution. 
</p>
<p>43. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to meet with a group of 
</p>
<p>approximately 80 young women and children working as kayayee or accompanying them,

<p>in one of the markets in Accra. The majority indicated that they had come to the city to do 
</p>
<p>that work in order to survive, help their families at home, or enable their children to go to 
</p>
<p>school. Many had small children accompanying them, ranging from toddlers to 6 to 8 year-
</p>
<p>olds. The latter, often a family member (e.g. younger sister or cousin) would accompany 
</p>
<p>the kayayee in order to carry her baby throughout the day &#8212; thereby freeing the kayayee to 
</p>
<p>do her job. Most slept out in the open in the marketplace, usually in groups for fear of being 
</p>
<p>attacked, raped at night or having their children kidnapped. Very small children, under 
</p>
<p>2 years old and barely dressed in rags or completely naked, played and slept directly in the 
</p>
<p>mud and garbage of the market floor. A &#8220;queen mother&#8221; accompanied by a man introduced 
</p>
<p>themselves as representatives and protectors of the kayayee in that market. For that, the 
</p>
<p>kayayee appeared to be expected to provide a fee, to cover the &#8220;expenses&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>44. Some interlocutors expressed the view that while some might view kayayee as 
</p>
<p>victims of exploitation, they earned more income and were able to access more services 
</p>
<p>than at home, so that it represented a better alternative to staying in their areas of origin.  
</p>
<p><b>  Responses and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>45. A number of initiatives by the Government, civil society and international 
</p>
<p>organizations in Ghana have tried to address both the causes and consequences of work as a 
</p>
<p>kayayee, especially with regard to children. Urban informal work, such as portering, has 
</p>
<p>been listed for instance as one of the worst forms of child labour to be eliminated. In order 
</p>
<p>to diminish the need for women and girls to migrate to the south, the Government has also 
</p>
<p>developed some livelihood and skill development projects in the northern regions, 
</p>
<p>including in the context of programmes such as LEAP, and implemented other social 
</p>
<p>protection and cash transfer programmes. However, as those social programmes still have 
</p>
<p>very limited population and geographic reach, many do not have access to them. It was also 
</p>
<p>noted that livelihood projects implemented in northern communities, such as soap-making, 
</p>
<p>often failed to provide a sufficient income, such that girls kept returning to urban areas to 
</p>
<p>supplement it. The seasonal nature of work of kayayee, who generally migrate to work in 
</p>
<p>the city during the dry season, further makes it difficult to ensure continuity in programmes 
</p>
<p>such as skills training provided in the host city.  
</p>
<p>46. NGOs and international organizations such as IOM, UNFPA and UNICEF have also 
</p>
<p>implemented programmes, often in partnership with the Government, to address short and 
</p>
<p>long-term vulnerabilities, and improve girls&#8217; lives within their native communities. Those 
</p>
<p>diverse programmes promote, inter alia: alternative livelihoods; awareness of reproductive 
</p>
<p>health, HIV and AIDS, and risks of migration; legal literacy; monitoring in host cities and 
</p>
<p>development in communities of origin.30 
</p>
<p>47. Government interlocutors expressed concern regarding the increasing number of 
</p>
<p>kayayee and other forms of &#8220;streetism&#8221; in Ghana&#8217;s expanding cities &#8212; a phenomenon 
</p>
<p>largely described as a purely economic rather than a social problem, to be solved through 
</p>
<p>economic development initiatives. The Special Rapporteur regrets that due to that 
</p>
<p>perspective, too little attention has been paid to the gender, child protection and other 
</p>
<p>human rights dimensions of the issue. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Sexual exploitation and abuse  
</b></p>
<p>48. The sexual exploitation and abuse of children and adults in Ghana take many forms. 
</p>
<p>The most blatant manifestation is the growing number of women, girls and increasingly 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 30 For success and lessons learned, see UNFPA, <i>Good Practices</i>.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>also boys, being used for commercial sexual exploitation across Ghana, including within 
</p>
<p>the tourism industry. One study estimated that in Accra alone, there were over 120 brothels 
</p>
<p>where young girls were forced into prostitution, while many others were sent abroad for the 
</p>
<p>same purpose.31 
</p>
<p>49. In other cases, sexual exploitation takes place as a by-product or consequence of 
</p>
<p>children working in the worst forms of child labour, including in the mining, fishing and 
</p>
<p>agricultural sectors. While some boys are also affected, girls sent to work in the households 
</p>
<p>of fishing communities around the Volta region are frequently sexually exploited and used 
</p>
<p>by fishermen and older boys. In the mining sector, it is common for girls as young as 
</p>
<p>10 years of age to be sexually exploited by mine workers who support them financially in 
</p>
<p>exchange for sex, and by galamsey (i.e. informal mining) gang masters who traffic them 
</p>
<p>into sexual slavery.32 Urban street workers (e.g. vendors, kayayee) and domestic workers 
</p>
<p>most of whom are children, are also at risk of sexual assault, exploitation, or of being 
</p>
<p>trafficked or sold into sexual slavery.  
</p>
<p>50. Children who live on the streets, estimated in one study at 50,000, can be victimized 
</p>
<p>by sexual predators, forced into survival sex (i.e. exchange of sex for material necessities or 
</p>
<p>protection), or subjected to commercial sexual exploitation.33 Trokosi, a form of 
</p>
<p>religious/ritual servitude still practised in parts of the country, includes the use of the child 
</p>
<p>for sexual purposes by a fetish priest.  
</p>
<p>51. Poverty, migration to urban areas in precarious conditions, and child neglect or 
</p>
<p>abandonment have also resulted in the forming of sexually exploitative relationships, which 
</p>
<p>might not be considered commercial sexual exploitation per se. The Special Rapporteur had 
</p>
<p>the opportunity to meet a group of 50 girls in that situation during an awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>session on reproductive health being conducted at a community centre in Accra by a local 
</p>
<p>NGO. Nearly all the girls, who were between 12 and 18 years of age, came from single-
</p>
<p>parent households headed by the mother and lived in a precarious social and financial 
</p>
<p>situation. Most often the separation of the parents (often due to domestic violence or 
</p>
<p>alcoholism) or the death or abandonment by the father had left the family in a state of 
</p>
<p>destitution. The experiences and stories narrated by the girls revealed a pattern of 
</p>
<p>dependence on boyfriends and multiple sexual relationships which helped them meet their 
</p>
<p>material needs. A significant number had also borne children from those relationships, 
</p>
<p>thereby limiting their availability to engage in those relationships and placing them at risk 
</p>
<p>of commercial sexual activity, unless they were able to find an alternative form of 
</p>
<p>livelihood. Sexual abuse and exploitation in its various forms not only continue to have an 
</p>
<p>impact on the lives of children into adulthood, but in some cases may become more 
</p>
<p>pronounced, as they may be forced to adopt increasingly risky survival strategies to sustain 
</p>
<p>their dependants and themselves.  
</p>
<p><b>  Responses and challenges 
</b></p>
<p>52. A number of NGOs, such as International Needs, have begun to address the situation 
</p>
<p>of girls at risk or who are already victims of sexual exploitation, especially in urban areas. 
</p>
<p>Some provide comprehensive programmes offering awareness-raising sessions (e.g. on 
</p>
<p>reproductive health, domestic violence), apprenticeships, educational and livelihood 
</p>
<p>support, as well as family counselling and financial assistance (e.g. microcredits, stipends)

</p>
<p>to assist parents or guardians. Most girls benefiting from the programme range from 12 to 
</p>
<p>18 years of age. Despite such initiatives, the Government and other stakeholders have paid 
</p>
<p>considerably less attention to sexual exploitation and sex trafficking than to child labour.34 
</p>
<p>53. Traditional cultural and livelihood practices, such as fostering,35 which have in the 
</p>
<p>past been viewed positively, have given way to negative manifestations under conditions of 
</p>
<p>poverty, breakdown of the family and community ties, and urbanization. In many cases, the 
</p>
<p>exploitative child labour that takes place under the guise of these practices, as well as the 
</p>
<p>sexual abuse and exploitation that accompany them may go unrecognized or ignored due to 
</p>
<p>extreme poverty or shame.  
</p>
<p>54. A number of legal gaps leave children and youth vulnerable to sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p>The Criminal Code of 1998 prohibits the procurement of any person under 21 years of age, 
</p>
<p>who is not a &#8220;prostitute or of known immoral character&#8221;. Children who have already been 
</p>
<p>victims of commercial sexual exploitation are therefore unprotected and their &#8220;moral 
</p>
<p>standing&#8221; subject to scrutiny.36 The Code also fails to provide specifically for offences 
</p>
<p>relating to pornography and pornographic performances by a child under 18.37 
</p>
<p>55. Protection against sex trafficking and exploitation of adults is comparatively weak, 
</p>
<p>as most efforts have been devoted to combating child exploitation and labour trafficking.38 
</p>
<p>Forms of sexual exploitation not considered commercial are also often complex to address. 
</p>
<p>In addition to better social protection systems and improvements to the status of women, it 
</p>
<p>is necessary to improve access to higher education, health (including reproductive rights) 
</p>
<p>and livelihoods, and set in place positive measures to combat discrimination of girls and 
</p>
<p>women in law and in practice.  
</p>
<p>56. Other challenges include police abuse of female sex workers&#8217; human rights, a 
</p>
<p>widespread problem requiring improved training of police officers and better understanding 
</p>
<p>of their human rights and laws relevant to commercial sex workers; and the lack of 
</p>
<p>adequate government support and assistance services (e.g. shelters) for victims of 
</p>
<p>exploitation,39 including sexual exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Further issues requiring attention 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic servitude and slavery 
</b></p>
<p>57. Although the use of child labour in domestic service has been long-standing, 
</p>
<p>especially in the Ashanti and Greater Accra regions,40 there are no reliable data on the 
</p>
<p>extent of the problem of domestic servitude among children in Ghana. Children, between 
</p>
<p>the ages of 11 and 16, often enter into domestic slavery either through the tradition of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;fostering&#8221; or recruitment by traffickers among poor rural communities who promise work 
</p>
<p>for the child in the city in exchange for shelter and food, and at times a minimal income. 
</p>
<p>Increasingly, the tradition of fostering has been used as a pretext to commercialize child 
</p>

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>domestic servitude and has become the domain of traffickers.41 Children working in this 
</p>
<p>sector are particularly at risk of physical and sexual abuse, long working days of 8 to 12 
</p>
<p>hours, insufficient rest, and have little or no access to education, amounting to one of the 
</p>
<p>worst forms of child labour as per ILO Convention No. 182. In many instances, they are 
</p>
<p>also subject to other indignities such as not being provided with any sleeping area, and not 
</p>
<p>being permitted to use the same toilet. Their situation is typically characterized by material 
</p>
<p>and financial dependency, as they work for bed and board only, or when payment is given, 
</p>
<p>it is provided to the parents (typically upon receipt of the child or after a period of work by 
</p>
<p>the child). In some cases, the children run away and once in the street need &#8220;protectors&#8221; 
</p>
<p>who beat, use them sexually or for other types of slave labour.  
</p>
<p>58. According to information received, it is predominantly girls and women from poor 
</p>
<p>regions of the country (e.g. the northern region) who work as domestic servants in 
</p>
<p>metropolitan areas. While girl children are preferred because they are perceived as more 
</p>
<p>easily controlled, boys and adults can also become victims of domestic servitude.  
</p>
<p>59. Domestic servitude or slavery is often characterized by exploitation; the fact that it 
</p>
<p>takes place primarily in and around the household of the perpetrator; a relationship of 
</p>
<p>economic (or other dependency) on other persons such that the victim cannot end the 
</p>
<p>relationship on its own; and restrictions on freedom of movement and communication so 
</p>
<p>that the victim becomes virtually invisible and socially isolated.42 
</p>
<p>60. The Government of Ghana has listed domestic service in the category of the worst 
</p>
<p>forms of child labour, developed a related national action plan, and put in place anti-human 
</p>
<p>trafficking and labour laws. However, implementation of those laws and policies, which has 
</p>
<p>been weak, is further challenged by the fact that those abuses take place in private homes 
</p>
<p>and the informal sector, which labour authorities seldom monitor.43 
</p>
<p><b> B. Ritual servitude  
</b></p>
<p>61. The practice of trokosi is a form of ritual or religious servitude, which has existed 
</p>
<p>for centuries in some areas of the country, whereby a family gives one of their children, 
</p>
<p>usually a young girl between 6 and 10 years of age, to a traditional fetish shrine in 
</p>
<p>atonement for their family members&#8217; sins.44 According to interlocutors with whom the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur met, the practice continues to exist in some parts of the country, despite 
</p>
<p>legislation and awareness-raising efforts which have succeeded in diminishing the 
</p>
<p>prevalence of the practice.  
</p>
<p>62. Through the ritual of trokosi, the fetish priest becomes the custodian of the girl that 
</p>
<p>has been given to the shrine. Once she has reached puberty the trokosi is given in marriage 
</p>
<p>to the shrine&#8217;s priest who is entitled to sleep with her in order to consummate the marriage 
</p>
<p>between her and the gods. In this capacity and as her custodian, she belongs to the priest, 
</p>
<p>who can beat her and use her for sex, in addition to the ritual duties, domestic chores and 
</p>
<p>farming work she must perform. She is expected to work long hours, for which she does not 
</p>
<p>receive any payment. Her family is to provide for her food and any other necessities.45 In 
</p>
<p>some cases she is not permitted to wear clothes, except for a loin cloth. Although the girl 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 41 The tradition of fostering is also used to deceive families and lure children into other sectors, such as 
</p>
<p>mining, fishing and cocoa. 
</p>
<p> 42 See A/HRC/15/20, paras. 17&#8211;18 and 23&#8211;26. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/53/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>lives in a shrine that is part of a community, she does not mingle or participate in its 
</p>
<p>activities, and is considered evil. 
</p>
<p>63. Having been raised to accept her life as a trokosi from a young age, girls are not 
</p>
<p>generally in a position to be able to refuse. Moreover, once given to the shrine, it is not 
</p>
<p>acceptable for the parents to change their minds, and reintegration into the original 
</p>
<p>community and family is difficult &#8212; as she is generally no longer accepted by them. If the 
</p>
<p>trokosi has daughters, they will also have certain obligations to the shrine. In some cases, 
</p>
<p>where the family is willing and able to pay for a special ceremony, the trokosi can be 
</p>
<p>released from servitude after several years, although she will continue to perform some of 
</p>
<p>the rituals at the shrine. While she is technically allowed to marry, in practice men will be 
</p>
<p>unwilling to marry a former trokosi. Should she die, the family is expected to replace her 
</p>
<p>with another girl.46 
</p>
<p>64. The Government of Ghana and the Commission on Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Administrative Justice have expressed strong opposition to the practice of trokosi, which is 
</p>
<p>considered a form of ritual or customary servitude prohibited by the 1998 Criminal Code, 
</p>
<p>and liable to a minimum of three years&#8217; imprisonment.47 However, according to information 
</p>
<p>received, local authorities in some districts remain reluctant to enforce the law against ritual 
</p>
<p>servitude fearing popular backlash or negative spiritual consequences for themselves, while 
</p>
<p>some elected politicians fear alienating key constituencies. Some intellectual and 
</p>
<p>traditionalist groups have defended trokosi as an indigenous religious tradition that provides 
</p>
<p>girls with a form of apprenticeship, or maintain that the practice is part of Ghanaian culture 
</p>
<p>and should not be prohibited by law.48 According to interlocutors, although the practice has 
</p>
<p>diminished it continues to persist in shrines in certain areas, such as the Volta and Greater 
</p>
<p>Accra region, indicating that it must continue to be monitored and further action be taken to 
</p>
<p>enforce the law, and release and assist the remaining trokosi. Beyond legal enforcement 
</p>
<p>alone however, which risks driving the practice further underground, more efforts must be 
</p>
<p>made to engage with traditional communities with a view to addressing the deep-seated 
</p>
<p>cultural beliefs supporting the practice.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Servile marriages 
</b></p>
<p>65. Servile marriage, which affects both children and adults, is usually characterized by 
</p>
<p>the inability to escape the marriage due to lack of economic or social support (often due to 
</p>
<p>cultural or religious beliefs); social or legal norms which fail to safeguard property, custody 
</p>
<p>or other rights; the presence of sexual and physical abuse, and domestic servitude.49 Servile 
</p>
<p>marriage occurs most often as a result of forced and early marriage, and affects girls and 
</p>
<p>women disproportionally due to gender inequalities and prejudices.50 
</p>
<p>66. According to UNFPA, Ghana has one of the highest child marriage rates in the 
</p>
<p>world, with an estimated average of one out of four girls being married before their 
</p>
<p>eighteenth birthday. While the national average is 25 per cent, due to regional disparities 
</p>
<p>rates of child marriage can be as high as 39 and 50 per cent, such as in the Upper East and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>Upper West areas of the country. Child marriage is most prevalent among girls who are the 
</p>
<p>least educated, poorest and living in rural areas.51  
</p>
<p>67. According to interlocutors, forced early marriage is associated with the tradition of 
</p>
<p>fostering, which has over the years been transformed into an exchange. The child, usually a 
</p>
<p>girl, is betrothed in early childhood (e.g. 4 years of age) to an older man (e.g. 40), with 
</p>
<p>whom she goes to live at the age of 10 or 12. This effectively ends her schooling. However, 
</p>
<p>due to legislation, this tradition is largely being driven underground.  
</p>
<p>68. Once married only an estimated 13.6 per cent of girls use contraception, and of 
</p>
<p>these, few feel that their demands for contraception have been satisfied, resulting in a high 
</p>
<p>adolescent pregnancy rate of 66/1,000 women.52 In addition to cultural, religious and 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic factors such as poverty, interlocutors noted that children are often married 
</p>
<p>early because they start to &#8220;misbehave&#8221;, or because of the financial benefit it brings to the 
</p>
<p>family. The issue is especially acute in more remote areas, where there may be insufficient 
</p>
<p>access to schools and girls may get pregnant early.  
</p>
<p>69. While forced marriage is criminalized and the legal age for marriage is 18 years of 
</p>
<p>age (and 16 with parental consent or approval by a pertinent authority), early marriages 
</p>
<p>continue to be performed as the law is not adequately enforced. Moreover, as they are not 
</p>
<p>permitted by law, these marriages are unregistered, placing the woman in a position where 
</p>
<p>she has few matrimonial rights or forms of legal redress. The practice whereby the groom&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>family pays a dowry to the bride&#8217;s family, which can lead to her treatment as property, 
</p>
<p>continues to be widespread in Ghana, and polygamy, which is practised especially in the 
</p>
<p>three northern regions of the country, is accepted under customary law. Abuses within 
</p>
<p>polygamous unions often include early marriages, which are unregistered, and the different 
</p>
<p>status of the different wives, which renders some vulnerable to mistreatment. Experts on the 
</p>
<p>practice noted how the inability to sustain the many children resulting from polygamous 
</p>
<p>marriages resulted in the need to marry the children at a young age, so that early marriage 
</p>
<p>becomes an offshoot of polygamy. 
</p>
<p>70. Servile marriages are further perpetuated by widespread domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>considered acceptable by a significant percentage of women and men,53 and the absence of 
</p>
<p>a spousal property regime in the country. Although the enactment of the Domestic Violence 
</p>
<p>Act 732 (2007) proscribes this type of violence and provides for assistance to victims, its 
</p>
<p>implementation has been problematic. Areas of concern include the lack of capacity of the 
</p>
<p>staff of the police domestic violence support unit; the absence of women&#8217;s shelters (there is 
</p>
<p>only one, run by an NGO); the need, in practice, for the victim to pay for the medical 
</p>
<p>examination, which is necessary for a successful prosecution; and the attempts to arrive at 
</p>
<p>&#8220;settlements&#8221; between the perpetrator and the woman, either through spot settlements by 
</p>
<p>the police or referral to an alternative dispute resolution mechanism by the Court.54 
</p>
<p>71. Also of deep concern, despite various attempts made over the years to introduce a 
</p>
<p>spousal property regime, as required by the 1992 Constitution, the Property Rights of 
</p>
<p>Spouses Bill continues to encounter delays in Parliament55 &#8212; a situation which perpetuates 
</p>
<p>dependency and fails to affirm these important rights for women within marriage. <b>

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Government of Ghana has taken significant steps to enact legislation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop action plans, together with domestic and international stakeholders, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>combat the worst forms of child labour and child slavery in Ghana. It has also 
</b></p>
<p><b>adopted some measures to try to address issues such as domestic violence, human 
</b></p>
<p><b>trafficking, harmful traditional practices and poverty. However, implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>those measures has been inconsistent and ineffective, due in part to inadequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>allocation of resources. As such, poverty and exploitation of children and adults 
</b></p>
<p><b>remain persistent and urgent problems, law enforcement efforts are weak, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>government victim assistance and support services virtually non-existent. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Children and youth in Ghana are especially impacted by high levels of poverty, 
</b></p>
<p><b>unemployment, abuse and parental neglect, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation in 
</b></p>
<p><b>its various manifestations. Unequal regional development and the lack of effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to adequate education, health and other services, as well as livelihoods in parts 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the country, are noted as key reasons for sending children to work, or for migration 
</b></p>
<p><b>to urban areas </b>&#8212;<b> often under precarious conditions exposing them to human 
</b></p>
<p><b>traffickers, exploitation and life in urban slums that are growing rapidly. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Adults are also impacted by situations of exploitation and slavery. Yet, too little 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention has been given to their protection. Equally, domestic human trafficking and 
</b></p>
<p><b>slavery, which are prevalent in Ghana, have been given insufficient attention and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In the light of the findings in the present report the Special Rapporteur makes 
</b></p>
<p><b>the following recommendations to the Government of Ghana. 
</b></p>
<p><b>International conventions 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Ratify and/or adopt implementing legislation with regard to: 1926 Slavery 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention; 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave 
</b></p>
<p><b>Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery; Optional Protocol to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention on the Rights of Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</b></p>
<p><b>pornography; Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Institutional approaches 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Establish systems to ensure a better flow of information from the bottom up, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including through better representative and participatory approaches, in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that legislation, policies and programmes reflect the concerns and challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the ground and provide more effective responses. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Revise legislation from the human rights perspective, including establishment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of compensation and further integration. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Strengthen human rights analysis and address the causes and consequences of 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary forms of slavery and exploitation, including poverty, discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>harmful traditional practices, and lack of effective access to economic and social 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights.  
</b></p>
<p>80. Address the country&#8217;s human development deficits, including those
