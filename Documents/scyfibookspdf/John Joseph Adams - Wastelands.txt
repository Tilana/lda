I - STEPHEN KING - THE END OF THE WHOLE MESS
I want to tell you abo-ut the end of war, the de-ge-ne-ra-ti-on of man-kind, and the de-ath of the
Mes-si-ah-an epic story, de-ser-ving tho-usands of pa-ges and a who-le shelf of vo-lu-mes, but you (if
the-re are any "you" la-ter on to re-ad this) will ha-ve to set-tle for the fre-eze-dri-ed ver-si-on. The
di-rect inj-ec-ti-on works very fast. I fi-gu-re I’ve got so-mew-he-re bet-we-en forty-fi-ve mi-nu-tes
and two ho-urs, de-pen-ding on my blo-od-type. I think it's A, which sho-uld gi-ve me a lit-tle mo-re
ti-me, but I'll be god-dam-ned if I can re-mem-ber for su-re. If it turns out to be O, you co-uld be in for
a lot of blank pa-ges, my hypot-he-ti-cal fri-end.
In any event, I think may-be I'd bet-ter as-su-me the worst and go as fast as I can.
I'm using the elect-ric typew-ri-ter-Bob-by's word-pro-ces-sor is fas-ter, but the genny's cycle is too
ir-re-gu-lar to be trus-ted, even with the li-ne sup-pres-sor. I've only got one shot at this; I can't risk
get-ting most of the way ho-me and then se-e-ing the who-le thing go to da-ta he-aven be-ca-use of an
ohm drop, or a sur-ge too gre-at for the sup-pres-sor to co-pe with. My na-me is Ho-ward For-noy. I
was a fre-elan-ce wri-ter. My brot-her, Ro-bert For-noy, was the Mes-si-ah. I kil-led him by sho-oting
him up with his own dis-co-very fo-ur ho-urs ago. He cal-led it The Cal-ma-ti-ve. A Very Se-ri-o-us

Mis-ta-ke might ha-ve be-en a bet-ter na-me, but what's do-ne is do-ne and can't be un-do-ne, as the
Irish ha-ve be-en sa-ying for cen-tu-ri-es… which pro-ves what as-sho-les they are.
Shit, I can’t af-ford the-se dig-res-si-ons.
After Bobby di-ed I co-ve-red him with a qu-ilt and sat at the ca-bin's sing-le li-ving ro-om win-dow
for so-me three ho-urs, lo-oking out at the wo-ods. Used to be you co-uld see the oran-ge glow of the
hi-inten-sity arc-so-di-um’s from North Con-way, but no mo-re. Now the-re's just the Whi-te
Mo-un-ta-ins, lo-oking li-ke dark tri-ang-les of cre-pe pa-per cut out by a child, and the po-int-less
stars.
I tur-ned on the ra-dio, di-al-led thro-ugh fo-ur bands, fo-und one crazy guy, and shut it off. I sat
the-re thin-king of ways to tell this story. My mind kept sli-ding away to-ward all tho-se mi-les of dark
pi-ne-wo-ods, all that not-hing. Fi-nal-ly I re-ali-zed I ne-eded to get myself off the di-me and sho-ot
myself up. Shit. I ne-ver co-uld work wit-ho-ut a de-ad-li-ne.
And I've su-re-to-God got one now.
Our pa-rents had no re-ason to ex-pect anyt-hing ot-her than what they got: bright child-ren. Dad was
a his-tory ma-j-or who had be-co-me a full pro-fes-sor at Hofst-ra when he was thirty. Ten ye-ars la-ter
he was one of six vi-ce-admi-nist-ra-tors of the Na-ti-onal Arc-hi-ves in Was-hing-ton, D.C., and in
li-ne for the top spot. He was a hel-lu-va go-od guy, too-had every re-cord Chuck Berry ever cut and
pla-yed a pretty me-an blu-es gu-itar him-self. My dad fi-led by day and roc-ked by night.
Mom gra-du-ated mag-na cum la-ude from Drew. Got a Phi Be-ta Kap-pa key she so-me-ti-mes
wo-re on this funky fe-do-ra she had. She be-ca-me a suc-ces-sful CPA in D.C., met my dad, mar-ri-ed
him, and to-ok in her shing-le when she be-ca-me preg-nant with yo-urs truly. I ca-me along in 1980. By
'84 she was do-ing ta-xes for so-me of my dad's as-so-ci-ates-she cal-led this her "lit-tle hobby." By the
ti-me Bobby was born in 1987, she was hand-ling ta-xes, in-vest-ment port-fo-li-os, and
es-ta-te-plan-ning for a do-zen po-wer-ful men. I co-uld na-me them, but who gi-ves a wad? They're
eit-her de-ad or dri-vel-ling idi-ots by now.
I think she pro-bably ma-de mo-re out of "her lit-tle hobby" each ye-ar than my dad ma-de at his job,
but that ne-ver mat-te-red-they we-re happy with what they we-re to them-sel-ves and to each ot-her. I
saw them squ-ab-ble lots of ti-mes, but I ne-ver saw them fight. When I was gro-wing up, the only
dif-fe-ren-ce I saw bet-we-en my mom and my play-ma-tes' moms was that the-ir moms used to re-ad
or iron or sew or talk on the pho-ne whi-le the so-aps pla-yed on the tu-be, and my mom used to run a
poc-ket cal-cu-la-tor and wri-te down num-bers on big gre-en she-ets of pa-per whi-le the so-aps
pla-yed on the tu-be.
I was no di-sap-po-int-ment to a co-up-le of pe-op-le with Men-sa Gold Cards in the-ir wal-lets. I
ma-in-ta-ined A's and B's thro-ugh my pub-lic-scho-ol ca-re-er (the idea that eit-her I or my brot-her
might go to a pri-va-te scho-ol was ne-ver even dis-cus-sed so far as I know). I al-so wro-te well early,
with no ef-fort at all. I sold my first ma-ga-zi-ne pi-ece when I was twenty-it was on how the
Con-ti-nen-tal Army win-te-red at Val-ley For-ge. I sold it to an air-li-ne ma-ga-zi-ne for fo-ur hund-red
fifty dol-lars. My dad, whom I lo-ved de-eply, as-ked me if he co-uld buy that check from me. He ga-ve
me his own per-so-nal check and had the check from the air-li-ne ma-ga-zi-ne fra-med and hung it over
his desk. A ro-man-tic ge-ni-us, if you will. A ro-man-tic blu-es pla-ying ge-ni-us, if you will. Ta-ke it
from me, a kid co-uld do a lot wor-se. Of co-ur-se he and my mot-her both di-ed ra-ving and pis-sing in
the-ir pants la-te last ye-ar, li-ke al-most ever-yo-ne el-se on this big ro-und world of ours, but I ne-ver
stop-ped lo-ving eit-her of them.
I was the sort of child they had every re-ason to ex-pect-a go-od boy with a bright mind, a ta-len-ted
boy who-se ta-lent grew to early ma-tu-rity in an at-mosp-he-re of lo-ve and con-fi-den-ce, a fa-ith-ful
boy who lo-ved and res-pec-ted his mom and dad.
Bobby was dif-fe-rent. No-body, not even Men-sa types li-ke our folks, ever ex-pects a kid li-ke
Bobby. Not ever.
I pot-ty-tra-ined two full ye-ars ear-li-er than Bob, and that was the only thing in which I ever be-at

him. But I ne-ver felt je-alo-us of him; that wo-uld ha-ve be-en li-ke a fa-irly go-od Ame-ri-can Le-gi-on
Le-ague pitc-her fe-eling je-alo-us of No-lan Ryan or Ro-ger Cle-mens. Af-ter a cer-ta-in po-int the
com-pa-ri-sons that ca-use fe-elings of je-alo-usy simply ce-ase to exist. I've be-en the-re, and I can tell
you: af-ter a cer-ta-in po-int you just stand back and shi-eld yo-ur eyes from the flash burns.
Bobby re-ad at two and be-gan wri-ting short es-says ("Our Dog," A Trip to Bos-ton with Mot-her")
at three. His prin-ting was the strag-gling, strug-gling gal-va-nic const-ruc-ti-ons of a six-ye-ar-old, and
that was start-ling eno-ugh in it-self, but the-re was mo-re: if transc-ri-bed so that his still-de-ve-lo-ping
mo-tor cont-rol no lon-ger be-ca-me an eva-lu-ati-ve fac-tor, you wo-uld ha-ve tho-ught you we-re
re-ading the work of a bright, if ext-re-mely na-ive, fifth-gra-der. He prog-res-sed from simp-le
sen-ten-ces to com-po-und sen-ten-ces to comp-lex ones with diz-zying ra-pi-dity, gras-ping cla-uses,
sub-cla-uses, and mo-dif-ying cla-uses with an in-tu-iti-ve-ness that was eerie. So-me-ti-mes his syntax
was garb-led and his mo-di-fi-ers misp-la-ced, but he had such flaws-which pla-gue most wri-ters all
the-ir li-ves pretty well un-der cont-rol by the age of fi-ve.
He de-ve-lo-ped he-adac-hes. My pa-rents we-re af-ra-id he had so-me sort of physi-cal prob-lem-a
bra-in-tu-mo-ur, per-haps-and to-ok him to a doc-tor who exa-mi-ned him ca-re-ful-ly, lis-te-ned to
him even mo-re ca-re-ful-ly, and then told my pa-rents the-re was not-hing wrong with Bobby ex-cept
stress: he was in a sta-te of ext-re-me frust-ra-ti-on be-ca-use his wri-ting-hand wo-uld not work as well
as his bra-in.
"You got a kid trying to pass a men-tal kid-ney sto-ne," the doc-tor sa-id. "I co-uld presc-ri-be
so-met-hing for his he-adac-hes, but I think the drug he re-al-ly ne-eds is a typew-ri-ter." So Mom and
Dad ga-ve Bobby an IBM. A ye-ar la-ter they ga-ve him a Com-mo-do-re 64 with WordS-tar for
Christ-mas and Bobby's he-adac-hes stop-ped. Be-fo-re go-ing on to ot-her mat-ters, I only want to
add that he be-li-eved for the next three ye-ars or so that it was San-ta Cla-us who had left that
word-crunc-her un-der our tree. Now that I think of it, that was anot-her pla-ce whe-re I be-at Bobby: I
San-ta-tra-ined ear-li-er, too.
There's so much I co-uld tell you abo-ut tho-se early days, and I sup-po-se I'll ha-ve to tell you a
lit-tle, but I'll ha-ve to go fast and ma-ke it bri-ef. The de-ad-li-ne. Ah, the de-ad-li-ne. I on-ce re-ad a
very funny pi-ece cal-led "The Es-sen-ti-al Go-ne with the Wind" that went so-met-hing li-ke this:
“A war?’ la-ug-hed Scar-lett. Oh, fid-dle-de-dee!’
“Boom! Ash-ley went to war! At-lan-ta bur-ned! Rhett wal-ked in and then wal-ked out!
"'Fiddle-de-dee,' sa-id Scar-lett thro-ugh her te-ars, I will think abo-ut it to-mor-row, for
to-mor-row is anot-her day'"
I la-ug-hed he-ar-tily over that when I re-ad it; now that I'm fa-ced with do-ing so-met-hing si-mi-lar,
it do-esn't se-em qu-ite so funny. But he-re go-es:
"A child with an IQ im-me-asu-rab-le by any exis-ting test?" smi-led In-dia For-noy to her
de-vo-ted hus-band, Ric-hard. Fid-dle-de-dee! Well pro-vi-de an at-mosp-he-re whe-re his
in-tel-lect-not to men-ti-on that of his not-exactly-stu-pid ol-der brot-her-can grow. And we'll
ra-ise them as the nor-mal all-Ame-ri-can boys they by gosh are!"
Boom! The For-noy boys grew up! Ho-ward went to the Uni-ver-sity of Vir-gi-nia, gra-du-ated
cum la-ude, and set-tled down to a fre-elan-ce wri-ting ca-re-er! Ma-de a com-for-tab-le li-ving!
Step-ped out with a lot of wo-men and went to bed with qu-ite a few of them! Ma-na-ged to avo-id
so-ci-al di-se-ases both se-xu-al and phar-ma-co-lo-gi-cal! Bo-ught a Mit-su-bis-hi ste-reo system!
Wro-te ho-me at le-ast on-ce a we-ek! Pub-lis-hed two no-vels that did pretty well!
"Fid-dle-de-dee" sa-id Ho-ward, "this is the li-fe for me!"
And so it was, at le-ast un-til the day Bobby sho-wed up unex-pec-tedly (in the best mad-sci-en-tist
tra-di-ti-on) with his two glass bo-xes, a be-es' nest in one and a wasps' nest in the ot-her, Bobby
we-aring a Mum-ford Phys Ed tee-shirt in-si-de-out, on the ver-ge of dest-ro-ying hu-man in-tel-lect and
just as happy as a clam at high ti-de.
Guys li-ke my brot-her Bobby co-me along only on-ce every two or three ge-ne-ra-ti-ons, I

think-guys li-ke Le-onar-do da Vin-ci, New-ton, Eins-te-in, may-be Edi-son. They all se-em to ha-ve
one thing in com-mon: they are li-ke hu-ge com-pas-ses which swing aim-les-sly for a long ti-me,
se-arc-hing for so-me true north and then ho-ming on it with fe-ar-ful for-ce. Be-fo-re that hap-pens
such guys are apt to get up to so-me we-ird shit, and Bobby was no ex-cep-ti-on.
When he was eight and I was fif-te-en, he ca-me to me and sa-id he had in-ven-ted an airp-la-ne. By
then I knew Bobby too well to just say "Bul-lshit" and kick him out of my ro-om. I went out to the
ga-ra-ge, Whe-re the-re was this we-ird plywo-od cont-rap-ti-on sit-ting on his Ame-ri-can Flyer red
wa-gon. It lo-oked a lit-tle li-ke a figh-ter pla-ne, but the wings we-re ra-ked for-ward ins-te-ad of
back. He had mo-un-ted the sad-dle from his roc-king hor-se on the mid-dle of it with bolts. The-re was
a le-ver on the si-de. The-re was no mo-tor. He sa-id it was a gli-der. He wan-ted me to push him down
Car-ri-gan's Hill, which was the ste-epest gra-de in D.C.'s Grant Park-the-re was a ce-ment path down
the mid-dle of it for old folks. That, Bobby sa-id, wo-uld be his run-way.
"Bobby," I sa-id, "you got this puppy's wings on back-ward."
"No," he sa-id. "This is the way they're sup-po-sed to be. I saw so-met-hing on Wild Kin-g-dom
abo-ut hawks. They di-ve down on the-ir prey and then re-ver-se the-ir wings co-ming up. They're
do-ub-le-jo-in-ted, see? You get bet-ter lift this way."
"Then why isn't the Air For-ce bu-il-ding them this way?" I as-ked, blis-sful-ly una-wa-re that both the
Ame-ri-can and the Rus-si-an air for-ces had plans for such for-ward-wing figh-ter pla-nes on the-ir
dra-wing bo-ards.
Bobby just shrug-ged. He didn't know and didn't ca-re.
We went over to Car-ri-gan's Hill and he clim-bed in-to the roc-king-hor-se sad-dle and grip-ped the
le-ver. "Push me hard" he sa-id. His eyes we-re dan-cing with that cra-zed light I knew so well-Christ,
his eyes used to light up that way in his crad-le so-me-ti-mes. But I swe-ar to God I ne-ver wo-uld ha-ve
pus-hed him down the ce-ment path as hard as I did if I tho-ught the thing wo-uld ac-tu-al-ly work.
But I didn’t know, and I ga-ve him one hell of a sho-ve. He went fre-ew-he-eling down the hill,
who-oping li-ke a cow-boy just off a tra-ild-ri-ve and he-aded in-to town for a few cold be-ers. An old
lady had to jump out of his way, and he just mis-sed an old ge-ezer le-aning over a wal-ker. Half-way
down he pul-led the hand-le and I watc-hed, wi-de-eyed and bul-lshit with fe-ar and ama-ze-ment, as
his splin-tery plywo-od pla-ne se-pa-ra-ted from the wa-gon. At first it only ho-ve-red inc-hes abo-ve it,
and for a se-cond it lo-oked li-ke it was go-ing to set-tle back. Then the-re was a gust of wind and
Bobby's pla-ne to-ok off li-ke so-me-one had it on an in-vi-sib-le cab-le. The Ame-ri-can Flyer wa-gon
ran off the conc-re-te path and in-to so-me bus-hes. All of a sud-den Bobby was ten fe-et in the air, then
twenty, then fifty. He went gli-ding over Grant Park on a ste-epe-ning up-ward pla-ne, who-oping
che-erily.
I went run-ning af-ter him, scre-aming for him to co-me down, vi-si-ons of his body tumb-ling off that
stu-pid roc-king-hor-se sad-dle and im-pa-ling it-self on a tree, or one of the park's many sta-tu-es,
stan-ding out with hi-de-o-us cla-rity in my he-ad. I did not just ima-gi-ne my brot-her's fu-ne-ral; I tell
you I at-ten-ded it. "BOBBY!" I shri-eked. "CO-ME DOWN!"
"WHEEEEEEEE!" Bobby scre-amed back, his vo-ice fa-int but cle-arly ecs-ta-tic. Start-led
chess-pla-yers, Fris-bee-thro-wers, bo-ok-re-aders, lo-vers, and jog-gers stop-ped wha-te-ver they
we-re do-ing to watch.
"BOBBY THE-RE'S NO SE-AT-BELT ON THAT FUC-KING THING." I scre-amed. It was the first
ti-me I ever used that par-ti-cu-lar word, so far as I can re-mem-ber.
"Iyyyyll be-e-ee all riyyyyht… " He was scre-aming at the top of his lungs, but I was ap-pal-led to
re-ali-ze I co-uld ba-rely he-ar him. I went run-ning down Car-ri-gan's Hill, shri-eking all the way. I don't
ha-ve the sligh-test me-mory of just what I was yel-ling, but the next day I co-uld not spe-ak abo-ve a
whis-per. I do re-mem-ber pas-sing a yo-ung fel-low in a ne-at three-pi-ece su-it stan-ding by the
sta-tue of Ele-anor Ro-ose-velt at the fo-ot of the hill. He lo-oked at me and sa-id con-ver-sa-ti-onal-ly,
"Tell you what, my fri-end, I'm ha-ving one hell of an acid flash-back."
I re-mem-ber that odd mis-sha-pen sha-dow gli-ding ac-ross the gre-en flo-or of the park, ri-sing and
rip-pling as it cros-sed park benc-hes, lit-ter bas-kets, and the up-tur-ned fa-ces of the watc-hing

pe-op-le. I re-mem-ber cha-sing it. I re-mem-ber how my mot-her's fa-ce crump-led and how she
star-ted to cry when I told her that Bobby's pla-ne, which had no bu-si-ness flying in the first pla-ce,
tur-ned up-si-de down in a sud-den eddy of wind and Bobby fi-nis-hed his short but bril-li-ant ca-re-er
splat-te-red all over D Stre-et.
The way things tur-ned out, it might ha-ve be-en bet-ter for ever-yo-ne if things had ac-tu-al-ly
tur-ned out that way, but they didn't. Ins-te-ad, Bobby ban-ked back to-ward Car-ri-gan's Hill, hol-ding
nonc-ha-lantly on-to the ta-il of his own pla-ne to ke-ep from fal-ling off the dam-ned thing, and bro-ught
it down to-ward the lit-tle pond at the cent-re of Grant Park. He went air-sli-ding fi-ve fe-et over it, then
fo-ur…and then he was ski-ing his sne-akers along the sur-fa-ce of the wa-ter, sen-ding back twin
whi-te wa-kes, sca-ring the usu-al-ly comp-la-cent (and over-fed) ducks up in hon-king in-dig-nant
flur-ri-es be-fo-re him, la-ug-hing his che-er-ful la-ugh. He ca-me down on the far si-de, exactly
bet-we-en two park benc-hes that snap-ped off the wings of his pla-ne. He flew out of the sad-dle,
thum-ped his he-ad, and star-ted to bawl.
That was li-fe with Bobby.
Not everyt-hing was that spec-ta-cu-lar-in fact, I don't think anyt-hing was…at le-ast un-til The
Cal-ma-ti-ve. But I told you the story be-ca-use I think, this ti-me at le-ast, the ext-re-me ca-se best
il-lust-ra-tes the norm: li-fe with Bobby was a cons-tant mind-fuck. By the age of ni-ne he was
at-ten-ding qu-an-tum physics and ad-van-ced al-geb-ra clas-ses at Ge-or-ge-town Uni-ver-sity. The-re
was the day he blan-ked out every ra-dio and TV on our stre-et-and the sur-ro-un-ding fo-ur
blocks-with his own vo-ice; he had fo-und an old por-tab-le TV in the at-tic and tur-ned it in-to a
wi-de-band ra-dio bro-ad-cas-ting sta-ti-on. One old black-and-whi-te Ze-nith, twel-ve fe-et of hi-fi
flex, a co-at han-ger mo-un-ted on the ro-of pe-ak of our ho-use, and pres-to! For abo-ut two ho-urs
fo-ur blocks of Ge-or-ge-town co-uld re-ce-ive only WBOB…which hap-pe-ned to be my brot-her,
re-ading so-me of my short sto-ri-es, tel-ling mo-ron jokes, and exp-la-ining that the high sulp-hur
con-tent in ba-ked be-ans was the re-ason our dad far-ted so much in church every Sun-day mor-ning.
"But he gets most of 'em off pretty qu-i-et," Bobby told his lis-te-ning audi-en-ce of ro-ughly three
tho-usand, "or so-me-ti-mes he holds the re-al ban-gers un-til it's ti-me for the hymns."
My dad, who was less than happy abo-ut all this, en-ded up pa-ying a se-venty-fi-ve-dol-lar FCC
fi-ne and ta-king it out of Bobby's al-lo-wan-ce for the next ye-ar.
Life with Bobby, oh ye-ah…and lo-ok he-re, I'm crying. Is it ho-nest sen-ti-ment, I won-der, or the
on-set? The for-mer, I think-Christ knows how much I lo-ved him-but I think I bet-ter try to hurry up a
lit-tle just the sa-me.
Bobby had gra-du-ated high scho-ol, for all prac-ti-cal pur-po-ses, by the age of ten, but he ne-ver
got a B.A. or B.S., let alo-ne any ad-van-ced deg-ree. It was that big po-wer-ful com-pass in his he-ad,
swin-ging aro-und and aro-und, lo-oking for so-me true north to po-int at.
He went thro-ugh a physics pe-ri-od, and a shor-ter pe-ri-od when he was nutty for che-mistry…but
in the end, Bobby was too im-pa-ti-ent with mat-he-ma-tics for eit-her of tho-se fi-elds to hold him. He
co-uld do it, but it-and ul-ti-ma-tely all so-cal-led hard sci-en-ce bo-red him.
By the ti-me he was fif-te-en, it was arc-ha-e-ology-he com-bed the Whi-te Mo-un-ta-in fo-ot-hil-ls
aro-und our sum-mer pla-ce in North Con-way, bu-il-ding a his-tory of the In-di-ans who had li-ved
the-re from ar-row-he-ads, flints, even the char-co-al pat-terns of long-de-ad camp-fi-res in the
Me-so-lit-hic ca-ves in the mid-New Hamps-hi-re re-gi-ons.
But that pas-sed, too, and he be-gan to re-ad his-tory and anth-ro-po-logy. When he was six-te-en
my fat-her and my mot-her ga-ve the-ir re-luc-tant ap-pro-val when Bobby re-qu-es-ted that he be
al-lo-wed to ac-com-pany a party of New Eng-land anth-ro-po-lo-gists on an ex-pe-di-ti-on to So-uth
Ame-ri-ca.
He ca-me back fi-ve months la-ter with the first re-al tan of his li-fe; he was al-so an inch tal-ler,
fif-te-en po-unds ligh-ter, and much qu-i-eter. He was still che-er-ful eno-ugh, or co-uld be, but his
lit-tle-boy exu-be-ran-ce, so-me-ti-mes in-fec-ti-o-us, so-me-ti-mes we-ari-so-me, but al-ways the-re,

was go-ne. He had grown up. And for the first ti-me I re-mem-ber him tal-king abo-ut the news…how
bad it was, I me-an. That was 2003, the ye-ar a PLO splin-ter gro-up cal-led the Sons of the Jihad (a
na-me that al-ways so-un-ded to me hi-de-o-usly li-ke a Cat-ho-lic com-mu-nity ser-vi-ce gro-up
so-mew-he-re in wes-tern Pen-nsyl-va-nia) set off a Squ-irt Bomb in Lon-don, pol-lu-ting sixty per cent
of it and ma-king the rest of it ext-re-mely un-he-althy for pe-op-le who ever plan-ned to ha-ve child-ren
(or to li-ve past the age of fifty, for that mat-ter). The ye-ar we tri-ed to bloc-ka-de the Phi-lip-pi-nes
af-ter the Ce-de-no ad-mi-nist-ra-ti-on ac-cep-ted a "small gro-up" of Red Chi-ne-se ad-vi-sors
(fif-te-en tho-usand or so, ac-cor-ding to our spy sa-tel-li-tes), and only bac-ked down when it
be-ca-me cle-ar that (a) the Chi-ne-se we-ren't kid-ding abo-ut empt-ying the ho-les if we didn't pull
back, and (b) the Ame-ri-can pe-op-le we-ren't all that crazy abo-ut com-mit-ting mass su-ici-de over
the Phi-lip-pi-ne Is-lands. That was al-so the ye-ar so-me ot-her gro-up of crazy
mot-her-fuc-kers-Alba-ni-ans, I think-tri-ed to air-spray the AIDS vi-rus over Ber-lin.
This sort of stuff dep-res-sed every-body, but it dep-res-sed the shit out of Bobby.
"Why are pe-op-le so god-dam me-an?" he as-ked me one day. We we-re at the sum-mer pla-ce in
New Hamps-hi-re, it was la-te August, and most of our stuff was al-re-ady in bo-xes and su-it-ca-ses.
The ca-bin had that sad, de-ser-ted lo-ok it al-ways got just be-fo-re we all went our se-pa-ra-te ways.
For me it me-ant back to New York, and for Bobby it me-ant Wa-co, Te-xas, of all pla-ces…he had
spent the sum-mer re-ading so-ci-ology and ge-ology texts-how's that for a crazy sa-lad?-and sa-id he
wan-ted to run a co-up-le of ex-pe-ri-ments down the-re. He sa-id it in a ca-su-al, of-fhand way, but I
had se-en my mot-her lo-oking at him with a pe-cu-li-ar tho-ught-ful scru-tiny in the last co-up-le of
we-eks we we-re all to-get-her. Ne-it-her Dad nor I sus-pec-ted, but I think my mom knew that
Bobby's com-pass ne-ed-le had fi-nal-ly stop-ped swin-ging and had star-ted po-in-ting.
"Why are they so me-an?" I as-ked. "I'm sup-po-sed to ans-wer that?"
"Someone bet-ter," he sa-id. "Pretty so-on, too, the way things are go-ing."
"They're go-ing the way they al-ways went," I sa-id, "and I gu-ess they're do-ing it be-ca-use pe-op-le
we-re bu-ilt to be me-an. If you want to lay bla-me, bla-me God."
"That's bul-lshit. I don't be-li-eve it. Even that do-ub-le-X-chro-mo-so-me stuff tur-ned out to be
bul-lshit in the end. And don't tell me it's just eco-no-mic pres-su-res, the conf-lict bet-we-en the ha-ves
and ha-ve-nots, be-ca-use that do-esn't exp-la-in all of it, eit-her."
"Original sin," I sa-id. "It works for me-it's got a go-od be-at and you can dan-ce to it."
"Well," Bobby sa-id, "may-be it is ori-gi-nal sin. But what's the inst-ru-ment, big brot-her? Ha-ve you
ever as-ked yo-ur-self that?"
"Instrument? What inst-ru-ment? I'm not fol-lo-wing you." "I think it's the wa-ter" Bobby sa-id
mo-odily.
"Say what?"
"The wa-ter. So-met-hing in the wa-ter."
He lo-oked at me.
"Or so-met-hing that isn't"
The next day Bobby went off to Wa-co. I didn't see him aga-in un-til he sho-wed up at my apart-ment
we-aring the in-si-de-out Mum-ford shirt and car-rying the two glass bo-xes. That was three ye-ars
la-ter.
"Howdy, Ho-wie," he sa-id, step-ping in and gi-ving me a nonc-ha-lant swat on the back as if it had
be-en only three days.
"Bobby!" I yel-led, and threw both arms aro-und him in a be-ar-hug. Hard ang-les bit in-to my chest,
and I he-ard an angry hi-ve-hum.
"I'm glad to see you too," Bobby sa-id, "but you bet-ter go easy. You're up-set-ting the na-ti-ves."
I step-ped back in a hurry. Bobby set down the big pa-per bag he was car-rying and uns-lung his
sho-ul-der-bag. Then he ca-re-ful-ly bro-ught the glass bo-xes out of the bag. The-re was a be-ehi-ve in
one, a wasps' nest in the ot-her. The be-es we-re al-re-ady set-tling down and go-ing back to
wha-te-ver bu-si-ness be-es ha-ve, but the wasps we-re cle-arly un-hap-py abo-ut the who-le thing.

"Okay, Bobby," I sa-id. I lo-oked at him and grin-ned. I co-uldn't se-em to stop grin-ning. "What are
you up to this ti-me?"
He un-zip-ped the to-te-bag and bro-ught out a ma-yon-na-ise jar which was half-fil-led with a cle-ar
li-qu-id.
"See this?" he sa-id.
"Yeah. Lo-oks li-ke eit-her wa-ter or whi-te light-ning."
"It's ac-tu-al-ly both, if you can be-li-eve that. It ca-me from an ar-te-si-an well in La Pla-ta, a lit-tle
town forty mi-les east of Wa-co, and be-fo-re I tur-ned it in-to this con-cent-ra-ted form, the-re we-re
fi-ve gal-lons of it. I've got a re-gu-lar lit-tle dis-til-lery run-ning down the-re, Ho-wie, but I don't think
the go-vern-ment will ever bust me for it." He was grin-ning, and now the grin bro-ade-ned. "Wa-ter's all
it is, but it's still the god-damn-dist pops-kull the hu-man ra-ce has ever se-en."
"I don't ha-ve the sligh-test idea what you're tal-king abo-ut."
"I know you don't. But you will. You know what, Ho-wie?"
"What?"
"If the idi-otic hu-man ra-ce can ma-na-ge to hold it-self to-get-her for anot-her six months, I'm
bet-ting it'll hold it-self to-get-her for all ti-me."
He lif-ted the ma-yon-na-ise jar, and one mag-ni-fi-ed Bob-by-eye sta-red at me thro-ugh it with
hu-ge so-lem-nity. "This is the big one," he sa-id. "The cu-re for the worst di-se-ase to which Ho-mo
sa-pi-ens falls prey."
"Cancer?"
"Nope," Bobby sa-id. "War. Bar-ro-om brawls. Dri-ve-by sho-otings. The who-le mess.
Where's yo-ur bath-ro-om, Ho-wie? My back te-eth are flo-ating."
When he ca-me back he had not only tur-ned the Mum-ford tee-shirt right-si-de out, he had com-bed
his ha-ir-nor had his met-hod of do-ing this chan-ged, I saw. Bobby just held his he-ad un-der the
fa-ucet for aw-hi-le then ra-ked everyt-hing back with his fin-gers.
He lo-oked at the two glass bo-xes and pro-no-un-ced the be-es and wasps back to nor-mal. "Not
that a wasps' nest ever ap-pro-ac-hes anyt-hing even clo-sely re-semb-ling 'nor-mal,' Ho-wie. Wasps
are so-ci-al in-sects, li-ke be-es and ants, but un-li-ke be-es, which are al-most al-ways sa-ne, and ants,
which ha-ve oc-ca-si-onal schi-zo-id lap-ses, wasps are to-tal full-bo-re lu-na-tics." He smi-led. "Just
li-ke us go-od old Ho-mo saps." He to-ok the top off the glass box con-ta-ining the be-ehi-ve.
"Tell you what, Bobby," I sa-id. I was smi-ling, but the smi-le felt much too wi-de. "Put the top back
on and just tell me abo-ut it, what do you say? Sa-ve the de-monst-ra-ti-on for la-ter. I me-an, my
land-lord's a re-al pus-sycat, but the su-per's this big bull dyke who smo-kes Odie Pe-ro-de ci-gars and
has thirty po-unds on me. She-"
"You'll li-ke this," Bobby sa-id, as if I hadn't spo-ken at all-a ha-bit as fa-mi-li-ar to me as his Ten
Fin-gers Met-hod of Ha-ir Gro-oming. He was ne-ver im-po-li-te but of-ten to-tal-ly ab-sor-bed. And
co-uld I stop him? Aw shit, no. It was too go-od to ha-ve him back. I me-an I think I knew even then
that so-met-hing was go-ing to go to-tal-ly wrong, but when I was with Bobby for mo-re than fi-ve
mi-nu-tes, he just hypno-ti-zed me. He was Lucy hol-ding the fo-ot-ball and pro-mi-sing me this ti-me
for su-re, and I was Char-lie Brown, rus-hing down the fi-eld to kick it. "In fact, you've pro-bably se-en
it do-ne be-fo-re-they show pic-tu-res of it in ma-ga-zi-nes from ti-me to ti-me, or in TV wild-li-fe
do-cu-men-ta-ri-es. It's not-hing very spe-ci-al, but it lo-oks li-ke a big de-al be-ca-use pe-op-le ha-ve
got the-se to-tal-ly ir-ra-ti-onal pre-j-udi-ces abo-ut be-es."
And the we-ird thing was, he was right-I had se-en it be-fo-re.
He stuck his hand in-to the box bet-we-en the hi-ve and the glass. In less than fif-te-en se-conds his
hand had ac-qu-ired a li-ving black-and-yel-low glo-ve. It bro-ught back an ins-tant of to-tal re-call:
sit-ting in front of the TV, we-aring fo-otie pyj-amas and clutc-hing my Pad-ding-ton Be-ar, may-be half
an ho-ur be-fo-re bed-ti-me (and su-rely ye-ars be-fo-re Bobby was born), watc-hing with ming-led
hor-ror, dis-gust, and fas-ci-na-ti-on as so-me be-eke-eper al-lo-wed be-es to co-ver his en-ti-re fa-ce.
They had for-med a sort of exe-cu-ti-oner's ho-od at first, and then he had brus-hed them in-to a
gro-tes-que li-ving be-ard.

Bobby win-ced sud-denly, sharply, then grin-ned.
"One of 'em stung me," he sa-id. "They're still a lit-tle up-set from the trip. I ho-oked a ri-de with the
lo-cal in-su-ran-ce lady from La Pla-ta to Wa-co-she's got an old Pi-per Cub-and flew so-me lit-tle
com-mu-ter air-li-ne, Air As-sho-le, I think it was, up to New Or-le-ans from the-re. Ma-de abo-ut
forty con-nec-ti-ons, but I swe-ar to God it was the cab ri-de from La-Gar-ba-ge that got 'em crazy.
Se-cond Ave-nue's still got mo-re pot-ho-les than the Ber-genst-ras-se af-ter the Ger-mans
sur-ren-de-red."
"You know, I think you re-al-ly ought to get yo-ur hand out of the-re, Bobs," I sa-id. I kept wa-iting
for so-me of them to fly out-I co-uld ima-gi-ne cha-sing them aro-und with a rol-led-up ma-ga-zi-ne for
ho-urs, brin-ging them down one by one, as if they we-re es-ca-pe-es in so-me old pri-son mo-vie. But
no-ne of them had es-ca-ped…at le-ast so far.
"Relax, Ho-wie. You ever see a bee sting a flo-wer? Or even he-ar of it, for that mat-ter?"
"You don't lo-ok li-ke a flo-wer."
He la-ug-hed. "Shit, you think be-es know what a flo-wer lo-oks li-ke? Un-uh! No way, man! They
don't know what a flo-wer lo-oks li-ke any mo-re than you or I know what a clo-ud so-unds li-ke. They
know I'm swe-et be-ca-use I exc-re-te suc-ro-se di-oxin in my swe-at…along with thirty-se-ven ot-her
di-oxins, and tho-se're just the ones we know abo-ut."
He pa-used tho-ught-ful-ly.
"Although I must con-fess I was ca-re-ful to, uh, swe-eten myself up a lit-tle to-night. Ate a box of
cho-co-la-te-co-ve-red cher-ri-es on the pla-ne-"
"Oh Bobby, Jesus!"
"-and had a co-up-le of Mal-lowC-re-mes in the ta-xi co-ming he-re."
He re-ac-hed in with his ot-her hand and ca-re-ful-ly be-gan to brush the be-es away. I saw him
win-ce on-ce mo-re just be-fo-re he got the last of them off, and then he eased my mind con-si-de-rably
by rep-la-cing the lid on the glass box. I saw a red swel-ling on each of his hands: one in the cup of the
left palm, anot-her high up on the right, ne-ar what the pal-mists call the Bra-ce-lets of For-tu-ne. He'd
be-en stung, but I saw well eno-ugh what he'd set out to show me: what lo-oked li-ke at le-ast fo-ur
hund-red be-es had in-ves-ti-ga-ted him. Only two had stung.
He to-ok a pa-ir of twe-ezers out of his je-ans watch-poc-ket, and went over to my desk. He mo-ved
the pi-le of ma-nusc-ript be-si-de the Wang Mic-ro I was using in tho-se days and tra-ined my Ten-sor
lamp on the pla-ce whe-re the pa-ges had be-en-fid-dling with it un-til it for-med a tiny hard spot-light on
the cherry wo-od.
"Writin’ anyt-hing go-od, Bow-Wow?" he as-ked ca-su-al-ly, and I felt the ha-ir stif-fen on the back
of my neck. When was the last ti-me he'd cal-led me Bow-Wow? When he was fo-ur? Six? Shit, man, I
don't know. He was wor-king ca-re-ful-ly on his left hand with the twe-ezers. I saw him ext-ract a tiny
so-met-hing that lo-oked li-ke a nost-ril ha-ir and pla-ce it in my asht-ray.
"Piece on art for-gery for Va-nity Fa-ir," I sa-id. "Bobby, what in hell are you up to this ti-me?"
"You want to pull the ot-her one for me?" he as-ked, of-fe-ring me the twe-ezers, his right hand, and
an apo-lo-ge-tic smi-le. "I ke-ep thin-king if I'm so god-dam smart I ought to be am-bi-dext-ro-us, but
my left hand has still got an IQ of abo-ut six."
Same old Bobby.
I sat down be-si-de him, to-ok the twe-ezers, and pul-led the bee stin-ger out of the red swel-ling
ne-ar what in his ca-se sho-uld ha-ve be-en the Bra-ce-lets of Do-om, and whi-le I did it he told me
abo-ut the dif-fe-ren-ces bet-we-en be-es and wasps, the dif-fe-ren-ce bet-we-en the wa-ter in La
Pla-ta and the wa-ter in New York, and how, god-dam! everyt-hing was go-ing to be all right with his
wa-ter and a lit-tle help from me.
And oh shit, I en-ded up run-ning at the fo-ot-ball whi-le my la-ug-hing, wildly in-tel-li-gent brot-her
held it, one last ti-me.
"Bees don't sting un-less they ha-ve to, be-ca-use it kills them," Bobby sa-id mat-ter-of-factly. "You
re-mem-ber that ti-me in North Con-way, when you sa-id we kept kil-ling each ot-her be-ca-use of

ori-gi-nal sin?"
"Yes. Hold still."
"Well, if the-re is such a thing, if the-re's a God who co-uld si-mul-ta-ne-o-usly lo-ve us eno-ugh to
ser-ve us His own Son on a cross and send us all on a roc-ket-sled to hell just be-ca-use one stu-pid
bitch bit a bad ap-ple, then the cur-se was just this: He ma-de us li-ke wasps ins-te-ad of be-es. Shit,
Ho-wie, what are you do-ing?"
"Hold still," I sa-id, "and I'll get it out. If you want to ma-ke a lot of big ges-tu-res, I'll wa-it."
"Okay," he sa-id, and af-ter that he held re-la-ti-vely still whi-le I ext-rac-ted the stin-ger. "Be-es are
na-tu-re's ka-mi-ka-ze pi-lots, Bow-Wow. Lo-ok in that glass box, you'll see the two who stung me
lying de-ad at the bot-tom. The-ir stin-gers are bar-bed, li-ke fish-ho-oks. They sli-de in easy. When
they pull out, they di-sem-bo-wel them-sel-ves."
"Gross," I sa-id, drop-ping the se-cond stin-ger in the asht-ray. I co-uldn't see the barbs, but I didn't
ha-ve a mic-ros-co-pe.
"It ma-kes them par-ti-cu-lar, tho-ugh," he sa-id.
"I bet."
"Wasps, on the ot-her hand, ha-ve smo-oth stin-gers. They can sho-ot you up as many ti-mes as they
li-ke. They use up the po-ison by the third or fo-urth shot, but they can go right on ma-king ho-les if they
li-ke…and usu-al-ly they do. Es-pe-ci-al-ly wall-wasps. The kind I've got over the-re. You got-ta
se-da-te 'em. Stuff cal-led No-xon. It must gi-ve 'em a hell of a han-go-ver, be-ca-use they wa-ke up
mad-der than ever."
He lo-oked at me som-berly, and for the first ti-me I saw the dark brown whe-els of we-ari-ness
un-der his eyes and re-ali-zed my kid brot-her was mo-re ti-red than I had ever se-en him.
"That's why pe-op-le go on figh-ting, Bow-Wow. On and on and on. We got smo-oth stin-gers. Now
watch this."
He got up, went over to his to-te-bag, rum-ma-ged in it, and ca-me up with an eye-drop-per. He
ope-ned the ma-yon-na-ise jar, put the drop-per in, and drew up a tiny bub-ble of his dis-til-led Te-xas
wa-ter.
When he to-ok it over to the glass box with the wasps' nest in-si-de, I saw the top on this one was
dif-fe-rent-the-re was a tiny plas-tic sli-de-pi-ece set in-to it. I didn't ne-ed him to draw me a pic-tu-re:
with the be-es, he was per-fectly wil-ling to re-mo-ve the who-le top. With the wasps, he was ta-king no
chan-ces.
He squ-e-ezed the black bulb. Two drops of wa-ter fell on-to the nest, ma-king a mo-men-tary dark
spot that di-sap-pe-ared al-most at on-ce. "Gi-ve it abo-ut three mi-nu-tes," he sa-id.
"What-"
"No qu-es-ti-ons" he sa-id. "You'll see. Three mi-nu-tes."
In that pe-ri-od, he re-ad my pi-ece on art for-gery…altho-ugh it was al-re-ady twenty pa-ges long.
"Okay" he sa-id, put-ting the pa-ges down. "That's pretty go-od, man. You ought to re-ad up a lit-tle
on how Jay Go-uld fur-nis-hed the par-lor-car of his pri-va-te tra-in with fa-ke Ma-nets, tho-ugh-that's a
ho-ot." He was re-mo-ving the co-ver of the glass box con-ta-ining the wasps' nest as he spo-ke.
"Jesus, Bobby, cut the co-medy!" I yel-led.
"Same old wimp," Bobby la-ug-hed, and pul-led the nest, which was dull gray and abo-ut the si-ze of
a bow-ling ball, out of the box. He held it in his hands. Wasps flew out and lit on his arms, his che-eks,
his fo-re-he-ad. One flew ac-ross to me and lan-ded on my fo-re-arm. I slap-ped it and it fell de-ad to
the car-pet. I was sca-red-I me-an re-al-ly sca-red. My body was wi-red with ad-re-na-li-ne and I
co-uld fe-el my eyes trying to push the-ir way out of the-ir soc-kets.
"Don't kill 'em," Bobby sa-id. "You might as well be kil-ling ba-bi-es, for all the harm they can do you.
That's the who-le po-int." He tos-sed the nest from hand to hand as if it we-re an overg-rown soft-ball.
He lob-bed it in the air. I watc-hed, hor-ri-fi-ed, as wasps cru-ised the li-ving ro-om of my apart-ment
li-ke figh-ter pla-nes on pat-rol.
Bobby lo-we-red the nest ca-re-ful-ly back in-to the box and sat down on my co-uch. He pat-ted the
pla-ce next to him and I went over, ne-arly hypno-ti-zed. They we-re everyw-he-re: on the rug, the

ce-iling, the dra-pes. Half a do-zen of them we-re craw-ling ac-ross the front of my big-scre-en TV.
Before I co-uld sit down, he brus-hed away a co-up-le that we-re on the so-fa cus-hi-on whe-re my
ass was aimed. They flew away qu-ickly. They we-re all flying easily, craw-ling easily, mo-ving fast.
The-re was not-hing drug-ged abo-ut the-ir be-ha-vi-o-ur. As Bobby tal-ked, they gra-du-al-ly fo-und
the-ir way back to the-ir spit-pa-per ho-me, craw-led over it, and even-tu-al-ly di-sap-pe-ared in-si-de
aga-in thro-ugh the ho-le in the top.
"I wasn't the first one to get in-te-res-ted in Wa-co," he sa-id. "It just hap-pens to be the big-gest
town in the funny lit-tle non-vi-olent sec-ti-on of what is, per ca-pi-ta, the most vi-olent sta-te in the
uni-on. Te-xans lo-ve to sho-ot each ot-her, Ho-wie-I me-an, it's li-ke a sta-te hobby. Half the ma-le
po-pu-la-ti-on go-es aro-und ar-med. Sa-tur-day night in the Fort Worth bars is li-ke a sho-oting
gal-lery whe-re you get to plonk away at drunks ins-te-ad of clay ducks. The-re are mo-re NRA
card-car-ri-ers than the-re are Met-ho-dists. Not that Te-xas is the only pla-ce whe-re pe-op-le sho-ot
each ot-her, or car-ve each ot-her up with stra-ight ra-zors, or stick the-ir kids in the oven if they cry too
long, you un-ders-tand, but they su-re do li-ke the-ir fi-re-arms."
"Except in Wa-co," I sa-id.
"Oh, they lo-ok li-ke 'em the-re, too," he sa-id. "It's just that they use 'em on each ot-her a hell of a lot
less of-ten."
Jesus. I just lo-oked up at the clock and saw the ti-me. It fe-els li-ke I've be-en wri-ting for fif-te-en
mi-nu-tes or so, but it's ac-tu-al-ly be-en over an ho-ur. That hap-pens to me so-me-ti-mes when I'm
run-ning at whi-te-hot spe-ed, but I can't al-low myself to In* se-du-ced in-to the-se spe-ci-fics. I fe-el
as well as ever-no no-ti-ce-ab-le drying of the memb-ra-nes in the back of the thro-at, no gro-ping for
words, and as I glan-ce back over what I've do-ne 1 see only the nor-mal typos and stri-ke overs. But I
can't kid myself. I've got to hurry up. "Fid-dle-de-dee," sa-id Scar-lett, and all of that.
The non-vi-olent at-mosp-he-re of the Wa-co area had be-en no-ti-ced and in-ves-ti-ga-ted be-fo-re,
mostly by so-ci-olo-gists. Bobby sa-id that when you fed eno-ugh sta-tis-ti-cal da-ta on Wa-co and
si-mi-lar are-as in-to a com-pu-ter-po-pu-la-ti-on den-sity, me-an age, me-an eco-no-mic le-vel, me-an
edu-ca-ti-onal le-vel, and do-zens of ot-her fac-tors-what you got back was a whop-per of an
ano-maly. Scho-larly pa-pers are ra-rely jocu-lar, but even so, se-ve-ral of the bet-ter than fifty Bobby
had re-ad on the su-bj-ect sug-ges-ted iro-ni-cal-ly that may-be it was "so-met-hing in the wa-ter."
"I de-ci-ded may-be it was ti-me to ta-ke the joke se-ri-o-usly," Bobby sa-id. "After all, the-re's
so-met-hing in the wa-ter of a lot of pla-ces that pre-vents to-oth de-cay. It's cal-led flu-ori-de."
He went to Wa-co ac-com-pa-ni-ed by a trio of re-se-arch as-sis-tants: two so-ci-ology
grad-stu-dents and a full pro-fes-sor of ge-ology who hap-pe-ned to be on sab-ba-ti-cal and re-ady for
ad-ven-tu-re. Wit-hin six months, Bobby and the so-ci-ology guys had const-ruc-ted a com-pu-ter
prog-ram which il-lust-ra-ted what my brot-her cal-led the world's only calm qu-ake. He had a slightly
rump-led prin-to-ut in his to-te. He ga-ve it to me. I was lo-oking at a se-ri-es of forty con-cent-ric rings.
Wa-co was in the eighth, ninth, and tenth as you mo-ved in to-ward the cent-re.
"Now lo-ok at this," he sa-id, and put a trans-pa-rent over-lay on the prin-to-ut. Mo-re rings; but in
each one the-re was a num-ber. For-ti-eth ring: 471. Thirty-ninth: 420. Thirty-eighth: 418. And so on. In
a co-up-le of pla-ces the num-bers went up ins-te-ad of down, but only in a co-up-le (and only by a
lit-tle).
"What are they?"
"Each num-ber rep-re-sents the in-ci-den-ce of vi-olent cri-me in that par-ti-cu-lar circ-le," Bobby
sa-id. "Mur-der, ra-pe, as-sa-ult and bat-tery, even acts of van-da-lism. The com-pu-ter as-signs a
num-ber by a for-mu-la that ta-kes po-pu-la-ti-on den-sity in-to ac-co-unt." He tap-ped the
twenty-se-venth circ-le, which held the num-ber 204, with his fin-ger. "The-re's less than ni-ne hund-red
pe-op-le in this who-le area, for ins-tan-ce. The num-ber rep-re-sents three or fo-ur ca-ses of spo-use
abu-se, a co-up-le of bar-ro-om brawls, an act of ani-mal cru-elty-so-me se-ni-le far-mer got pis-sed at
a pig and shot a lo-ad of rock-salt in-to it, as I re-call-and one in-vo-lun-tary mans-la-ugh-ter."
I saw that the num-bers in the cent-ral circ-les drop-ped off ra-di-cal-ly: 85, 81, 70, 63,40,21,5. At

the epi-cent-re of Bobby's calm qu-ake was the town of La Pla-ta. To call it a sle-epy lit-tle town
se-ems mo-re than fa-ir.
The nu-me-ric va-lue as-sig-ned to La Pla-ta was ze-ro.
"So he-re it is, Bow-Wow," Bobby sa-id, le-aning for-ward and rub-bing his long hands to-get-her
ner-vo-usly, "my no-mi-nee for the Gar-den of Eden. He-re's a com-mu-nity of fif-te-en tho-usand,
twenty-fo-ur per cent of which are pe-op-le of mi-xed blo-od, com-monly cal-led In-di-os. The-re's a
moc-ca-sin fac-tory, a co-up-le of lit-tle mo-tor co-urts, a co-up-le of scrub farms. That's it for work.
For play the-re's fo-ur bars, a co-up-le of dan-ce halls whe-re you can he-ar any kind of mu-sic you
want as long as it so-unds li-ke Ge-or-ge Jones, two dri-ve-ins, and a bow-ling al-ley." He pa-used and
ad-ded, "The-re's al-so a still. I didn't know any-body ma-de whis-key that go-od out-si-de of
Ten-nes-see."
In short (and it is now too la-te to be anyt-hing el-se), La Pla-ta sho-uld ha-ve be-en a fer-ti-le
bre-eding gro-und for the sort of ca-su-al vi-olen-ce you can re-ad abo-ut in the Po-li-ce Blot-ter
sec-ti-on of the lo-cal news-pa-per every day. Sho-uld ha-ve be-en but wasn't. The-re had be-en only
one mur-der in La Pla-ta du-ring the fi-ve ye-ars pre-vi-o-us to my brot-her's ar-ri-val, two ca-ses of
as-sa-ult, no ra-pes, no re-por-ted in-ci-dents of child abu-se. The-re had be-en fo-ur ar-med
rob-be-ri-es, but all fo-ur tur-ned out to ha-ve be-en com-mit-ted by tran-si-ents… as the mur-der and
one of the as-sa-ults had be-en. The lo-cal She-riff was a fat old Re-pub-li-can who did a pretty fa-ir
Rod-ney Dan-ger-fi-eld imi-ta-ti-on. He had be-en known, in fact, to spend who-le days in the lo-cal
cof-fee shop, tug-ging the knot in his tie and tel-ling pe-op-le to ta-ke his wi-fe, ple-ase. My brot-her
sa-id he tho-ught it was a lit-tle mo-re than la-me hu-mo-ur; he was pretty su-re the po-or guy was
suf-fe-ring first-sta-ge Alz-he-imer's Di-se-ase. His only de-puty was his nep-hew. Bobby told me the
nep-hew lo-oked qu-ite a lot li-ke Juni-or Samp-les on the old Hee-Haw show.
"Put tho-se two guys in a Pen-nsyl-va-nia town si-mi-lar to La Pla-ta in every way but the
ge-og-rap-hi-cal," Bobby sa-id, "and they wo-uld ha-ve be-en out on the-ir as-ses fif-te-en ye-ars ago.
But in La Pla-ta, they're gon-na go on un-til they die…which they'll pro-bably do in the-ir sle-ep."
"What did you do?" I as-ked. "How did you pro-ce-ed?"
"Well, for the first we-ek or so af-ter we got our sta-tis-ti-cal shit to-get-her, we just sort of sat
aro-und and sta-red at each ot-her," Bobby sa-id. "I me-an, we we-re pre-pa-red for so-met-hing, but
not-hing qu-ite li-ke this. Even Wa-co do-esn't pre-pa-re you for La Pla-ta." Bobby shif-ted rest-les-sly
and crac-ked his knuck-les.
"Jesus, I ha-te it when you do that," I sa-id.
He smi-led. "Sorry, Bow-Wow. Any-way, we star-ted ge-olo-gi-cal tests, then mic-ros-co-pic
analy-sis of the wa-ter. I didn't ex-pect a hell of a lot; ever-yo-ne in the area has got a well, usu-al-ly a
de-ep one, and they get the-ir wa-ter tes-ted re-gu-larly to ma-ke su-re they're not drin-king bo-rax, or
so-met-hing. If the-re had be-en so-met-hing ob-vi-o-us, it wo-uld ha-ve tur-ned up a long ti-me ago.
So we went on to sub-mic-ros-copy, and that was when we star-ted to turn up so-me pretty we-ird
stuff."
"What kind of we-ird stuff?"
"Breaks in cha-ins of atoms, subdy-na-mic elect-ri-cal fluc-tu-ati-ons, and so-me sort of
uni-den-ti-fi-ed pro-te-in. Wa-ter ain't re-al-ly H20, you know-not when you add in the sulp-hi-des,
irons, God knows what el-se hap-pens to be in the aqu-ifer of a gi-ven re-gi-on. And La Pla-ta
wa-ter-you'd ha-ve to gi-ve it a string of let-ters li-ke the ones af-ter a pro-fes-sor eme-ri-tus's na-me."
His eyes gle-amed. "But the pro-te-in was the most in-te-res-ting thing, Bow-Wow. So far as we know,
it's only fo-und in one ot-her pla-ce: the hu-man bra-in."
Uh-oh.
It just ar-ri-ved, bet-we-en one swal-low and the next: the thro-at-dryness. Not much as yet, but
eno-ugh for me to bre-ak away and get a glass of ice-wa-ter. I've got may-be forty mi-nu-tes left. And
oh Jesus, the-re's so much I want to tell! Abo-ut the wasps' nests they fo-und with wasps that wo-uldn't
sting, abo-ut the fen-der-ben-der Bobby and one of his as-sis-tants saw whe-re the two dri-vers, both

ma-le, both drunk, and both abo-ut twenty-fo-ur (so-ci-olo-gi-cal bull mo-ose, in ot-her words), got out,
sho-ok hands, and exc-han-ged in-su-ran-ce in-for-ma-ti-on ami-cably be-fo-re go-ing in-to the
ne-arest bar for anot-her drink.
Bobby tal-ked for ho-urs-mo-re ho-urs than I ha-ve. But the ups-hot was simp-le: the stuff in the
ma-yon-na-ise jar.
"We've got our own still in La Pla-ta now," he sa-id. "This is the stuff we're bre-wing, Ho-wie;
pa-ci-fist whi-te light-ning. The aqu-ifer un-der that area of Te-xas is de-ep but ama-zingly lar-ge; it's
li-ke this inc-re-dib-le La-ke Vic-to-ria dri-ven in-to the po-ro-us se-di-ment which over-lays the
Mo-ho. The wa-ter is po-tent, but we've be-en ab-le to ma-ke the stuff I squ-ir-ted on the wasps even
mo-re po-tent. We've got damn ne-ar six tho-usand gal-lons now, in the-se big ste-el tanks. By the end
of the ye-ar, we'll ha-ve fo-ur-te-en tho-usand. By next June we'll ha-ve thirty tho-usand. But it's not
eno-ugh. We ne-ed mo-re, we ne-ed it fas-ter…and then we ne-ed to trans-port it."
"Transport it whe-re?" I as-ked him.
"Borneo, to start with."
I tho-ught I'd eit-her lost my mind or mis-he-ard him. I re-al-ly did.
"Look, Bow-Wow…sor-ry. Ho-wie." He was scrum-ming thro-ugh his to-te-bag aga-in. He bro-ught
out a num-ber of aeri-al pho-tog-raphs and han-ded them over to me. "You see?" he as-ked as I
lo-oked thro-ugh them. "You see how fuc-king per-fect it is? It's as if God Him-self sud-denly bus-ted
thro-ugh our bu-si-ness-as-usu-al trans-mis-si-ons with so-met-hing li-ke 'And now we bring you a
spe-ci-al bul-le-tin! This is yo-ur last chan-ce, as-sho-les! And now we re-turn you to Days of Our
Li-ves?"
"I don't get you," I sa-id. "And I ha-ve no idea what I'm lo-oking at." Of co-ur-se I knew; it was an
is-land-not Bor-neo it-self but an is-land lying to the west of Bor-neo iden-ti-fi-ed as Gu-lan-dio-with a
mo-un-ta-in in the mid-dle and a lot of muddy lit-tle vil-la-ges lying on its lo-wer slo-pes. It was hard to
see the mo-un-ta-in be-ca-use of the clo-ud co-ver. What I me-ant was that I didn't know what I was
lo-oking for.
"The mo-un-ta-in has the sa-me na-me as the is-land," he sa-id. "Gu-lan-dio. In the lo-cal pa-to-is it
me-ans gra-ce, fa-te, or des-tiny, or ta-ke yo-ur pick. But Du-ke Ro-gers says it's re-al-ly the big-gest
ti-me-bomb on earth…and it's wi-red to go off by Oc-to-ber of next ye-ar. Pro-bably ear-li-er."
The crazy thing's this: the story's only crazy if you try to tell it in a spe-ed-rap, which is what I'm trying
to do now. Bobby wan-ted me to help him ra-ise so-mew-he-re bet-we-en six hund-red tho-usand and
a mil-li-on and a half dol-lars to do the fol-lo-wing: first, to synthe-si-ze fifty to se-venty tho-usand
gal-lons of what he cal-led "the high-test"; se-cond, to air-lift all of this wa-ter to Bor-neo, which had
lan-ding fa-ci-li-ti-es (you co-uld land a hang-gli-der on Gu-lan-dio, but that was abo-ut all); third, to
ship it over to this is-land na-med Fa-te, or Des-tiny, or Gra-ce; fo-urth, to truck it up the slo-pe of the
vol-ca-no, which had be-en dor-mant (sa-ve for a few puffs in 1938) sin-ce 1804, and then to drop it
down the muddy tu-be of the vol-ca-no's cal-de-ra. Du-ke Ro-gers was ac-tu-al-ly John Pa-ul Ro-gers,
the ge-ology pro-fes-sor. He cla-imed that Gu-lan-dio was go-ing to do mo-re than just erupt; he
cla-imed that it was go-ing to exp-lo-de, as Kra-ka-toa had do-ne in the ni-ne-te-enth cen-tury,
cre-ating a bang that wo-uld ma-ke the Squ-irt Bomb that po-iso-ned Lon-don lo-ok li-ke a kid's
fi-rec-rac-ker.
The deb-ris from the Kra-ka-toa blow-up, Bobby told me, had li-te-ral-ly en-circ-led the glo-be; the
ob-ser-ved re-sults had for-med an im-por-tant part of the Sa-gan (Gro-ups nuc-le-ar win-ter the-ory.
For three months af-ter-ward sun-sets and sun-ri-ses half a world away had be-en gro-tes-qu-ely
co-lo-ur-ful as a re-sult of the ash whir-ling aro-und in both the jet stre-am and the Van Al-len Cur-rents,
which lie forty mi-les be-low the Van Al-len Belt. The-re had be-en glo-bal chan-ges in cli-ma-te which
las-ted fi-ve ye-ars, and ni-pa palms, which pre-vi-o-usly had grown only in eas-tern Af-ri-ca and
Mic-ro-ne-sia, sud-denly sho-wed up in both So-uth and North Ame-ri-ca.
"The North Ame-ri-can ni-pas all di-ed be-fo-re 1900," Bobby sa-id, "but they're ali-ve and well
be-low the equ-ator. Kra-ka-toa se-eded them the-re, Ho-wie…the way I want to se-ed La Pla-ta

wa-ter all over the earth. I want pe-op-le to go out in La Pla-ta wa-ter when it ra-ins-and it's go-ing to
ra-in a lot af-ter Gu-lan-dio go-es bang. I want them to drink the La Pla-ta wa-ter that falls in the-ir
re-ser-vo-irs, I want them to wash the-ir ha-ir in it, bat-he in it, so-ak the-ir con-tact len-ses in it. I want
who-res to do-uc-he in it."
"Bobby," I sa-id, kno-wing he was not, "you're crazy."
He ga-ve me a cro-oked, ti-red grin. "I ain't crazy," he sa-id. "You want to see crazy? Turn on CNN,
Bow…Ho-wie. You'll see crazy in li-ving co-lo-ur."
But I didn't ne-ed to turn on Cab-le News (what a fri-end of mi-ne had ta-ken to cal-ling The
Or-gan-Grin-der of Do-om) to know what Bobby was tal-king abo-ut. The In-di-ans and the
Pa-kis-ta-nis we-re po-ised on the brink. The Chi-ne-se and the Afg-hans, dit-to. Half of Af-ri-ca was
star-ving, the ot-her half on fi-re with AIDS. The-re had be-en bor-der skir-mis-hes along the en-ti-re
Tex-Mex bor-der in the last fi-ve ye-ars, sin-ce Me-xi-co went Com-mu-nist, and pe-op-le had star-ted
cal-ling the Ti-j-u-ana cros-sing po-int in Ca-li-for-nia Lit-tle Ber-lin be-ca-use of the wall. The
sab-re-rat-tling had be-co-me a din. On the last day of the old ye-ar the Sci-en-tists for Nuc-le-ar
Res-pon-si-bi-lity had set the-ir black clock to fif-te-en se-conds be-fo-re mid-night.
"Bobby, let's sup-po-se it co-uld be do-ne and everyt-hing went ac-cor-ding to sche-du-le," I sa-id.
"It pro-bably co-uldn't and wo-uldn't, but let's sup-po-se. You don't ha-ve the sligh-test idea what the
long-term ef-fects might be."
He star-ted to say so-met-hing and I wa-ved it away.
"Don't even sug-gest that you do, be-ca-use you don't! You've had ti-me to find this calm qu-ake of
yo-urs and iso-la-te the ca-use, I'll gi-ve you that. But did you ever he-ar abo-ut tha-li-do-mi-de? That
nifty lit-tle ac-ne-stop-per and sle-eping pill that ca-used can-cer and he-art at-tacks in thirty-ye-ar-olds?
Don't you re-mem-ber the AIDS vac-ci-ne in 1997?"
"Howie?"
"That one stop-ped the di-se-ase, ex-cept it tur-ned the test su-bj-ects in-to in-cu-rab-le epi-lep-tics
who all di-ed wit-hin eigh-te-en months."
"Howie?"
"Then the-re was-"
"Howie?"
I stop-ped and lo-oked at him.
"The world," Bobby sa-id, and then stop-ped. His thro-at wor-ked. I saw he was strug-gling with
te-ars. "The world ne-eds he-ro-ic me-asu-res, man. I don't know abo-ut long-term ef-fects, and
the-re's no ti-me to study them, be-ca-use the-re's no long-term pros-pect. May-be we can cu-re the
who-le mess. Or may-be-"
He shrug-ged, tri-ed to smi-le, and lo-oked at me with shi-ning eyes from which two sing-le te-ars
slowly trac-ked.
"Or may-be we're gi-ving he-ro-in to a pa-ti-ent with ter-mi-nal can-cer. Eit-her way, it'll stop what's
hap-pe-ning now. It'll end the world's pa-in." He spre-ad out his hands, palms up, so I co-uld see the
stings on them. "Help me, Bow-Wow. Ple-ase help me."
So I hel-ped him.
And we fuc-ked up. In fact I think you co-uld say we fuc-ked up big-ti-me. And do you want the
truth? I don't gi-ve a shit. We kil-led all the plants, but at le-ast we sa-ved the gre-en-ho-use.
So-met-hing will grow he-re aga-in, so-me-day. I ho-pe.
Are you re-ading this?
My ge-ars are star-ting to get a lit-tle sticky. For the first ti-me in ye-ars I'm ha-ving to think abo-ut
what I'm do-ing. The mo-tor-mo-ve-ments of wri-ting. Sho-uld ha-ve hur-ri-ed mo-re at the start.
Never mind. Too la-te to chan-ge things now.
We did it, of co-ur-se: dis-til-led the wa-ter, flew it in, trans-por-ted it to Gu-lan-dio, bu-ilt a
pri-mi-ti-ve lif-ting system-half mo-tor-winch and half cog ra-il-way-up the si-de of the vol-ca-no, and

drop-ped over twel-ve tho-usand fi-ve-gal-lon con-ta-iners of La Pla-ta wa-ter-the bra-in-bus-ter
ver-si-on-into the murky misty depths of the vol-ca-no's cal-de-ra. We did all of this in just eight months.
It didn't cost six hund-red tho-usand dol-lars, or a mil-li-on and a half; it cost over fo-ur mil-li-on, still
less than a six-te-enth of one per cent of what Ame-ri-ca spent on de-fen-se that ye-ar. You want to
know how we ra-zed it? I'd tell you if I had mo-re thyme, but my he-ad's fal-ling apart so ne-ver mend. I
ra-ised most of it myself if it mat-ters to you. So-me by ho-of and so-me by cro-of. Tell you the truth, I
didn't know I co-uld do it myself un-til I did. But we did it and so-me-how the world held to-get-her and
that vol-ca-no-wha-te-ver its na-me wuz, I can't exactly re-mem-ber now and the-re iz-zunt ti-me to go
back over the ma-nusc-ript-it blue just when it was spoWait
Okay. A lit-tle bet-ter. Di-gi-ta-lin. Bobby had it. He-art's be-ating li-ke crazy but I can think aga-in.
The vol-ca-no-Mo-unt Gra-ce, we cal-led it-blue just when Do-ok Ro-gers sa-id it wo-uld.
Everyt-hing when ski-hi and for aw-hi-le ever-yo-ne's at-ten-ti-on tur-ned away from wha-te-ver and
to-ward the skys. And bim-mel-dee-dee, sa-id Strap-less!
It hap-pe-ned pretty fast li-ke sex and checks and spe-ci-al ef-fex and every-body got he-althy
aga-in. I me-anwait
Jesus ple-ase let me fi-nish this.
I me-an that every-body sto-od down. Every-body star-ted to get a lit-tle purs-tec-ti-ve on the

Bobby went on with his re-surch. La Pla-ta. So-ci-olo-gi-cal backg-ro-und etc. You re-mem-ber the
lo-cal She-riff? Fat old Re-pub-li-can with a go-od Rod-ney Yo-ungb-lo-od imi-tas-hun? How Bobby

II - ORSON SCOTT CARD - SALVAGE
The ro-ad be-gan to climb ste-eply right from the ferry, so the truck co-uldn't bu-ild up any spe-ed.
De-aver just kept shif-ting down, win-cing as he lis-te-ned to the grin-ding of the ge-ars. So-un-ded li-ke
the trans-mis-si-on was che-wing it-self to gra-vel. He'd be-en nur-sing it all the way ac-ross Ne-va-da,
and if the Wen-do-ver ferry hadn't car-ri-ed him the-se last mi-les over the Mor-mon Sea, he wo-uld
ha-ve had a ni-ce long hi-ke. Lucky. It was a go-od sign. Things we-re go-ing to go De-aver's way for a
whi-le.
The mec-ha-nic frow-ned at him when he rat-tled in to the lo-ading dock. "You be-en ri-din the
clutch, boy?"
Deaver got down from the cab. "Clutch? What's a clutch?"
The mec-ha-nic didn't smi-le. "Co-uldn't you he-ar the trans-mis-si-on was shot?"
"I had mec-ha-nics all the way ac-ross Ne-va-da as-kin to fix it for me, but I told em I was sa-vin it
for you."
The mec-ha-nic lo-oked at him li-ke he was crazy. "The-re ain't no mec-ha-nics in Ne-va-da."
If you wasn't dumb as yo-ur thumb, tho-ught De-aver, you'd know I was joking. The-se old
Mor-mons we-re so stra-ight they co-uldn't sit down, so-me of them. But De-aver didn't say anyt-hing,
just smi-led.
"This truck's gon-na stay he-re a few days," sa-id the mec-ha-nic.
Fine with me, tho-ught De-aver. I got plans. "How many days you fi-gu-re?"
"Take three for now, I’ll sign you off."
"My na-mes De-aver Te-ague."
"Tell the fo-re-man, he'll wri-te it up." The mec-ha-nic lif-ted the ho-od to be-gin the ro-uti-ne checks
whi-le the dock boys lo-aded off the old was-hing mac-hi-nes and ref-ri-ge-ra-tors and ot-her stuff
De-aver had pic-ked up on this trip. De-aver to-ok his mi-le-age re-ading to the win-dow and the
fo-re-man pa-id him off.
Seven dol-lars for fi-ve days of dri-ving and lo-ading, sle-eping in the cab and eating wha-te-ver the
far-mers co-uld spa-re. It was bet-ter than a lot of pe-op-le li-ved on, but the-re wasn't any fu-tu-re in it.
Sal-va-ge wo-uldn't go on fo-re-ver. So-me-day he'd pick up the last bro-ken-down dish-was-her left
from the old days, and then he'd be out of a job.
Well, De-aver Te-ague wasn't go-ing to wa-it aro-und for that. He knew whe-re the gold was, he'd
be-en plan-ning how to get it for we-eks, and if Le-hi had got the di-ving equ-ip-ment li-ke he
pro-mi-sed then to-mor-row mor-ning they'd do a lit-tle fre-elan-ce sal-va-ge work. If they we-re lucky
they'd co-me ho-me rich.
Deaver's legs we-re stiff but he lo-ose-ned them up pretty qu-ick and bro-ke in-to an easy, lo-ping
run down the cor-ri-dors of the Sal-va-ge Cent-re. He to-ok a flight of sta-irs two or three steps at a
ti-me, bo-un-ded down a hall, and when he re-ac-hed a sign that sa-id SMALL COM-PU-TER
SAL-VA-GE, he pus-hed off the do-orf-ra-me and re-bo-un-ded in-to the ro-om. "Hey Le-hi!" he
sa-id. "Hey it's qu-it-tin ti-me!"
Lehi McKay pa-id no at-ten-ti-on. He was sit-ting in front of a TV scre-en, jer-king at a black box he
held on his lap.
"You do that and you'll go blind," sa-id De-aver.

"Shut up, carp-fa-ce." Le-hi ne-ver to-ok his eyes off the scre-en. He jab-bed at a but-ton on the
black box and twis-ted on the stick that jut-ted up from it. A co-lo-red blob on the scre-en blew up and
split in-to fo-ur smal-ler blobs.
"I got three days off whi-le they do the trans-mis-si-on on the truck," sa-id De-aver. "So to-mor-row's
the temp-le ex-pe-di-ti-on."
Lehi got the last blob off the scre-en. Mo-re blobs ap-pe-ared.
"That's re-al fun," sa-id De-aver, "li-ke swe-epin the stre-et and then they bring along anot-her tro-op
of hor-ses."
"It's an Ata-ri. From the six-ti-es or se-ven-ti-es or so-met-hing. Eigh-ti-es. Old. Can't do much with
the pi-eces, it's only eight-bit stuff. All the-se ye-ars in so-me-body's at-tic in Lo-gan, and the suc-ker
still runs."
"Old guys pro-bably didn't even know they had it."
"Probably."
Deaver watc-hed the ga-me. Sa-me thing over and over aga-in. "How much a thing li-ke this use to
cost?"
"A lot. May-be fif-te-en, twenty bucks."
"Makes you want to barf. And he-re sits Le-hi McKay, to-od-ling his no-od-le li-ke the old guys use
to. All it ever got them was a so-re no-od-le, Le-hi. And slag for bra-ins." "Drown it. I'm trying to
con-cent-ra-te."
The ga-me fi-nal-ly en-ded. Le-hi set the black box up on the work-bench, tur-ned off the mac-hi-ne,
and sto-od up.
"You got everyt-hing re-ady to go un-der-wa-ter to-mor-row?" as-ked De-aver.
"That was a go-od ga-me. Ha-ving fun must-Ve to-ok up a lot of the-ir ti-me in the old days. Mom
says the kids used to not even be ab-le to get jobs till they was six-te-en. It was the law."
"Don t you wish," sa-id De-aver.
"It's true."
"You don't know yo-ur ton-gue from dung, Le-hi. You don't know yo-ur he-art from a fart."
"You want to get us both kic-ked out of he-re, tal-kin li-ke that?"
"I don't ha-ve to fol-low scho-ol ru-les now, I gra-du-ated sixth gra-de, I'm ni-ne-te-en ye-ars old, I
be-en on my own for fi-ve ye-ars." He pul-led his se-ven dol-lars out of his poc-ket, wa-ved them
on-ce, stuf-fed them back in ca-re-les-sly. "I do OK, and I talk li-ke I want to talk. Think I'm af-ra-id of
the Bis-hop?"
"Bishop don't sca-re me. I don't even go to church ex-cept to ma-ke Mom happy. It's a bunch of
bunny turds."
Lehi la-ug-hed, but De-aver co-uld see that he was a lit-tle sca-red to talk li-ke that. Six-te-en ye-ars
old, tho-ught De-aver, he's big and he's smart but he's such a lit-tle kid. He don't un-ders-tand how it's
li-ke to be a man. "Ra-in's co-min."
"Rain's al-ways co-min. What the hell do you think fil-led up the la-ke?" Le-hi smir-ked as he
unp-lug-ged everyt-hing on the work-bench.
"I me-ant Lor-ra-ine Wil-son."
"I know what you me-ant. She's got her bo-at?"
"And she's got a me-an set of fen-ders." De-aver cup-ped his hands. "Just ne-ed a lit-tle po-lis-hing."
"Why do you al-ways talk dirty? Ever sin-ce you star-ted dri-ving sal-va-ge, De-aver, you got a
gut-ter mo-uth. Be-si-des, she's bu-ilt li-ke a sack."
"She's ne-ar fifty, what do you ex-pect?" It oc-cur-red to De-aver that Le-hi se-emed to be stal-ling.
Which pro-bably me-ant he botc-hed up aga-in as usu-al. "Can you get the di-ving stuff?"
"I al-re-ady got it. You tho-ught I'd screw up." Le-hi smir-ked aga-in.
"You? Screw up? You can be trus-ted with an-y-t-hing" De-aver star-ted for the do-or. He co-uld
he-ar Le-hi be-hind him, still shut-ting a few things off. They got to use a lot of elect-ri-city in he-re. Of
co-ur-se they had to, be-ca-use they ne-eded com-pu-ters all the ti-me, and sal-va-ge was the only way
to get them. But when De-aver saw all that elect-ri-city get-ting used up at on-ce, to him it lo-oked li-ke

his own fu-tu-re. All the mac-hi-nes he co-uld ever want, new ones, and all the po-wer they ne-eded.
Clot-hes that no-body el-se ever wo-re, his own hor-se and wa-gon or even a car. May-be he'd be the
guy who star-ted ma-king cars aga-in. He didn't ne-ed stu-pid blob-smas-hing ga-mes from the past.
"That stuff's de-ad and go-ne, duck lips, de-ad and go-ne."
" What're you tal-king abo-ut?" as-ked Le-hi. "De-ad and go-ne. All yo-ur com-pu-ter things."
It was eno-ugh to set Le-hi off, as it al-ways did. De-aver grin-ned and felt wic-ked and strong as
Le-hi bab-bled along be-hind him. Abo-ut how we use the com-pu-ters mo-re than they ever did in the
old days, the com-pu-ters kept everyt-hing go-ing, on and on and on, it was cu-te, De-aver li-ked him,
the boy was so in-ten-se. Li-ke everyt-hing was the end of the world. De-aver knew bet-ter. The world
was de-ad, it had al-re-ady en-ded, so no-ne of it mat-te-red, you co-uld sink all this stuff in the la-ke.
They ca-me out of the Cent-re and wal-ked along the re-ta-ining wall. Far be-low them was the
har-bo-ur, a lit-tle circ-le of wa-ter in the bot-tom of a bowl, with Bing-ham City perc-hed on the lip.
They used to ha-ve an open-pit cop-per mi-ne he-re, but when the wa-ter ro-se they cut a chan-nel to it
and now they had a ni-ce har-bo-ur on Oqu-ir-rh Is-land in the mid-dle of the Mor-mon Sea, whe-re the
fac-to-ri-es co-uld stink up the who-le sky and no ne-igh-bo-urs ever comp-la-ined abo-ut it.
A lot of ot-her pe-op-le jo-ined them on the ste-ep dirt ro-ad that led down to the har-bo-ur.
No-body li-ved right in Bing-ham City it-self, be-ca-use it was just a wor-king pla-ce, day and night.
Shifts in, shifts out. Le-hi was a shift boy, li-ved with his fa-mily ac-ross the Jor-dan Stra-it on
Po-int-of-the-Mo-un-ta-in, which was as rot-ten a pla-ce to li-ve as any-body ever de-vi-sed, ro-de the
ferry in every day at fi-ve in the mor-ning and ro-de it back every af-ter-no-on at fo-ur. He was
sup-po-sed to go to scho-ol af-ter that for a co-up-le of ho-urs but De-aver tho-ught that was stu-pid,
he told Le-hi that all the ti-me, told him aga-in now. Scho-ol is too much ti-me and too lit-tle of
everyt-hing, a was-te of ti-me.
"I got-ta go to scho-ol," sa-id Le-hi.
"Tell me two plus two, you ha-ven't got two plus two yet?" "You fi-nis-hed, didn't you?"
"Nobody ne-eds anyt-hing af-ter fo-urth gra-de." He sho-ved Le-hi a lit-tle. Usu-al-ly Le-hi sho-ved
back, but this ti-me no.
"Just try get-ting a re-al job wit-ho-ut a sixth-gra-de dip-lo-ma, OK? And I'm pretty clo-se now."
They we-re at the ferry ship. Le-hi got out his pass.
"You with me to-mor-row or not?"
Lehi ma-de a fa-ce. "I don't know, De-aver. You can get ar-res-ted for go-ing aro-und the-re. It's a
dumb thing to do. They say the-re's re-al we-ird things in the old skyscra-pers."
"We aren't go-ing in the skyscra-pers."
"Even wor-se in the-re, De-aver. I don't want to go the-re."
"Yeah, the An-gel Mo-ro-ni's pro-bably wa-iting to jump out and say bo-oga-bo-oga-bo-oga."
"Don't talk abo-ut it, De-aver." De-aver was tick-ling him; Le-hi la-ug-hed and tri-ed to shy away.
"Cut it out, chig-ger-he-ad. Co-me on. Be-si-des, the Mo-ro-ni sta-tue was mo-ved to the Salt La-ke
Mo-nu-ment up on the mo-un-ta-in. And that has a gu-ard all the ti-me."
"The sta-tue's just gold pla-te any-way. I'm tel-lin you tho-se old Mor-mons hid tons of stuff down in
the Temp-le, just wa-itin for so-me-body who isn't sca-red of the ghost of Bi-gamy Yo-ung to -"
"Shut up, snot-suc-ker, OK? Pe-op-le can he-ar! Lo-ok aro-und, we're not alo-ne!"
It was true, of co-ur-se. So-me of the ot-her pe-op-le we-re gla-ring at them. But then, De-aver
no-ti-ced that ol-der pe-op-le li-ked to gla-re at yo-un-ger ones. It ma-de the old farts fe-el bet-ter
abo-ut kic-king off. It was li-ke they we-re sa-ying, OK, I'm dying, but at le-ast you're stu-pid. So
De-aver lo-oked right at a wo-man who was sta-ring at him and mur-mu-red, "OK, I'm stu-pid, but at
le-ast I won't die."
"Deaver, do you al-ways ha-ve to say that whe-re they can he-ar you?"
"It's true."
"In the first pla-ce, De-aver, they aren't dying. And in the se-cond pla-ce, you're de-fi-ni-tely stu-pid.
And in the third pla-ce, the ferry's he-re." Le-hi punc-hed De-aver lightly in the sto-mach.

Deaver bent over in mock agony. "Ay, the lad-die's ung-ra-te-ful, he is, I gi-ve him me last cro-ost of
bre-ad and this be the thanks I gets."
"Nobody has an ac-cent li-ke that, De-aver!" sho-uted Le-hi. The bo-at be-gan to pull away.
"Tomorrow at fi-ve-thirty!" sho-uted De-aver.
"You'll ne-ver get up at fo-ur-thirty, don't gi-ve me that, you ne-ver get up… " But the ferry and the
no-ise of the fac-to-ri-es and mac-hi-ne and trucks swal-lo-wed up the rest of his in-sults. De-aver knew
them all, any-way. Le-hi might be only six-te-en, but he was OK. So-me-day De-aver'd get mar-ri-ed
but his wi-fe wo-uld li-ke Le-hi, too. And Le-hi'd even get mar-ri-ed, and his wi-fe wo-uld li-ke
De-aver. She'd bet-ter, or she'd ha-ve to swim ho-me.
He to-ok the trol-ley ho-me to Fort Do-ug-las and wal-ked to the an-ci-ent bar-racks bu-il-ding
whe-re Ra-in let him stay. It was sup-po-sed to be a sto-ra-ge ro-om, but she kept the mops and so-ap
stuff in her pla-ce so that the-re'd be ro-om for a cot.
Not much el-se, but it was on Oqu-ir-rh Is-land wit-ho-ut be-ing right the-re in the stink and the
smo-ke and the no-ise. He co-uld sle-ep and that was eno-ugh, sin-ce most of the ti-me he was out on
the truck.
Truth was, his ro-om wasn't ho-me any-way. Ho-me was pretty much Ra-in's pla-ce, a drafty ro-om
at the end of the bar-racks with a dumpy frowzy lady who ser-ved him go-od fo-od and plenty of it.
That's whe-re he went now, wal-ked right in and surp-ri-sed her in the kitc-hen. She yel-led at him for
surp-ri-sing her, yel-led at him for be-ing filthy and trac-king all over her flo-or, and let him get a sli-ce of
ap-ple be-fo-re she yel-led at him for snitc-hing be-fo-re sup-per.
He went aro-und and chan-ged light bulbs in fi-ve ro-oms be-fo-re sup-per. The fa-mi-li-es the-re
we-re all cram-med in-to two ro-oms each at the most, and most of them had to sha-re kitc-hens and eat
in shifts. So-me of the ro-oms we-re nasty pla-ces, fa-mily war-fa-re held off only as long as it to-ok him
to chan-ge the light, and so-me-ti-mes even that tru-ce wasn't ob-ser-ved. Ot-hers we-re do-ing fi-ne,
the pla-ce was small but they li-ked each ot-her. De-aver was pretty su-re his fa-mily must ha-ve be-en
one of the ni-ce ones, be-ca-use if the-re'd be-en any yel-ling he wo-uld ha-ve re-mem-be-red.
Rain and De-aver ate and then tur-ned off all the lights whi-le she pla-yed the old re-cord pla-yer
De-aver had wang-led away from Le-hi. They re-al-ly we-ren't sup-po-sed to ha-ve it, but they
fi-gu-red as long as they didn't burn any lights it wasn't was-ting elect-ri-city, and they'd turn it in as so-on
as any-body as-ked for it.
In the me-an-ti-me, Ra-in had so-me of the old re-cords from when she was a girl. The songs had
strong rhythms, and to-night, li-ke she so-me-ti-mes did, Ra-in got up and mo-ved to the mu-sic,
stran-ge lit-tle dan-ces that De-aver didn't un-ders-tand un-less he ima-gi-ned her as a lit-he yo-ung girl,
pic-tu-red her body as it must ha-ve be-en then. It wasn't hard to ima-gi-ne, it was the-re in her eyes and
her smi-le all the ti-me, and her mo-ve-ments ga-ve away sec-rets that ye-ars of starchy eating and lack
of exer-ci-se had dis-gu-ised.
Then, as al-ways, his tho-ughts went off to so-me of the girls he saw from his truck win-dow, dri-ving
by the fi-elds whe-re they bent over, hard at work, un-til they he-ard the truck and then they sto-od and
wa-ved. Every-body wa-ved at the sal-va-ge truck, so-me-ti-mes it was the only thing with a mo-tor that
ever ca-me by, the-ir only con-tact with the old mac-hi-nes. All the trac-tors, all the elect-ri-city we-re
re-ser-ved for the New So-il Lands; the old pla-ces we-re dying. And they tur-ned and wa-ved at the
last me-mo-ri-es. It ma-de De-aver sad and he ha-ted to be sad, all the-se pe-op-le clin-ging to a past
that ne-ver exis-ted.
"It ne-ver exis-ted," he sa-id alo-ud.
"Yes it did," Ra-in whis-pe-red. "Girls just wan-na ha-ve fu-un," she mur-mu-red along with the
re-cord. "I ha-ted this song when I was a girl. Or may-be it was my ma-ma who ha-ted it."
"You li-ve he-re then?"
"Indiana," she sa-id. "One of the sta-tes, way east." "We-re you a re-fu-gee, too?"
"No. We mo-ved he-re when I was six-te-en, se-ven-te-en, can't re-mem-ber. Whe-ne-ver things got
scary in the world, a lot of Mor-mons mo-ved ho-me. This was al-ways ho-me, no mat-ter what."
The re-cord en-ded. She tur-ned it off, tur-ned on the lights.

"Got the bo-at all gas-sed up?" as-ked De-aver.
"You don't want to go the-re," she sa-id.
"If the-re's gold down the-re, I want it."
"If the-re was gold the-re, De-aver, they wo-uld've ta-ken it out be-fo-re the wa-ter co-ve-red it. It's
not as if no-body got a war-ning, you know. The Mor-mon Sea wasn't a flash flo-od."
"If it isn't down the-re, what's all the hush-hush abo-ut? How co-me the La-ke Pat-rol ke-eps
pe-op-le from go-ing the-re?"
"I don't know, De-aver. May-be be-ca-use a lot of pe-op-le fe-el li-ke it's a holy pla-ce."
Deaver was used to this. Ra-in ne-ver went to church, but she still tal-ked li-ke a Mor-mon. Most
pe-op-le did, tho-ugh, when you scratc-hed them the wrong pla-ce. De-aver didn't li-ke it when they got
re-li-gi-o-us. "Angels ne-ed po-li-ce pro-tec-ti-on, is that it?"
"It used to be re-al im-por-tant to the Mor-mons in the old days, De-aver." She sat down on the
flo-or, le-aning aga-inst the wall un-der the win-dow.
"Well it's not-hin now. They got the-ir ot-her temp-les, don't they? And they're bu-il-ding the new one
in Za-ra-hem-la, right?"
"I don't know, De-aver. The one he-re, it was al-ways the re-al one. The cent-re." She bent
si-de-ways, le-aned on her hand, lo-oked down at the flo-or. "It still is."
Deaver saw she was get-ting re-al-ly som-ber now, re-al-ly sad. It hap-pe-ned to a lot of pe-op-le
who re-mem-be-red the old days. Li-ke a di-se-ase that ne-ver got cu-red. But De-aver knew the cu-re.
For Ra-in, any-way. "Is it true they used to kill pe-op-le in
there?"
It wor-ked. She gla-red at him and the lan-gu-or left her body. "Is that what you truc-kers talk abo-ut
all day?"
Deaver grin-ned. "The-re's sto-ri-es. Cut-tin pe-op-le up if they told whe-re the gold was hid."
"You know Mor-mons all over the pla-ce, now, De-aver, do you re-al-ly think we'd go cut-tin
pe-op-le up for tel-lin sec-rets?"
"I don't know. De-pends on the sec-rets, don't it?" He was sit-ting on his hands, kind of bo-un-cing a
lit-tle on the co-uch.
He co-uld see that she was a lit-tle mad for re-al, but didn't want to be. So she'd pre-tend to be mad
for play. She sat up, re-ac-hed for a pil-low to throw at him.
"No! No!" he cri-ed. "Don't cut me up! Don't fe-ed me to the carp!"
The pil-low hit him and he pre-ten-ded ela-bo-ra-tely to die.
"Just don't joke abo-ut things li-ke that," she sa-id.
"Things li-ke what? You don't be-li-eve in the old stuff any-mo-re. No-body do-es." "May-be not."
"Jesus was sup-po-sed to co-me aga-in, right? The-re was atom bombs drop-ped he-re and the-re,
and he was sup-po-sed to co-me."
"Prophet sa-id we was too wic-ked. He wo-uldn't co-me ca-use we lo-ved the things of the world too
much."
"Come on, if he was co-min he wo-uld've co-me, right?"
"Might still," she sa-id.
"Nobody be-li-eves that," sa-id De-aver. "Mor-mons are just the go-vern-ment, that's all. The
Bis-hop gets elec-ted jud-ge in every town, right? The pre-si-dent of the el-ders is al-ways ma-yor, it's
just the go-vern-ment, just po-li-tics, no-body be-li-eves it now. Za-ra-hem-la's the ca-pi-tal, not the
holy city."
He co-uldn't see her be-ca-use he was lying flat on his back on the co-uch. When she didn't ans-wer,
he got up and lo-oked for her. She was over by the sink, le-aning on the co-un-ter. He snuck up be-hind
her to tick-le her, but so-met-hing in her pos-tu-re chan-ged his mind. When he got clo-se, he saw te-ars
down her che-eks. It was crazy. All the-se pe-op-le from the old days got crazy a lot.
"I was just te-asin," he sa-id.
She nod-ded.
"It's just part of the old days. You know how I am abo-ut that. May-be if I re-mem-be-red, it'd be

dif-fe-rent. So-me-ti-mes I wish I re-mem-be-red." But it was a lie. He ne-ver wis-hed he
re-mem-be-red. He didn't li-ke re-mem-be-ring. Most stuff he co-uldn't re-mem-ber even if he wan-ted
to. The ear-li-est thing he co-uld bring to mind was ri-ding on the back of a hor-se, be-hind so-me man
who swe-ated a lot, just ri-ding and ri-ding and ri-ding. And then it was all re-cent stuff, go-ing to
scho-ol, get-ting pas-sed aro-und in pe-op-le's ho-mes, fi-nal-ly get-ting busy one ye-ar and fi-nis-hing
scho-ol and get-ting a job. He didn't get misty-eyed thin-king abo-ut any of it, any of tho-se pla-ces. Just
pas-sing thro-ugh, that's all he was ever do-ing, ne-ver be-lon-ged anyw-he-re un-til may-be now. He
be-lon-ged he-re. "I'm sorry," he sa-id.
"It's fi-ne," she sa-id.
"You still gon-na ta-ke me the-re?"
"I sa-id I wo-uld, didn't I?"
She so-un-ded just an-no-yed eno-ugh that he knew it was OK to te-ase her aga-in. "You don't think
they'll ha-ve the Se-cond Co-ming whi-le we're the-re, do you? If you think so, I'll we-ar my tie."
She smi-led, then tur-ned to fa-ce him and pus-hed him away. "De-aver, go to
bed."
"I'm get-tin up at fo-ur-thirty, Ra-in, and then you're one girl who's gon-na ha-ve fan."
"I don't think the song was abo-ut early mor-ning bo-at trips." She was do-ing the dis-hes when he left
for his lit-tle ro-om.
Lehi was wa-iting at fi-ve-thirty, right on sche-du-le. "I can't be-li-eve it," he sa-id. "I tho-ught you'd
be la-te."
"Good thing you we-re re-ady on ti-me," sa-id De-aver, "ca-use if you didn't co-me with us you
wo-uldn't get a cut."
"We aren't go-ing to find any gold, De-aver Te-ague."
"Then why're you co-min with me? Don't gi-ve me that stuff, Le-hi, you know the fu-tu-re's with
De-aver Te-ague, and you don't want to be left be-hind. Whe-re's the di-ving stuff?"
"I didn't bring it ho-me, De-aver. You don't think my mom'd ask qu-es-ti-ons then?"
"She's al-ways as-kin qu-es-ti-ons," sa-id De-aver. "It's her job," sa-id Ra-in.
"I don't want any-body as-kin abo-ut everyt-hing I do," sa-id De-aver.
"Nobody has to ask," sa-id Ra-in. "You al-ways tell us whet-her we want to he-ar or not."
"If you don't want to he-ar, you don't ha-ve to," sa-id De-aver. "Don't get to-uchy," sa-id Ra-in.
"You guys are both get-tin wet-he-aded on me, all of a sud-den. Do-es the temp-le ma-ke you crazy,
is that how it works?"
"I don't mind my mom as-kin me stuff. It's OK."
The fer-ri-es ran from Po-int to Bing-ham day and night, so they had to go north a ways be-fo-re
cut-ting west to Oqu-ir-rh Is-land. The smel-ter and the fo-und-ri-es put oran-ge-bel-li-ed smo-ke
clo-uds in-to the night sky, and the co-al bar-ges we-re get-ting of-flo-aded just li-ke in day-ti-me. The
co-al-dust clo-ud that was so grimy and black in the day lo-oked li-ke whi-te fog un-der the
flo-od-lights.
"My dad di-ed right the-re, abo-ut this ti-me of day," sa-id Le-hi.
"He lo-aded co-al?"
"Yeah. He used to be a car sa-les-men. His job kind of di-sap-pe-ared on him." "You we-ren't the-re,
we-re you?"
"I he-ard the crash. I was as-le-ep, but it wo-ke me up. And then a lot of sho-uting and run-ning. We
li-ved on the is-land back then, al-ways he-ard stuff from the har-bor. He got bu-ri-ed un-der a ton of
co-al that fell from fifty fe-et up."
Deaver didn't know what to say abo-ut that.
"You ne-ver talk abo-ut yo-ur folks," sa-id Le-hi. "I al-ways re-mem-ber my dad, but you ne-ver talk
abo-ut yo-ur folks." De-aver shrug-ged.
"He do-esn't re-mem-ber em," Ra-in sa-id qu-i-etly. "They fo-und him out on the pla-ins
so-mew-he-re. The mob-bers got his fa-mily, ho-we-ver many the-re was, he must've hid or

so-met-hing, that's all they can fi-gu-re."
"Well what was it?" as-ked Le-hi. "Did you hi-de?"
Deaver didn't fe-el com-for-tab-le tal-king abo-ut it, sin-ce he didn't re-mem-ber anyt-hing ex-cept
what pe-op-le told him. He knew that ot-her pe-op-le re-mem-be-red the-ir child-ho-od, and he didn't
li-ke how they al-ways ac-ted so surp-ri-sed that he didn't. But Le-hi was as-king, and De-aver knew
that you don't ke-ep stuff back from fri-ends. "I gu-ess I did. Or may-be I lo-oked too dumb to kill or
so-met-hin." He la-ug-hed. "I must've be-en a re-al dumb lit-tle kid, I didn't even re-mem-ber my own
na-me. They fi-gu-re I was fi-ve or six ye-ars old, most kids know the-ir na-mes, but not me. So the two
guys that fo-und me, the-ir na-mes we-re Te-ague and De-aver."
"You got-ta re-mem-ber so-met-hin."
"Lehi, I didn't even know how to talk. They tell me I didn't even say a word till I was ni-ne ye-ars old.
We're tal-kin abo-ut a slow le-ar-ner he-re."
"Wow." Le-hi was si-lent for a whi-le. "How co-me you didn't say anyt-hing?"
"Doesn't mat-ter," sa-id Ra-in. "He ma-kes up for it now, De-aver the tal-ker. Cham-pi-on tal-ker."
They co-as-ted the is-land till they got past Mag-na. Le-hi led them to a sto-ra-ge shed that
Un-der-wa-ter Sal-va-ge had put up at the north end of Oqu-ir-rh Is-land. It was un-loc-ked and full of
di-ving equ-ip-ment. Le-hi's fri-ends had fil-led so-me tanks with air. They got two di-ving out-fits and
un-der-wa-ter flash-lights. Ra-in wasn't go-ing un-der-wa-ter, so she didn't ne-ed anyt-hing.
They pul-led away from the is-land, out in-to the re-gu-lar ship-ping la-ne from Wen-do-ver. In that
di-rec-ti-on, at le-ast, pe-op-le had sen-se eno-ugh not to tra-vel at night, so the-re wasn't much traf-fic.
Af-ter a lit-tle whi-le they we-re out in-to open wa-ter. That was when Ra-in stop-ped the lit-tle
out-bo-ard mo-tor De-aver had scro-un-ged for her and Le-hi had fi-xed. "Ti-me to swe-at and sla-ve,"
sa-id Ra-in.
Deaver sat on the mid-dle bench, set-tled the oars in-to the locks, and be-gan to row.
"Not too fast," Ra-in sa-id. "You'll gi-ve yo-ur-self blis-ters."
A bo-at that might ha-ve be-en La-ke Pat-rol went by on-ce, but ot-her-wi-se no-body ca-me ne-ar
them as they cros-sed the open stretch. Then the skyscra-pers ro-se up and bloc-ked off lar-ge
sec-ti-ons of the starry night.
"They say the-re's pe-op-le who was ne-ver res-cu-ed still li-vin in the-re," Le-hi whis-pe-red.
Rain was dis-da-in-ful. "You think the-re's anyt-hing left in the-re to ke-ep any-body ali-ve? And the
wa-ter's still too salty to drink for long."
"Who says they're ali-ve?" whis-pe-red De-aver in his most myste-ri-o-us vo-ice. A co-up-le of
ye-ars ago, he co-uld ha-ve spo-oked Le-hi and ma-de his eyes go wi-de. Now Le-hi just lo-oked
dis-gus-ted.
"Come on, De-aver, I'm not a kid."
It was De-aver who got spo-oked a lit-tle. The big ho-les whe-re pi-eces of glass and plas-tic had
fal-len off lo-oked li-ke mo-uths, wa-iting to suck him in and carry him down un-der the wa-ter, in-to the
city of the drow-ned. He so-me-ti-mes dre-amed abo-ut tho-usands and tho-usands of pe-op-le li-ving
un-der wa-ter. Still dri-ving the-ir cars aro-und, go-ing abo-ut the-ir bu-si-ness, shop-ping in sto-res,
go-ing to mo-vi-es. In his dre-ams they ne-ver did anyt-hing bad, just went abo-ut the-ir bu-si-ness. But
he al-ways wo-ke up swe-ating and frigh-te-ned. No re-ason. Just spo-oked him. "I think they sho-uld
blow up the-se things be-fo-re they fall down and hurt so-me-body," sa-id De-aver.
"Maybe it's bet-ter to le-ave em stan-ding," sa-id Ra-in. "May-be the-re's a lot of folks li-ke to
re-mem-ber how tall we on-ce sto-od."
"What's to re-mem-ber? They bu-ilt tall bu-il-dings and then they let em ta-ke a bath, what's to brag
for?"
Deaver was trying to get her not to talk abo-ut the old days, but Le-hi se-emed to li-ke wal-lo-wing in
it. "You ever he-re be-fo-re the wa-ter ca-me?"
Rain nod-ded. "Saw a pa-ra-de go right down this stre-et. I can't re-mem-ber if it was Third So-uth
or Fo-urth So-uth. Third I gu-ess. I saw twenty-fi-ve hor-ses all ri-ding to-get-her. I re-mem-ber that I
tho-ught that was re-al-ly so-met-hing. You didn't see many hor-ses in tho-se days."

"I se-en too many myself," sa-id Le-hi.
"It's the ones I don't see that I ha-te," sa-id De-aver. "They ought to ma-ke em we-ar di-apers."
They ro-un-ded a bu-il-ding and lo-oked up a north-so-uth pas-sa-ge bet-we-en to-wers. Ra-in was
sit-ting in the stern and saw it first. "The-re it is. You can see it. Just the tall spi-res now."
Deaver ro-wed them up the pas-sa-ge. The-re we-re six spi-res stic-king up out of the wa-ter, but the
fo-ur short ones we-re un-der so far that only the po-in-ted ro-ofs we-re dry. The two tall ones had
win-dows in them, not co-ve-red at all. De-aver was di-sap-po-in-ted. Wi-de open li-ke that me-ant
that any-body might ha-ve co-me he-re. It was all so much less dan-ge-ro-us than he had ex-pec-ted.
May-be Ra-in was right, and the-re was not-hing the-re.
They ti-ed the bo-at to the north si-de and wa-ited for day-light. "If I knew it'd be so easy," sa-id
De-aver, "I co-uld've slept anot-her ho-ur."
"Sleep now," sa-id Ra-in.
"Maybe 1 will," sa-id De-aver.
He slid off his bench and spraw-led in the bot-tom of the bo-at.
He didn't sle-ep, tho-ugh. The open win-dow of the ste-ep-le was only a few yards away, a de-ep
black sur-ro-un-ded by the star-lit grey of the temp-le gra-ni-te. It was down the-re, wa-iting for him; the
fu-tu-re, a chan-ce to get so-met-hing bet-ter for him-self and his two fri-ends. May-be a plot of gro-und
in the so-uth whe-re it was war-mer and the snow didn't pi-le up fi-ve fe-et de-ep every win-ter, whe-re
it wasn't ra-in in the sky and la-ke everyw-he-re el-se you lo-oked. A pla-ce whe-re he co-uld li-ve for a
very long ti-me and lo-ok back and re-mem-ber go-od ti-mes with his fri-ends, that was all wa-iting
down un-der the wa-ter.
Of co-ur-se they hadn't told him abo-ut the gold. It was on the ro-ad, a lit-tle pla-ce in Pa-ro-wan
whe-re truc-kers knew they co-uld stop in be-ca-use the iron mi-ne kept such crazy shifts that the
di-ners ne-ver clo-sed. They even had so-me cof-fee the-re, hot and bit-ter, be-ca-use the-re we-ren't
so many Mor-mons the-re and the mi-ners didn't let the Bis-hop push them aro-und. In fact they even
cal-led him Jud-ge the-re ins-te-ad of Bis-hop. The ot-her dri-vers didn't talk to De-aver, of co-ur-se,
they we-re tal-king to each ot-her when the one fel-low told the story abo-ut how the Mor-mons back in
the gold rush days ho-ar-ded up all the gold they co-uld get and hid it in the up-per ro-oms of the
temp-le whe-re no-body but the prop-het and the twel-ve apost-les co-uld ever go. At first De-aver
didn't be-li-eve him, ex-cept that Bill Ho-me nod-ded li-ke he knew it was true, and Cal Sil-ber sa-id
you'd ne-ver catch him mes-sin with the Mor-mon temp-le, that's a go-od way to get yo-ur-self de-ad.
The way they we-re tal-king, sca-red and qu-i-et, told De-aver that they be-li-eved it, that it was true,
and he knew so-met-hing el-se, too: if an-yo-ne was go-ing to get that gold, it was him.
Even if it was easy to get he-re, that didn't me-an anyt-hing. He knew how Mor-mons we-re abo-ut
the temp-le. He'd as-ked aro-und a lit-tle, but no-body'd talk abo-ut it. And no-body ever went the-re,
eit-her, he as-ked a lot of pe-op-le if they ever sa-iled on out and lo-oked at it, and they all got qu-i-et
and sho-ok the-ir he-ads no or chan-ged the su-bj-ect. Why sho-uld the La-ke Pat-rol gu-ard it, then, if
every-body was too sca-red to go? Every-body but De-aver Te-ague and his two fri-ends.
"Real pretty," sa-id Ra-in.
Deaver wo-ke up. The sun was just top-ping the mo-un-ta-ins; it must've be-en light for so-me ti-me.
He lo-oked whe-re Ra-in was lo-oking. It was the Mo-ro-ni to-wer on top of the mo-un-ta-in abo-ve
the old ca-pi-tol, whe-re they'd put the temp-le sta-tue a few ye-ars back. It was bright and shiny, the
old guy and his trum-pet. But when the Mor-mons wan-ted that trum-pet to blow, it had just sta-yed
si-lent and the-ir fa-ith got drow-ned. Now De-aver knew they only hung on to it for old ti-mes' sa-ke.
Well, De-aver li-ved for new ti-mes.
Lehi sho-wed him how to use the un-der-wa-ter ge-ar, and they prac-ti-ced go-ing over the si-de
in-to the wa-ter a co-up-le of ti-mes, on-ce wit-ho-ut the we-ight belts and on-ce with. De-aver and
Le-hi swam li-ke fish, of co-ur-se-swim-ming was the ma-in rec-re-ati-on that every-body co-uld do for
free. It was dif-fe-rent with the mask and the air ho-se, tho-ugh.
"Hose tas-tes li-ke a hor-se's ho-of," De-aver sa-id bet-we-en di-ves.
Lehi ma-de su-re De-aver's we-ight belt was on tight. "You're the only guy on Oqu-ir-rh Is-land who

knows." Then he tumb-led for-ward off the bo-at. De-aver went down too stra-ight and the air tank
bum-ped the back of his he-ad a lit-tle, but it didn't hurt too much and he didn't drop his light, eit-her.
He swam along the out-si-de of the temp-le, shi-ning his light on the sto-nes. Lots of un-der-wa-ter
plants we-re ri-sing up the si-des of the temp-le, but it wasn't co-ve-red much yet. The-re was a big
me-tal pla-que right in the front of the bu-il-ding, abo-ut a third of the way down. THE HO-USE OF
THE LORD it sa-id. De-aver po-in-ted it out to Le-hi.
When they got up to the bo-at aga-in, De-aver as-ked abo-ut it. "It lo-oked kind of gol-dish," he
sa-id.
"Used to be anot-her sign the-re," sa-id Ra-in. "It was a lit-tle dif-fe-rent. That one might ha-ve be-en
gold. This one's plas-tic. They ma-de it so the temp-le wo-uld still ha-ve a sign, I gu-ess."
"You su-re abo-ut that?"
"I re-mem-ber when they did it."
Finally De-aver felt con-fi-dent eno-ugh to go down in-to the temp-le. They had to ta-ke off the-ir
flip-pers to climb in-to the ste-ep-le win-dow; Ra-in tos-sed them up af-ter. In the sun-light the-re was
not-hing spo-oking abo-ut the win-dow. They sat the-re on the sill, wa-ter lap-ping at the-ir fe-et, and
put the-ir fins and tanks on.
Halfway thro-ugh get-ting dres-sed, Le-hi stop-ped. Just sat the-re.
"I can't do it," he sa-id.
"Nothin to be sca-red of," sa-id De-aver. "Co-me on, the-re's no ghosts or not-hin down the-re."
"I can't," sa-id Le-hi.
"Good for you," cal-led Ra-in from the bo-at.
Deaver tur-ned to lo-ok at her. "What're you tal-kin abo-ut!"
"I don't think you sho-uld."
"Then why'd you bring me he-re?"
"Because you wan-ted to."
Made no sen-se.
"It's holy gro-und, De-aver," sa-id Ra-in. "Le-hi fe-els it, too. That's why he isn't go-ing down."
Deaver lo-oked at Le-hi.
"It just don't fe-el right," sa-id Le-hi.
"It's just sto-nes," sa-id De-aver.
Lehi sa-id not-hing. De-aver put on his gog-gles, to-ok a light, put the bre-at-her in his mo-uth, and
jum-ped.
Turned out the flo-or was only a fo-ot and a half down. It to-ok him comp-le-tely by surp-ri-se, so he
fell over and sat on his butt in eigh-te-en inc-hes of wa-ter. Le-hi was just as surp-ri-sed as he was, but
then he star-ted la-ug-hing, and De-aver la-ug-hed, too. De-aver got to his fe-et and star-ted flap-ping
aro-und, lo-oking for the sta-ir-way. He co-uld hardly ta-ke a step, his flip-pers slo-wed him down so
much.
"Walk back-ward," sa-id Le-hi.
"Then how am 1 sup-po-sed to see whe-re I'm go-ing?"
"Stick yo-ur fa-ce un-der the wa-ter and lo-ok, chig-ger-he-ad."
Deaver stuck his fa-ce in the wa-ter. Wit-ho-ut the ref-lec-ti-on of day-light on the sur-fa-ce, he
co-uld see fi-ne. The-re was the sta-ir-way.
He got up, lo-oked to-ward Le-hi. Le-hi sho-ok his he-ad. He still wasn't go-ing.
"Suit yo-ur-self," sa-id De-aver. He bac-ked thro-ugh the wa-ter to the top step. Then he put in his
bre-at-hing tu-be and went down.
It wasn't easy to get down the sta-irs. They're fi-ne when you aren't flo-ating, tho-ught De-aver, but
they're a pa-in when you ke-ep scra-ping yo-ur tanks on the ce-iling. Fi-nal-ly he fi-gu-red out he co-uld
grab the ra-iling and pull him-self down. The sta-irs wo-und aro-und and aro-und. When they en-ded, a
who-le bunch of gar-ba-ge had fil-led up the bot-tom of the sta-ir-well, partly bloc-king the do-or-way.
He swam abo-ve the gar-ba-ge, which lo-oked li-ke scrap me-tal and chips of wo-od, and ca-me out
in-to a lar-ge ro-om.

His light didn't shi-ne very far thro-ugh the murky wa-ter, so he swam the walls, aro-und and aro-und,
high and low. Down he-re the wa-ter was cold, and he swam fas-ter to ke-ep warm. The-re we-re rows
of arc-hed win-dows on both si-des, with rows of cir-cu-lar win-dows abo-ve them, but they had be-en
co-ve-red over with wo-od on the out-si-de; the only light was from De-aver's flash-light. Fi-nal-ly,
tho-ugh, af-ter a co-up-le of ti-mes aro-und the ro-om and ac-ross the ce-iling, he fi-gu-red it was just
one big ro-om. And ex-cept for the gar-ba-ge all over the flo-or, it was empty.
Already he felt the de-ep pa-in of di-sap-po-int-ment. He for-ced him-self to ig-no-re it. Af-ter all, it
wo-uldn't be right out he-re in a big ro-om li-ke this, wo-uld it? The-re had to be a sec-ret tre-asury.
There we-re a co-up-le of do-ors. The small one in the mid-dle of the wall at one end was wi-de
open. On-ce the-re must ha-ve be-en sta-irs le-ading up to it. De-aver swam over the-re and sho-ne his
light in. Just anot-her ro-om, smal-ler this ti-me. He fo-und a co-up-le mo-re ro-oms, but they had all
be-en strip-ped, right down to the sto-ne. Not-hing at all.
He tri-ed exa-mi-ning so-me of the sto-nes to lo-ok for sec-ret do-ors, but he ga-ve up pretty
so-on-he co-uldn't see well eno-ugh from the flash-light to find a thin crack even if it was the-re. Now the
di-sap-po-int-ment was re-al. As he swam along, he be-gan to won-der if may-be the truc-kers hadn't
known he was lis-te-ning. May-be they ma-de it all up just so so-me-day he'd do this. So-me joke,
whe-re they wo-uldn't even see him ma-ke a fo-ol of him-self.
But no, no, that co-uldn't be it. They be-li-eved it, all right. But he knew now what they didn't know.
Wha-te-ver the Mor-mons did he-re in the old days, the-re wasn't any gold in the up-per ro-oms now.
So much for the fu-tu-re. But what the hell, he told him-self, I got he-re, I saw it, and I'll find so-met-hing
el-se. No re-ason not to be che-er-ful abo-ut it.
He didn't fo-ol him-self, and the-re was no-body el-se down he-re to fo-ol. It was bit-ter. He'd spent
a lot of ye-ars thin-king abo-ut bars of gold or bags of it. He'd al-ways pic-tu-red it hid-den be-hind a
cur-ta-in. He'd pull on the cur-ta-in and it wo-uld bil-low out in the wa-ter, and he-re wo-uld be the bags
of gold, and he'd just ta-ke them out and that wo-uld be it. But the-re we-ren't any cur-ta-ins, we-ren't
any hi-dey ho-les, the-re was not-hing at all, and if he had a fu-tu-re, he'd ha-ve to find it so-mew-he-re
el-se.
He swam back to the do-or le-ading to the sta-ir-way. Now he co-uld see the pi-le of gar-ba-ge
bet-ter, and it oc-cur-red to him to won-der how it got the-re. Every ot-her ro-om was comp-le-tely
empty. The gar-ba-ge co-uldn't ha-ve be-en car-ri-ed in by the wa-ter, be-ca-use the only win-dows
that we-re open we-re in the ste-ep-le, and they we-re abo-ve the wa-ter li-ne. He swam clo-se and
pic-ked up a pi-ece. It was me-tal. They we-re all me-tal, ex-cept a few sto-nes, and it oc-cur-red to
him that this might be it af-ter all. If you're hi-ding a tre-asu-re, you don't put it in bags or in-gots, you
le-ave it aro-und lo-oking li-ke gar-ba-ge and pe-op-le le-ave it alo-ne.
He gat-he-red up as many of the thin me-tal pi-eces as he co-uld carry in one hand and swam
ca-re-ful-ly up the sta-ir-well. Le-hi wo-uld ha-ve to co-me down now and help him carry it up; they
co-uld ma-ke bags out of the-ir shirts to carry lots of it at a ti-me.
He splas-hed out in-to the air and then wal-ked back-ward up the last few steps and ac-ross the
sub-mer-ged flo-or. Le-hi was still sit-ting on the sill, and now Ra-in was the-re be-si-de him, her ba-re
fe-et dang-ling in the wa-ter. When he got the-re he tur-ned aro-und and held out the me-tal in his hands.
He co-uldn't see the-ir fa-ces well, be-ca-use the out-si-de of the fa-ce-mask was blurry with wa-ter and
kept catc-hing sun-light.
"You scra-ped yo-ur knee," sa-id Ra-in.
Deaver han-ded her his flash-light and now that his hand was free, he co-uld pull his mask off and
lo-ok at them. They we-re very se-ri-o-us. He held out the me-tal pi-eces to-ward them. "Lo-ok what I
fo-und down the-re."
Lehi to-ok a co-up-le of me-tal pi-eces from him. Ra-in ne-ver to-ok her eyes from De-aver's fa-ce.
"It's old cans, De-aver," Le-hi sa-id qu-i-etly.
"No it isn't," sa-id De-aver. But he lo-oked at his fist-ful of me-tal she-ets and re-ali-zed it was true.
They had be-en cut down the si-de and pres-sed flat, but they we-re su-re eno-ugh cans.
"There's wri-ting on it," sa-id Le-hi. "It says, De-ar Lord he-al my girl Jen-ny ple-ase I pray."

Deaver set down his hand-ful on the sill. Then he to-ok one, tur-ned it over, fo-und the wri-ting.
"For-gi-ve my adul-tery I will sin no mo-re."
Lehi re-ad anot-her. "Bring my boy sa-fe from the pla-ins O Lord God."
Each mes-sa-ge was scratc-hed with a na-il or a pi-ece of glass, the let-ters cru-dely for-med.
"They used to say pra-yers all day in the temp-le, and pe-op-le wo-uld bring in na-mes and they'd say
the temp-le pra-yers for them," sa-id Ra-in. "No-body prays he-re now, but they still bring the na-mes.
On me-tal so they'll last."
"We sho-uldn't re-ad the-se," sa-id Le-hi. "We sho-uld put them back."
There we-re hund-reds, may-be tho-usand of tho-se me-tal pra-yers down the-re. Pe-op-le must
co-me he-re all the ti-me, De-aver re-ali-zed. The Mor-mons must ha-ve a re-gu-lar traf-fic co-ming
he-re and le-aving the-se things be-hind. But no-body told me.
"Did you know abo-ut this?"
Rain nod-ded.
"You bro-ught them he-re, didn't you." "So-me of them. Over the ye-ars." "You knew what was down
the-re." She didn't ans-wer.
"She told you not to co-me," sa-id Le-hi. "You knew abo-ut this too?"
"I knew pe-op-le ca-me, I didn't know what they did."
And sud-denly the mag-ni-tu-de of it struck him. Le-hi and Ra-in had both known. All the Mor-mons
knew, then. They all knew, and he had as-ked aga-in and aga-in, and no one had told him. Not even his
fri-ends.
"Why'd you let me co-me out he-re?"
"Tried to stop you," sa-id Ra-in.
"Why didn't you tell me this?"
She lo-oked him in the eye. "De-aver, you wo-uld've tho-ught I was gi-vin you the run aro-und. And
you wo-uld ha-ve la-ug-hed at this, if I told you. I tho-ught it was bet-ter if you saw it. Then may-be you
wo-uldn't go tel-lin pe-op-le how dumb the Mor-mons are."
"You think I wo-uld?" He held up anot-her me-tal pra-yer and re-ad it alo-ud. "Co-me qu-ickly, Lord
Jesus, be-fo-re I die." He sho-ok it at her. "You think I'd la-ugh at the-se pe-op-le?"
"You la-ugh at everyt-hing, De-aver."
Deaver lo-oked at Le-hi. This was so-met-hing Le-hi had ne-ver sa-id be-fo-re. De-aver wo-uld
ne-ver la-ugh at so-met-hing that was re-al-ly im-por-tant. And this was re-al-ly im-por-tant to them, to
them both.
"This is yo-urs," De-aver sa-id. "All this stuff is yo-urs."
"I ne-ver left a pra-yer he-re," sa-id Le-hi.
But when he sa-id yo-urs he didn't me-an just them, just Le-hi and Ra-in. He me-ant all of them, all
the pe-op-le of the Mor-mon Sea, all the ones who had known abo-ut it but ne-ver told him even
tho-ugh he as-ked aga-in and aga-in. All the pe-op-le who be-lon-ged he-re. "I ca-me to find
so-met-hing he-re for me, and you knew all the ti-me it was only yo-ur stuff down the-re."
Lehi and Ra-in lo-oked at each ot-her, then back at De-aver.
"It isn't ours," sa-id Ra-in.
"I ne-ver be-en he-re be-fo-re," sa-id Le-hi.
"It's yo-ur stuff." He sat down in the wa-ter and be-gan ta-king off the un-der-wa-ter ge-ar.
"Don't be mad," sa-id Le-hi. "I didn't know."
You knew mo-re than you told me. All the ti-me I tho-ught we we-re fri-ends, but it wasn't true. You
two had this pla-ce in com-mon with all the ot-her pe-op-le, but not with me. Every-body but me.
Lehi ca-re-ful-ly to-ok the me-tal she-ets to the sta-ir-way and drop-ped them. They sank on-ce, to
drift down and ta-ke the-ir pla-ce on the pi-le of sup-pli-ca-ti-ons.
Lehi ro-wed them thro-ugh the skyscra-pers to the east of the old city, and then Ra-in star-ted the
mo-tor and they skim-med along the sur-fa-ce of the la-ke. The La-ke Pat-rol didn't see them, but
De-aver knew now that it didn't mat-ter much if they did. The La-ke Pat-rol was mostly Mor-mons.
They un-do-ub-tedly knew abo-ut the traf-fic he-re, and let it hap-pen as long as it was disc-re-et.

Pro-bably the only pe-op-le they stop-ped we-re the pe-op-le who we-ren't in on it.
All the way back to Mag-na to re-turn the un-der-wa-ter ge-ar, De-aver sat in the front of the bo-at,
not tal-king to the ot-hers. Whe-re De-aver sat, the bow of the bo-at se-emed to cur-ve un-der him. The
fas-ter they went, the less the bo-at se-emed to to-uch the wa-ter. Just skim-ming over the sur-fa-ce,
ne-ver re-al-ly to-uc-hing de-ep; ma-king a few wa-ves, but the wa-ter al-ways smo-ot-hed out aga-in.
Those two pe-op-le in the back of the bo-at, he felt kind of sorry for them. They still li-ved in the
drow-ned city, they be-lon-ged down the-re, and the fact they co-uldn't go the-re bro-ke the-ir he-arts.
But not De-aver. His city wasn't even bu-ilt yet. His city was to-mor-row.
He'd dri-ven a sal-va-ge truck and li-ved in a clo-set long eno-ugh. May-be he'd go so-uth in-to the
New So-il Lands. May-be qu-alify on a pi-ece of land. Own so-met-hing, plant in the so-il, may-be he'd
co-me to be-long the-re. As for this pla-ce, well, he ne-ver had be-lon-ged he-re, just li-ke all the fos-ter
ho-mes and scho-ols along the way, just one mo-re stop for a ye-ar or two or three, he knew that all
along. Ne-ver did ma-ke any fri-ends he-re, but that's how he wan-ted it. Wo-uldn't be right to ma-ke
fri-ends, ca-use he'd just mo-ve on and di-sap-po-int them. Didn't see no go-od in do-ing that to
pe-op-le.

III - PAOLO BACIGALUPI - THE PEOPLE OF SAND AND SLAG
"Hostile mo-ve-ment! Well in-si-de the pe-ri-me-ter! Well in-si-de!"
I strip-ped off my Im-mer-si-ve Res-pon-se gog-gles as ad-re-na-li-ne sur-ged thro-ugh me. The
vir-tu-al citys-ca-pe I'd be-en abo-ut to ra-ze di-sap-pe-ared, rep-la-ced by our mo-ni-to-ring ro-om's
many vi-ews of Ses-Co's mi-ning ope-ra-ti-ons. On one scre-en, the red phosp-ho-res-cent tra-cery of
an int-ru-der ska-ted ac-ross a ter-ra-in map, a hot blip li-ke blo-od spat-te-ring its way to-ward Pit 8.
Jaak was al-re-ady out of the mo-ni-to-ring ro-om. I ran for my ge-ar.
I ca-ught up with Ja-ak in the equ-ip-ment ro-om as he grab-bed a TS-101 and slash bangs and
drag-ged his im-pact exos-ke-le-ton over his tat-to-o-ed body. He dra-ped ban-do-le-ers of
sur-ge-packs over his mas-si-ve sho-ul-ders and ran for the outer locks. I strap-ped on my own
exos-ke-le-ton, pul-led my 101 from its rack, chec-ked its char-ge, and fol-lo-wed.
Lisa was al-re-ady in the HEV, its tur-bo-fans scre-aming li-ke bans-he-es when the hatch di-la-ted.
Sentry cen-ta-urs le-ve-led the-ir 101's at me, then re-la-xed as fri-end/foe da-ta spil-led in-to the-ir
he-ads-up disp-lays. I bol-ted ac-ross the tar-mac, my skin pric-king un-der blasts of icy Mon-ta-na
wind and the jet wash of Hen-ta-sa Mark V en-gi-nes. Over-he-ad, the clo-uds glo-wed oran-ge with
light from Ses-Co's mi-ning bots.
"Come on, Chen! Mo-ve! Mo-ve! Mo-ve!"
I do-ve in-to the hun-ter. The ship le-aped in-to the sky. It ban-ked, thro-wing me aga-inst a
bulk-he-ad, then the Hen-ta-sas cycled wi-de and the hun-ter punc-hed for-ward. The HEV's hatch slid
shut. The wind howl mu-ted.
I strug-gled for-ward to the flight co-co-on and pe-ered over Ja-ak's and Li-sa's sho-ul-ders to the
lands-ca-pe be-yond.
"Have a go-od ga-me?" Li-sa as-ked.
I scow-led. "I was abo-ut to win. I ma-de it to Pa-ris."
We cut thro-ugh the mists over the catch-ment la-kes, skim-ming inc-hes abo-ve the wa-ter, and then
we hit the far sho-re. The hun-ter lurc-hed as its an-ti-col-li-si-on soft-wa-re jer-ked us away from the
ro-ug-he-ning ter-ra-in. Li-sa over-ro-de the com-pu-ters and for-ced the ship back down aga-inst the
so-il, dri-ving us so low I co-uld ha-ve re-ac-hed out and drag-ged my hands thro-ugh the bro-ken scree
as we scre-amed over it.
Alarms yow-led. Ja-ak shut them off as Li-sa pus-hed the hun-ter lo-wer. Ahe-ad, a ta-ilings rid-ge
lo-omed. We rip-ped up its fa-ce and drop-ped sic-ke-ningly in-to the next val-ley. The Hen-ta-sas
shud-de-red as Li-sa for-ced them to the ed-ge of the-ir de-sign buf-fer. We hurt-led up and over
anot-her rid-ge. Ahe-ad, the rag-ged cuts-ca-pe of mi-ned mo-un-ta-ins stretc-hed to the ho-ri-zon. We

dip-ped aga-in in-to mist and skim-med low over anot-her catch-ment la-ke, le-aving choppy wa-ke in
the thick gol-den wa-ters.
Jaak stu-di-ed the hun-ter's scan-ners. "I've got it." He grin-ned. "It's mo-ving, but slow."
"Contact in one mi-nu-te," Li-sa sa-id. "He hasn't la-unc-hed any co-un-ter-me-asu-res."
I watc-hed the int-ru-der on the trac-king scre-ens as they disp-la-yed re-al-ti-me da-ta fed to us
from Ses-Co's sa-tel-li-tes. "It's not even a mas-ked tar-get. We co-uld ha-ve drop-ped a mi-ni on it
from ba-se if we'd known he wasn't go-ing to play hi-de-and-se-ek."
"Could ha-ve fi-nis-hed yo-ur ga-me," Li-sa sa-id.
"We co-uld still nu-ke him," Ja-ak sug-ges-ted.
I sho-ok my he-ad. "No, let's ta-ke a lo-ok. Va-po-ri-zing him won't le-ave us anyt-hing and
Bun-ba-um will want to know what we used the hun-ter for." "Thirty se-conds."
"He wo-uldn't ca-re, if so-me-one hadn't ta-ken the hun-ter on a joy-ri-de to Can-cun.
Lisa shrug-ged. "I wan-ted to swim. It was eit-her that, or rip off yo-ur kne-ecaps." The hun-ter
lun-ged over anot-her se-ri-es of rid-ges.
Jaak stu-di-ed his mo-ni-tor. "Tar-get's mo-ving away. He's still slow. We'll get him." "Fif-te-en
se-conds to drop," Li-sa sa-id. She unst-rap-ped and switc-hed the hun-ter to soft-wa-re. We all ran for
the hatch as the HEV yan-ked it-self skyward, its auto pi-lot des-pe-ra-te to te-ar away from the
scre-aming ha-zard of the rocks be-ne-ath its belly
We plun-ged out the hatch, one, two, three, fal-ling li-ke Ica-rus. We slam-med in-to the gro-und at
hund-reds of ki-lo-met-res per ho-ur. Our exos-ke-le-tons shat-te-red li-ke glass, flin-ging le-aves in-to
the sky. The shards flut-te-red down aro-und us, black me-tal-lic pe-tals ab-sor-bing our enemy's ra-dar
and he-at de-tec-ti-on whi-le we rol-led to jar-red vul-ne-rab-le stops in muddy scree.
The hun-ter blew over the rid-ge, Hen-ta-sas shri-eking, a bla-zing tar-get. I drag-ged myself up-right
and ran for the rid-ge, my fe-et chur-ning thro-ugh yel-low ta-ilings mud and rags of ja-un-di-ced snow.
Be-hind me, Ja-ak was down with smas-hed arms. The le-aves of his exos-ke-le-ton mar-ked his roll
path, a long tra-il of black shim-me-ring me-tal. Li-sa lay a hund-red yards away, her fe-mur ram-med
thro-ugh her thigh li-ke a bright whi-te exc-la-ma-ti-on mark.
I re-ac-hed the top of the rid-ge and sta-red down in-to the val-ley.
Nothing.
I di-aled up the mag-ni-fi-ca-ti-on of my hel-met. The mo-no-to-no-us slo-pes of mo-re ta-ilings
rub-ble spre-ad out be-low me. Bo-ul-ders, so-me as lar-ge as our HEV, so-me crac-ked and
shat-te-red by high exp-lo-si-ves, sha-red the slo-pes with the uns-tab-le yel-low sha-le and fi-ne grit of
was-te ma-te-ri-als from Ses-Co's ope-ra-ti-ons.
Jaak slip-ped up be-si-de me, fol-lo-wed a mo-ment la-ter by Li-sa, her flight su-it's leg torn and
blo-odi-ed. She wi-ped yel-low mud off her fa-ce and ate it as she stu-di-ed the val-ley be-low.
"Anything?"
I sho-ok my he-ad. "Not-hing yet. You okay?"
"Clean bre-ak."
Jaak po-in-ted. "The-re!"
Down in the val-ley, so-met-hing was run-ning, flus-hed by the hun-ter. It slip-ped along a shal-low
cre-ek, vis-co-us with ta-ilings acid. The ship her-ded it to-ward us. Not-hing. No mis-si-le fi-re. No
slag. Just the run-ning cre-atu-re. A mass of tang-led ha-ir. Qu-ad-ru-pe-dal. Splat-te-red with mud.
"Some kind of bio-job?" I won-de-red.
"It do-esn't ha-ve any hands," Li-sa mur-mu-red.
"No equ-ip-ment eit-her."
Jaak mut-te-red. "What kind of sick bas-tard ma-kes a bio-job wit-ho-ut hands?" I se-arc-hed the
ne-arby rid-ge-li-nes. "De-coy, may-be?"
Jaak chec-ked his scan-ner da-ta, pi-ped in from the hun-ter's mo-re ag-gres-si-ve inst-ru-ments. "I
don't think so. Can we put the hun-ter up hig-her? I want to lo-ok aro-und."
At Li-sa's com-mand, the hun-ter ro-se, al-lo-wing its sen-sors a ful-ler re-ach. The howl of its
tur-bo-fans be-ca-me mu-ted as it ga-ined al-ti-tu-de.

Jaak wa-ited as mo-re da-ta spat in-to his he-ads-up disp-lay. "No-pe, not-hing. And no new alerts
from any of the pe-ri-me-ter sta-ti-ons, eit-her. We're alo-ne."
Lisa sho-ok her he-ad. "We sho-uld ha-ve just drop-ped a mi-ni on it from ba-se."
Down in the val-ley, the bio-job's he-ad-long run slo-wed to a trot. It se-emed una-wa-re of us.
Clo-ser now, we co-uld ma-ke out its sha-pe: A shaggy qu-ad-ru-ped with a ta-il. 1 de-ad-loc-ked ha-ir
dang-led from its shanks li-ke or-na-ments, tag-ged with ta-ilings mud clods. It was sta-ined aro-und its
legs from the acids of the catch-ment ponds, as tho-ugh it had for-ded stre-ams of uri-ne. "That's one
ugly bio-job," I sa-id.
Lisa sho-ul-de-red her 101. "Bio-melt when I'm do-ne with it."
"Wait!" Ja-ak sa-id. "Don't slag it!"
Lisa glan-ced over at him, ir-ri-ta-ted. "What now?"
"That's not a bio-job at all." Ja-ak whis-pe-red. "That's a dog."
He sto-od sud-denly and jum-ped over the hil-lsi-de, run-ning he-ad-long down the scree to-ward the
ani-mal.
"Wait!" Li-sa cal-led, but Ja-ak was al-re-ady fully ex-po-sed and blur-ring to his top spe-ed.
The ani-mal to-ok one lo-ok at Ja-ak, who-oping and hol-le-ring as he ca-me ro-aring down the
slo-pe, then tur-ned and ran. It was no match for Ja-ak. Half a mi-nu-te la-ter he over-to-ok the ani-mal.
Lisa and I exc-han-ged glan-ces. "Well," she sa-id, "it's aw-ful-ly slow if it's a bio-job. I've se-en
cen-ta-urs walk fas-ter."
By the ti-me we ca-ught up with Ja-ak and the ani-mal, Ja-ak had it cor-ne-red in a dull gully. The
ani-mal sto-od in the cen-ter of a trick-ling ditch of sludgy wa-ter, sha-king and grow-ling and ba-ring its
te-eth at us as we sur-ro-un-ded it. It tri-ed to bre-ak aro-und us, but Ja-ak kept it cor-ral-led easily.
Up clo-se, the ani-mal se-emed even mo-re pat-he-tic than from a dis-tan-ce, a go-od thirty ki-los of
snar-ling man-ge. Its paws we-re slas-hed and blo-ody and patc-hes of fur we-re torn away, re-ve-aling
fes-te-ring che-mi-cal burns un-der-ne-ath.
"I'll be dam-ned," I bre-at-hed, sta-ring at the ani-mal. "It re-al-ly lo-oks li-ke a dog."
Jaak grin-ned. "It's li-ke fin-ding a god-damn di-no-sa-ur."
"How co-uld it li-ve out he-re?" Li-sa's arm swept the ho-ri-zon. "The-re's not-hing to li-ve on. It's got
to be mo-di-fi-ed." She stu-di-ed it clo-sely, then glan-ced at Ja-ak. "Are you su-re not-hing's co-ming in
on the pe-ri-me-ter? This isn't so-me kind of de-coy?"
Jaak sho-ok his he-ad. "Not-hing. Not even a pe-ep."
I le-aned in to-ward the cre-atu-re. It ba-red its te-eth in a ric-tus of hat-red. "It's pretty be-at up.
May-be it's the re-al thing."
Jaak sa-id, "Oh ye-ah, it's the re-al thing all right. I saw a dog in a zoo on-ce. I'm tel-ling you, this is a
dog."
Lisa sho-ok her he-ad. "It can't be. It wo-uld be de-ad, if it we-re a re-al dog."
Jaak just grin-ned and sho-ok his he-ad. "No way. Lo-ok at it." He re-ac-hed out to push the ha-ir
out of the ani-mal's fa-ce so that we co-uld see its muz-zle.
The ani-mal lun-ged and its te-eth sank in-to Ja-ak's arm. It sho-ok his arm vi-olently, grow-ling as
Ja-ak sta-red down at the cre-atu-re latc-hed on-to his flesh. It yan-ked its he-ad back and forth, trying
to te-ar Ja-ak's arm off. Blo-od spur-ted aro-und its muz-zle as its te-eth fo-und Ja-ak's ar-te-ri-es.
Jaak la-ug-hed. His ble-eding stop-ped. "Damn. Check that out." He lif-ted his arm un-til the ani-mal
dang-led fully out of the stre-am, drip-ping. "I got me a pet."
The dog swung from the thick bo-ugh of Ja-ak's arm. It tri-ed to sha-ke his arm tAtnp aanin. hut its
mo-ve-ments we-re inef-fec-tu-al now that it hung off the gro-und.
Even Li-sa smi-led.
"Must be a bum-mer to wa-ke up and find out you're at the end of yo-ur evo-lu-ti-onary cur-ve."
The dog grow-led, de-ter-mi-ned to hang on.
Jaak la-ug-hed and drew his mo-no-mol kni-fe. "He-re you go, doggy." He sli-ced his arm off,
le-aving it in the be-wil-de-red ani-mal's mo-uth.
Lisa coc-ked her he-ad. "You think we co-uld ma-ke so-me kind of mo-ney on it?"

Jaak watc-hed as the dog de-vo-ured his se-ve-red arm. "I re-ad so-mew-he-re that they used to eat
dogs. I won-der what they tas-te li-ke."
I chec-ked the ti-me in my he-ads-up disp-lay. We'd al-re-ady kil-led an ho-ur on an exer-ci-se that
wasn't gi-ving any bo-nu-ses. "Get yo-ur dog, Ja-ak, and get it on the hun-ter. We aren't go-ing to eat it
be-fo-re we call Bun-ba-um."
"He'll pro-bably call it com-pany pro-perty," Ja-ak gro-used.
"Yeah, that's the way it al-ways go-es. But we still ha-ve to re-port. Might as well ke-ep the
evi-den-ce, sin-ce we didn't nu-ke it."
We ate sand for din-ner. Out-si-de the se-cu-rity bun-ker, the mi-ning ro-bots rumb-led back and
forth, rip-ping de-eper in-to the earth, tur-ning it in-to a mush of ta-ilings and rock acid that they left in
ex-po-sed ponds when they hit the wa-ter tab-le, or pi-led in-to tho-usand fo-ot mo-un-ta-in sca-pes of
was-te so-il. It was com-for-ting to he-ar tho-se mac-hi-nes cru-ising back and forth all day. Just you
and the bots and the pro-fits, and if not-hing got bom-bed whi-le you we-re on duty, the-re was al-ways
a ni-ce bo-nus.
After din-ner we sat aro-und and shar-pe-ned Li-sa's skin, imp-lan-ting bla-des along her limbs so
that she was li-ke a ra-zor from all di-rec-ti-ons. She'd con-si-de-red mo-no-mol bla-des, but it was too
easy to ta-ke a limb off ac-ci-den-tal-ly, and we lost eno-ugh body parts as it was wit-ho-ut ad-ding to
the may-hem. That kind of gar-ba-ge was for pe-op-le who didn't ha-ve to work: aest-he-tes from New
York City and Ca-li-for-nia.
Lisa had a Derm-De-co-ra kit for the shar-pe-ning. She'd bo-ught it last ti-me we'd go-ne on
va-ca-ti-on and spent ext-ra to get it, ins-te-ad of get-ting one of the che-ap knock-offs that we-re
crop-ping up. We wor-ked on cut-ting her skin down to the bo-ne and set-ting the bla-des. A fri-end of
ours in L.A sa-id that he just held Derm-De-co-ra par-ti-es so ever-yo-ne co-uld do the-ir
mo-di-fi-ca-ti-ons and help out with the hard-to-re-ach pla-ces.
Lisa had do-ne my glows-pi-ne, a swe-et tra-cery of li-me lan-ding lights that ran from my ta-il-bo-ne
to the ba-se of my skull, so I didn't mind hel-ping her out, but Ja-ak, who did all of his mo-di-fi-ca-ti-on
with an old-ti-me scar and tat-too shop in Ha-wa-ii, wasn't so ple-ased. It was a lit-tle frust-ra-ting
be-ca-use her flesh kept trying to clo-se be-fo-re we had the bla-des set, but even-tu-al-ly we got the
hang of it, and an ho-ur la-ter, she star-ted lo-oking go-od.
Once we fi-nis-hed with Li-sa's front set-tings, we sat aro-und and fed her. I had a bowl of ta-ilings
mud that I driz-zled in-to her mo-uth to spe-ed her in-teg-ra-ti-on pro-cess. When we we-ren't fe-eding
her, we watc-hed the dog. Ja-ak had sho-ved it in-to a ma-kes-hift ca-ge in one cor-ner of our
com-mon ro-om. It lay the-re li-ke it was de-ad.
Lisa sa-id, "I ran its DNA. It re-al-ly is a dog."
"Bunbaum be-li-eve you?"
She ga-ve me a dirty lo-ok. "What do you think?"
I la-ug-hed. At Ses-Co, tac-ti-cal de-fen-se res-pon-ders we-re ex-pec-ted to be fast, fle-xib-le, and
de-adly, but the re-ality was our SOP was al-ways the sa-me: drop nu-kes on int-ru-ders, slag the
lef-to-vers to melt so they co-uldn't reg-row, hit the be-ac-hes for va-ca-ti-on. We we-re
in-de-pen-dent and trus-ted as far as tac-ti-cal de-ci-si-ons went, but the-re was no way Ses-Co was
go-ing to be-li-eve its slag sol-di-ers had fo-und a dog in the-ir ta-ilings mo-un-ta-ins.
Lisa nod-ded. "He wan-ted to know how the hell a dog co-uld li-ve out he-re. Then he wan-ted to
know why we didn't catch it so-oner. Wan-ted to know what he pays us for." She pus-hed her short
blond ha-ir off her fa-ce and eyed the ani-mal. "I sho-uld ha-ve slag-ged it."
"What's he want us to do?"
"It's not in the ma-nu-al. He's cal-ling back."
I stu-di-ed the limp ani-mal. "I want to know how it was sur-vi-ving. Dogs are me-at eaters, right?"
"Maybe so-me of the en-gi-ne-ers we-re gi-ving it me-at. Li-ke Ja-ak did."
Jaak sho-ok his he-ad. "I don't think so. The suc-ker threw up my arm al-most right af-ter he ate it."
He wig-gled his new stump whe-re it was ra-pidly reg-ro-wing. "I don't think we're com-pa-tib-le for it."

I as-ked, "But we co-uld eat it, right?"
Lisa la-ug-hed and to-ok a spo-on-ful of ta-ilings. "We can eat anyt-hing. We're the top of the fo-od
cha-in."
"Weird how it can't eat us."
"You've pro-bably got mo-re mer-cury and le-ad run-ning thro-ugh yo-ur blo-od than any
pre-we-evil-tech ani-mal ever co-uld ha-ve had."
"That's bad?"
"Used to be po-ison."
"Weird."
Jaak sa-id, "I think I might ha-ve bro-ken it when I put it in the ca-ge." He stu-di-ed it se-ri-o-usly.
"It's not mo-ving li-ke it was be-fo-re. And I he-ard so-met-hing snap when
I stuf-fed it in."
"So?"
Jaak shrug-ged. "I don't think it's he-aling."
The dog did lo-ok kind of be-at up. It just lay the-re, its si-des go-ing up and down li-ke a bel-lows.
Its eyes we-re half-open, but didn't se-em to be fo-cu-sed on any of us. When Ja-ak ma-de a sud-den
mo-ve-ment, it twitc-hed for a se-cond, but it didn't get up. It didn't even growl.
Jaak sa-id, "I ne-ver tho-ught an ani-mal co-uld be so fra-gi-le."
"You're fra-gi-le, too. That's not such a big surp-ri-se."
"Yeah, but I only bro-ke a co-up-le bo-nes on it, and now lo-ok at it. It just li-es the-re and pants."
Lisa frow-ned tho-ught-ful-ly. "It do-esn't he-al." She clim-bed awk-wardly to her fe-et and went to
pe-er in-to the ca-ge. Her vo-ice was ex-ci-ted. "It re-al-ly is a dog. Just li-ke we used to be. It co-uld
ta-ke we-eks for it to he-al. One bro-ken bo-ne, and it's do-ne for."
She re-ac-hed a ra-zo-red hand in-to the ca-ge and sli-ced a thin wo-und in-to its shank. Blo-od
oozed out, and kept oozing. It to-ok mi-nu-tes for it to be-gin clot-ting. The dog lay still and pan-ted,
cle-arly was-ted.
She la-ug-hed. "It's hard to be-li-eve we ever li-ved long eno-ugh to evol-ve out of that. If you chop
off its legs, they won't reg-row." She coc-ked her he-ad, fas-ci-na-ted. "It's as de-li-ca-te as rock. You
bre-ak it, and it ne-ver co-mes back to-get-her." She re-ac-hed out to stro-ke the mat-ted fur of the
ani-mal. "It's as easy to kill as the hun-ter."
The comm buz-zed. Ja-ak went to ans-wer.
Lisa and I sta-red at the dog, our own lit-tle win-dow in-to pre-his-tory.
Jaak ca-me back in-to the ro-om. "Bun-ba-um's flying out a bi-olo-gist to ta-ke a
look at it."
"You me-an a bio-engi-ne-er," I cor-rec-ted him.
"Nope. Bi-olo-gist. Bun-ba-um sa-id they study ani-mals."
Lisa sat down. I chec-ked her bla-des to see if she'd knoc-ked anyt-hing lo-ose. "The-re's a
de-ad-end job."
"I gu-ess they grow them out of DNA. Study what they do. Be-ha-vi-o-ur, shit li-ke
that." "Who hi-res them?"
Jaak shrug-ged. "Pau Fo-un-da-ti-on has three of them on staff. Ori-gin of li-fe guys. That's who's
sen-ding out this one. Mus-hi-so-met-hing. Didn't get his na-me."
"Origin of li-fe?"
"Sure, you know, what ma-kes us tick. What ma-kes us ali-ve. Stuff li-ke that." I po-ured a hand-ful
of ta-ilings mud in-to Li-sa's mo-uth. She gob-bled it gra-te-ful-ly. "Mud ma-kes us tick," I sa-id. Ja-ak
nod-ded at the dog. "It do-esn't ma-ke that dog tick." We all lo-oked at the dog. "It's hard to tell what
ma-kes it tick."
Lin Mus-har-raf was a short guy with black ha-ir and a ho-oked no-se that do-mi-na-ted his fa-ce.
He had car-ved his skin with swir-ling pat-terns of glow imp-lants, so he sto-od out as co-balt spi-rals in
the dark-ness as he jum-ped down from his char-te-red HEV.

The cen-ta-urs went wild abo-ut the una-ut-ho-ri-zed vi-si-tor and cor-ral-led him right up aga-inst his
ship. They we-re all over him and his DNA kit, snif-fing him, run-ning the-ir scan-ners over his ca-se,
po-in-ting the-ir 101's in-to his glo-wing fa-ce and snar-ling at him.
I let him swe-at for a mi-nu-te be-fo-re cal-ling them away. The cen-ta-urs bac-ked off, swe-aring
and circ-ling, but didn't slag him. Mus-har-raf lo-oked sha-ken. I co-uldn't bla-me him. They're scary
mons-ters: big-ger and fas-ter than a man. The-ir be-ha-vi-o-ur patc-hes ma-ke them vi-ci-o-us, the-ir
sen-ti-en-ce upg-ra-des gi-ve them the in-tel-li-gen-ce to ope-ra-te mi-li-tary equ-ip-ment, and the-ir
ba-sic fight/flight res-pon-se is so im-pa-ired that they only know how to at-tack when they're
thre-ate-ned. I've se-en a half-slag-ged cen-ta-ur te-ar a man to pi-eces ba-re-han-ded and then jo-in an
as-sa-ult on enemy rid-ge for-ti-fi-ca-ti-ons, drag-ging its who-le mel-ted car-cass for-ward with just its
arms. They're gre-at crit-ters to ha-ve at yo-ur back when the slag starts flying.
I gu-ided Mus-har-raf out of the scrum. He had a who-le pack of me-mory ad-den-dums blin-king off
the back of his skull: a fat pi-pe of da-ta ret-ri-eval, chan-ne-led di-rect to the bra-in, and no smash
pro-tec-ti-on. The cen-ta-urs co-uld ha-ve shut him down with one hard tap to the back of the he-ad.
His cor-tex might ha-ve grown back, but he wo-uldn't ha-ve be-en the sa-me. Lo-oking at tho-se
blin-king trip-le fins of in-tel-li-gen-ce dra-ping down the back of his he-ad, you co-uld tell he was a
typi-cal lab rat. All bra-ins, no sur-vi-val ins-tincts. I wo-uldn't ha-ve stuck mem-adds in-to my he-ad
even for a trip-le bo-nus.
"You've got a dog?" Mus-har-raf as-ked when we we-re out of re-ach of the cen-ta-urs.
"We think so." I led him down in-to the bun-ker, past our we-apons racks and we-ight ro-oms to the
com-mon ro-om whe-re we'd sto-red the dog. The dog lo-oked up at us as we ca-me in, the most
mo-ve-ment it had ma-de sin-ce Ja-ak put it in the ca-ge.
Musharraf stop-ped short and sta-red. "Re-mar-kab-le."
He knelt in front of the ani-mal's ca-ge and un-loc-ked the do-or. He held out a hand-ful of pel-lets.
The dog drag-ged it-self up-right. Mus-har-raf bac-ked away, gi-ving it ro-om, and the dog fol-lo-wed
stiff and wary, snuf-fling af-ter the pel-lets. It bu-ri-ed its muz-zle in his brown hand, snor-ting and
gob-bling at the pel-lets.
Musharraf lo-oked up. "And you fo-und it in yo-ur ta-ilings pits?"
"That's right."
"Remarkable."
The dog fi-nis-hed the pel-lets and snuf-fled his palm for mo-re. Mus-har-raf la-ug-hed and sto-od.
"No mo-re for you. Not right now." He ope-ned his DNA kit, pul-led out a samp-ler ne-ed-le and stuck
the dog. The samp-ler's cham-ber fil-led with blo-od.
Lisa watc-hed. "You talk to it?"
Musharraf shrug-ged. "It's a ha-bit." "But it's not sen-ti-ent."
"Well, no, but it li-kes to he-ar vo-ices." The cham-ber fi-nis-hed fil-ling. He withd-rew the ne-ed-le,
dis-con-nec-ted the col-lec-ti-on cham-ber and fit-ted it in-to the kit. The analy-sis soft-wa-re blin-ked
ali-ve and the blo-od di-sap-pe-ared in-to the he-art of the kit with a soft va-cu-um hiss.
"How do you know?"
Musharraf shrug-ged. "It's a dog. Dogs are that way."
We all frow-ned. Mus-har-raf star-ted run-ning tests on the blo-od, hum-ming tu-ne-les-sly to him-self
as he wor-ked. His DNA kit pe-eped and squ-aw-ked. Li-sa watc-hed him run his tests, cle-arly
pis-sed off that Ses-Co had sent out a lab rat to re-test what she had al-re-ady do-ne. It was easy to
un-ders-tand her ir-ri-ta-ti-on. A cen-ta-ur co-uld ha-ve run tho-se DNA tests.
"I'm as-to-un-ded that you fo-und a dog in yo-ur pits," Mus-har-raf mut-te-red.
Lisa sa-id, "We we-re go-ing to slag it, but Bun-ba-um wo-uldn't let us."
Musharraf eyed her. "How rest-ra-ined of you."
Lisa shrug-ged. "Orders."
"Still, I'm su-re yo-ur ther-mal sur-ge we-apon pre-sen-ted a po-wer-ful temp-ta-ti-on. How go-od of
you not to slag a star-ving ani-mal."
Lisa frow-ned sus-pi-ci-o-usly. I star-ted to worry that she might ta-ke Mus-har-raf apart. She was

crazy eno-ugh wit-ho-ut pe-op-le tal-king down to her. The me-mory ad-den-dums on the back of his
he-ad we-re an aw-ful-ly temp-ting tar-get: one slap, down go-es the lab rat. I won-de-red if we sank
him in a catch-ment la-ke if an-yo-ne wo-uld no-ti-ce him mis-sing. A bi-olo-gist, for Christ's sa-ke.
Musharraf tur-ned back to his DNA kit, ap-pa-rently una-wa-re of his ha-zard. "Did you know that in
the past, pe-op-le be-li-eved that we sho-uld ha-ve com-pas-si-on for all things on Earth? Not just for
our-sel-ves, but for all li-ving things?"
"So?"
"I wo-uld ho-pe you will ha-ve com-pas-si-on for one fo-olish sci-en-tist and not dis-mem-ber me
to-day."
Lisa la-ug-hed. I re-la-xed. En-co-ura-ged, Mus-har-raf sa-id, "It truly is re-mar-kab-le that you
fo-und such a spe-ci-men amongst yo-ur mi-ning ope-ra-ti-ons. I ha-ven't he-ard of a li-ving spe-ci-men
in ten or fif-te-en ye-ars."
"I saw one in a zoo, on-ce," Ja-ak sa-id.
"Yes, well, a zoo is the only pla-ce for them. And la-bo-ra-to-ri-es, of co-ur-se. They still pro-vi-de
use-ful ge-ne-tic da-ta." He was stud-ying the re-sults of the tests, nod-ding to him-self as
in-for-ma-ti-on scrol-led ac-ross the kit's scre-en.
Jaak grin-ned. "Who ne-eds ani-mals if you can eat sto-ne?"
Musharraf be-gan pac-king up his DNA kit. "We-evil-tech. Pre-ci-sely. We trans-cen-ded the
ani-mal king-dom." He latc-hed his kit clo-sed and nod-ded to us all. "Well, it's be-en qu-ite
en-ligh-te-ning. Thank you for let-ting me see yo-ur spe-ci-men."
"You're not go-ing to ta-ke it with you?"
Musharraf pa-used, surp-ri-sed. "Oh no. I don't think so."
"It's not a dog, then?"
"Oh no, it's qu-ite cer-ta-inly a re-al dog. But what on Earth wo-uld I do with it?" He held up a vi-al of
blo-od. "We ha-ve the DNA. A li-ve one is hardly worth ke-eping aro-und. Very ex-pen-si-ve to
ma-in-ta-in, you know. Ma-nu-fac-tu-ring a ba-sic or-ga-nism's fo-od is qu-ite comp-lex. Cle-an
ro-oms, air fil-ters, spe-ci-al lights. Re-cre-ating the web of li-fe isn't easy. Far mo-re simp-le to
re-le-ase one-self from it comp-le-tely than to at-tempt to re-cre-ate it." He glan-ced at the dog.
"Unfor-tu-na-tely, our furry fri-end over the-re wo-uld ne-ver sur-vi-ve we-evil-tech. The worms wo-uld
eat him as qu-ickly as they eat everyt-hing el-se. No, you wo-uld ha-ve to ma-nu-fac-tu-re the ani-mal
from scratch. And re-al-ly, what wo-uld be the po-int of that? A bio-job wit-ho-ut hands?" He la-ug-hed
and he-aded for his HEV.
We all lo-oked at each ot-her. I jog-ged af-ter the doc-tor and ca-ught up with him at the hatch to the
tar-mac. He had pa-used on the ver-ge of ope-ning it. "Yo-ur cen-ta-urs know me now?" he as-ked.
"Yeah, you're fi-ne."
"Good." He di-la-ted the hatch and stro-de out in-to the cold.
I tra-iled af-ter him. "Wa-it! What are we sup-po-sed to do with it?"
"The dog?" The doc-tor clim-bed in-to the HEV and be-gan strap-ping in. Wind whip-ped aro-und
us, car-rying stin-ging grit from the ta-ilings pi-les. "Turn it back to yo-ur pits. Or you co-uld eat it, I
sup-po-se. I un-ders-tand that it was a re-al de-li-cacy. The-re are re-ci-pes for co-oking ani-mals.
They ta-ke ti-me, but they can gi-ve qu-ite ext-ra-or-di-nary re-sults."
Musharraf's pi-lot star-ted cycling up his tur-bo-fans.
"Are you kid-ding?"
Musharraf shrug-ged, and sho-uted over the inc-re-asing scre-am of the en-gi-nes. "You sho-uld try
it! Just anot-her part of our he-ri-ta-ge that's at-rop-hi-ed sin-ce wee-vil-tech!"
He yan-ked down the flight co-co-on's do-or, se-aling him-self in-si-de. The tur-bo-fans cycled
hig-her and the pi-lot mo-ti-oned me back from the-ir wash as the HEV slowly lif-ted in-to the air.
Lisa and Ja-ak co-uldn't ag-ree on what we sho-uld do with the dog. We had pro-to-cols for
wor-king out conf-lict. As a tri-be of kil-lers, we ne-eded them. Nor-mal-ly, con-sen-sus wor-ked for
us, but every on-ce in a whi-le, we just got tang-led up and stuck to our po-si-ti-ons, and af-ter that, not

much co-uld get do-ne wit-ho-ut so-me-one get-ting sla-ugh-te-red. Li-sa and Ja-ak dug in, and af-ter a
co-up-le days of wrang-ling, with Li-sa thre-ate-ning to co-ok the thing in the mid-dle of the night whi-le
Ja-ak wasn't watc-hing, and Ja-ak thre-ate-ning to co-ok her if she did, we fi-nal-ly went with a
ma-j-ority vo-te. I got to be the tie-bre-aker.
"I say we eat it," Li-sa sa-id.
We we-re sit-ting in the mo-ni-to-ring ro-om, watc-hing sa-tel-li-te shots of the ta-ilings mo-un-ta-ins
and the inf-ra-red blobs of the mi-ning bots whi-le they rip-ped aro-und in the earth. In one cor-ner, the
obj-ect of our dis-cus-si-on lay in its ca-ge, drag-ged the-re by Ja-ak in an at-tempt to sway the re-sult.
He spun his ob-ser-va-ti-on cha-ir, tur-ning his at-ten-ti-on away from the the-at-re maps. "I think we
sho-uld ke-ep it. It's co-ol. Old-ti-mey, you know? I me-an, who the hell do you know who has a re-al
dog?"
"Who the hell wants the has-sle?" Li-sa res-pon-ded. "I say we try re-al me-at." She cut a li-ne in her
fo-re-arm with her ra-zors. She ran her fin-ger along the re-sul-ting blo-od be-ads and tas-ted them as
the wo-und se-aled.
They both lo-oked at me. I lo-oked at the ce-iling. "Are you su-re you can't de-ci-de this wit-ho-ut
me?"
Lisa grin-ned. "Co-me on, Chen, you de-ci-de. It was a gro-up find. Ja-ak won't po-ut, will you?"
Jaak ga-ve her a dirty lo-ok.
I lo-oked at Ja-ak. "I don't want its fo-od costs to co-me out of gro-up bo-nu-ses. We ag-re-ed we'd
use part of it for the new Im-mer-si-ve Res-pon-se. I'm sick of the old one.
Jaak shrug-ged. "Fi-ne with me. I can pay for it out of my own. I just won't get any mo-re tats."
I le-aned back in my cha-ir, surp-ri-sed, then lo-oked at Li-sa. "Well, if Ja-ak wants to pay for it, I
think we sho-uld ke-ep it."
Lisa sta-red at me, inc-re-du-lo-us. "But we co-uld co-ok it!"
I glan-ced at the dog whe-re it lay pan-ting in its ca-ge. "It's li-ke ha-ving a zoo of our own. I kind of
li-ke it."
Musharraf and the Pau Fo-un-da-ti-on ho-oked us up with a supply of fo-od pel-lets for the dog and
Ja-ak lo-oked up an old da-ta-ba-se on how to splint its bus-ted bo-nes. He bo-ught wa-ter filt-ra-ti-on
so that it co-uld drink.
I tho-ught I'd ma-de a go-od de-ci-si-on, put-ting the costs on Ja-ak, but I didn't re-al-ly fo-re-see
the comp-li-ca-ti-ons that ca-me with ha-ving an un-mo-di-fi-ed or-ga-nism in the bun-ker. The thing shit
all over the flo-or, and so-me-ti-mes it wo-uldn't eat, and it wo-uld get sick for no re-ason, and it was
slow to he-al so we all en-ded up pla-ying nur-se-ma-id to the thing whi-le it lay in its ca-ge. I kept
ex-pec-ting Li-sa to bre-ak its neck in the mid-dle of the night, but even tho-ugh she grumb-led, she
didn't as-sas-si-na-te it.
Jaak tri-ed to act li-ke Mus-har-raf. He tal-ked to the dog. He log-ged on-to the lib-ra-ri-es and
re-ad all abo-ut old-ti-me dogs. How they ran in packs. How pe-op-le used to bre-ed them.
We tri-ed to fi-gu-re out what kind of dog it was, but we co-uldn't nar-row it down much, and then
Ja-ak dis-co-ve-red that all the dogs co-uld in-terb-re-ed, so all you co-uld do was gu-ess that it was
so-me kind of big she-ep dog, with may-be a he-ad from a Rot-twe-iler, along with may-be so-me
ot-her kind of dog, li-ke a wolf or co-yo-te or so-met-hing.
Jaak tho-ught it had co-yo-te in it be-ca-use they we-re sup-po-sed to ha-ve be-en big adap-ters,
and wha-te-ver our dog was, it must ha-ve be-en a big adap-ter to hang out in the ta-ilings pits. It didn't
ha-ve the bo-os-ters we had, and it had still li-ved in the rock acids. Even Li-sa was imp-res-sed by that.
I was car-pet bom-bing An-tarc-tic Re-ces-si-onists, swo-oping low, dri-ving the suc-kers furt-her
and furt-her along the ice floe. If I got lucky, I'd dri-ve the who-le vil-la-ge out on-to a ves-ti-gi-al shelf
and sink them all be-fo-re they knew what was hap-pe-ning. I do-ve aga-in, stra-fing and then spin-ning
away from the-ir re-turn slag.
It was fun, but mostly just a way to kill ti-me bet-we-en re-al bom-bing runs. The new IR was

sup-po-sed to be as go-od as the ar-ca-des, full im-mer-si-on and fe-ed-back, and por-tab-le to bo-ot.
Pe-op-le got so lost they had to ta-ke int-ra-ve-no-us fe-edings or they wit-he-red away whi-le they
we-re in-si-de.
I was abo-ut to sink a who-le lo-ad of re-fu-ge-es when Ja-ak sho-uted. "Get out he-re! You've got
to see this!"
I strip-ped off my gog-gles and ran for the mo-ni-to-ring ro-om, ad-re-na-li-ne am-ping up. WTi-en I
got the-re, Ja-ak was just stan-ding in the cen-ter of the ro-om with the dog, grin-ning.
Lisa ca-me te-aring in a se-cond la-ter. "What? What is it?" Her eyes scan-ned the the-at-re maps,
re-ady for blo-ods-hed.
Jaak grin-ned. "Lo-ok at this." He tur-ned to the dog and held out his hand.
"Shake."
The dog sat back on its ha-unc-hes and gra-vely of-fe-red him its paw. Ja-ak grin-ned and sho-ok the
paw, then tos-sed it a fo-od pel-let. He tur-ned to us and bo-wed.
Lisa frow-ned. "Do it aga-in."
Jaak shrug-ged, and went thro-ugh the per-for-man-ce a se-cond ti-me. "It thinks?" she as-ked.
Jaak shrug-ged. "Got me. You can get it to do things. The lib-ra-ri-es are full of stuff on them. They're
tra-inab-le. Not li-ke a cen-ta-ur or anyt-hing, but you can ma-ke them do lit-tle tricks, and if they're
cer-ta-in bre-eds, they can le-arn spe-ci-al stuff, too."
"Like what?"
"Some of them we-re tra-ined to at-tack. Or to find exp-lo-si-ves." Li-sa lo-oked imp-res-sed. "Li-ke
nu-kes and stuff?" Ja-ak shrug-ged. "I gu-ess." "Can I try?" I as-ked. Ja-ak nod-ded. "Go for it."
I went over to the dog and stuck out my hand. "Sha-ke."
It stuck out its paw. My hack-les went up. It was li-ke sen-ding sig-nals to ali-ens. I me-an, you
ex-pect a bio-job or a ro-bot to do what you want it to. Cen-ta-ur, go get blown up. Find the op-for-ce.
Call re-in-for-ce-ments. The HEV was li-ke that, too. It wo-uld do anyt-hing. But it was de-sig-ned.
"Feed it," Ja-ak sa-id, han-ding me a fo-od pel-let. "You ha-ve to fe-ed it when it do-es it right."
I held out the fo-od pel-let. The dog's long pink ton-gue swab-bed my palm.
I held out my hand aga-in. "Sha-ke." I sa-id. It held out its paw. We sho-ok hands. Its am-ber eyes
sta-red up at me, so-lemn.
"That's so-me we-ird shit," Li-sa sa-id. I shi-ve-red, nod-ding and bac-ked away. The dog watc-hed
me go.
That night in my bunk, I lay awa-ke, re-ading. I'd tur-ned out the lights and only the bo-ok's sur-fa-ce
glo-wed, il-lu-mi-na-ting the bunk-ro-om in a soft gre-en aura. So-me of Li-sa's art buys glim-me-red
dimly from the walls: a bron-ze han-ging of a pho-enix bre-aking in-to flight, styli-zed fla-mes glo-wing
aro-und it; a Japa-ne-se wo-odb-lock print of Mo-unt Fu-ji and anot-her of a vil-la-ge we-ig-hed down
un-der thick snows; a pho-to of the three of us in Si-be-ria af-ter the Pe-nin-su-la cam-pa-ign, grin-ning
and ali-ve amongst the slag.
Lisa ca-me in-to the ro-om. Her ra-zors glin-ted in my bo-ok's dim light, flas-hes of gre-en sparks that
out-li-ned her limbs as she mo-ved.
"What are you re-ading?" She strip-ped and squ-e-ezed in-to bed with me.
I held up the bo-ok and re-ad out lo-ud.
Cut me I won't ble-ed. Gas me I won't bre-at-he.
Stab me, sho-ot me, slash me, smash me
I ha-ve swal-lo-wed sci-en-ce
I am God.
Alone.
I clo-sed the bo-ok and its glow di-ed. In the dark-ness, Li-sa rust-led un-der the co-vers.
My eyes adj-us-ted. She was sta-ring at me. "'De-ad Man,' right?" "Be-ca-use of the dog," I sa-id.
"Dark re-ading." She to-uc-hed my sho-ul-der, her hand warm, the bla-des em-bed-ded, bi-ting

lightly in-to my skin.
"We used to be li-ke that dog," I sa-id.
"Pathetic." "Scary."
We we-re qu-i-et for a lit-tle whi-le. Fi-nal-ly I as-ked, "Do you ever won-der what wo-uld hap-pen
to us if we didn't ha-ve our sci-en-ce? If we didn't ha-ve our big bra-ins and our we-evil-tech and our
cel-lstims and-"
"And everyt-hing that ma-kes our li-fe go-od?" She la-ug-hed. "No." She rub-bed my sto-mach. "I
li-ke all tho-se lit-tle worms that li-ve in yo-ur belly." She star-ted to tick-le me.
Wormy, squ-irmy in yo-ur belly, wormy squ-irmy fe-eds you Nelly. Mic-ro-we-evils eat the bad, and
gi-ve you so-met-hing go-od ins-te-ad.
I fo-ught her off, la-ug-hing. "That's no Ye-arly."
"Third Gra-de. Ba-sic bio-lo-gic. Mrs. Al-va-rez. She was re-al-ly big on we-evil-tech."
She tri-ed to tick-le me aga-in but I fo-ught her off. "Ye-ah, well Ye-arly only wro-te abo-ut
im-mor-ta-lity. He wo-uldn't ta-ke it."
Lisa ga-ve up on the tick-ling and flop-ped down be-si-de me aga-in. "Blah, blah, blah. He wo-uldn't
ta-ke any ge-ne mo-di-fi-ca-ti-ons. No c-cell in-hi-bi-tors. He was dying of can-cer and he wo-uldn't
ta-ke the drugs that wo-uld ha-ve sa-ved him. Our last mor-tal po-et. Cry me a ri-ver. So what?"
"You ever think abo-ut why he wo-uldn't?"
"Yeah. He wan-ted to be fa-mo-us. Su-ici-de's go-od for at-ten-ti-on."
"Seriously, tho-ugh. He tho-ught be-ing hu-man me-ant ha-ving ani-mals. The who-le web of li-fe
thing. I've be-en re-ading abo-ut him. It's we-ird shit. He didn't want to li-ve wit-ho-ut them."
"Mrs. Al-va-rez ha-ted him. She had so-me rhymes abo-ut him, too. Any-way, what we-re we
sup-po-sed to do? Work out we-evil-tech and DNA patc-hes for every stu-pid spe-ci-es? Do you
know what that wo-uld ha-ve cost?" She nuz-zled clo-se to me. "If you want ani-mals aro-und you, go to
a zoo. Or get so-me bu-il-ding blocks and ma-ke so-met-hing, if it ma-kes you happy. So-met-hing with
hands, for god's sa-ke, not li-ke that dog." She sta-red at the un-der-si-de of the bunk abo-ve. "I'd
co-ok that dog in a se-cond."
I sho-ok my he-ad. "I don't know. That dog's dif-fe-rent from a bio-job. It lo-oks at us, and the-re's
so-met-hing the-re, and it's not us. I me-an, ta-ke any bio-job out the-re, and it's ba-si-cal-ly us, po-ured
in-to anot-her sha-pe, but not that dog " I tra-iled off, thin-king.
Lisa la-ug-hed. "It sho-ok hands with you, Chen. You don't worry abo-ut a cen-ta-ur
when it sa-lu-tes." She clim-bed on top of me. "For-get the dog. Con-cent-ra-te on so-met-hing that
mat-ters." Her smi-le and her ra-zor bla-des glin-ted in the dim-ness.
I wo-ke up to so-met-hing lic-king my fa-ce. At first I tho-ught it was Li-sa, but she'd clim-bed in-to
her own bunk. I ope-ned my eyes and fo-und the dog.
It was a funny thing to ha-ve this ani-mal lic-king me, li-ke it wan-ted to talk, or say hel-lo or
so-met-hing. It lic-ked me aga-in, and I tho-ught that it had co-me a long way from when it had tri-ed to
ta-ke off Ja-ak's arm. It put its paws up on my bed, and then in a sing-le he-avy mo-ve-ment, it was up
on the bunk with me, its bulk cur-led aga-inst me.
It slept the-re all night. It was we-ird ha-ving so-met-hing ot-her than Li-sa lying next to me, but it was
warm and the-re was so-met-hing fri-endly abo-ut it. I co-uldn't help smi-ling as I drif-ted back to
sle-ep.
We flew to Ha-wa-ii for a swim-ming va-ca-ti-on and we bro-ught the dog with us. It was go-od to
get out of the nort-hern cold and in-to the gent-le Pa-ci-fic. Go-od to stand on the be-ach, and lo-ok out
to a li-mit-less ho-ri-zon. Go-od to walk along the be-ach hol-ding hands whi-le black wa-ves cras-hed
on the sand.
Lisa was a go-od swim-mer. She flas-hed thro-ugh the oce-an's me-tal-lic she-en li-ke an eel out of

his-tory and when she sur-fa-ced, her na-ked body glis-te-ned with hund-reds of iri-des-cent
pet-ro-le-um jewels.
When the Sun star-ted to set, Ja-ak lit the oce-an on fi-re with his 101. We all sat and watc-hed as
the Sun's gre-at red ball sank thro-ugh ve-ils of smo-ke, its light sha-ding de-eper crim-son with every
mi-nu-te. Wa-ves rus-hed fla-ming on-to the be-ach. Ja-ak got out his har-mo-ni-ca and pla-yed whi-le
Li-sa and I ma-de lo-ve on the sand.
We'd in-ten-ded to am-pu-ta-te her for the we-ekend, to let her try what she had do-ne to me the
va-ca-ti-on be-fo-re. It was a new thing in L.A., an ex-pe-ri-ment in vul-ne-ra-bi-lity.
She was be-a-uti-ful, lying the-re on the be-ach, slick and ex-ci-ted with all of our play in the wa-ter. I
lic-ked oil opals off her skin as I sli-ced off her limbs, le-aving her mo-re de-pen-dent than a baby. Ja-ak
pla-yed his har-mo-ni-ca and watc-hed the Sun set, and watc-hed as I ren-de-red Li-sa down to her
co-re.
After our sex, we lay on the sand. The last of the Sun was drop-ping be-low the wa-ter. Its rays
glin-ted redly ac-ross the smo-ul-de-ring wa-ves. The sky, thick with par-ti-cu-la-tes and smo-ke,
sha-ded dar-ker.
Lisa sig-hed con-ten-tedly. "We sho-uld va-ca-ti-on he-re mo-re of-ten."
I tug-ged on a length of bar-bed wi-re bu-ri-ed in the sand. It to-re free and I wrap-ped it aro-und my
up-per arm, a tight band that bit in-to my skin. I sho-wed it to Li-sa. "I used to do this all the ti-me when
I was a kid." I smi-led. "I tho-ught I was so bad-ass."
Lisa smi-led. "You are."
"Thanks to sci-en-ce." I glan-ced over at the dog. It was lying on the sand a short dis-tan-ce away. It
se-emed sul-len and un-su-re in its new en-vi-ron-ment, torn away from the sa-fety of the acid pits and
ta-ilings mo-un-ta-ins of its ho-me-land. Ja-ak sat be-si-de the dog and pla-yed. Its ears twitc-hed to the
mu-sic. He was a go-od pla-yer. The mo-urn-ful so-und of the har-mo-ni-ca car-ri-ed easily over the
be-ach to whe-re we lay. Li-sa tur-ned her he-ad, trying to see the dog. "Roll me."
I did what she as-ked. Al-re-ady, her limbs we-re reg-ro-wing. Small stumps, which wo-uld bu-ild
in-to lar-ger limbs. By mor-ning, she wo-uld be who-le, and ra-ve-no-us. She stu-di-ed the dog. "This is
as clo-se as I'll ever get to it," she sa-id.
"Sorry?"
"Its vul-ne-rab-le to everyt-hing. It can't swim in the oce-an. It can't eat anyt-hing. We ha-ve to fly its
fo-od to it. We ha-ve to scrub its wa-ter. De-ad end of an evo-lu-ti-onary cha-in. Wit-ho-ut sci-en-ce,
we'd be as vul-ne-rab-le as it." She lo-oked up at me. "As vul-ne-rab-le as I am now." She grin-ned.
"This is as clo-se to de-ath as I've ever be-en. At le-ast, not in com-bat."
"Wild, isn't it?"
"For a day. I li-ked it bet-ter when I did it to you. I'm al-re-ady star-ving."
I fed her a hand-ful of oily sand and watc-hed the dog, stan-ding un-cer-ta-inly on the be-ach, snif-fing
sus-pi-ci-o-usly at so-me rus-ting scrap iron that stuck out of the be-ach li-ke a gi-ant me-mory fin. It
pa-wed up a chunk of red plas-tic rub-bed shiny by the oce-an and che-wed on it bri-efly, be-fo-re
drop-ping it. It star-ted lic-king aro-und its mo-uth. I won-de-red if it had po-iso-ned it-self aga-in.
"It su-re can ma-ke you think," I mut-te-red. I fed Li-sa anot-her hand-ful of sand. "If so-me-one
ca-me from the past, to me-et us he-re and now, what do you think they'd say abo-ut us? Wo-uld they
even call us hu-man?"
Lisa lo-oked at me se-ri-o-usly. "No, they'd call us gods."
Jaak got up and wan-de-red in-to the surf, stan-ding knee-de-ep in the black smo-ul-de-ring wa-ters.
The dog, dri-ven by so-me unk-nown ins-tinct, fol-lo-wed him, gin-gerly pic-king its way ac-ross the
sand and rub-ble.
The dog got tang-led in a clus-ter of wi-re our last day on the be-ach. Re-al-ly rip-ped the hell out of
it: slas-hes thro-ugh its fur, bro-ken legs, prac-ti-cal-ly strang-led. It had gna-wed one of its own paws
half off trying to get free. By the ti-me we fo-und it, it was a blo-ody mess of rag-ged fur and ex-po-sed
me-at.

Lisa sta-red down at the dog. "Christ, Ja-ak, you we-re sup-po-sed to be watc-hing it."
"I went swim-ming. You can't ke-ep an eye on the thing all the ti-me."
"It's go-ing to ta-ke fo-re-ver to fix this," she fu-med.
"We sho-uld warm up the hun-ter," I sa-id. "It'll be easi-er to work on it back ho-me." Li-sa and I
knelt down to start cut-ting the dog free. It whim-pe-red and its ta-il wag-ged fe-ebly as we star-ted to
work.
Jaak was si-lent.
Lisa slap-ped him on his leg. "Co-me on, Ja-ak, get down he-re. It'll ble-ed out if you don't hurry up.
You know how fra-gi-le it is." Ja-ak sa-id, "I think we sho-uld eat it." Li-sa glan-ced up, surp-ri-sed.
"You do?" He shrug-ged. "Su-re."
I lo-oked up from whe-re 1 was te-aring away tang-led wi-res from aro-und the dog's tor-so."!
tho-ught you wan-ted it to be yo-ur pet. Li-ke in the zoo."
Jaak sho-ok his he-ad. "Tho-se fo-od pel-lets are ex-pen-si-ve. Fm spen-ding half my sa-lary on
fo-od and wa-ter filt-ra-ti-on, and now this bul-lshit." He wa-ved his hand at the tang-led dog. "You
ha-ve to watch the suc-ker all the ti-me. It's not worth it."
"But still, it's yo-ur fri-end. It sho-ok hands with you."
Jaak la-ug-hed. "You're my fri-end." He lo-oked down at the dog, his fa-ce wrink-led with tho-ught.
"It's, it's…an ani-mal."
Even tho-ugh we had all idly dis-cus-sed what it wo-uld be li-ke to eat the dog, it was a surp-ri-se to
he-ar him so de-ter-mi-ned to kill it. "May-be you sho-uld sle-ep on it." I sa-id. "We can get it back to
the bun-ker, fix it up, and then you can de-ci-de when you aren't so pis-sed off abo-ut it."
"No." He pul-led out his har-mo-ni-ca and pla-yed a few no-tes, a qu-ick jaz-zy sca-le.
He to-ok the har-mo-ni-ca out of his mo-uth. "If you want to put up the mo-ney for
his fe-ed, I'll ke-ep it, I gu-ess, but ot-her-wi-se " He shrug-ged.
"I don't think you sho-uld co-ok it."
"You don't?" Li-sa glan-ced at me. "We co-uld ro-ast it, right he-re, on the be-ach." I lo-oked down
at the dog, a mass of pan-ting, trus-ting ani-mal. "I still don't think we sho-uld do it."
Jaak lo-oked at me se-ri-o-usly. "You want to pay for the fe-ed?" I sig-hed. "I'm sa-ving for the new
Im-mer-si-ve Res-pon-se."
"Yeah, well, I've got things I want to buy too, you know." He fle-xed his musc-les, sho-wing off his
tat-to-os. "I me-an, what the fuck go-od do-es it do?" "It ma-kes you smi-le."
"Immersive Res-pon-se ma-kes you smi-le. And you don't ha-ve to cle-an up af-ter its crap. Co-me
on, Chen. Ad-mit it. You don't want to ta-ke ca-re of it eit-her. It's a pa-in in the ass."
We all lo-oked at each ot-her, then down at the dog.
Lisa ro-as-ted the dog on a spit, over bur-ning plas-tics and pet-ro-le-um skim-med from the oce-an.
It tas-ted okay, but in the end it was hard to un-ders-tand the big de-al. I've eaten slag-ged cen-ta-ur
that tas-ted bet-ter.
Afterward, we wal-ked along the sho-re-li-ne. Opa-les-cent wa-ves cras-hed and ro-ared up the
sand, le-aving jewel slicks as they re-ce-ded and the Sun sank red in the dis-tan-ce.
Without the dog, we co-uld re-al-ly enj-oy the be-ach. We didn't ha-ve to worry abo-ut whet-her it
was go-ing to step in acid, or tang-le in barb-wi-re half-bu-ri-ed in the sand, or eat so-met-hing that
wo-uld ke-ep it up vo-mi-ting half the night.
Still, I re-mem-ber when the dog lic-ked my fa-ce and ha-uled its shaggy bulk on-to my bed, and I
re-mem-ber its warm bre-at-hing be-si-de me, and so-me-ti-mes, I miss it.

IV - M. RICKERT - BREAD AND BOMBS
The stran-ge child-ren of the Man-mens-vit-zen-der fa-mily did not go to scho-ol so we only knew
they had mo-ved in-to the old ho-use on the hill be-ca-use Bobby had watc-hed them mo-ve in with

the-ir stran-ge as-sort-ment of roc-king cha-irs and go-ats. We co-uldn't ima-gi-ne how an-yo-ne
wo-uld li-ve the-re, whe-re the win-dows we-re all bro-ken and the yard was thorny with bramb-les.
For a whi-le we ex-pec-ted to see the child-ren, two da-ugh-ters who, Bobby sa-id, had ha-ir li-ke
smo-ke and eyes li-ke black oli-ves, at scho-ol. But they ne-ver ca-me.
We we-re in the fo-urth gra-de, that age that se-ems li-ke wa-king from a long slum-ber in-to the
world the adults im-po-sed, stre-ets we we-ren't al-lo-wed to cross, things we we-ren't al-lo-wed to
say, and cros-sing them, and sa-ying them. The myste-ri-o-us Man-mens-vit-zen-der child-ren we-re
just anot-her in a se-ri-es of re-ve-la-ti-ons that ye-ar, inc-lu-ding the much mo-re ex-ci-ting (and
so-me-ti-mes dis-tur-bing) evo-lu-ti-on of our bo-di-es. Our pa-rents, wit-ho-ut ex-cep-ti-on, had
ra-ised us with this su-bj-ect so tho-ro-ughly exp-lo-red that Li-sa Bit-ten knew how to say va-gi-na
be-fo-re she knew her ad-dress and Ralph Lins-ter de-li-ve-red his lit-tle brot-her, Pe-tey, when his
mot-her went in-to la-bo-ur one night when it sud-denly star-ted sno-wing be-fo-re his fat-her co-uld get
ho-me. But the re-al sig-ni-fi-can-ce of this in-for-ma-ti-on didn't start to sink in un-til that ye-ar. We
we-re wa-king to the won-ders of the world and the body; the stran-ge re-ali-za-ti-ons that a fri-end was
cu-te, or stinky, or pic-ked her no-se, or was fat, or wo-re dirty un-der-pants, or had eyes that didn't
blink when he lo-oked at you re-al clo-se and all of a sud-den you felt li-ke blus-hing.
When the crab ap-ple tree blos-so-med a bril-li-ant pink, buz-zing with ho-ney be-es, and our
te-ac-her, Mrs. Gray-mo-ore, lo-oked out the win-dow and sig-hed, we pas-sed no-tes ac-ross the
rows and ma-de wild plans for the scho-ol pic-nic, how we wo-uld am-bush her with wa-ter bal-lo-ons
and throw pi-es at the prin-ci-pal. Of co-ur-se no-ne of this hap-pe-ned. Only Tri-na Ne-ed-les was
di-sap-po-in-ted be-ca-use she re-al-ly be-li-eved it wo-uld but she still wo-re bows in her ha-ir and
sec-retly suc-ked her thumb and was not-hing but a big baby.
Released in-to sum-mer we ran ho-me or bi-ked ho-me sho-uting for joy and es-ca-pe and then
be-gan do-ing everyt-hing we co-uld think of, all tho-se things we'd ima-gi-ned do-ing whi-le Mrs.
Gray-mo-ore sig-hed at the crab ap-ple tree which had al-re-ady lost its bril-li-an-ce and on-ce aga-in
lo-oked or-di-nary. We threw balls, ro-de bi-kes, rol-led ska-te-bo-ards down the dri-ve-way, pic-ked
flo-wers, fo-ught, ma-de up, and it was still ho-urs be-fo-re din-ner. We watc-hed TV, and didn't think
abo-ut be-ing bo-red, but af-ter a whi-le we hung up-si-de down and watc-hed it that way, or switc-hed
the chan-nels back and forth or fo-und re-asons to fight with an-yo-ne in the ho-use. (I was alo-ne,
ho-we-ver and co-uld not in-dul-ge in this.) That's when we he-ard the stran-ge no-ise of go-ats and
bells. In the mothy gray of TV ro-oms, we pul-led back the dra-pes, and pe-ered out win-dows in-to a
yel-lo-wed sun-light.
The two Man-mens-vit-zen-der girls in bright clot-hes the co-lo-ur of a cir-cus, and ga-uzy scar-ves,
one purp-le, the ot-her red, glit-te-ring with se-qu-ins, ca-me rol-ling down the stre-et in a wo-oden
wa-gon pul-led by two go-ats with bells aro-und the-ir necks. That is how the tro-ub-le be-gan. The
news ac-co-unts ne-ver men-ti-on any of this; the fla-me of crab ap-ple blos-soms, our in-no-cen-ce, the
so-und of bells. Ins-te-ad they fo-cus on the un-hap-py re-sults. They say we we-re wild. Un-ca-red for.
Stran-ge. They say we we-re dan-ge-ro-us. As if li-fe was am-ber and we we-re for-med and
sus-pen-ded in that form, not evol-ved in-to that un-ga-inly sha-pe of hor-ror, and evol-ved out of it, as
we are, in-to a te-ac-her, a dan-cer, a wel-der, a law-yer, se-ve-ral sol-di-ers, two doc-tors, and me, a
wri-ter.
Everybody pro-mi-ses du-ring ti-mes li-ke tho-se days im-me-di-ately fol-lo-wing the tra-gedy that
li-ves ha-ve be-en ru-ined, fu-tu-res shat-te-red but only Tri-na Ne-ed-les fell for that and even-tu-al-ly
com-mit-ted su-ici-de. The rest of us suf-fe-red va-ri-o-us forms of cen-su-re and then went on with our
li-ves. Yes, it is true, with a dark past but, you may be surp-ri-sed to le-arn, that can be li-ved with. The
hand that holds the pen (or chalk, or the stet-hos-co-pe, or the gun, or lo-ver's skin) is so dif-fe-rent
from the hand that lit the match, and so in-ca-pab-le of such an act that it is not even a mat-ter of
for-gi-ve-ness, or he-aling. It's stran-ge to lo-ok back and be-li-eve that any of that was me or us. Are
you who you we-re then? Ele-ven ye-ars old and watc-hing the dust mo-tes spin la-zily down a be-am of
sun-light that ru-ins the pic-tu-re on the TV and the-re is a so-und of bells and go-ats and a la-ugh so
pu-re we all co-me run-ning to watch the girls in the-ir bright co-lo-ured scar-ves, sit-ting in the go-at

cart which stops in a stut-ter of go-at-ho-ofed steps and clat-ter of wo-oden whe-els when we
sur-ro-und it to ob-ser-ve tho-se dark eyes and pretty fa-ces.
The yo-un-ger girl, if si-ze is any in-di-ca-ti-on, smi-ling, and the ot-her, yo-un-ger than us, but at
le-ast eight or ni-ne, with hu-ge te-ars rol-ling down her brown che-eks. We stand the-re for a whi-le,
sta-ring, and then Bobby says, "What's a mat-ter with her?"
The yo-un-ger girl lo-oks at her sis-ter who se-ems to be trying to smi-le in spi-te of the te-ars. "She
just cri-es all the ti-me."
Bobby nods and squ-ints at the girl who con-ti-nu-es to cry tho-ugh she ma-na-ges to ask, "Whe-re
ha-ve you kids co-me from?"
He lo-oks aro-und the gro-up with an - are you kid-ding - kind of lo-ok but an-yo-ne can tell he
li-kes the we-eping girl, who-se dark eyes and las-hes glis-ten with te-ars that glit-ter in the sun. "It's
sum-mer va-ca-ti-on."
Trina, who has be-en fur-ti-vely suc-king her thumb, says, "Can I ha-ve a ri-de?" The girls say su-re.
She pus-hes her way thro-ugh the lit-tle crowd and climbs in-to the cart. The yo-un-ger girl smi-les at
her. The ot-her se-ems to try but cri-es es-pe-ci-al-ly lo-ud. Tri-na lo-oks li-ke she might start crying too
un-til the yo-un-ger one says, "Don't worry. It's just how she is." The crying girl sha-kes the re-igns and
the lit-tle bells ring and the go-ats and cart go clat-te-ring down the hill. We lis-ten to Tri-na's shrill
scre-am but we know she's all right. When they co-me back we ta-ke turns un-til our pa-rents call us
ho-me with whist-les and sho-uts and scre-en do-ors slam. We go ho-me for din-ner, and the girls he-ad
ho-me them-sel-ves, the one still crying, the ot-her sin-ging to the ac-com-pa-ni-ment of bells.
"I see you we-re pla-ying with the re-fu-ge-es," my mot-her says. "You be ca-re-ful aro-und tho-se
girls. I don't want you go-ing to the-ir ho-use."
"I didn't go to the-ir ho-use. We just pla-yed with the go-ats and the wa-gon."
"Well all right then, but stay away from the-re. What are they li-ke?"
"One la-ughs a lot. The ot-her cri-es all the ti-me."
"Don't eat anyt-hing they of-fer you."
"Why not?" "Just don't."
"Can't you just exp-la-in to me why not?"
"I don't ha-ve to exp-la-in to you, yo-ung lady, I'm yo-ur mot-her."
We didn't see the girls the next day or the day af-ter that. On the third day Bobby, who had be-gun to
carry a comb in his back poc-ket and part his ha-ir on the si-de, sa-id, "Well hell, let's just go the-re." He
star-ted up the hill but no-ne of us fol-lo-wed.
When he ca-me back that eve-ning we rus-hed him for in-for-ma-ti-on abo-ut his vi-sit, sho-uting
qu-es-ti-ons at him li-ke re-por-ters. "Did you eat anyt-hing?" I as-ked. "My mot-her says not to eat
anyt-hing the-re."
He tur-ned and fi-xed me with such a lo-ok that for a mo-ment I for-got he was my age, just a kid
li-ke me, in spi-te of the new way he was com-bing his ha-ir and the ste-ady ga-ze of his blue eyes.
"Yo-ur mot-her is pre-j-udi-ced," he sa-id. He tur-ned his back to me and re-ac-hed in-to his poc-ket,
pul-ling out a fist that he ope-ned to re-ve-al a hand-ful of small, brightly wrap-ped can-di-es. Tri-na
re-ac-hed her pudgy fin-gers in-to Bobby's palm and pluc-ked out one bright oran-ge one. This was
fol-lo-wed by a flurry of hands un-til the-re was only Bobby's empty palm.
Parents star-ted cal-ling kids ho-me. My mot-her sto-od in the do-or-way but she was too far away
to see what we we-re do-ing. Candy wrap-pers flo-ated down the si-de-walk in swirls of blue, gre-en,
red, yel-low, and oran-ge.
My mot-her and I usu-al-ly ate se-pa-ra-tely. When I was at my dad's we ate to-get-her in front of
the TV, which she sa-id was bar-ba-ric.
"Was he drin-king?" she'd ask. Mot-her was con-vin-ced my fat-her was an al-co-ho-lic and tho-ught
I did not re-mem-ber tho-se ye-ars when he had to le-ave work early be-ca-use I'd cal-led and told him
how she was as-le-ep on the co-uch, still in her pyj-amas, the cof-fee tab-le lit-te-red with cans and
bot-tles, which he threw in the trash with a grim exp-res-si-on and few words.
My mot-her stands, le-aning aga-inst the co-un-ter, and watc-hes me. "Did you play with tho-se girls

to-day?"
"No. Bobby did tho-ugh."
"Well, that fi-gu-res, no-body re-al-ly watc-hes out for that boy. I re-mem-ber when his daddy was in
high scho-ol with me. Did I ever tell you that?"
"Uh-huh."
"He was a hand-so-me man. Bobby's a ni-ce lo-oking boy too but you stay away from him. I think
you play with him too much."
"I hardly play with him at all. He plays with tho-se girls all day." "Did he say anyt-hing abo-ut them?"
"He sa-id so-me pe-op-le are pre-j-udi-ced."
"Oh, he did, did he? Whe-re'd he get such an idea any-way? Must be his grand-pa. You lis-ten to me,
the-re's no-body even talks that way any-mo-re ex-cept for a few rab-ble ro-users, and the-re's a
re-ason for that. Pe-op-le are de-ad be-ca-use of that fa-mily. You just re-mem-ber that. Many, many
pe-op-le di-ed be-ca-use of them."
"You me-an Bobby's, or the girls?"
"Well, both ac-tu-al-ly. But most es-pe-ci-al-ly tho-se girls. He didn't eat anyt-hing, did he?"
I lo-oked out the win-dow, pre-ten-ding a new in-te-rest in our back-yard, then, at her, with a lit-tle
start, as tho-ugh sud-denly awo-ken. "What? Uh, no."
She sta-red at me with squ-in-ted eyes. I pre-ten-ded to be un-con-cer-ned. She tap-ped her red
fin-ger-na-ils aga-inst the kitc-hen co-un-ter. "You lis-ten to me," she sa-id in a sharp vo-ice, "the-re's a
war go-ing on."
I rol-led my eyes.
"You don't even re-mem-ber, do you? Well, how co-uld you, you we-re just a tod-dler. But the-re
was a ti-me when this co-untry didn't know war. Why, pe-op-le used to fly in airp-la-nes all the ti-me."
I stop-ped my fork half-way to my mo-uth. "Well, how stu-pid was that?"
"You don't un-ders-tand. Every-body did it. It was a way to get from one pla-ce to anot-her. Yo-ur
grand-pa-rents did it a lot, and yo-ur fat-her and I did too."
"You we-re on an airp-la-ne?"
"Even you." She smi-led. "See, you don't know so much, missy. The world used to be sa-fe, and then,
one day, it wasn't. And tho-se pe-op-le," she po-in-ted at the kitc-hen win-dow, stra-ight at the Mil-lers'
ho-use, but I knew that wasn't who she me-ant," star-ted it."
"They're just a co-up-le of kids."
"Well, not them exactly, but I me-an the co-untry they co-me from. That's why I want you to be
ca-re-ful. The-re's no tel-ling what they're do-ing he-re. So lit-tle Bobby and his ra-di-cal grand-pa can
say we're all pre-j-udi-ced but who even talks that way any-mo-re?" She wal-ked over to the tab-le,
pul-led out a cha-ir, and sat down in front of me. "I want you to un-ders-tand, the-re's no way to know
abo-ut evil. So just stay away from them. Pro-mi-se me."
Evil. Hard to un-ders-tand. I nod-ded.
"Well, all right." She pus-hed back the cha-ir, sto-od up, grab-bed her pack of ci-ga-ret-tes from the
win-dow-sill. "Ma-ke su-re not to le-ave any crumbs. This is the ti-me of ye-ar for ants."
From the kitc-hen win-dow I co-uld see my mot-her sit-ting on the pic-nic tab-le, a gray plu-me of
smo-ke spi-ral-ling away from her. I rin-sed my dis-hes, lo-aded the dish-was-her, wi-ped the tab-le,
and went out-si-de to sit on the front steps and think abo-ut the world I ne-ver knew. The ho-use on top
of the hill bla-zed in the full sun. The bro-ken win-dows had be-en co-ve-red by so-me sort of plas-tic
that swal-lo-wed the light.
That night one flew over Oakg-ro-ve. I wo-ke up and put my hel-met on. My mot-her was
scre-aming in her ro-om, too frigh-te-ned to help. My hands didn't sha-ke the way hers did, and I didn't
lie in my bed scre-aming. I put the hel-met on and lis-te-ned to it fly past. Not us. Not our town. Not
to-night. I fell as-le-ep with the hel-met on and in the mor-ning wo-ke up with the marks of it den-ted on
my che-eks.
Now, when sum-mer ap-pro-ac-hes, I co-unt the we-eks when the ap-ple tre-es and li-lacs are in

blos-som, the tu-lips and daf-fo-dils in blo-om be-fo-re they dro-op with sum-mer's he-at, and I think
how it is so much li-ke that pe-ri-od of our in-no-cen-ce, that wa-king in-to the world with all its
in-can-des-cen-ce, be-fo-re be-ing sub-du-ed by its sha-dows in-to what we ha-ve be-co-me.
"You sho-uld ha-ve known the world then," my fat-her says, when I vi-sit him at the nur-sing ho-me.
We've he-ard it so much it do-esn't me-an anyt-hing. The ca-kes, the mo-ney, the end-less
as-sort-ment of everyt-hing.
"We used to ha-ve six dif-fe-rent kinds of ce-re-al at one ti-me," he ra-ises his fin-ger inst-ruc-ti-vely,
"co-ated in su-gar, can you ima-gi-ne? It used to go sta-le. We threw it out. And the pla-nes. The sky
used to be fil-led with them. Re-al-ly. Pe-op-le tra-vel-led that way, who-le fa-mi-li-es did. It didn't
mat-ter if so-me-one mo-ved away. Hell, you just got on a pla-ne to see them."
Whenever he spe-aks li-ke this, whe-ne-ver any of them do, they so-und be-wil-de-red, ama-zed. He
sha-kes his he-ad, he sighs. "We we-re so happy."
I can-not he-ar abo-ut tho-se ti-mes wit-ho-ut thin-king of spring flo-wers, child-ren's la-ugh-ter, the
so-und of bells and clat-ter of go-ats. Smo-ke.
Bobby sits in the cart, hol-ding the re-igns, a pretty dark-skin-ned girl on eit-her si-de of him. They
ri-de up and down the stre-et all mor-ning, la-ug-hing and crying, the-ir ga-uzy scar-ves blo-wing
be-hind them li-ke ra-in-bows.
The flags dro-op list-les-sly from flag-po-les and porc-hes. But-terf-li-es flit in and out of gar-dens.
The Whi-te-hall twins play in the-ir back-yard and the squ-e-aky so-und of the-ir uno-iled swings
ec-ho-es thro-ugh the ne-igh-bo-ur-ho-od. Mrs. Ren-qu-at has ta-ken the day off to ta-ke se-ve-ral
kids to the park. I am not in-vi-ted, pro-bably be-ca-use I ha-te Becky Ren-qu-at and told her so
se-ve-ral ti-mes du-ring the scho-ol ye-ar, pul-ling her ha-ir, which was a stre-am of whi-te gold so
bright I co-uld not re-sist it. It is Ralph Pa-ter-son's birth-day and most of the lit-tle kids are spen-ding
the day with him and his dad at The Snow-man's Ca-ve Amu-se-ment Park whe-re they get to do all the
things kids used to do when snow was still sa-fe, li-ke sled-ding, and bu-il-ding snow-men. Li-na
Bre-ed-so-re and Ca-rol Minst-re-et went to the mall with the-ir baby-sit-ter who has a boyf-ri-end who
works at the mo-vie the-at-re and can sne-ak them in to watch mo-vi-es all day long. The town is empty
ex-cept for the baby Whi-te-hall twins, Tri-na Ne-ed-les who is suc-king her thumb and re-ading a
bo-ok on her porch swing, and Bobby, go-ing up and down the stre-et with the Man-mens-vit-zen-der
girls and the-ir go-ats. I sit on my porch pic-king at the scabs on my kne-es but Bobby spe-aks only to
them, in a vo-ice so low I can't he-ar what he says. Fi-nal-ly I stand up and block the-ir way. The go-ats
and cart stut-ter to a stop, the bells still jing-ling as Bobby says, "What's up, We-yers?"
He has eyes so blue, I re-cently dis-co-ve-red, I can-not lo-ok in-to them for mo-re than thirty
se-conds, as tho-ugh they burn me. Ins-te-ad I lo-ok at the girls who are both smi-ling, even the one who
is crying.
"What's yo-ur prob-lem?" I say.
Her dark eyes wi-den, inc-re-asing the po-ol of milky whi-te aro-und them. She lo-oks at Bobby. The
se-qu-ins of her scarf catch the sun. "Jesus Christ, We-yers, what are you tal-king abo-ut?"
"I just wan-ta know," I say still lo-oking at her, "what it is with all this crying all the ti-me, I me-an li-ke
is it a di-se-ase, or what?"
"Oh for Christ's sa-ke." The go-ats' he-ads re-ar, and the bells jing-le. Bobby pulls on the re-igns. The
go-ats step back with clomps and the rat-tle of whe-els but I con-ti-nue to block the-ir path. "What's
yo-ur prob-lem?"
"It's a per-fectly re-aso-nab-le qu-es-ti-on," I sho-ut at his sha-dow aga-inst the bright sun. "I just
wan-ta know what her prob-lem is."
"It's no-ne of yo-ur bu-si-ness," he sho-uts and at the sa-me ti-me the smal-ler girl spe-aks.
"What?" I say to her.
"It's the war, and all the suf-fe-ring."
Bobby holds the go-ats ste-ady. The ot-her girl holds on-to his arm. She smi-les at me but
con-ti-nu-es to we-ep.

"Well, so? Did so-met-hing hap-pen to her?" "It's just how she is. She al-ways cri-es."
"That's stu-pid."
"Oh for Christ's sa-ke, We-yers!"
"You can't cry all the ti-me, that's no way to li-ve."
Bobby ste-ers the go-ats and cart aro-und me. The yo-un-ger girl turns and sta-res at me un-til, at
so-me dis-tan-ce, she wa-ves but I turn away wit-ho-ut wa-ving back.
Before it was aban-do-ned and then oc-cu-pi-ed by the Man-mens-vit-zen-ders the big ho-use on the
hill had be-en ow-ned by the Rich-ters. "Oh, su-re they we-re rich," my fat-her says when 1 tell him I am
re-se-arc-hing a bo-ok. "But you know, we all we-re. You sho-uld ha-ve se-en the ca-kes! And the
ca-ta-logs. We used to get the-se ca-ta-logs in the ma-il and you co-uld buy anyt-hing that way, they'd
ma-il it to you, even ca-ke. We used to get this ca-ta-log, what was it cal-led, Henry and Danny?
So-met-hing li-ke that. Two guys' na-mes. Any-how, when we we-re yo-ung it was just fru-it but then,
when the who-le co-untry was rich you co-uld or-der spon-ge ca-ke with but-terc-re-am, or they had
the-se to-wers of pac-ka-ges they'd send you, fil-led with candy and nuts and co-oki-es, and
cho-co-la-te, and oh my God, right in the ma-il."
"You we-re tel-ling me abo-ut the Rich-ters."
"Terrible thing what hap-pe-ned to them, the who-le fa-mily."
"It was the snow, right?"
"Your brot-her, Ja-ime, that's when we lost him."
"We don't ha-ve to talk abo-ut that."
"Everything chan-ged af-ter that, you know. That's what got yo-ur mot-her star-ted. Most folks just
lost one, so-me not even, but you know tho-se Rich-ters. That big ho-use on the hill and when it
sno-wed they all went sled-ding. The world was dif-fe-rent then."
"I can't ima-gi-ne."
"Well, ne-it-her co-uld we. No-body co-uld of gu-es-sed it. And be-li-eve me, we we-re gu-es-sing.
Ever-yo-ne tri-ed to fi-gu-re what they wo-uld do next. But snow? I me-an how evil is that any-way?"
"How many?"
"Oh, tho-usands. Tho-usands." "No, I me-an how many Rich-ters?"
"All six of them. First the child-ren and then the pa-rents." "Wasn't it unu-su-al for adults to get
in-fec-ted?" "Well, not that many of us pla-yed in the snow the way they did." "So you must ha-ve
sen-sed it, or so-met-hing."
"What? No. We we-re just so busy then. Very busy. I wish I co-uld re-mem-ber. But I can't. What
we we-re so busy with." He rubs his eyes and sta-res out the win-dow. "It wasn't yo-ur fa-ult. I want you
to know I un-ders-tand that."
"Pop."
"I me-an you kids, that's just the world we ga-ve you, so full of evil you didn't even know the
dif-fe-ren-ce."
"We knew, Pop."
"You still don't know. What do you think of when you think of snow?"
"I think of de-ath."
"Well, the-re you ha-ve it. Be-fo-re that hap-pe-ned it me-ant joy. Pe-ace and joy."
"I can t ima-gi-ne."
"Well, that's my po-int."
***
"Are you fe-eling all right?" She dis-hes out the ma-ca-ro-ni, puts the bowl in front of me, and stands,
le-aning aga-inst the co-un-ter, to watch me eat. I shrug.
She pla-ces a cold palm on my fo-re-he-ad. Steps back and frowns. "You didn't eat anyt-hing from
tho-se girls, did you?"

I sha-ke my he-ad. She is just abo-ut to spe-ak when I say, "But the ot-her kids did."
"Who? When?" She le-ans so clo-se that I can see the li-nes of ma-ke-up sharp aga-inst her skin.
"Bobby. So-me of the ot-her kids. They ate candy."
Her hand co-mes palm down, hard, aga-inst the tab-le. The ma-ca-ro-ni bowl jumps, and the
sil-ver-wa-re. So-me milk spills. "Didn't I tell you?" she sho-uts. "Bobby plays with them all the ti-me
now."
She squ-ints at me, sha-kes her he-ad, then snaps her jaw with grim re-sol-ve.
"When? When did they eat this candy?"
"I don't know. Days ago. Not-hing hap-pe-ned. They sa-id it was go-od."
Her mo-uth opens and clo-ses li-ke a fish. She turns on her he-els and grabs the pho-ne as she le-aves
the kitc-hen. The do-or slams. I can see her thro-ugh the win-dow, pa-cing the back-yard, her arms
ges-tu-ring wildly.
My mot-her or-ga-ni-zed the town me-eting and every-body ca-me, dres-sed up li-ke it was church.
The only pe-op-le who we-ren't the-re we-re the Man-mens-vit-zen-ders, for ob-vi-o-us re-asons.
Most pe-op-le bro-ught the-ir kids, even the ba-bi-es who suc-ked thumbs or blan-ket cor-ners. I was
the-re and so was Bobby with his grand-pa who che-wed the stem of a cold pi-pe and kept le-aning
over and whis-pe-ring to his grand-son du-ring the pro-ce-edings, which qu-ickly be-ca-me he-ated,
tho-ugh the-re wasn't much ar-gu-ment, the he-at be-ing fu-eled by just the ge-ne-ral ex-ci-te-ment of it,
my mot-her es-pe-ci-al-ly in her ro-ses dress, her lips pa-in-ted a bright red so that even I ca-me to
so-me un-ders-tan-ding that she had a cer-ta-in be-a-uty tho-ugh I was too yo-ung to un-ders-tand what
abo-ut that be-a-uty wasn't en-ti-rely ple-asing. "We ha-ve to re-mem-ber that we are all sol-di-ers in
this war," she sa-id to much ap-pla-use.
Mr. Smyths sug-ges-ted a sort of ho-use ar-rest but my mot-her po-in-ted out that wo-uld en-ta-il
so-me-one from town brin-ging gro-ce-ri-es to them. "Every-body knows the-se pe-op-le are star-ving.
Who's go-ing to pay for all this bre-ad any-way?" she sa-id. "Why sho-uld we ha-ve to pay for it?"
Mrs. Mat-hers sa-id so-met-hing abo-ut jus-ti-ce.
Mr. Hal-lens-way sa-id, "No one is in-no-cent any-mo-re."
My mot-her, who sto-od at the front of the ro-om, le-aning slightly aga-inst the vil-la-ge bo-ard tab-le,
sa-id, "Then it's de-ci-ded."
Mrs. Fo-ley, who had just mo-ved to town from the re-cently dest-ro-yed Ches-ter-vil-le, sto-od up,
in that way she had of sort of cro-uc-hing in-to her sho-ul-ders, with tho-se eyes that lo-oked aro-und
ner-vo-usly so that so-me of us had sec-retly ta-ken to cal-ling her Bird Wo-man, and with a shaky
vo-ice, so soft ever-yo-ne had to le-an for-ward to he-ar, sa-id, "Are any of the child-ren ac-tu-al-ly
sick?"
The adults lo-oked at each ot-her and each ot-her's child-ren. I co-uld tell that my mot-her was
di-sap-po-in-ted that no one re-por-ted any symptoms. The dis-cus-si-on tur-ned to the bright
co-lo-ured can-di-es when Bobby, wit-ho-ut stan-ding or ra-ising his hand, sa-id in a lo-ud vo-ice, "Is
that what this is abo-ut? Do you me-an the-se?" He le-aned back in his cha-ir to wig-gle his hand in-to
his poc-ket and pul-led out a hand-ful of them.
There was a ge-ne-ral mur-mur. My mot-her grab-bed the ed-ge of the tab-le. Bobby's grand-fat-her,
grin-ning aro-und his dry pi-pe, pluc-ked one of the can-di-es from Bobby's palm, unw-rap-ped it, and
pop-ped it in-to his mo-uth.
Mr. Cal-vin Wright had to use his ga-vel to hush the no-ise. My mot-her sto-od up stra-ight and sa-id,
"Fi-ne thing, ris-king yo-ur own li-fe li-ke that, just to ma-ke a po-int."
"Well, you're right abo-ut ma-king a po-int, May-le-ne," he sa-id, lo-oking right at my mot-her and
sha-king his he-ad as if they we-re ha-ving a pri-va-te dis-cus-si-on, "but this is candy I ke-ep aro-und
the ho-use to get me out of the ha-bit of smo-king. I or-der it thro-ugh the Go-vern-ment Is-sue
ca-ta-log. It's per-fectly sa-fe."
"I ne-ver sa-id it was from them," sa-id Bobby, who lo-oked first at my mot-her and then se-arc-hed
the ro-om un-til he fo-und my fa-ce, but I pre-ten-ded not to no-ti-ce.

When we left, my mot-her to-ok me by the hand, her red fin-ger-na-ils dig-ging in-to my wrist. "Don't
talk," she sa-id, "just don't say anot-her word." She sent me to my ro-om and I fell as-le-ep with my
clot-hes on still for-mu-la-ting my apo-logy.
The next mor-ning when I he-ar the bells, I grab a lo-af of bre-ad and wa-it on the porch un-til they
co-me back up the hill. Then I stand in the-ir path. "Now what d'you want?" Bobby says.
I of-fer the lo-af, li-ke a tiny baby be-ing held up to God in church. The we-eping girl cri-es lo-uder,
her sis-ter clutc-hes Bobby's arm. "What d'you think you're do-ing?" he sho-uts.
"It's a pre-sent."
"What kind of stu-pid pre-sent is that? Put it away! Jesus Christ, wo-uld you put it down?"
My arms drop to my si-des, the lo-af dang-les in its bag from my hand. Both girls are crying. "I just
was trying to be ni-ce," I say, my vo-ice wa-ve-ring li-ke the Bird Wo-man's.
"God, don't you know anyt-hing?" Bobby says. "They're af-ra-id of our fo-od, don't you even know
that?"
"Why?"
"'Cause of the bombs, you idi-ot. Why don't you think on-ce in a whi-le?" "I don't know what you're
tal-king abo-ut."
The go-ats rat-tle the-ir bells and the cart shifts back and forth. "The bombs!
Don't you even re-ad yo-ur his-tory bo-oks? In the be-gin-ning of the war we sent them fo-od
pac-ka-ges all wrap-ped up the sa-me co-lor as the-se bombs that wo-uld go off when so-me-one
to-uc-hed them."
"We did that?"
"Well, our pa-rents did." He sha-kes his he-ad and pulls the re-igns. The cart rat-tles past, both girls
pres-sed aga-inst him as if I am dan-ge-ro-us.
"Oh, we we-re so happy!" my fat-her says, roc-king in-to the me-mory. "We we-re li-ke child-ren,
you know, so in-no-cent, we didn't even know." "Know what, Pop?" "That we had eno-ugh." "Eno-ugh
what?"
"Oh, everyt-hing. We had eno-ugh everyt-hing. Is that a pla-ne?" he lo-oks at me with wa-tery blue
eyes.
"Here, let me help you put yo-ur hel-met on." He slaps at it, bru-ising his fra-gi-le hands. "Qu-it it,
Dad. Stop!"
He fumb-les with arth-ri-tic fin-gers to un-buck-le the strap but finds he can-not. He we-eps in-to his
spot-ted hands. It dro-nes past.
Now that I lo-ok back on how we we-re that sum-mer, be-fo-re the tra-gedy, I get a glim-mer of
what my fat-her's be-en trying to say all along. It isn't re-al-ly abo-ut the ca-kes, and the ma-il or-der
ca-ta-logs, or the air tra-vel they used to ta-ke. Even tho-ugh he uses stuff to desc-ri-be it that's not what
he me-ans. On-ce the-re was a dif-fe-rent emo-ti-on. Pe-op-le used to ha-ve a way of fe-eling and
be-ing in the world that is go-ne, dest-ro-yed so tho-ro-ughly we in-he-ri-ted only its ab-sen-ce.
"Sometimes," I tell my hus-band, "I won-der if my hap-pi-ness is re-al-ly hap-pi-ness."
"Of co-ur-se it's re-al-ly hap-pi-ness," he says, "what el-se wo-uld it be?"
We we-re un-der at-tack is how it felt. The Man-mens-vit-zen-ders with the-ir te-ars and fe-ar of
bre-ad, the-ir stran-ge clot-hes and stinky go-ats we-re child-ren li-ke us and we co-uld not get the town
me-eting out of our he-ads, what the adults had con-si-de-red do-ing. We clim-bed tre-es, cha-sed
balls, ca-me ho-me when cal-led, brus-hed our te-eth when told, fi-nis-hed our milk, but we had lost that
fe-eling we'd had be-fo-re. It is true we didn't un-ders-tand what had be-en ta-ken from us, but we
knew what we had be-en gi-ven and who had do-ne the gi-ving.
We didn't call a me-eting the way they did. Ours just hap-pe-ned on a day so hot we sat in Tri-na
Ne-ed-les's play-ho-use fan-ning our-sel-ves with our hands and comp-la-ining abo-ut the we-at-her
li-ke the grow-nups. We men-ti-oned ho-use ar-rest but that se-emed im-pos-sib-le to en-for-ce. We

dis-cus-sed things li-ke wa-ter bal-lo-ons, T.P.ing. So-me-one men-ti-oned dog shit in brown pa-per
bags set on fi-re. I think that's when the dis-cus-si-on tur-ned the way it did.
You may ask, who loc-ked the do-or? Who ma-de the stick pi-les? Who lit the matc-hes? We all did.
And if I am to find so-la-ce, twenty-fi-ve ye-ars af-ter I dest-ro-yed all abi-lity to fe-el that my
hap-pi-ness, or an-yo-ne's, re-al-ly exists, I find it in this. It was all of us.
Maybe the-re will be no mo-re town me-etings. May-be this plan is li-ke the ones we've ma-de
be-fo-re. But a town me-eting is cal-led. The grow-nups as-semb-le to dis-cuss how we will not be
ru-led by evil, and al-so, the pos-si-bi-lity of wi-de-ning Ma-in Stre-et. No-body no-ti-ces when we
child-ren sne-ak out. We had to le-ave be-hind the ba-bi-es, suc-king thumbs or blan-ket cor-ners and
not re-al-ly part of our plan for re-demp-ti-on. We we-re child-ren. It wasn't well tho-ught out.
When the po-li-ce ca-me we we-re not "ca-re-ening in so-me wild imi-ta-ti-on of bar-ba-ric dan-ce"
or ha-ving se-izu-res as has be-en re-por-ted. I can still see Bobby, his ha-ir damp aga-inst his
fo-re-he-ad, the bright red of his che-eks as he dan-ced be-ne-ath the whi-te (la-kes that fell from a sky
we ne-ver trus-ted; Tri-na spin-ning in circ-les, her arms stretc-hed wi-de, and the
Man-mens-vit-zen-der girls with the-ir go-ats and cart pi-led high with roc-king cha-irs, ri-ding away
from us, the jing-le bells rin-ging, just li-ke in the old song. On-ce aga-in the world was sa-fe and
be-a-uti-ful. Ex-cept by the town hall whe-re the lar-ge whi-te fla-kes ro-se li-ke ghosts and the fla-mes
ate the sky li-ke a hungry mons-ter who co-uld ne-ver get eno-ugh.

V - JONATHAN LETHEM - HOW WE GOT IN TOWN AND OUT AGAIN
When we first saw so-me-body ne-ar the mall Glo-ria and I lo-oked aro-und for sticks. We we-re
go-ing to rob them if they we-re few eno-ugh. The mall was abo-ut fi-ve mi-les out of the town we we-re
he-aded for, so no-body wo-uld know. But when we got clo-ser Glo-ria saw the-ir vans and sa-id they
we-re sca-pers. I didn't know what that was, but she told me.
It was sum-mer. Two days be-fo-re this Glo-ria and I had bro-ken out of a pack of pe-op-le that had
fo-od but we co-uldn't stand the-ir re-li-gi-o-us chan-ting any-mo-re. We hadn't eaten sin-ce then.
"So what do we do?" I sa-id.
"You let me talk " sa-id Glo-ria.
"You think we co-uld get in-to town with them?" "Bet-ter than that," she sa-id. "Just ke-ep qu-i-et."
I drop-ped the pi-ece of pi-pe I'd fo-und and we wal-ked in ac-ross the par-king lot. This mall was
long past be-ing go-od for fin-ding fo-od any-mo-re but the sca-pers we-re ta-king out fol-ding cha-irs
from a sto-re and strap-ping them on top of the-ir vans. The-re we-re fo-ur men and one wo-man.
"Hey" sa-id Glo-ria.
Two guys we-re just lugs and they ig-no-red us and kept lug-ging. The wo-man was sit-ting in the
front of the van. She was smo-king a ci-ga-ret-te.
The ot-her two guys tur-ned. This was Kro-mer and Fe-aring, but I didn't know the-ir na-mes yet.
"Beat it," sa-id Kro-mer. He was a tall squ-inty guy with a gold to-oth. He was kind of worn but the
to-oth sa-id he'd ne-ver lost a fight or slept in a flop. "We're busy," he sa-id.
He was be-ing re-aso-nab-le. If you we-ren't in a town you we-re now-he-re. Why talk to so-me-one
you met now-he-re?
But the ot-her guy smi-led at Glo-ria. He had a thin fa-ce and a lit-tle mus-tac-he. "Who are you?" he
sa-id. He didn't lo-ok at me.
"I know what you guys do," Glo-ria sa-id. "I was in one be-fo-re."
"Oh?" sa-id the guy, still smi-ling.
"You're go-ing to ne-ed con-tes-tants," she sa-id.
"She's a fast one," this guy sa-id to the ot-her guy. I'm Fe-aring," he sa-id to Glo-ria.
"Fearing what?" sa-id Glo-ria. "Just Fe-aring."
"Well, I'm just Glo-ria."

"That's fi-ne," sa-id Fe-aring. "This is Tommy Kro-mer. We run this thing. What's yo-ur lit-tle fri-end's
na-me?"
"I can say my own na-me," I sa-id. "I'm Le-wis." "Are you from the lo-vely town up ahe-ad?"
"No-pe," sa-id Glo-ria. "We're he-aded the-re." "Get-ting in exactly how?" sa-id Fe-aring.
"Anyhow," sa-id Glo-ria, li-ke it was an ans-wer. "With you, now." "That's as-su-ming so-met-hing
pretty qu-ick."
"Or we co-uld go and say how you rip-ped off the last town and they sent us to warn abo-ut you,"
sa-id Glo-ria.
"Fast," sa-id Fe-aring aga-in, grin-ning, and Kro-mer sho-ok his he-ad. They didn't lo-ok too
wor-ri-ed.
"You ought to want me along," sa-id Glo-ria. "I'm an at-trac-ti-on."
"Can't hurt," sa-id Fe-aring.
Kromer shrug-ged, and sa-id, "Skinny, for an at-trac-ti-on."
"Sure, I'm skinny," she sa-id. "That's why me and Le-wis ought to get so-met-hing to eat."
Fearing sta-red at her. Kro-mer was back to the van with the ot-her guys.
"Or if you can't fe-ed us-" star-ted Glo-ria. "Hold it, swe-et-he-art. No mo-re thre-ats." "We ne-ed a
me-al."
"We'll eat so-met-hing when we get in." Fe-aring sa-id. "You and Le-wis can get a me-al if you're
both plan-ning to en-ter."
"Sure," she sa-id. "We're gon-na en-ter-right, Le-wis?" I knew to say right.
The town mi-li-tia ca-me out to me-et the vans, of co-ur-se. But they se-emed to know the sca-pers
we-re co-ming, and af-ter Fe-aring tal-ked to them for a co-up-le of mi-nu-tes they ope-ned up the
do-ors and had a qu-ick lo-ok then wa-ved us thro-ugh. Glo-ria and I we-re in the back of a van with a
bunch of equ-ip-ment and one of the lugs, na-med Ed. Kro-mer dro-ve. Fe-aring dro-ve the van with the
wo-man in it. The ot-her lug dro-ve the last one alo-ne.
I'd ne-ver got-ten in-to a town in a van be-fo-re, but I'd only got-ten in two ti-mes be-fo-re this
any-way. The first ti-me by myself, just by cre-eping in, the se-cond be-ca-use Glo-ria went with a
mi-li-tia guy.
Towns we-ren't so gre-at any-way. May-be this wo-uld be dif-fe-rent.
We dro-ve a few blocks and a guy flag-ged Fe-aring down. He ca-me up to the win-dow of the van
and they tal-ked, then went back to his car, wa-ving at Kro-mer on his way. Then we fol-lo-wed him.
"What's that abo-ut?" sa-id Glo-ria.
"Gilmartin's the ad-van-ce man." sa-id Kro-mer. "I tho-ught you knew everyt-hing,"
Gloria didn't talk. I sa-id, "What's an ad-van-ce man?"
"Gets us a pla-ce, and the ju-ice we ne-ed," sa-id Kro-mer. "Sof-tens the town up. Gets pe-op-le
ex-ci-ted."
It was get-ting dark. I was pretty hungry, but I didn't say anyt-hing. Gil-mar-tin's car led us to this big
bu-il-ding sha-ped li-ke a bo-at-ho-use only it wasn't ne-ar any wa-ter. Kro-mer sa-id it used to be a
bow-ling al-ley.
The lugs star-ted mo-ving stuff and Kro-mer ma-de me help. The bu-il-ding was dusty and empty
in-si-de, and so-me of the lights didn't work. Kro-mer sa-id just to get things in-si-de for now. He
dro-ve away one of the vans and ca-me back and we un-lo-aded a bunch of lit-tle cots that Gil-mar-tin
the ad-van-ce man had ren-ted, so I had an idea whe-re I was go-ing to be sle-eping. Apart from that it
was stuff for the con-test. Com-pu-ter cab-les and plas-tic spa-ce-su-its, and lo-ads of te-le-vi-si-ons.
Fearing to-ok Glo-ria and they ca-me back with fo-od, fri-ed chic-ken and po-ta-to sa-lad, and we
all ate. I co-uldn't stop go-ing back for mo-re but no-body sa-id anyt-hing. Then I went to sle-ep on a
cot. No one was tal-king to me. Glo-ria wasn't sle-eping on a cot. I think she was with Fe-aring.
Gilmartin the ad-van-ce man had re-al-ly do-ne his work. The town was snif-fing aro-und first thing in
the mor-ning. Fe-aring was out tal-king to them when I wo-ke up. "Re-gist-ra-ti-on be-gins at no-on, not

a mi-nu-te so-oner," he was sa-ying. "Be-at the li-nes and stick aro-und. We'll be ser-ving cof-fee. Be
war-ned, only the fit ne-ed ap-ply-our doc-tor will be exa-mi-ning you, and he's ne-ver be-en fo-oled
on-ce. It's Dar-wi-ni-an lo-gic, pe-op-le. The fu-tu-re is for the strong. The me-ek will ha-ve to in-he-rit
the he-re and now."
Inside, Ed and the ot-her guy we-re set-ting up the ge-ar. They had abo-ut thirty of tho-se wi-red-up
plas-tic su-its stretc-hed out in the mid-dle of the pla-ce, and so tang-led up with cab-le and lit-tle wi-res
that they we-re li-ke husks of fly bo-di-es in a spi-der web.
Under each of the su-its was a light me-tal fra-me, sort of li-ke a bicyc-le with a se-at but no whe-els,
but with a he-ad-rest too. Aro-und the web they we-re set-ting up the te-le-vi-si-ons in an arc fa-cing the
se-ats. The su-its each had a num-ber on the back, and the te-le-vi-si-ons had num-bers on top that
matc-hed.
When Glo-ria tur-ned up she didn't say anyt-hing to me but she han-ded me so-me do-nuts and
cof-fee.
"This is just the start," she sa-id, when she saw my eyes get big. "We're in for three squ-ares a day as
long as this thing lasts. As long as we last, any-way."
We sat and ate out-si-de whe-re we co-uld lis-ten to Fe-aring. He went on and on. So-me pe-op-le
we-re li-ned up li-ke he sa-id. I didn't bla-me them sin-ce Fe-aring was such a tal-ker. Ot-hers lis-te-ned
and just got ner-vo-us or ex-ci-ted and went away, but I co-uld tell they we-re co-ming back la-ter, at
le-ast to watch. When we fi-nis-hed the do-nuts Fe-aring ca-me over and told us to get on li-ne too.
"We don't ha-ve to," sa-id Glo-ria.
"Yes, you do," sa-id Fe-aring.
On li-ne we met La-ne. She sa-id she was twenty li-ke Glo-ria but she lo-oked yo-un-ger. She co-uld
ha-ve be-en six-te-en, li-ke me. "You ever do this be-fo-re?" as-ked Glo-ria. La-ne sho-ok her he-ad.
"You?"
"Sure," sa-id Glo-ria. "You ever be-en out of this town?"
"A co-up-le of ti-mes," sa-id La-ne. "When I was a kid. I'd li-ke to now."
"Why?"
"I bro-ke up with my boyf-ri-end."
Gloria stuck out her lip, and sa-id, "But you're sca-red to le-ave town, so you're do-ing this ins-te-ad."
La-ne shrug-ged. I li-ked her, but Glo-ria didn't.
The doc-tor tur-ned out to be Gil-mar-tin the ad-van-ce man. I don't think he was a re-al doc-tor, but
he lis-te-ned to my he-art. No-body ever did that be-fo-re, and it ga-ve me a go-od fe-eling.
Registration was a joke, tho-ugh. It was for show. They as-ked a lot of qu-es-ti-ons but they only sent
a co-up-le of-wo-men and one guy away, Glo-ria sa-id for be-ing too old. Ever-yo-ne el-se was okay,
des-pi-te how so-me of them lo-oked pretty hungry, just li-ke me and Glo-ria. This was a hungry town.
La-ter I fi-gu-red out that's part of why Fe-aring and Kro-mer pic-ked it. You'd think they'd want to go
whe-re the mo-ney was, but you'd be wrong.
After re-gist-ra-ti-on they told us to get lost for the af-ter-no-on. Everyt-hing star-ted at eight o'clock.
We wal-ked aro-und down-town but al-most all the shops we-re clo-sed. All the go-od stuff was in
the shop-ping cen-ter and you had to show a town ID card to get in and me and Glo-ria didn't ha-ve
tho-se.
So, li-ke Glo-ria al-ways says, we kil-led ti-me sin-ce ti-me was what we had.
The pla-ce lo-oked dif-fe-rent. They had spot-lights po-in-ted from on top of the vans and Fe-aring
was tal-king thro-ugh a mic-rop-ho-ne. The-re was a ban-ner up over the do-ors. I as-ked Glo-ria and
she sa-id, "Sca-pe At-hon." Ed was sel-ling be-er out of a co-oler and so-me pe-op-le we-re bu-ying,
even tho-ugh he must ha-ve just bo-ught it right the-re in town for half the pri-ce he was sel-ling at. It was
a hot night. They we-re sel-ling tic-kets but they we-ren't let-ting any-body in yet. Fe-aring told us to get
in-si-de.
Most of the con-tes-tants we-re the-re al-re-ady. An-ne, the wo-man from the van, was the-re,

ac-ting li-ke any ot-her con-tes-tant. La-ne was the-re too and we wa-ved at each ot-her. Gil-mar-tin
was hel-ping every-body put on the su-its. You had to get na-ked but no-body se-emed to mind. Just
be-ing con-tes-tants ma-de it all right, li-ke we we-re in-vi-sib-le to each ot-her.
"Can we be next to each ot-her?" I sa-id to Glo-ria.
"Sure, ex-cept it do-esn't mat-ter," she sa-id. "We won't be ab-le to see each ot-her in-si-de."
"Inside whe-re?" I sa-id.
"The sca-pes," she sa-id. "You'll see."
Gloria got me in-to my su-it. It was plas-tic with wi-ring everyw-he-re and pad-ding at my kne-es and
wrists and el-bows and un-der my arms and in my crotch. I tri-ed on the mask but it was he-avy and I
saw no-body el-se was we-aring the-irs so I kept it off un-til I had to. Then Gil-mar-tin tri-ed to help
Glo-ria but she sa-id she co-uld do it her-self.
So the-re we we-re, stan-ding aro-und half na-ked and drip-ping with cab-le in the big empty lit-up
bow-ling al-ley, and then sud-denly Fe-aring and his big vo-ice ca-me in-si-de and they let the pe-op-le
in and the lights went down and it all star-ted.
"Thirty-two yo-ung so-uls re-ady to swim out of this world, in-to the bright shiny fu-tu-re," went
Fe-aring. "The qu-es-ti-on is, how far in-to that fu-tu-re will the-ir bo-di-es ta-ke them? New worlds are
the-irs for the ta-king-a cor-nu-co-pia of sca-pes to bog-gle and ama-ze and gra-tify the sen-ses. The-se
lucky kids will be im-mer-sed in an oce-an of da-ta overw-hel-ming to the-ir un-der-no-uris-hed
sen-si-bi-li-ti-es-we've as-semb-led a re-al-ly bril-li-ant col-lec-ti-on of en-vi-ron-ments for them to
exp-lo-re-and you'll be ab-le to see everyt-hing they see, on the mo-ni-tors in front of you. But can they
ma-ke it in the fast la-ne? How long can they ri-de the wa-ve? Which of them will pro-ve ab-le to
out-last the ot-hers, and ta-ke ho-me the big pri-ze-one tho-usand dol-lars? That's what we're he-re to
find out."
Gilmartin and Ed we-re snap-ping every-body in-to the-ir masks and tur-ning all the switc-hes to
wi-re us up and get-ting us to lie down on the fra-mes. It was com-for-tab-le on the bicyc-le se-at with
yo-ur he-ad on the he-ad-rest and a belt aro-und yo-ur wa-ist. You co-uld mo-ve yo-ur arms and legs
li-ke you we-re swim-ming, the way Fe-aring sa-id. I didn't mind put-ting on the mask now be-ca-use
the audi-en-ce was ma-king me ner-vo-us. A lot of them I co-uldn't see be-ca-use of the lights, but I
co-uld tell they we-re the-re, watc-hing.
The mask co-ve-red my ears and eyes. Aro-und my chin the-re was a strip of wi-re and ta-pe.
In-si-de it was dark and qu-i-et at first ex-cept Fe-aring's vo-ice was still co-ming in-to the earp-ho-nes.
"The ru-les are simp-le. Our con-tes-tants get a thirty-mi-nu-te rest pe-ri-od every three ho-urs.
The-se kids'll be well fed, don't worry abo-ut that. Our doc-tor will mo-ni-tor the-ir he-alth. You've
he-ard the hor-ror sto-ri-es, but we're a class out-fit: you'll see no hor-rors he-re. The kids earn the
qu-ality ca-re we pro-vi-de one way: con-ti-nu-o-us, wa-king en-ga-ge-ment with the da-ta stre-am.
We're firm on that. To sle-ep is to die-you can sle-ep on yo-ur own ti-me, but not ours. One lap-se, and
you're out of the ga-me, them's the ru-les."
The earp-ho-nes star-ted to hum. I wis-hed I co-uld re-ach out and hold Glo-ria's hand, but she was
too far away.
"They'll ha-ve no help from the flo-or jud-ges, or one anot-her, in lo-ca-ting the per-cep-tu-al ric-hes
of cybers-pa-ce. So-me will dis-co-ver the keys that open the do-ors to a tho-usand worlds, ot-hers will
bog down in the an-tec-ham-ber to the fu-tu-re. An-yo-ne ca-ught co-ac-hing du-ring rest pe-ri-ods will
be dis-qu-ali-fi-ed-no war-nings, no se-cond chan-ces."
Then Fe-aring's vo-ice drop-ped out, and the sca-pes star-ted.
I was in a hal-lway. The walls we-re full of dra-wers, li-ke a big ca-bi-net that went on fo-re-ver. The
dra-wers had wri-ting on them that I ig-no-red. First I co-uldn't mo-ve ex-cept my he-ad, then I
fi-gu-red out how to walk, and just did that for a whi-le. But I ne-ver got anyw-he-re. It felt li-ke I was
wal-king in a gi-ant circ-le, up the wall, ac-ross the ce-iling, and then back down the ot-her wall.
So I pul-led open a dra-wer. It only lo-oked big eno-ugh to hold so-me pen-cils or wha-te-ver but
when I pul-led, it ope-ned li-ke a do-or and I went thro-ugh.

"Welcome to In-ten-se Per-so-nals," sa-id a vo-ice. The-re we-re just so-me co-lo-urs to lo-ok at.
The do-or clo-sed be-hind me. "You must be eigh-te-en ye-ars of age or ol-der to use this ser-vi-ce. To
avo-id any char-ges, ple-ase exit now."
I didn't exit be-ca-use I didn't know how. The spa-ce with co-lo-urs was kind of small ex-cept it
didn't ha-ve any ed-ges. But it felt small.
"This is the ma-in me-nu. Ple-ase re-ach out and ma-ke one of the fol-lo-wing se-lec-ti-ons: wo-men
se-eking men, men se-eking wo-men, wo-men se-eking wo-men, men se-eking men, or al-ter-na-ti-ves."
Each of them was a block of words in the air. I re-ac-hed up and to-uc-hed the first one.
"After each se-lec-ti-on to-uch one to play the re-cor-ding aga-in, two to re-cord a mes-sa-ge for this
per-son, or three to ad-van-ce to the next se-lec-ti-on. You may to-uch three at any ti-me to ad-van-ce
to the next se-lec-ti-on, or fo-ur to re-turn to the ma-in me-nu."
Then a wo-man ca-me in-to the co-lo-ured spa-ce with me. She was dres-sed up and we-aring
lips-tick.
"Hi, my na-me is Ka-te," she sa-id. She sta-red li-ke she was lo-oking thro-ugh my he-ad at
so-met-hing be-hind me and po-ked at her ha-ir whi-le she tal-ked. "I li-ve in San Fran-cis-co. I work in
the fi-nan-ci-al dist-rict, as a per-son-nel ma-na-ger, but my re-al lo-ve is the arts, cur-rently pa-in-ting
and wri-ting-"
"How did you get in-to San Fran-cis-co?" I sa-id.
"-just bo-ught a new pa-ir of hi-king bo-ots and I'm ho-ping to tack-le Mo-unt Tarn this we-ekend,"
she sa-id, ig-no-ring me. "I ne-ver met an-yo-ne from the-re," I sa-id.
"-looking for a man who's not in-ti-mi-da-ted by in-tel-li-gen-ce," she went on. "It's im-por-tant that
you li-ke what you do, li-ke whe-re you are. I al-so want so-me-one who's con-fi-dent eno-ugh that I
can exp-ress my vul-ne-ra-bi-lity. You sho-uld be a go-od lis-te-ner-"
I to-uc-hed three. I can re-ad num-bers.
Another wo-man ca-me in, just li-ke that. This one was as yo-ung as Glo-ria, but kind of
soft-lo-oking.
"I con-ti-nue to ask myself why in the heck I'm do-ing this per-so-nals thing," she sa-id, sig-hing. "But
I know the re-ason-I want to da-te. I'm new to the San Fran-cis-co area. I li-ke to go to the the-at-re,
but I'm re-al-ly open-min-ded. I was born and ra-ised in Chi-ca-go, so I think I'm a lit-tle mo-re east
co-ast than west. I'm fast-tal-king and cyni-cal. I gu-ess I'm get-ting a lit-tle cyni-cal abo-ut the-se ads,
the sky has yet to part, light-ning has yet to stri-ke-"
I got rid of her, now that I knew how.
"-I ha-ve my own gar-den and lands-ca-pe bu-si-ness-"
"-someone who's fun, not nerdy-"
"-I'm ten-der, I'm sen-su-o-us-"
I star-ted to won-der how long ago the-se wo-men we-re from. I didn't li-ke the way they we-re
ma-king me fe-el, sort of gu-ilty and bul-li-ed at the sa-me ti-me. I didn't think I co-uld ma-ke any of
them happy the way they we-re ho-ping but I didn't think I was go-ing to get a chan-ce to try, any-way.
It to-ok pretty long for me to get back out in-to the hal-lway. From then on I pa-id mo-re at-ten-ti-on
to how I got in-to things.
The next dra-wer I got in-to was just abo-ut the op-po-si-te. All spa-ce and no pe-op-le. I was
dri-ving an airp-la-ne over al-most the who-le world, as far as I co-uld tell. The-re was a row of di-als
and switc-hes un-der the win-dows but it didn't me-an anyt-hing to me. First I was in the mo-un-ta-ins
and I cras-hed a lot, and that was dull be-ca-use a vo-ice wo-uld lec-tu-re me be-fo-re I co-uld start
aga-in, and I had to wa-it. But then I got to the de-sert and I kept it up wit-ho-ut cras-hing much. I just
le-ar-ned to say "no" whe-ne-ver the vo-ice sug-ges-ted so-met-hing dif-fe-rent li-ke "enga-ge tar-get"
or "eva-si-ve ac-ti-on." I wan-ted to fly aw-hi-le, that's all. The de-sert lo-oked go-od from up the-re,
even tho-ugh I'd be-en wal-king aro-und in de-serts too of-ten.
Except that I had to pee I co-uld ha-ve do-ne that fo-re-ver. Fe-aring's vo-ice bro-ke in, tho-ugh, and
sa-id it was ti-me for the first rest pe-ri-od.

"-still fresh and eager af-ter the-ir first plun-ge in-to the won-ders of the fu-tu-re," Fe-aring was
sa-ying to the pe-op-le in the se-ats. The pla-ce was only half full. "Alre-ady this world se-ems drab by
com-pa-ri-son. Yet, con-si-der the irony, that as the-ir qu-es-ting minds grow ac-cus-to-med to the-se
splen-dors, the-ir bo-di-es will be-gin to re-bel-"
Gloria sho-wed me how to uns-nap the cab-les so I co-uld walk out of the mid-dle of all that stuff still
we-aring the su-it, le-aving the mask be-hind. Every-body li-ned up for the bath-ro-om. Then we went to
the big hall in the back whe-re they had the cots, but no-body went to sle-ep or anyt-hing. I gu-es-sed
we'd all want to next ti-me, but right now I was too ex-ci-ted and so was every-body el-se. Fe-aring just
kept tal-king li-ke us ta-king a bre-ak was as much a part of the show as anyt-hing el-se.
"Splendors, hah," sa-id Glo-ria. "Bunch of se-cond-hand cybe-rj-unk."
"I was in a pla-ne," I star-ted.
"Shut up," sa-id Glo-ria. "We're not sup-po-sed to talk abo-ut it. Only, if you find so-met-hing you
li-ke, re-mem-ber whe-re it is." I hadn't do-ne that, but I wasn't wor-ri-ed. "Drink so-me wa-ter," she
sa-id. "And get so-me fo-od."
They we-re go-ing aro-und with sand-wic-hes and I got a co-up-le, one for Glo-ria.
But she didn't se-em to want to talk.
Gilmartin the fa-ke doc-tor was ma-king a big de-al of go-ing aro-und chec-king every-body even
tho-ugh it was only the first bre-ak. I fi-gu-red that the who-le po-int of ta-king ca-re of us so hard was
to re-mind the pe-op-le in the se-ats that they might see so-me-body get hurt.
Ed was gi-ving out ap-ples from a bag. I to-ok one and went over and sat on La-ne's cot. She
lo-oked ni-ce in her su-it.
"My boyf-ri-end's he-re," she sa-id.
"You're back to-get-her?"
"I me-an ex-. I'm pre-ten-ding I didn't see him."
"Where?"
"He's sit-ting right in front of my mo-ni-tor." She tip-ped her he-ad to po-int. I didn't say anyt-hing but
I wis-hed I had so-me-body watc-hing me from the audi-en-ce.
When I went back the first thing I got in-to was a lib-rary of bo-oks. Every one you to-ok off the shelf
tur-ned in-to a show, with charts and pic-tu-res, but when I fi-gu-red out that it was all bu-si-ness stuff
abo-ut how to ma-na-ge yo-ur mo-ney, I got bo-red.
Then I went in-to a dun-ge-on. It star-ted with a wi-zard gro-wing me up from a bug. We we-re in his
works-hop, which was all full of jars and cob-webs. He had a fa-ce li-ke a mel-ted cand-le and he
tal-ked as much as Fe-aring. The-re we-re bats flying aro-und.
"You must re-su-me the qu-est of Kroyd-he sa-id to me and star-ted to-uc-hing me with his stick. I
co-uld see my arms and legs, but they we-ren't we-aring the sca-per su-it. They we-re co-ve-red with
musc-les. When the wi-zard to-uc-hed me I got a sword and a shi-eld. "The-se are yo-ur
com-pa-ni-ons, Rip and Bat-ter," sa-id the wi-zard. "They will obey you and pro-tect you. You must
ne-ver bet-ray them for any ot-her. That was Kroyd's mis-ta-ke."
"Okay," I sa-id.
The wi-zard sent me in-to the dun-ge-on and Rip and Bat-ter tal-ked to me. They told me what to do.
They so-un-ded a lot li-ke the wi-zard.
We met a Worm-li-on. That's what Rip and Bat-ter cal-led it. It had a he-ad full of worms with lit-tle
fa-ces and Rip and Bat-ter sa-id to kill it, which wasn't hard. The he-ad exp-lo-ded and all the worms
star-ted run-ning away in-to the sto-nes of the flo-or li-ke wa-ter.
Then we met a wo-man in sexy clot-hes who was hol-ding a sword and shi-eld too. Hers we-re
lo-aded with jewels and lo-oked a lot ni-cer than Rip and Bat-ter. This was Kroyd's mis-ta-ke, an-yo-ne
co-uld see that. Only I fi-gu-red Kroyd wasn't he-re and I was, and so may-be his mis-ta-ke was one I
wan-ted to ma-ke too.
Rip and Bat-ter star-ted scre-aming when I tra-ded with the wo-man, and then she put them on and
we fo-ught. When she kil-led me I was back in the do-or-way to the wi-zard's ro-om, whe-re I first ran

in, bug-si-zed. This ti-me I went the ot-her way, back to the dra-wers.
Which is when I met the snow-man.
I was lo-oking aro-und in a dra-wer that didn't se-em to ha-ve anyt-hing in it. Everyt-hing was just
black. Then I saw a lit-tle blin-king list of num-bers in the cor-ner. I to-uc-hed the num-bers. No-ne of
them did anyt-hing ex-cept one.
It was still black but the-re we-re fi-ve pic-tu-res of a snow-man. He was three balls of whi-te, mo-re
li-ke plas-tic than snow. His eyes we-re just o's and his mo-uth didn't mo-ve right when he tal-ked. His
arms we-re sticks but they bent li-ke rub-ber. The-re we-re two pic-tu-res of him small and far away,
one from un-der-ne-ath li-ke he was on a hill and one that sho-wed the top of his he-ad, li-ke he was in a
ho-le. Then the-re was a big one of just his he-ad, and a big one of his who-le body. The last one was of
him lo-oking in thro-ugh a win-dow, only you co-uldn't see the win-dow, just the way it cut off part of
the snow-man.
"What's yo-ur na-me?" he sa-id.
"Lewis."
"I'm Mr. Sne-eze." His he-ad and arms mo-ved in all fi-ve pic-tu-res when he tal-ked. His eyes got
big and small. "What's this pla-ce you're in?"
"It's no pla-ce," sa-id Mr. Sne-eze. "Just a gar-ba-ge fi-le." "Why do you li-ve in a gar-ba-ge fi-le?"
"Copyright law-yers," sa-id Mr. Sne-eze. "I ma-de them ner-vo-us." He so-un-ded happy no mat-ter
what he was sa-ying.
"Nervous abo-ut what?"
"I was in a Christ-mas spe-ci-al for in-te-rac-ti-ve te-le-vi-si-on. But at the last mi-nu-te so-me-body
from the le-gal de-part-ment tho-ught I lo-oked too much li-ke a snow-man on a vi-deo ga-me cal-led
Mud Flin-ger. It was too la-te to re-de-sign me so they just cut me out and dum-ped me in this fi-le."
"Can t you go so-mew-he-re el-se?"
"I don't ha-ve too much mo-bi-lity." He jum-ped and twir-led up-si-de down and lan-ded in the sa-me
pla-ce, fi-ve ti-mes at on-ce. The one wit-ho-ut a body spun too. "Do you miss the show?"
"I just ho-pe they're do-ing well. Every-body has be-en wor-king so hard. I didn't want to tell him it
was pro-bably a long ti-me ago. "What are you do-ing he-re, Le-wis?" sa-id Mr. Sne-eze. "I'm in a
Sca-pe At-hon."
"What's that?"
I told him abo-ut Glo-ria and Fe-aring and Kro-mer, and abo-ut the con-test. I think he li-ked that he
was on te-le-vi-si-on aga-in.
There we-ren't too many pe-op-le left in the se-ats. Fe-aring was tal-king to them abo-ut what was
go-ing to hap-pen to-mor-row when they ca-me back. Kro-mer and Ed got us all in the back. I lo-oked
over at La-ne's cot. She was al-re-ady as-le-ep. Her boyf-ri-end was go-ne from the cha-ir out front.
I lay down on the cot be-si-de Glo-ria. "I'm ti-red now," I sa-id.
"So sle-ep a lit-tle," she sa-id, and put her arm over me. But I co-uld he-ar Fe-aring out-si-de tal-king
abo-ut a "Se-xat-hon" and I as-ked Glo-ria what it was.
"That's to-mor-row night," she sa-id. "Don't worry abo-ut it now." Glo-ria wasn't go-ing to sle-ep, just
lo-oking aro-und.
I fo-und the Smart-Ho-use Show-ro-om. It was a ho-use with a vo-ice in-si-de. At first I was
lo-oking aro-und to see who the vo-ice was but then I fi-gu-red out it was the ho-use.
"Answer the pho-ne!" it sa-id. The pho-ne was rin-ging.
I pic-ked up the pho-ne, and the lights in the ro-om chan-ged to a desk light on the tab-le with the
pho-ne. The mu-sic in the ro-om tur-ned off. "How's that for res-pon-si-ve-ness?" "Fi-ne," I sa-id. I hung
up the pho-ne.
There was a te-le-vi-si-on in the ro-om, and it tur-ned on. It was a pic-tu-re of fo-od.
"See that?"
"The fo-od, you me-an?" I sa-id.

"That's the con-tents of yo-ur ref-ri-ge-ra-tor!" it sa-id. "The pac-ka-ges with the blue ha-lo will go
bad in the next twenty-fo-ur ho-urs. The pac-ka-ge with the black ha-lo has al-re-ady ex-pi-red!
Wo-uld you li-ke me to dis-po-se of it for you?"
"Sure."
"Now lo-ok out the win-dows!"
I lo-oked. The-re we-re mo-un-ta-ins out-si-de.
"Imagine wa-king up in the Alps every mor-ning!"
"And when you're re-ady for work, yo-ur car is al-re-ady warm in the ga-ra-ge!"
The win-dows switc-hed from the mo-un-ta-ins to a pic-tu-re of a car in a ga-ra-ge.
"And yo-ur vo-ice-ma-il tells cal-lers that you're not ho-me when it sen-ses the car is go-ne from the
ga-ra-ge!"
I won-de-red if the-re was so-mew-he-re I co-uld get if I went down to dri-ve the car. But they
we-re trying to sell me this ho-use, so pro-bably not.
"And the te-le-vi-si-on no-ti-fi-es you when the bo-ok you're re-ading is ava-ilab-le this we-ek as a
mo-vie!"
The te-le-vi-si-on switc-hed to a mo-vie, the win-dow cur-ta-ins clo-sed, and the light by the pho-ne
went off. "I can't re-ad," I sa-id.
"All the mo-re im-por-tant, then, isn't it?" sa-id the ho-use. "What abo-ut the bed-ro-om?" I sa-id. I
was thin-king abo-ut sle-ep. "He-re you go!" A do-or ope-ned and I went in. The bed-ro-om had
anot-her te-le-vi-si-on. But the bed wasn't right. It had a scrib-ble of elect-ro-nic stuff over it. "What's
wrong with the bed?" "So-me-body de-fa-ced it," sa-id the ho-use. "Pity."
I knew it must ha-ve be-en Fe-aring or Kro-mer who wrec-ked the bed be-ca-use they didn't want
an-yo-ne get-ting that com-for-tab-le and fal-ling as-le-ep and out of the con-test. At le-ast not yet.
"Sorry!" sa-id the ho-use. "Let me show you the work cent-re!"
Next rest I got right in-to Glo-ria's cot and cur-led up and she cur-led aro-und me. It was re-al early
in the mor-ning and no-body was watc-hing the show now and Fe-aring wasn't tal-king. I think he was
off ta-king a nap of his own.
Kromer wo-ke us up. "He al-ways ha-ve to sle-ep with you, li-ke a baby?"
Gloria sa-id, "Le-ave him alo-ne. He can sle-ep whe-re he wants."
"I can't fi-gu-re," sa-id Kro-mer. "Is he yo-ur boyf-ri-end or yo-ur kid brot-her?"
"Neither," sa-id Glo-ria. "What do you ca-re?"
"Okay," sa-id Kro-mer. "We've got a job for him to do to-mor-row, tho-ugh." "What job?" sa-id
Glo-ria. They tal-ked li-ke I wasn't the-re.
"We ne-ed a hac-ker boy for a lit-tle si-des-how we put on." sa-id Kro-mer "He's it."
"He's ne-ver be-en in a sca-pe be-fo-re," sa-id Glo-ria. "He's no hac-ker." "He's the ne-arest we've
got. We'll walk him thro-ugh it."
"I'll do it," I sa-id.
"Okay, but then le-ave him out of the Se-xat-hon," sa-id Glo-ria.
Kromer smi-led. "You're pro-tec-ting him? Sorry. Every-body plays in the Se-xat-hon, swe-et-he-art.
That's bre-ad and but-ter. The cus-to-mers don't let us bre-ak the ru-les." He po-in-ted out to the rigs.
"You'd bet-ter get out the-re."
I knew Kro-mer tho-ught I didn't know abo-ut Glo-ria and Fe-aring, or ot-her things. I wan-ted to tell
him I wasn't so in-no-cent, but I didn't think Glo-ria wo-uld li-ke it, so I kept qu-i-et.
I went to talk to Mr. Sne-eze. I re-mem-be-red whe-re he was from the first ti-me.
"What's a Se-xat-hon?" I sa-id.
"I don't know, Le-wis." "I've ne-ver had sex," I sa-id. "Me ne-it-her," sa-id Mr. Sne-eze.
"Everybody al-ways thinks I do with Glo-ria just be-ca-use we go aro-und to-get-her. But we're just
fri-ends."
"That's fi-ne," sa-id Mr. Sne-eze. "It's okay to be fri-ends." "I'd li-ke to be La-ne's boyf-ri-end," I
sa-id.

Next bre-ak Glo-ria slept whi-le Gil-mar-tin and Kro-mer told me abo-ut the act. A dra-wer wo-uld
be mar-ked for me to go in-to, and the-re wo-uld be a lot of num-bers and let-ters but I just had to
ke-ep pres-sing "1-2-3" no mat-ter what. It was sup-po-sed to be a se-cu-rity arc-hi-ve, they sa-id. The
pe-op-le watc-hing wo-uld think I was bre-aking co-des but it was just for show. Then so-met-hing
el-se wo-uld hap-pen but they wo-uldn't say what, just that I sho-uld ke-ep qu-i-et and let Fe-aring talk.
So I knew they we-re go-ing to pull me out of my mask. I didn't know if I sho-uld tell Glo-ria.
Fearing was up aga-in wel-co-ming so-me pe-op-le back in. I co-uldn't be-li-eve any-body wan-ted
to start watc-hing first thing in the mor-ning but Fe-aring was sa-ying "the gritty de-ter-mi-na-ti-on to
sur-vi-ve that epi-to-mi-zes the fron-ti-er spi-rit that on-ce ma-de a co-untry cal-led Ame-ri-ca gre-at"
and "yo-ung bo-di-es writ-hing in ago-ni-zed cong-ress with the fu-tu-re" and that so-un-ded li-ke a lot
of fun, I gu-ess.
A wo-man from the town had qu-it al-re-ady. Not La-ne tho-ugh.
A go-od qu-i-et pla-ce to go was Mars. It was li-ke the airp-la-ne, all spa-ce and no pe-op-le, but
bet-ter sin-ce the-re was no vo-ice tel-ling you to en-ga-ge tar-gets, and you ne-ver cras-hed.
I went to the dra-wer they told me abo-ut. Fe-aring's vo-ice in my ear told me it was ti-me. The
pla-ce was a sto-re-ro-om of in-for-ma-ti-on li-ke the bu-si-ness lib-rary. No pe-op-le, just fi-les with a
lot of blin-king lights and comp-li-ca-ted words. A vo-ice kept as-king me for "se-cu-rity cle-aran-ce
pas-sword" but the-re was al-ways a pla-ce for me to to-uch "1-2-3" and I did. It was kind of a joke,
li-ke a wall ma-de out of fe-at-hers that falls apart every ti-me you to-uch it.
I fo-und a bunch of pa-pers with wri-ting. So-me of the words we-re blac-ked out and so-me we-re
bright red and blin-king. The-re was a si-ren so-und. Then I felt hands pul-ling on me from out-si-de and
so-me-body to-ok off my mask.
There we-re two guys pul-ling on me who I had ne-ver se-en be-fo-re, and Ed and Kro-mer we-re
pul-ling on them. Every-body was scre-aming at each ot-her but it was kind of fa-ke, be-ca-use no-body
was pul-ling or yel-ling very hard. Fe-aring sa-id, "The feds, the feds!" A bunch of pe-op-le we-re
crow-ded aro-und my te-le-vi-si-on scre-en I gu-ess lo-oking at the pa-pers I'd dug up, but now they
we-re watc-hing the ac-ti-on.
Fearing ca-me over and pul-led out a toy gun and so did Kro-mer, and they we-re bac-king the two
men away from me. I'm su-re the audi-en-ce co-uld tell it was fa-ke. But they we-re pretty ex-ci-ted,
may-be just from re-mem-be-ring when feds we-re re-al.
I got off my fra-me and lo-oked aro-und. I didn't know what they we-re go-ing to do with me now
that I was out but I didn't ca-re. It was my first chan-ce to see what it was li-ke when the con-tes-tants
we-re all in the-ir su-its and masks, swim-ming in the in-for-ma-ti-on. No-ne of them knew what was
hap-pe-ning, not even Glo-ria, who was right next to me the who-le ti-me. They just kept mo-ving in the
sca-pes. I lo-oked at La-ne. She lo-oked go-od, li-ke she was dan-cing.
Meanwhile Fe-aring and Kro-mer cha-sed tho-se guys out the back. Pe-op-le we-re cra-ning
aro-und to see. Fe-aring ca-me out and to-ok his mic-rop-ho-ne and sa-id, "It isn't his fa-ult, folks. Just
go-od hac-ker ins-tincts for fer-re-ting out cor-rup-ti-on from encryp-ted da-ta. The feds don't want us
dig-ging up the-ir tra-il, but the kid co-uldn't help it."
Ed and Kro-mer star-ted snap-ping me back in-to my su-it. "We cha-sed them off," Fe-aring sa-id,
pat-ting his gun. "We do ta-ke ca-re of our own. You can't tell who's go-ing to co-me snif-fing aro-und,
can you? For his pro-tec-ti-on and ours we're go-ing to ha-ve to de-le-te that fi-le, but it go-es to show,
the-re's no li-mit to what a kid with a no-se for da-ta's go-ing to ro-ot out of cybers-pa-ce. We can't
throw him out of the con-test for do-ing what co-mes na-tu-ral. Gi-ve him a big hand, folks."
People clap-ped and a few threw co-ins. Ed pic-ked the chan-ge up for me, then told me to put on
my mask. Me-anw-hi-le Glo-ria and La-ne and every-body el-se just went on thro-ugh the-ir sca-pes.
I be-gan to see what Kro-mer and Fe-aring we-re sel-ling. It wasn't any one thing. So-me of it was
fa-ke and so-me was re-al, and so-me was a mix so you co-uldn't tell.
The pe-op-le watc-hing pro-bably didn't know why they wan-ted to, ex-cept it ma-de them for-get

the-ir scre-wed-up li-ves for a whi-le to watch the only suc-kers big-ger than them-sel-ves-us.
"Meanwhile, the big show go-es on," sa-id Fe-aring. "How long will they last? Who will ta-ke the
pri-ze?"
I told Glo-ria abo-ut it at the bre-ak. She just shrug-ged and sa-id to ma-ke su-re I got my mo-ney
from Kro-mer. Fe-aring was tal-king to An-ne, the wo-man from the van, and Glo-ria was sta-ring at
them li-ke she wan-ted them de-ad.
A guy was lying in his cot tal-king to him-self as if no-body co-uld he-ar and Gil-mar-tin and Kro-mer
went over and told him he was kic-ked out. He didn't se-em to ca-re.
I went to see La-ne but we didn't talk. We sat on her cot and held hands. I didn't know if it me-ant the
sa-me thing to her that it did to me but I li-ked it. Af-ter the bre-ak I went and tal-ked to Mr. Sne-eze.
He told me the story of the show abo-ut Christ-mas. He sa-id it wasn't abo-ut al-ways get-ting gifts.
So-me-ti-mes you had to gi-ve gifts too.
The Se-xat-hon was la-te at night. They cle-ared the se-ats and ever-yo-ne had to pay aga-in to get
back in, be-ca-use it was a spe-ci-al event. Fe-aring had bu-ilt it up all day, tal-king abo-ut how it was
for adults only, it wo-uld se-pa-ra-te the men from the boys, things li-ke that. Al-so that pe-op-le wo-uld
get knoc-ked out of the con-test. So we we-re pretty ner-vo-us by the ti-me he told us the ru-les.
"What wo-uld sca-pes be wit-ho-ut vir-tu-al sex?" he sa-id. "Our vo-ya-gers must now pro-ve
them-sel-ves in the sen-su-al re-alm-for the fu-tu-re con-sists of far mo-re than cold, hard
in-for-ma-ti-on. It's a pla-ce of de-si-re and temp-ta-ti-on, and, as al-ways, sur-vi-val be-longs to the
fit-test. The sol-di-ers will now be ste-ered on-to the se-xu-al bat-tles-ca-pe, the qu-es-ti-on is, will they
me-et with the Lit-tle De-ath, or the Big one?"
Gloria wo-uldn't exp-la-in. "Not re-al de-ath," is all she sa-id.
"The ru-les aga-in are so simp-le a child co-uld fol-low them. In the Sex-Sca-pe en-vi-ron-ment our
con-tes-tants will be free to pick from a va-ri-ety of fan-tasy part-ners. We've pac-ked this prog-ram
with op-ti-ons, the-re's so-met-hing for every tas-te, be-li-eve you me. We won't qu-es-ti-on the-ir
se-lec-ti-ons, but-he-re's the catch-we will chart the re-sults. The-ir su-its will tell us who do-es and
do-esn't at-ta-in se-xu-al or-gasm in the next ses-si-on, and tho-se who don't will be han-ded the-ir
wal-king pa-pers. The su-its don't lie. Find bliss or die, folks, find bliss or die."
"You get it now?" sa-id Glo-ria to me.
"I gu-ess," I sa-id.
"As ever, audi-en-ce mem-bers are ca-uti-oned ne-ver to in-ter-fe-re with the con-tes-tants du-ring
play. Fol-low the-ir fan-ta-si-es on the mo-ni-tors, or watch the-ir yo-uth-ful bo-di-es stra-in aga-inst
ex-ha-us-ti-on, se-eking to brid-ge vir-tu-al lust and bo-na fi-de physi-cal res-pon-se. But no
to-uc-hee."
Kromer was go-ing aro-und, chec-king the su-its. "Who's gon-na be in yo-ur fan-tasy, kid?" he sa-id
to me. "The snow-man?"
I'd for-got-ten how they co-uld watch me talk to Mr. Sne-eze on my te-le-vi-si-on. I tur-ned red.
"Screw you, Kro-mer," sa-id Glo-ria.
"Whoever you want, ho-ney," he sa-id, la-ug-hing.
Well I fo-und my way aro-und the-ir Sex-Sca-pe and I'm not too em-bar-ras-sed to say I fo-und a
girl who re-min-ded me of La-ne, ex-cept for the way she was trying so hard to be sexy. But she
lo-oked li-ke La-ne. I didn't ha-ve to do much to get the su-bj-ect aro-und to sex. It was the only thing
on her mind. She wan-ted me to tell her what I wan-ted to do to her and when I co-uldn't think of much
she sug-ges-ted things and I just ag-re-ed. And when I did that she wo-uld mo-ve aro-und and sigh as if
it we-re re-al-ly ex-ci-ting to talk abo-ut even tho-ugh she was do-ing the tal-king. She wan-ted to
to-uch me but she co-uldn't re-al-ly so she to-ok off her clot-hes and got clo-se to me and to-uc-hed
her-self. I to-uc-hed her too but she didn't re-al-ly fe-el li-ke much and it was li-ke my hands we-re
ma-de of wo-od, which co-uldn't ha-ve felt too ni-ce for her tho-ugh she ac-ted li-ke it was gre-at.

I to-uc-hed myself a lit-tle too. I tri-ed not to think abo-ut the audi-en-ce. I was a lit-tle con-fu-sed
abo-ut what was what in the su-it and with her bre-at-hing in my ear so lo-ud but I got the de-si-red
re-sult. That wasn't hard for me.
Then I co-uld go back to the dra-wers but Kro-mer had ma-de me em-bar-ras-sed abo-ut vi-si-ting
Mr. Sne-eze so I went to Mars even tho-ugh I wo-uld ha-ve li-ked to talk to him.
The audi-en-ce was all stir-red up at the next bre-ak. They we-re su-re get-ting the-ir mo-ney's worth
now. I got in-to Glo-ria's cot. I as-ked her if she did it with her own hands too. "You didn't ha-ve to do
that," she sa-id.
"How el-se?"
"I just pre-ten-ded. I don't think they can tell. They just want to see you wig-gle aro-und."
Well so-me of the wo-men from the town hadn't wig-gled aro-und eno-ugh I gu-ess be-ca-use
Kro-mer and Ed we-re ta-king them out of the con-test. A co-up-le of them we-re crying.
"I wish I hadn't," I sa-id.
"It's the sa-me eit-her way," sa-id Glo-ria. "Don't fe-el bad. Pro-bably so-me ot-her pe-op-le did it
too."
They didn't kick La-ne out but I saw she was crying any-way.
Kromer bro-ught a man in-to the back and sa-id to me, "Get in-to yo-ur own cot, lit-tle snow-man."
"Let him stay," sa-id Glo-ria. She wasn't lo-oking at Kro-mer.
"I've got so-me-one he-re who wants to me-et you," sa-id Kro-mer to Glo-ria. "Mr. War-ren, this is
Glo-ria."
Mr. War-ren sho-ok her hand. He was pretty old. "I've be-en ad-mi-ring you," he sa-id. "You're very
go-od."
"Mr. War-ren is won-de-ring if you'd let him buy you a drink," sa-id Kro-mer.
"Thanks, but I ne-ed so-me sle-ep," sa-id Glo-ria.
"Perhaps la-ter," sa-id Mr. War-ren.
After he left, Kro-mer ca-me back and sa-id, "You sho-uldn't pass up easy mo-ney."
"I don't ne-ed it," sa-id Glo-ria. "I'm go-ing to win yo-ur con-test, you god-damn pimp."
"Now, Glo-ria," sa-id Kro-mer. "You don't want to gi-ve the wrong imp-res-si-on." "Le-ave me
alo-ne."
I no-ti-ced now that An-ne wasn't aro-und in the rest area and I got the idea that the kind of easy
mo-ney Glo-ria didn't want An-ne did. I'm not so dumb.
Worrying abo-ut the Se-xat-hon had stop-ped me from fe-eling how ti-red I was. Right af-ter that I
star-ted nod-ding off in the sca-pes. I had to ke-ep mo-ving aro-und. Af-ter I'd be-en to a few new
things I went to see the snow-man aga-in. It was early in the mor-ning and I fi-gu-red Kro-mer was
pro-bably as-le-ep and the-re was ba-rely any audi-en-ce to see what I was do-ing on my te-le-vi-si-on.
So Mr. Sne-eze and I tal-ked and that hel-ped me stay awa-ke.
I wasn't the only one who was ti-red af-ter that night. On the next bre-ak I saw that a bunch of
pe-op-le had drop-ped out or be-en kic-ked out for sle-eping. The-re we-re only se-ven-te-en left. I
co-uldn't stay awa-ke myself. But I wo-ke up when I he-ard so-me yel-ling over whe-re La-ne was.
It was her pa-rents. I gu-ess they he-ard abo-ut the Se-xat-hon, may-be from her boyf-ri-end, who
was the-re too. La-ne was sit-ting crying be-hind Fe-aring who was tel-ling her pa-rents to get out of
the-re, and her fat-her just kept sa-ying, "I'm her fat-her! I'm her fat-her!" Her mot-her was pul-ling at
Fe-aring but Ed ca-me over and pul-led on her.
I star-ted to get up but Glo-ria grab-bed my arm and sa-id, "Stay out of this." "La-ne do-esn't want to
see that guy," I sa-id.
"Let the tow-ni-es ta-ke ca-re of them-sel-ves, Le-wis. Let La-ne's daddy ta-ke her ho-me if he can.
Wor-se co-uld hap-pen to her." "You just want her out of the con-test," I sa-id.
Gloria la-ug-hed. "I'm not wor-ri-ed abo-ut yo-ur girlf-ri-end out-las-ting me," she sa-id. "She's
abo-ut to bre-ak no mat-ter what."

So I just watc-hed. Kro-mer and Ed got La-ne's pa-rents and boyf-ri-end pus-hed out of the rest
area, back to-ward the se-ats. Fe-aring was yel-ling at them, ma-king a sce-ne for the audi-en-ce. It was
all part of the show as far as he was con-cer-ned.
Anne from the van was over tal-king to La-ne, who was still crying, but qu-i-et now.
"Do you re-al-ly think you can win?" I sa-id to Glo-ria. "Su-re, why not?" she sa-id. "I can last."
"I'm pretty ti-red." In fact my eye-bal-ls felt li-ke they we-re full of sand. "Well if you fall out stick
aro-und. You can pro-bably get fo-od out of Kro-mer for cle-aning up or so-met-hing. I'm go-ing to
ta-ke the-se bas-tards." "You don't li-ke Fe-aring any-mo-re," I sa-id. "I ne-ver did," sa-id Glo-ria.
That af-ter-no-on three mo-re pe-op-le drop-ped out. Fe-aring was go-ing on abo-ut en-du-ran-ce
and I got thin-king abo-ut how much har-der it was to li-ve the way me and Glo-ria did than it was to be
in town and so may-be we had an ad-van-ta-ge. May-be that was why Glo-ria tho-ught she co-uld win
now. But I su-re didn't fe-el it myself. I was so mes-sed up that I co-uldn't al-ways sle-ep at the rest
pe-ri-ods, just lie the-re and lis-ten to Fe-aring or eat the-ir sand-wic-hes un-til I wan-ted to vo-mit.
Kromer and Gil-mar-tin we-re plan-ning so-me si-des-how but it didn't in-vol-ve me and I didn't
ca-re. I didn't want co-ins thrown at me. I just wan-ted to get thro-ugh.
If I bu-ilt the ci-ti-es ne-ar the wa-ter the pla-gue al-ways kil-led all the pe-op-le and if I bu-ilt the
ci-ti-es ne-ar the mo-un-ta-ins the vol-ca-no-es al-ways kil-led all the pe-op-le and if I bu-ilt the ci-ti-es
on the pla-in the ot-her tri-be al-ways ca-me over and kil-led all the pe-op-le and I got sick of the
who-le damn thing.
"When Glo-ria wins we co-uld li-ve in town for a whi-le," I sa-id. "We co-uld even get jobs if the-re
are any. Then if La-ne do-esn't want to go back to her pa-rents she co-uld stay with us."
"You co-uld win the con-test," sa-id Mr. Sne-eze.
"I don't think so," I sa-id. "But Glo-ria co-uld."
Why did Le-wis cross Mars? To get to the ot-her si-de. Ha ha.
I ca-me out for the rest pe-ri-od and Glo-ria was al-re-ady yel-ling and I un-ho-oked my su-it and
rus-hed over to see what was the mat-ter. It was so la-te it was get-ting light out-si-de and al-most
no-body was in the pla-ce. "She's che-ating!" Glo-ria scre-amed. She was po-un-ding on Kro-mer and
he was bac-king up be-ca-use she was a hand-ful mad. "That bitch is che-ating! You let her sle-ep!"
Glo-ria po-in-ted at An-ne from the van. "She's lying the-re as-le-ep, you're run-ning ta-pes in her
mo-ni-tor you god-damn che-ater!"
Anne sat up in her fra-me and didn't say anyt-hing. She lo-oked con-fu-sed. "You're a bunch of
che-aters!" Glo-ria kept sa-ying. Kro-mer got her by the wrists and sa-id, "Ta-ke it easy, ta-ke it easy.
You're go-ing sca-pe-crazy, girl."
"Don't tell me I'm crazy!" sa-id Glo-ria. She twis-ted away from Kro-mer and ran to the se-ats. Mr.
War-ren was the-re, watc-hing her with his hat in his hands. I ran af-ter Glo-ria and sa-id her na-me but
she sa-id, "Le-ave me alo-ne!" and went over to Mr. War-ren. "You saw it, didn't you?" she sa-id.
"I'm sorry?" sa-id Mr. War-ren.
"You must ha-ve se-en it, the way she wasn't mo-ving at all," sa-id Glo-ria. "Co-me on, tell the-se
che-aters you saw it. I'll go on that da-te with you if you tell them." "I'm sorry, dar-ling. I was lo-oking at
you."
Kromer knoc-ked me out of the way and grab-bed Glo-ria from be-hind. "Lis-ten to me, girl. You're
hal-lu-ci-na-ting. You're sca-pe-hap-py. We see it all the ti-me." He was tal-king qu-i-et but hard. "Any
mo-re of this and you're out of the show, you un-ders-tand? Get in the back and lie down now and get
so-me sle-ep. You ne-ed it."
"You bas-tard," sa-id Glo-ria.
"Sure, I'm a bas-tard, but you're se-e-ing things." He held Glo-ria's wrist and she sag-ged.

Mr. War-ren got up and put his hat on. "I'll see you to-mor-row, dar-ling. Don't worry. I'm ro-oting
for you." He went out. Glo-ria didn't lo-ok at him.
Kromer to-ok Glo-ria back to the rest area but sud-denly I wasn't pa-ying much at-ten-ti-on myself. I
had be-en thin-king Fe-aring wasn't ta-king ad-van-ta-ge of the free ac-ti-on by tal-king abo-ut it
be-ca-use the-re wasn't an-yo-ne much in the pla-ce to imp-ress at this ho-ur. Then I lo-oked aro-und
and I re-ali-zed the-re we-re two pe-op-le mis-sing and that was Fe-aring and La-ne.
I fo-und Ed and I as-ked him if La-ne had drop-ped out of the con-test and he sa-id no.
"Maybe the-re's a way you co-uld find out if An-ne is re-al-ly sca-ping or if she's a che-at," I sa-id to
Mr. Sne-eze.
"I don't see how I co-uld," he sa-id. "I can't vi-sit her, she has to vi-sit me. And no-body vi-sits me
ex-cept you." He hop-ped and jig-gled in his fi-ve pla-ces. "I'd li-ke it if I co-uld me-et Glo-ria and
La-ne."
"Let's not talk abo-ut La-ne," I sa-id.
When I saw Fe-aring aga-in I co-uldn't lo-ok at him. He was out tal-king to the pe-op-le who ca-me
by in the mor-ning, not in the mic-rop-ho-ne but one at a ti-me, sha-king hands and ta-king
comp-li-ments li-ke it was him do-ing the sca-ping.
There we-re only eight pe-op-le left in the con-test. La-ne was still in it but I didn't ca-re.
I knew if I tri-ed to sle-ep I wo-uld just lie the-re thin-king. So I went to rin-se out un-der my su-it,
which was get-ting pretty rank. I hadn't be-en out of that su-it sin-ce the con-test star-ted. In the
bath-ro-om I lo-oked out the lit-tle win-dow at the day-light and I tho-ught abo-ut how I hadn't be-en
out of that bu-il-ding for fi-ve days eit-her, no mat-ter how much I'd go-ne to Mars and el-sew-he-re.
I went back in and saw Glo-ria as-le-ep and I tho-ught all of a sud-den that I sho-uld try to win.
But may-be that was just the idea co-ming over me that Glo-ria wasn't go-ing to.
I didn't no-ti-ce it right away be-ca-use I went to ot-her pla-ces first. Mr. Sne-eze had ma-de me
pro-mi-se I'd al-ways ha-ve so-met-hing new to tell him abo-ut so I al-ways ope-ned a few dra-wers. I
went to a tank ga-me but it was bo-ring. Then I fo-und a pla-ce cal-led the Ame-ri-can His-tory Blo-od
and Wax Mu-se-um and I stop-ped Pre-si-dent Lin-coln from get-ting mur-de-red a co-up-le of ti-mes.
I tri-ed to stop Pre-si-dent Ken-nedy from get-ting mur-de-red but if I stop-ped it one way it al-ways
hap-pe-ned a dif-fe-rent way. I don't know why.
So then I was go-ing to tell Mr. Sne-eze abo-ut it and that's when I fo-und out. I went in-to his
dra-wer and to-uc-hed the right num-bers but what I got wasn't the usu-al fi-ve pic-tu-res of the
snow-man. It was pi-eces of him but chop-ped up and stretc-hed in-to thin whi-te strips, aro-und the
ed-ge of the black spa-ce, li-ke a band of whi-te light.
I sa-id, "Mr. Sne-eze?"
There wasn't any vo-ice.
I went out and ca-me back in but it was the sa-me. He co-uldn't talk. The band of whi-te strips got
nar-ro-wer and wi-der, li-ke it was trying to mo-ve or talk. It lo-oked a bit li-ke a hand wa-ving open
and shut. But if he was still the-re he co-uldn't talk.
I wo-uld ha-ve ta-ken my mask off then any-way, but the he-at of my fa-ce and my te-ars for-ced me
to.
I saw Fe-aring up front tal-king and I star-ted for him wit-ho-ut even get-ting my su-it un-dip-ped, so
I to-re up a few of my wi-res. I didn't ca-re. I knew I was out now. I went right out and tack-led
Fe-aring from be-hind. He wasn't so big, any-way. Only his vo-ice was big. I got him down on the
flo-or.
"You kil-led him," I sa-id, and I punc-hed him as hard as I co-uld, but you know Kro-mer and
Gil-mar-tin we-re the-re hol-ding my arms be-fo-re I co-uld hit him mo-re than on-ce. I just scre-amed
at Fe-aring, "You kil-led him, you kil-led him."
Fearing was smi-ling at me and wi-ping his mo-uth. "Yo-ur snow-man mal-func-ti-oned, kid."

"That's a lie!"
"You we-re bo-ring us to de-ath with that snow-man, you lit-tle punk. Gi-ve it a rest, for chris-sa-ke."
I kept kic-king out even tho-ugh they had me pul-led away from him. "I'll kill you!" I sa-id.
"Right," sa-id Fe-aring. "Throw him out of he-re."
He ne-ver stop-ped smi-ling. Everyt-hing su-ited his plans, that was what I ha-ted.
Kromer the big ape and Gil-mar-tin pul-led me out-si-de in-to the sun-light and it was li-ke a kni-fe in
my eyes. I co-uldn't be-li-eve how bright it was. They tos-sed me down in the stre-et and when I got up
Kro-mer punc-hed me, hard.
Then Glo-ria ca-me out-si-de. I don't know how she fo-und out, if she he-ard me scre-aming or if Ed
wo-ke her. Any-way she ga-ve Kro-mer a pretty go-od punch in the si-de and sa-id, "Le-ave him
alo-ne!"
Kromer was surp-ri-sed and he mo-aned and I got away from him. Glo-ria punc-hed him aga-in.
Then she tur-ned aro-und and ga-ve Gil-mar-tin a kick in the nuts and he went down. I'll al-ways
re-mem-ber in spi-te of what hap-pe-ned next that she ga-ve tho-se guys a co-up-le they'd be fe-eling
for a day or two.
The gang who be-at the crap out of us we-re a mix of the mi-li-tia and so-me ot-her guys from the
town, inc-lu-ding La-ne's boyf-ri-end.
Pretty funny that he'd ta-ke out his frust-ra-ti-on on us, but that just shows you how go-od Fe-aring
had that who-le town wrap-ped aro-und his fin-ger.
Outside of town we fo-und an old ho-use that we co-uld hi-de in and get so-me sle-ep. I slept lon-ger
than Glo-ria. When I wo-ke up she was on the front steps rub-bing a spo-on back and forth on the
pa-ve-ment to ma-ke a sharp po-int, even tho-ugh I co-uld see it hurt her arm to do it.
"Well, we did get fed for a co-up-le of days," I sa-id.
Gloria didn't say anyt-hing.
"Let's go up to San Fran-cis-co," I sa-id. "The-re's a lot of lo-nely wo-men the-re." I was ma-king a
joke of co-ur-se.
Gloria lo-oked at me. "What's that sup-po-sed to me-an?" "Just that may-be I can get us in for on-ce."
Glo-ria didn't la-ugh, but I knew she wo-uld la-ter.

VI - GEORGE R. R MARTIN - DARK, DARK WERE THE TUNNELS
Greel was af-ra-id.
He lay in the warm, rich dark-ness be-yond the pla-ce whe-re the tun-nel cur-ved, his thin body
pres-sed aga-inst the stran-ge me-tal bar that ran along the flo-or. His eyes we-re clo-sed. He stra-ined
to re-ma-in per-fectly still.
He was ar-med. A short bar-bed spe-ar was clenc-hed tightly in his right fist. But that did not les-sen
his fe-ar.
He had co-me far, far. He had clim-bed hig-her and ran-ged furt-her than any ot-her sco-ut of the
Pe-op-le in long ge-ne-ra-ti-ons. He had fo-ught his way thro-ugh the Bad Le-vels, whe-re the
worm-things still hun-ted the Pe-op-le re-lent-les-sly. He had stal-ked and sla-in the glo-wing kil-ler
mo-le in the crumb-ling Mid-dle Tun-nels. He had wig-gled thro-ugh do-zens of un-map-ped and
un-na-med pas-sa-ges that hardly lo-oked big eno-ugh for a man to pass.
And now he had pe-net-ra-ted to the Ol-dest Tun-nels, the gre-at tun-nels and halls of le-gend,
whe-re the ta-le-tel-lers sa-id the Pe-op-le had co-me from a mil-li-on ye-ars ago.
He was no co-ward. He was a sco-ut of the Pe-op-le, who da-red to walk in tun-nels whe-re men
had not trod in cen-tu-ri-es.
But he was af-ra-id, and was not as-ha-med for his fe-ar. A go-od sco-ut knows when to be af-ra-id.
And Gre-el was a very go-od sco-ut. So he lay si-lent in the dark-ness, and clutc-hed his spe-ar, and

tho-ught.
Slowly the fe-ar be-gan to wa-ne. Gre-el ste-eled him-self, and ope-ned his eyes. Qu-ickly he shut
them aga-in.
The tun-nel ahe-ad was on fi-re.
He had ne-ver se-en fi-re. But the ta-le-tel-lers had sung of it many ti-mes. Hot it was. And bright, so
bright it hurt the eyes. Blind-ness was the lot of tho-se who lo-oked too long.
So Gre-el kept his eyes shut. A sco-ut ne-eded his eyes. He co-uld not al-low the fi-re ahe-ad to
blind him.
Back he-re, in the dark-ness be-yond the bend of the tun-nel, the fi-re was not so bad. It still hurt the
eyes to lo-ok at it, as it hung upon the cur-ving tun-nel wall. But the pa-in was one that co-uld be bor-ne.
But ear-li-er, when he had first se-en the fi-re, Gre-el had be-en un-wi-se. He had crept for-ward,
squ-in-ting, to whe-re the wall cur-ved away. He had to-uc-hed the fi-re that hung upon the sto-ne. And
then, fo-olishly, he had pe-ered be-yond the cur-ve.
His eyes still ac-hed. He had got-ten only one qu-ick glimp-se be-fo-re whir-ling and scramb-ling
si-lently back to whe-re he lay. But it was eno-ugh. Be-yond the bend the fi-re had be-en brigh-ter,
much brigh-ter, brigh-ter than ever he co-uld ha-ve ima-gi-ned. Even with his eyes clo-sed he co-uld still
see it, two dan-cing, ac-hing spots of hor-rib-le in-ten-se bright-ness. They wo-uld not go away. The
fi-re had bur-ned part of his eyes, he tho-ught.
But still, when he had to-uc-hed the fi-re that hung upon the wall, it had not be-en li-ke the fi-re of
which the ta-le-tel-lers sing. The sto-ne had felt li-ke all ot-her sto-ne, co-ol and a lit-tle damp. Fi-re was
hot, the ta-le-tel-lers sa-id. But the fi-re on the sto-ne had not be-en hot to the to-uch.
It was not fi-re, then, Gre-el de-ci-ded af-ter tho-ught. What it was he did not know. But it co-uld not
be fi-re if it was not hot.
He stir-red slightly from whe-re he lay. Ba-rely mo-ving, he re-ac-hed out and to-uc-hed H'ssig in the
dark-ness.
His mind-brot-her was se-ve-ral yards dis-tant, ne-ar one of the ot-her me-tal bars. Gre-el stro-ked
him with his mind, and co-uld fe-el H'ssig qu-iver in res-pon-se. Tho-ughts and sen-sa-ti-ons ming-led
word-les-sly.
H'ssig was af-ra-id, too. The gre-at hun-ting rat had no eyes. But his scent was ke-ener than Gre-els,
and the-re was a stran-ge smell in the tun-nel. His ears we-re bet-ter, too. Thro-ugh them Gre-el co-uld
pick up mo-re of the odd no-ises that ca-me from wit-hin the fi-re that was not a fi-re.
Greel ope-ned his eyes aga-in. Slowly this ti-me, not all at on-ce. Squ-in-ting.
The ho-les the fi-re had bur-ned in his vi-si-on we-re still the-re. But they we-re fa-ding. And the
dim-mer fi-re that mo-ved on the cur-ving tun-nel wall co-uld be en-du-red, if he did not lo-ok di-rectly
at it.
Still. He co-uld not go for-ward. And he must not cre-ep back. He was a sco-ut. He had a duty.
He re-ac-hed out to H'ssig aga-in. The hun-ting rat had run with him sin-ce birth. He had ne-ver
fa-iled him. He wo-uld not fa-il him now. The rat had no eyes that co-uld be bur-ned, but his ears and his
no-se wo-uld tell Gre-el what he must know abo-ut the thing be-yond the cur-ve.
H'ssig felt the com-mand mo-re than he he-ard it. He crept for-ward slowly to-wards the fi-re.
"A tre-asu-re ho-use!"
Ciffonetto's vo-ice was thick with ad-mi-ra-ti-on. The la-yer of pro-tec-ti-ve gre-ase sme-ared on-to
his fa-ce co-uld hardly hi-de the grin.
Von der Stadt lo-oked do-ubt-ful. Not just his fa-ce, but his who-le body ra-di-ated do-ubt. Both
men we-re dres-sed ali-ke, in fe-atu-re-less grey co-ve-ral-ls wo-ven of a he-avy me-tal-lic cloth. But
they co-uld ne-ver be mis-ta-ken. Von der Stadt was uni-que in his abi-lity to exp-ress do-ubt whi-le
re-ma-ining ab-so-lu-tely still.
When he mo-ved, or spo-ke, he un-der-li-ned the imp-res-si-on. As he did now.
"Some tre-asu-re ho-use," he sa-id, simply.
It was eno-ugh to an-noy Cif-fo-net-to. He frow-ned slightly at his lar-ger com-pa-ni-on. "No, I

me-an it," he sa-id. The be-am from his he-avy flash-light sli-ced thro-ugh the thick dark-ness, and
pla-yed up and down one of the rust-eaten ste-el pil-lars that stretc-hed from the plat-form to the ro-of.
"Lo-ok at that," Cif-fo-net-to sa-id.
Von der Stadt lo-oked at it. Do-ubt-ful-ly. "I see it," he sa-id. "So whe-re's the tre-asu-re?"
Ciffonetto con-ti-nu-ed to mo-ve his be-am up and down. "That's the tre-asu-re," he sa-id. "This
who-le pla-ce is a ma-j-or his-to-ri-cal find. I knew this was the pla-ce to se-arch. I told them so."
"What's so gre-at abo-ut a ste-el be-am, any-way?" Von der Stadt as-ked, let-ting his own flash brush
aga-inst the pil-lar.
"The sta-te of pre-ser-va-ti-on," Cif-fo-net-to sa-id, mo-ving clo-ser. "Most everyt-hing abo-ve
gro-und is ra-di-o-ac-ti-ve slag, even now. But down he-re we've got so-me be-a-uti-ful ar-te-facts. It
will gi-ve us a much bet-ter pic-tu-re abo-ut what the old ci-vi-li-za-ti-on was li-ke, be-fo-re the
di-sas-ter."
"We know what the old ci-vi-li-za-ti-on was li-ke," Von der Stadt pro-tes-ted. "We've got ta-pes,
bo-oks, films, everyt-hing. All sorts of things. The war didn't even to-uch Lu-na."
"Yes, yes, but this is dif-fe-rent," Cif-fo-net-to sa-id. "This is re-ality." He ran his glo-ved hand
lo-vingly along the pil-lar. "Lo-ok he-re," he sa-id. Von der Stadt mo-ved clo-ser.
There was wri-ting car-ved in-to the me-tal. Scratc-hed in, rat-her. It didn't go very de-ep, but it
co-uld still be re-ad, if but fa-intly.
Ciffonetto was grin-ning aga-in. Von der Stadt lo-oked do-ubt-ful. "Rod-ney lo-ves Wan-da," he
sa-id.
He sho-ok his he-ad. "Shit, Cliff" he sa-id, "you can find the sa-me thing in every pub-lic John in Lu-na
City."
Ciffonetto rol-led his eyes. "Von der Stadt," he sa-id, "if we fo-und the ol-dest ca-ve pa-in-ting in the
world, you'd pro-bably say it was a lo-usy pic-tu-re of a buf-fa-lo." He jab-bed at the wri-ting with his
free hand. "Don't you un-ders-tand? This is old. It's his-tory. It's the re-ma-ins of a ci-vi-li-za-ti-on and a
na-ti-on and a pla-net that pe-ris-hed al-most half a mil-len-ni-um ago."
Von der Stadt didn't reply, but he still lo-oked do-ubt-ful. His flash-light wan-de-red. "The-re's so-me
mo-re if that's what you're af-ter," he sa-id, hol-ding his be-am ste-ady on anot-her pil-lar a few fe-et
dis-tant.
This ti-me it was Cif-fo-net-to who re-ad the insc-rip-ti-on. "Re-pent or ye are do-omed." he sa-id,
smi-ling, af-ter his flash mel-ted in-to Von der Stadt's.
He chuck-led slightly. "The words of the prop-hets are writ-ten on the sub-way walls," he sa-id softly.
Von der Stadt frow-ned. "So-me prop-het," he sa-id. "They must ha-ve had one hell of a we-ird
re-li-gi-on."
"Oh, Christ," Cif-fo-net-to gro-aned. "I didn't me-an it li-te-ral-ly. I was qu-oting. A
mid-twen-ti-eth-cen-tury po-et na-med Si-mon. He wro-te that only fifty ye-ars or so be-fo-re the gre-at
di-sas-ter."
Von der Stadt wasn't in-te-res-ted. He wan-de-red away im-pa-ti-ently, his flash dar-ting he-re and
the-re amid the pitch-black ru-ins of the an-ci-ent sub-way sta-ti-on. "It's hot down he-re," he
comp-la-ined.
"Hotter up the-re," Cif-fo-net-to sa-id, al-re-ady lost in a new insc-rip-ti-on.
"Not the sa-me kind of hot," Von der Stadt rep-li-ed.
Ciffonetto didn't bot-her to ans-wer. "This is the big-gest find of the ex-pe-di-ti-on," he sa-id when he
lo-oked up at last. "We've got to get pic-tu-res. And get the ot-hers down he-re. We're was-ting our
ti-me on the sur-fa-ce."
"We'll do bet-ter down he-re?" Von der Stadt sa-id. Do-ubt-ful-ly, of co-ur-se.
Ciffonetto nod-ded. "That's what I've sa-id all along. The sur-fa-ce was plas-te-red. It's still a
ra-di-o-ac-ti-ve hell up the-re, even af-ter all the-se cen-tu-ri-es. If anyt-hing sur-vi-ved, it was
un-derg-ro-und. That's whe-re we sho-uld lo-ok. We sho-uld branch out and exp-lo-re this who-le
system of tun-nels." His hands swept out ex-pan-si-vely.
"You and Na-gel ha-ve be-en ar-gu-ing abo-ut that the who-le trip," Von der Stadt sa-id. "All the way

from Lu-na City. I don't see that it's do-ne you much go-od."
"Doctor Na-gel is a fo-ol," Cif-fo-net-to sa-id ca-re-ful-ly.
"I don't think so," Von der Stadt sa-id. "I'm a sol-di-er, not a sci-en-tist. But I've he-ard his si-de of
the ar-gu-ment, and it ma-kes sen-se. All this stuff down he-re is gre-at, but it's not what Na-gel wants.
It's not what the ex-pe-di-ti-on was sent to Earth to lo-ok for."
"I know, I know," Cif-fo-net-to sa-id. "Na-gel wants li-fe. Hu-man li-fe, es-pe-ci-al-ly. So every day
he sends the flyers out furt-her and furt-her. And so far all he's co-me up with is a few spe-ci-es of
in-sects and a hand-ful of mu-ta-ted birds." Von der Stadt shrug-ged.
"If he'd lo-ok down he-re, he'd find what he's af-ter," Cif-fo-net-to con-ti-nu-ed. "He do-esn't
re-ali-ze how de-ep the ci-ti-es had dug be-fo-re the war. The-re are mi-les of tun-nels un-der our fe-et.
Le-vel af-ter le-vel. That's whe-re the sur-vi-vors wo-uld be, if the-re are any sur-vi-vors."
"How do you fi-gu-re?" Von der Stadt as-ked.
"Look, when war hit, the only ones to li-ve thro-ugh it wo-uld be tho-se down in de-ep shel-ters. Or
in the tun-nels be-ne-ath the ci-ti-es. The ra-di-o-ac-ti-vity wo-uld ha-ve pre-ven-ted them from co-ming
up for ye-ars. Hell, the sur-fa-ce still isn't very at-trac-ti-ve. They'd be trap-ped down the-re. They'd
adj-ust. Af-ter a few ge-ne-ra-ti-ons they wo-uldn't want to co-me up."
But Von der Stadt's at-ten-ti-on had wan-de-red, and he was hardly lis-te-ning any mo-re. He had
wal-ked to the ed-ge of the plat-form, and was sta-ring down on-to the tracks.
He sto-od the-re si-lently for a mo-ment, then re-ac-hed a de-ci-si-on. He stuf-fed his flash-light in-to
his belt, and be-gan to climb down. "Co-me on," he sa-id. "Let's go lo-ok for so-me of the-se
sur-vi-vors of yo-urs."
H'ssig sta-yed clo-se to the me-tal bar as he ed-ged for-ward. It hel-ped to hi-de him, and kept away
the fi-re, so he mo-ved in a lit-tle band of al-most dark-ness. Hug-ging it as best he co-uld, he crept
si-lently aro-und the cur-ve, and hal-ted…
Through him Gre-el watc-hed: watc-hed with the rat's ears and with his no-se.
The fi-re was tal-king.
There we-re two scents, ali-ke but not the sa-me. And the-re we-re two vo-ices. Just as the-re had
be-en two fi-res. The bright things that had bur-ned Gre-el's eyes we-re li-ving cre-atu-res of so-me sort.
Greel lis-te-ned. The so-unds H'ssig he-ard so cle-arly we-re words. A lan-gu-age of so-me sort.
Gre-el was su-re of that. He knew the dif-fe-ren-ce bet-we-en the ro-ars and grunts of ani-mals and the
pat-terns of spe-ech.
But the fi-re things we-re tal-king in a lan-gu-age he did not know. The so-unds me-ant no mo-re to
him than to H'ssig who re-la-yed them.
He con-cent-ra-ted on the scent. It was stran-ge, un-li-ke anyt-hing he had en-co-un-te-red be-fo-re.
But so-me-how it felt li-ke a man-scent, tho-ugh it co-uld not be that.
Greel tho-ught. An al-most man-scent. And words. Co-uld it be that the fi-re things we-re men? They
wo-uld be stran-ge men, much un-li-ke the Pe-op-le. But the ta-le-tel-lers sung of men in an-ci-ent
ti-mes that had stran-ge po-wers and forms. Might not the-se be such men? He-re, in the Ol-dest
Tun-nels, whe-re the le-gends sa-id the Old Ones had cre-ated the Pe-op-le-might not such men still
dwell he-re?
Yes.
Greel stir-red. He mo-ved slowly from whe-re he lay, ra-ising him-self to a cro-uc-hing po-si-ti-on to
squ-int at the cur-ve ahe-ad. A si-lent snap bro-ught H'ssig back to sa-fety from the fi-ery tun-nel
be-yond the cur-ve.
There was one way to ma-ke su-re, Cre-el tho-ught. Tremb-ling, he re-ac-hed out ca-uti-o-usly with
his mind.
Von der Stadt had adap-ted to Earth’s gra-vity a lot mo-re suc-ces-sful-ly than Cif-fo-net-to. He
re-ac-hed the flo-or of the tun-nel qu-ickly, and wa-ited im-pa-ti-ently whi-le his com-pa-ni-on clim-bed
down from the plat-form.

Ciffonetto let him-self drop the last fo-ot or so, and lan-ded with a thud. He lo-oked up at the
plat-form ap-pre-hen-si-vely. "I just ho-pe I can ma-ke it back up," he sa-id.
Von der Stadt shrug-ged. "You we-re the one who wan-ted to exp-lo-re all the tun-nels."
"Yes," sa-id Cif-fo-net-to, shif-ting his ga-ze from the plat-form to lo-ok aro-und him. "And I still do.
Down he-re, in the-se tun-nels, are the ans-wers we're se-eking."
"That's yo-ur the-ory, any-way," Von der Stadt sa-id. He lo-oked in both di-rec-ti-ons, cho-se one at
ran-dom, and mo-ved for-ward, his flash-light be-am spe-aring out be-fo-re him. Cif-fo-net-to
fol-lo-wed a half-step be-hind.
The tun-nel they en-te-red was long, stra-ight, and empty.
"Tell me," Von der Stadt sa-id in an of-fhand man-ner as they wal-ked, "even if yo-ur sur-vi-vors did
ma-ke it thro-ugh the war in shel-ters, wo-uldn't they ha-ve be-en for-ced to sur-fa-ce even-tu-al-ly to
sur-vi-ve? I me-an-how co-uld an-yo-ne ac-tu-al-ly li-ve down he-re?" He lo-oked aro-und the tun-nel
with ob-vi-o-us dis-tas-te.
"Have you be-en ta-king les-sons from Na-gel or so-met-hing?" Cif-fo-net-to rep-li-ed. "I've he-ard
that so of-ten I'm sick of it. I ad-mit it wo-uld be dif-fi-cult. But not im-pos-sib-le. At first, the-re wo-uld
be ac-cess to lar-ge sto-res of can-ned go-ods. A lot of that stuff was kept in ba-se-ments. You co-uld
get to it by tun-nel-ling. La-ter, you co-uld ra-ise fo-od. The-re are plants that will grow wit-ho-ut light.
And the-re wo-uld be in-sects and bo-ring ani-mals too, I ima-gi-ne."
"A di-et of bugs and mush-ro-oms. It do-esn't so-und too he-althy to me."
Ciffonetto stop-ped sud-denly, not bot-he-ring to reply. "Lo-ok the-re," he sa-id, po-in-ting with his
flash-light.
The be-am pla-yed over a jag-ged bre-ak in the tun-nel wall. It lo-oked as tho-ugh so-me-one had
smas-hed thro-ugh the sto-ne a long ti-me ago.
Von der Stadt's flash jo-ined Cif-fo-net-to's to light the area bet-ter. The-re was a pas-sa-ge
des-cen-ding from the bre-ak. Cif-fo-net-to mo-ved to-wards it with a start.
"What the hell do you say to this, Von der Stadt?" he as-ked, grin-ning. He stuck he-ad and flash-light
in-to the cru-de tun-nel, but re-emer-ged qu-ickly.
"Not much the-re," he sa-id. "The pas-sa-ge is ca-ved in af-ter a few fe-et. But still, it con-firms what
I've be-en sa-ying."
Von der Stadt lo-oked va-gu-ely une-asy. His free hand drif-ted to the hols-te-red pis-tol at his si-de.
"I don't know," he sa-id.
"No, you don't," sa-id Cif-fo-net-to, tri-ump-hantly. "Ne-it-her do-es Na-gel. Men ha-ve li-ved down
he-re. They may still li-ve he-re. We've got to or-ga-ni-ze a mo-re ef-fi-ci-ent se-arch of the who-le
un-derg-ro-und system."
He pa-used, his mind flic-ke-ring back to Von der Stadt's ar-gu-ment of a few se-conds ear-li-er. "As
for yo-ur bugs and mush-ro-oms, men can le-arn to li-ve on a lot of things.
Men adapt. If men sur-vi-ved the war-and this says they did-then they sur-vi-ved the af-ter-math, I'll
wa-ger."
"Maybe," Von der Stadt sa-id. "I can't see what you are so hot on dis-co-ve-ring sur-vi-vors for
any-way, tho-ugh. I me-an, the ex-pe-di-ti-on is im-por-tant and all that. We've got to re-estab-lish
spa-cef-light, and this is a go-od test for our new hard-wa-re. And I gu-ess you sci-en-tists can pick up
so-me go-od stuff for the mu-se-ums. But hu-mans? What did Earth ever get us be-si-des the Gre-at
Fa-mi-ne?"
Ciffonetto smi-led to-le-rantly. "It's be-ca-use of the Gre-at Fa-mi-ne that we want to find hu-mans,"
he sa-id. He pa-used. "We've got eno-ugh to en-ti-ce even Na-gel now. Let's he-ad back."
He star-ted wal-king back in the di-rec-ti-on they had co-me, and re-su-med tal-king. "The Gre-at
Fa-mi-ne was an una-vo-idab-le re-sult of the war on Earth," he sa-id. "When sup-pli-es stop-ped
co-ming, the-re was ab-so-lu-tely no way to ke-ep all the pe-op-le in the lu-nar co-lony ali-ve. Ni-nety
per cent star-ved.
"Luna co-uld be ma-de self-suf-fi-ci-ent, but only with a very small po-pu-la-ti-on. That's what
hap-pe-ned. The po-pu-la-ti-on adj-us-ted it-self. But we recyc-led our air and our wa-ter, grew fo-ods

in hydro-po-nic tanks. We strug-gled, but we sur-vi-ved. And be-gan to re-bu-ild.
"But we lost a lot. Too many pe-op-le di-ed. Our ge-ne-tic po-ol was ter-ribly small, and not too
di-ver-se. The co-lony had ne-ver had a lot of ra-ci-al di-ver-sity to be-gin with.
"That hasn't hel-ped. Po-pu-la-ti-on ac-tu-al-ly dec-li-ned for a long ti-me af-ter we had the physi-cal
re-so-ur-ces to sup-port mo-re pe-op-le. The idea of in-bre-eding didn't go over. Now po-pu-la-ti-on's
go-ing up aga-in, but slowly. We're stag-nant, Von der Stadt. It's ta-ken us ne-arly fi-ve cen-tu-ri-es to
get spa-ce tra-vel go-ing aga-in, for examp-le. And we still ha-ven't dup-li-ca-ted many of the things they
had back on Earth be-fo-re the di-sas-ter."
Von der Stadt frow-ned. "Stag-nant's a strong word," he sa-id. "I think we've do-ne pretty go-od."
Ciffonetto dis-mis-sed the com-ment with a wa-ve of his flash-light. "Pretty go-od," he sa-id. "Not
go-od eno-ugh. We're not go-ing anyw-he-re. The-re's so damn few chan-ges, so lit-tle in the way of
new ide-as. We ne-ed fresh vi-ew-po-ints, fresh ge-ne-tic stock. We ne-ed the sti-mu-la-ti-on of
con-tact with a fo-re-ign cul-tu-re.
"Survivors wo-uld gi-ve us that. Af-ter all Earth's be-en thro-ugh, they'd ha-ve to ha-ve chan-ged in
so-me ways. And they'd be pro-of that hu-man li-fe can still flo-urish on Earth. That's cru-ci-al if we're
go-ing to es-tab-lish a co-lony he-re."
The last po-int was tac-ked on al-most as an af-tert-ho-ught, but ca-ught Von der Stadt's ap-pro-val.
He nod-ded gra-vely.
They had re-ac-hed the sta-ti-on aga-in. Cif-fo-net-to he-aded stra-ight for the plat-form. "C'mon," he
sa-id, "let's get back to ba-se. I can't wa-it to see Na-gel's fa-ce drop when I tell him what we've
fo-und."
They we-re men.
Greel was al-most su-re of it. The tex-tu-re of the-ir minds was cu-ri-o-us, but man-li-ke. Gre-el was
a strong mind-ming-ler. He knew the co-ar-se, dim fe-el of an ani-mal's mind, the obs-ce-ne sha-dows
that we-re the tho-ughts of the worm-things. And he knew the minds of men. They we-re men.
Yet the-re was a stran-ge-ness. Mind-ming-ling was true com-mu-ni-ca-ti-on only with a
mind-brot-her. But al-ways it was a sha-ring with ot-her men. A dark and murky sha-ring, full of clo-uds
and fla-vo-urs and smells and emo-ti-ons. But a sha-ring.
Here the-re was no sha-ring. He-re it was li-ke mind-ming-ling with a lo-wer ani-mal. To-uch, fe-el,
stro-ke, sa-vo-ur-all that a strong mind-ming-ler co-uld do with an ani-mal. But ne-ver wo-uld he fe-el a
res-pon-se. Men and mind-brot-hers res-pon-ded; ani-mals did not.
These men did not res-pond. The-se stran-ge fi-re-men had minds that we-re si-lent and crip-pled.
In the dark-ness of the tun-nel, Gre-el stra-igh-te-ned from his cro-uch. The fi-re had fa-ded
sud-denly from the wall. The men we-re go-ing away, down the tun-nel away from him. The fi-re went
with them.
He ed-ged for-ward slowly, H'ssig at his si-de, spe-ar in hand. Dis-tan-ce ma-de mind-ming-ling
dif-fi-cult. He must ke-ep them in ran-ge. He must find out mo-re. He was a sco-ut. He had a duty.
His mind crept out aga-in, to tas-te the fla-vo-ur of the ot-her minds. He had to be su-re.
Their tho-ughts mo-ved aro-und him, swir-ling cha-os shot thro-ugh with stre-aks of bright-ness and
emo-ti-ons and dan-cing, half-se-en con-cepts. Gre-el un-ders-to-od lit-tle. But he-re he re-cog-ni-zed
so-met-hing. And the-re so-met-hing el-se ca-me to him.
He lin-ge-red and tas-ted fully of the-ir minds, and le-ar-ned. But still it was li-ke mind-ming-ling with
an ani-mal. He co-uld not ma-ke him-self felt. He co-uld not get an ans-wer.
Still they mo-ved away, and the-ir tho-ughts dim-med, and the mind-ming-ling be-ca-me har-der.
Gre-el ad-van-ced. He he-si-ta-ted when he got to the pla-ce whe-re the tun-nel cur-ved. But he knew
he must go on. He was a sco-ut.
He lo-we-red him-self to the flo-or, squ-in-ted, and mo-ved aro-und the cur-ve on hands and kne-es.
Beyond the cur-ve, he star-ted and gas-ped. He was in a gre-at hall, an im-men-se ca-vern with a
va-ul-ting ro-of and gi-ant pil-lars that held up the sky. And the hall was bright with light, a stran-ge,
fi-ery light that dan-ced over everyt-hing.

It was a pla-ce of le-gend. A hall of the Old Ones. It had to be. Ne-ver had Gre-el se-en a cham-ber
so vast. And he of all the Pe-op-le had wan-de-red furt-hest and clim-bed hig-hest.
The men we-re not in sight, but the-ir fi-re dan-ced aro-und the mo-uth of the tun-nel at the ot-her end
of the hall. It was in-ten-se, but not un-be-arab-le. The men had go-ne aro-und anot-her cur-ve. Gre-el
re-ali-zed that he lo-oked only at the dim ref-lec-ti-on of the-ir fi-re. So long as he did not see it di-rect,
he was sa-fe.
He mo-ved out in-to the hall, the sco-ut in him crying to climb the sto-ne wall and exp-lo-re the up-per
cham-ber from which the mighty pil-lars re-ared. But no. The fi-re-men we-re mo-re im-por-tant. The
hall he co-uld re-turn to.
H'ssig rub-bed up aga-inst his leg. He re-ac-hed down and stro-ked the rat's soft fur re-as-su-ringly.
His mind-brot-her co-uld sen-se the tur-mo-il of his tho-ughts.
Men, yes, he was su-re of that. And mo-re he knew. The-ir tho-ughts we-re not tho-se of the
Pe-op-le, but they we-re man-tho-ughts, and so-me he co-uld un-ders-tand. One of them bur-ned,
bur-ned to find ot-her men. They se-ek the Pe-op-le, Gre-el tho-ught.
That he knew. He was a sco-ut and a mind-ming-ler. He did not ma-ke mis-ta-kes. But what he must
do he did not know.
They so-ught the Pe-op-le. That might be go-od. When first that con-cept had to-uc-hed him, Gre-el
had qu-ive-red with joy. The-se fi-re-men we-re li-ke the Old Ones of le-gend. If they so-ught the
Pe-op-le, he wo-uld le-ad them. The-re wo-uld be re-wards, and glory, and the ta-le-tel-lers wo-uld
sing his na-me for ge-ne-ra-ti-ons.
More, it was his duty. Things went not well with the Pe-op-le in re-cent ge-ne-ra-ti-ons. The ti-me of
go-od had en-ded with the co-ming of the worm-things, who had dri-ven the Pe-op-le from tun-nel
af-ter tun-nel. Even now, be-low his fe-et, the fight went on still in the Bad Le-vels and the tun-nels of the
Pe-op-le.
And Gre-el knew the Pe-op-le we-re lo-sing.
It was slow. But cer-ta-in. The worm-things we-re new to the Pe-op-le. Mo-re than ani-mal, but less,
less than men. They ne-eded not the tun-nels. They stal-ked thro-ugh the earth it-self, and now-he-re
we-re men sa-fe.
The Pe-op-le fo-ught back. Mind-ming-lers co-uld sen-se the worm-things, and spe-ars co-uld slay
them, and the gre-at hun-ting rats co-uld rip them to shreds. But al-ways the worm-things fled back in-to
the earth it-self. And the-re we-re many worm-things, and few Pe-op-le.
But the-se new men, the-se fi-re-men, they co-uld chan-ge the war. Le-gends sa-id the Old Ones had
fo-ught with fi-re and stran-ger we-apons, and the-se men li-ved in fi-re. They co-uld aid the Pe-op-le.
They co-uld gi-ve mighty we-apons to dri-ve the worm-things back in-to the dark-ness from which they
ca-me.
But.
But the-se men we-re not qu-ite men. The-ir minds we-re crip-pled, and much, much of the-ir
tho-ught was ali-en to Gre-el. Only glimp-ses of it co-uld he catch. He co-uld not know them as he
co-uld know anot-her of the Pe-op-le when they ming-led minds.
He co-uld le-ad them to the Pe-op-le. He knew the way. Back and down, a turn he-re, a twist the-re.
Thro-ugh the Mid-dle Tun-nels and the Bad Le-vels.
But what if he led them, and they we-re enemy to the Pe-op-le? What if they tur-ned on the Pe-op-le
with the-ir fi-re? He fe-ared for what they might do.
Without him, they wo-uld ne-ver find the Pe-op-le. Gre-el was cer-ta-in of that. Only he, in long
ge-ne-ra-ti-ons, had co-me this far. And only with ste-alth and mind-ming-ling and H'ssig along-si-de
him. They wo-uld ne-ver find the ways he had co-me, the twis-ting tun-nels that led de-ep, de-ep in-to
the earth.
So the Pe-op-le we-re sa-fe if he did not act. But then the worm-things wo-uld win, even-tu-al-ly. It
might ta-ke many ge-ne-ra-ti-ons. But the Pe-op-le co-uld not hold out.
His de-ci-si-on. No mind-ming-ler co-uld re-ach a small part of the dis-tan-ce that se-pa-ra-ted him
from the tun-nels of the Pe-op-le. He alo-ne must de-ci-de.

And he must de-ci-de so-on. For he re-ali-zed, with a shock, that the fi-re-men we-re co-ming back.
The-ir odd tho-ughts grew stron-ger, and the light in the hall grew mo-re and mo-re in-ten-se.
He he-si-ta-ted, then mo-ved slowly back-wards to-wards the tun-nel from which he had co-me.
"Wait a mi-nu-te," Von der Stadt sa-id when Cif-fo-net-to was a qu-ar-ter of the way up the wall.
"Let's try the ot-her di-rec-ti-ons."
Ciffonetto cra-ned his he-ad aro-und awk-wardly to lo-ok at his com-pa-ni-on, ga-ve it up as a bad
job, and drop-ped back to the tun-nel flo-or. He lo-oked disg-runt-led. "We sho-uld get back," he sa-id.
"We've got eno-ugh."
Von der Stadt shrug-ged. "C'mon. You're the one wan-ted to exp-lo-re down he-re. So we might as
well do a tho-ro-ugh job of it. May-be we're only a few fe-et away from anot-her one of yo-ur big
finds."
"All right," sa-id Cif-fo-net-to, pul-ling his flash-light from his belt whe-re he had stas-hed it for his
in-ten-ded as-sa-ult on the plat-form. "I sup-po-se you ha-ve a po-int. It wo-uld be tra-gic if we got
Na-gel down he-re and he trip-ped over so-met-hing we had mis-sed."
Von der Stadt nod-ded as-sent. The-ir flash-light be-ams mel-ted to-get-her, and they stro-de
qu-ickly to-wards the de-eper dark-ness of the tun-nel mo-uth.
They we-re co-ming. Fe-ar and in-de-ci-si-on tumb-led in Gre-el's tho-ughts. He hug-ged the tun-nel
wall. Back he mo-ved, fast and si-lent. He must ke-ep away from the-ir fi-re un-til he co-uld de-ci-de
what he must do.
But af-ter the first turn, the tun-nel ran long and stra-ight. Gre-el was fast. But not fast eno-ugh. And
his eyes we-re in-ca-uti-o-usly wi-de when the fi-re ap-pe-ared sud-denly in full fury.
His eyes bur-ned. He squ-e-aled in sud-den pa-in, and threw him-self to the gro-und. The fi-re
re-fu-sed to go away. It dan-ced be-fo-re him even with his eyes clo-sed, shif-ting co-lo-urs hor-ribly.
Greel fo-ught for cont-rol. Still the-re was dis-tan-ce bet-we-en them. Still he was ar-med. He
re-ac-hed out to H'ssig, ne-arby in the tun-nel. The eye-less rat aga-in wo-uld be his eyes.
Eyes still shut; Gre-el be-gan to crawl back, away from the fi-re. H'ssig re-ma-ined. "What the hell
was that?"
Von der Stadt's whis-pe-red qu-es-ti-on hung in the air for an ins-tant. He was fro-zen whe-re he had
ro-un-ded the cur-ve. Cif-fo-net-to, by his si-de, had al-so stop-ped de-ad at the so-und.
The sci-en-tist lo-oked puz-zled. "I don't know," he sa-id. "It was-odd. So-un-ded li-ke so-me sort of
ani-mal in pa-in. A scre-am, sort of. But as if the scre-amer we-re trying to re-ma-in si-lent, al-most."
His flash-light dar-ted this way and that, sli-cing rib-bons of light from the vel-vet dark-ness, but
re-ve-aling lit-tle. Von der Stadt's be-am po-in-ted stra-ight ahe-ad, un-mo-ving.
"I don't li-ke it," Von der Stadt sta-ted do-ubt-ful-ly. "May-be the-re is so-met-hing down he-re. But
that do-esn't me-an it's fri-endly." He shif-ted his flash to his left hand, and drew his pis-tol. "We'll see,"
he sa-id.
Ciffonetto frow-ned, but sa-id not-hing. They star-ted for-ward aga-in.
They we-re big, and they mo-ved fast. Gre-el re-ali-zed with a sick des-pa-ir that they wo-uld catch
him. His cho-ice had be-en ma-de for him.
But per-haps it was right. They we-re men. Men li-ke the Old Ones. They wo-uld help the Pe-op-le
aga-inst the worm-things. A new age wo-uld dawn. The ti-me of fe-ar wo-uld pass. The hor-ror wo-uld
fa-de. The old glo-ri-es of which the ta-le-tel-lers sing wo-uld re-turn, and on-ce aga-in the Pe-op-le
wo-uld bu-ild gre-at halls and mighty tun-nels.
Yes. They had de-ci-ded for him, but the de-ci-si-on was right. It was the only de-ci-si-on. Man must
me-et man, and to-get-her they wo-uld fa-ce the worm-things. He kept his eyes clo-sed. But he sto-od.
And spo-ke.
Again they fro-ze in mid-step. This ti-me the so-und was no muf-fled scre-am. It was soft, al-most

his-sing, but it was too cle-ar to be mi-sun-ders-to-od.
Both flash be-ams swung wildly now, for se-conds. Then one fro-ze. The ot-her he-si-ta-ted, then
jo-ined it.
Together they for-med a po-ol of light aga-inst a dis-tant part of the tun-nel wall. And in the po-ol
sto-od-what?
"My God," sa-id Von der Stadt. "Cliff, tell me what it is qu-ick, be-fo-re I sho-ot it."
"Don't," Cif-fo-net-to rep-li-ed. "It isn't mo-ving."
"But-what?"
"I don't know." The sci-en-tist's vo-ice had a stran-ge, un-cer-ta-in qu-iver in it.
The cre-atu-re in the po-ol of light was small, ba-rely over fo-ur fe-et. Small and sic-ke-ning. The-re
was so-met-hing va-gu-ely man-li-ke abo-ut it, but the pro-por-ti-ons of the limbs we-re all wrong, and
the hands and fe-et we-re gro-tes-qu-ely mal-for-med. And the skin, the skin was a sickly, mag-goty
whi-te.
But the fa-ce was the worst. Lar-ge, all out of pro-por-ti-on to the body, yet the mo-uth and no-se
co-uld hardly be se-en. The he-ad was all eyes. Two gre-at, im-men-se, gro-tes-que eyes, now sa-fely
hid-den by lids of de-ad whi-te skin.
Von der Stadt was rock ste-ady, but Cif-fo-net-to sho-ok a bit as he lo-oked at it. Yet he spo-ke
first.
"Look," he sa-id, his vo-ice soft. "In its hand. I think-I think that's a to-ol." Si-len-ce. Long, stra-ined
si-len-ce. Then Cif-fo-net-to spo-ke aga-in. His vo-ice was ho-ar-se.
"I think that's a man."
Greel bur-ned.
The fi-re had ca-ught him. Even shut tight, his eyes ac-hed, and he knew the hor-ror that lur-ked
out-si-de if he ope-ned them. And the fi-re had ca-ught him. His skin itc-hed stran-gely, and hurt.
Wor-se and wor-se it hurt.
Yet he did not stir. He was a sco-ut. He had a duty. He en-du-red, whi-le his mind ming-led with
tho-se of the ot-hers.
And the-re, in the-ir minds, he saw fe-ar, but chec-ked fe-ar. In a dis-tor-ted, blurry way he saw
him-self thro-ugh the-ir eyes, He tas-ted the awe and the re-vul-si-on that war-red in one. And the
un-mi-xed re-vul-si-on that chur-ned in-si-de the ot-her.
He an-ge-red, but he chec-ked his an-ger. He must re-ach them. 1 le must ta-ke them to the
Pe-op-le. They we-re blind and crip-pled and co-uld not help the-ir fe-elings. But if they un-ders-to-od,
they wo-uld aid. Yes.
He did not mo-ve. He wa-ited. His skin bur-ned, but he wa-ited.
"That," sa-id Von der Stadt. "That thing is a man?"
Ciffonetto nod-ded. "It must be. It car-ri-es to-ols. It spo-ke." He he-si-ta-ted. "But-God, I ne-ver
en-vi-si-oned anyt-hing li-ke this. The tun-nels, Von der Stadt. The dark. For long cen-tu-ri-es only the
dark. I ne-ver tho-ught-so much evo-lu-ti-on in so lit-tle ti-me."
"A man?" Still Von der Stadt do-ub-ted. "You're crazy. No man co-uld be-co-me so-met-hing li-ke
that."
Ciffonetto scar-cely he-ard him. "I sho-uld ha-ve re-ali-zed," he mumb-led. "Sho-uld ha-ve gu-es-sed.
The ra-di-ati-on, of co-ur-se. It wo-uld spe-ed up mu-ta-ti-on. Shor-ter li-fe-spans, pro-bably. You
we-re right, Von der Stadt. Men can't li-ve on bugs and mush-ro-oms. Not men li-ke us. So they
adap-ted. Adap-ted to the dark-ness, and the tun-nels. It-"
Suddenly he star-ted. "Tho-se eyes," he sa-id. He clic-ked off his flash-light, and the walls se-emed to
mo-ve clo-ser. "He must be sen-si-ti-ve. We're hur-ting him. Di-vert yo-ur flash, Von der Stadt."
Von der Stadt ga-ve him a do-ubt-ful si-de-long glan-ce. "It's dark eno-ugh down he-re al-re-ady," he
sa-id. But he obe-yed. His be-am swung away.
"History," Cif-fo-net-to sa-id. "A mo-ment that will li-ve in-"

He ne-ver fi-nis-hed. Von der Stadt was ten-se, trig-ger-edged. As his be-am swung away from the
fi-gu-re down the tun-nel, he ca-ught anot-her flic-ker of mo-ve-ment in the dark-ness. He swung back
and forth, fo-und the thing aga-in, pin-ned it aga-inst the tracks with a be-am of light.
Almost he had shot be-fo-re. But he had he-si-ta-ted, be-ca-use the man-li-ke fi-gu-re had be-en still
and un-fa-mi-li-ar.
This new thing was not still. It squ-e-aled and scur-ri-ed. Nor was it un-fa-mi-li-ar. This ti-me Von der
Stadt did not he-si-ta-te.
There was a ro-ar, a flash. Then a se-cond.
"Got it," sa-id Von der Stadt. "A damn rat."
And Gre-el scre-amed.
After the long bur-ning, the-re had co-me an ins-tant of re-li-ef. But only an ins-tant. Then, sud-denly,
pa-in flo-oded him. Wa-ve af-ter wa-ve af-ter wa-ve. Rol-led over him, blot-ting out the tho-ughts of the
fi-re-men, blot-ting out the-ir fe-ar, blot-ting out his an-ger.
H'ssig di-ed. His mind-brot-her di-ed.
The fi-re-men had kil-led his mind-brot-her.
He shri-eked in pa-in ra-ge. He dar-ted for-ward, swung up his spe-ar.
He ope-ned his eyes. The-re was a flash of vi-si-on, then mo-re pa-in and blind-ness. But the flash
was eno-ugh. He struck. And struck aga-in. Wildly, madly, blow af-ter blow, thrust af-ter thrust.
Then, aga-in, the uni-ver-se tur-ned red with pa-in, and then aga-in so-un-ded that aw-ful ro-ar that
had co-me when H'ssig di-ed. So-met-hing threw him to the tun-nel flo-or, and his eyes ope-ned aga-in,
and fi-re, fi-re was everyw-he-re.
But only for a whi-le. Only for a whi-le. Then, shortly, it was dark-ness aga-in for Gre-el of the
Pe-op-le.
The gun still smo-ked. The hand was still ste-ady. But Von der Stadt's mo-uth hung open as he
lo-oked, un-be-li-eving; from the thing he had blas-ted ac-ross the tun-nel, to the blo-od drip-ping from
his uni-form, then back aga-in.
Then the gun drop-ped, and he clutc-hed at his sto-mach, clutc-hed at the wo-unds. His hand ca-me
away wet with blo-od. He sta-red at it. Then sta-red at Cif-fo-net-to.
"The rat," he sa-id. The-re was pa-in in his vo-ice. "I only shot a rat. It was go-ing for him. Why, Cliff?
I-?"
And he fell. He-avily. His flash-light shat-te-red and went dark.
There was a long fumb-ling in the black-ness. Then, at last, Cif-fo-net-to's light win-ked on, and the
as-hen sci-en-tist knelt be-si-de his com-pa-ni-on.
"Von," he sa-id, tug-ging at the uni-form. "Are you all right?" He rip-ped away the fab-ric to ex-po-se
the torn flesh.
Von der Stadt was mumb-ling. "I didn't even see him co-ming. I to-ok my light away, li-ke you sa-id,
Cliff. Why? I wasn't go-ing to sho-ot him. Not if he was a man. I only shot a rat. Only a rat. It was
go-ing for him, too."
Ciffonetto, who had sto-od pa-raly-zed thro-ugh everyt-hing, nod-ded. "It wasn't yo-ur fa-ult, Von.
But you must ha-ve sca-red him. You ne-ed tre-ating, now, tho-ugh. He hurt you bad. Can you ma-ke it
back to camp?"
He didn't wa-it for an ans-wer. He slip-ped his arm un-der Von der Stadt's, and lif-ted him to his
fe-et, and be-gan to walk him down the tun-nel, pra-ying they co-uld ma-ke it back to the plat-form.
"I only shot a rat," Von der Stadt kept sa-ying, over and over, in a da-zed vo-ice.
"Don't worry," sa-id Cif-fo-net-to. "It won't mat-ter. We'll find ot-hers. We'll se-arch the who-le
sub-way system if we ha-ve to. We'll find them."
"Only a rat. Only a rat."
They re-ac-hed the plat-form. Cif-fo-net-to lo-we-red Von der Stadt back to the gro-und. “I can't
ma-ke the climb car-rying you, Von," he sa-id. "I'll ha-ve to le-ave you he-re. Go for help." He
stra-igh-te-ned, hung the flash from his belt.

"Only a rat," Von der Stadt sa-id aga-in.
"Don't worry," sa-id Cif-fo-net-to. "Even if we don't find them, not-hing will be lost. They we-re
cle-arly sub-hu-man. Men on-ce, may-be. But no mo-re. De-ge-ne-ra-ted. The-re was not-hing they
co-uld ha-ve ta-ught us, any-way."
But Von der Stadt was past lis-te-ning, past he-aring. He just sat aga-inst the wall; clutc-hing his
sto-mach and fe-eling the blo-od ooze from bet-we-en his fin-gers, mumb-ling the sa-me words over and
over.
Ciffonetto tur-ned to the wall. A few short fe-et to the plat-form, then the old, rusty es-ca-la-tor, and
the ba-se-ment ru-ins, and day-light. He had to hurry. Von der Stadt wo-uldn't last long.
He grab-bed the rock, pul-led him-self up, hung on des-pe-ra-tely as his ot-her hand scramb-led and
fo-und a hold. He pul-led up aga-in.
He was al-most the-re, al-most at the plat-form le-vel, when his we-ak lu-nar musc-les ga-ve out on
him. The-re was a sud-den spasm; his hand slip-ped lo-ose, his ot-her hand co-uldn't ta-ke the we-ight.
He fell. On the flash-light.
The dark-ness was li-ke not-hing he had ever se-en. Too thick, too comp-le-te. He fo-ught to ke-ep
from scre-aming.
When he tri-ed to ri-se aga-in, he did scre-am. Mo-re than the flash-light had bro-ken in the fall.
His scre-am ec-ho-ed and re-echo-ed thro-ugh the long, black tun-nel he co-uld not see. It was a
long ti-me dying. When it fi-nal-ly fa-ded, he scre-amed aga-in. And aga-in.
Finally, ho-ar-se, he stop-ped. "Von," he sa-id. "Von, can you he-ar me?" The-re was no ans-wer. He
tri-ed aga-in. Talk, he must talk to hold his sa-nity. The dark-ness was all aro-und him, and he co-uld
al-most he-ar soft mo-ve-ments a few fe-et away.
Von der Stadt gig-gled, so-un-ding in-fi-ni-tely far away.
"It was only a rat," he sa-id. "Only a rat."
Silence. Then, softly, Cif-fo-net-to. "Yes, Von, yes."
"It was only a rat."
"It was only a rat."
"It was only a rat."

VII - TOBIAS S. BUCKELL - WAITING FOR THE ZEPHYR
The Zephyr was al-most fi-ve days over-due.
Wind lif-ted the dust off in lit-tle de-vils of twis-ting co-lumns that ran-domly to-uc-hed down
thro-ug-ho-ut the re-ma-ins of the town. Furt-her out be-yond the hulks of the Su-per Wal-Mart and
Kro-ger's Ma-ra sto-od and swept the bi-no-cu-lars. The plat-form she sto-od on re-ac-hed up a go-od
hund-red fe-et en-ding in the bul-bo-us wa-ter tank that wa-te-red the town, af-for-ding her a lo-ok just
over the ed-ge of the ho-ri-zon. She stra-ined her eyes for the fa-mi-li-ar sha-pe of the Zephyrs fo-ur
bla-de li-ke masts, but saw not-hing but dirt-twis-ters.
The old asp-halt high-way, la-id down back in the ti-me of plenty, had fi-nal-ly suc-cum-bed to the
ad-van-cing dirt des-pi-te the town's best at-tempts to ke-ep it out. The bar-ri-ers lay on the-ir si-de.
Mara still knew the twists and turns of the high-way she'd me-mo-ri-zed sin-ce twel-ve, when she'd
first re-ali-zed it led to ot-her towns and pe-op-le.
"Mara, it's get-ting dark."
"Yes, Ken."
Ken ca-re-ful-ly put the bi-no-cu-lars in-to the-ir po-uch and clim-bed down the si-de of the to-wer.
Pus-hing off down the dust pi-led at its fe-et she trud-ged down to Ken, now only a lar-ge sil-ho-u-et-te
in the sud-denly ap-pro-ac-hing dusk.
"Your mot-her still wants to talk to you." Ma-ra didn't res-pond.
"She wants to work it out," Ken con-ti-nu-ed.
"I'm le-aving. I've wan-ted to le-ave sin-ce I was twel-ve, co-me on, Ken… don't start this aga-in."

Ma-ra star-ted wal-king qu-ickly to-wards the ho-use.
Ken matc-hed her pa-ce, and even tho-ugh she co-uld see him won-de-ring what to say next, she
co-uld al-so see him exa-mi-ning the farm out of his pe-rip-he-ral vi-si-on. The-ir farm de-fi-ed the dust
and wind with lush gre-en growth, but only be-ca-use it lay un-der-ne-ath pro-tec-ti-ve glass. Ken
pa-used slightly twi-ce, chec-king cracks in the fa-ca-de, are-as whe-re dust tri-ed to le-ak in.
"Their wind ge-ne-ra-tor is down. They ne-ed help, Ma-ra. I sa-id I wo-uld go over to-mor-row."
Mara sig-hed.
"I re-al-ly don't want to."
Ken ope-ned the outer do-or for her, stam-ping his bo-ots cle-an and let-ting it shut, then pas-sed
thro-ugh as she ope-ned the se-cond do-or. Dust slip-ped in everyw-he-re and co-ve-red everyt-hing
des-pi-te pre-ca-uti-ons. Bro-oms didn't qu-ite get it all. Alt-ho-ugh Ken tho-ught them a use-less
ne-ces-sity, Ma-ra tho-ught the idea of a va-cu-um cle-aner qu-ite fetc-hing.
"I ne-ed yo-ur help, Ma-ra, just for an af-ter-no-on. You wo-uldn't fe-el right le-aving so-me-one
wit-ho-ut elect-ri-city, wo-uld you?"
Ken was right, wit-ho-ut the wind-ge-ne-ra-tor her pa-rents wo-uld be wit-ho-ut po-wer.
"Okay. I'll help." Ken, she no-ti-ced, ever the won-der with his hands, al-re-ady had a din-ner set for
the two of them. Des-pi-te be-ing slightly cold from sit-ting out, it was won-der-ful.
The Zephyr was six days over-due.
Mara shim-mi-ed up the ro-of and jo-ined Ken. He al-re-ady had parts of the wind-ge-ne-ra-tor
la-ying out on the ro-of. She had just ma-na-ged to brush past her fat-her wit-ho-ut be-ing physi-cal-ly
stop-ped. Mot-her sto-od aro-und, lo-oking wo-un-ded and help-less.
Ken ma-de a fa-ce.
"The bla-de is all right. But the al-ter-na-tor is bur-ned out."
Simple eno-ugh to fix. The wind ge-ne-ra-tors con-sis-ted of no mo-re than an old auto-mo-bi-le
al-ter-na-tor at-tac-hed to a pro-pel-ler bla-de and swi-vel mo-un-ted on the ro-of. What elect-ri-city
the ho-uses had de-pen-ded on de-ep cycle bat-te-ri-es that used the wind ge-ne-ra-tors to rec-har-ge.
So-lar pa-nels wor-ked in so-me are-as, but he-re the dust crept in-to them, and un-li-ke wind
ge-ne-ra-tors, didn't work at night. Plus, it was easy eno-ugh to wan-der out to a car lot and pick an
al-ter-na-tor out of the tho-usands of de-ad cars.
Mara half sus-pec-ted her fat-her had cal-led them for help just to get her out to his farm. Dam-nit.
"Mara," her fat-her sa-id from the ed-ge of the dust gut-ter. "We ne-ed to talk." Ma-ra lo-oked
stra-ight out over the ed-ge, out at the mi-les and mi-les of brown ho-ri-zon. "Ma-ra, lo-ok at me.
Ma-ra, we spo-ke harshly. We're sorry."
"We li-ke Ken," her mot-her chi-med in from be-low. "But you're yo-ung. You can't mo-ve out just
yet."
"Come back, ho-ney. We co-uld use yo-ur help on the farm. You wo-uldn't be as busy as you are
with Ken."
Ken lo-oked up at that with a half-pa-ined grin. Ma-ra swo-re and slid off the low end off the ro-of,
hit-ting the dust with a grunt. Her fat-her star-ted back down the lad-der but Ma-ra was al-re-ady in the
cart, pul-ling up the sa-il and bo-un-cing out ac-ross the dust back to-wards the re-la-ti-ve sa-fety of
Ken's farm, le-aving her mot-her's pla-in-ti-ve ent-re-ati-es in the dusk air be-hind her.
Damn, how co-uld she ha-ve fal-len for that? Her pa-rents we-re so ob-vi-o-us. And Ken, she
fu-med on her way back. He sho-uldn't ha-ve ta-ken her over.
Even af-ter he sho-wed up, she-epishly co-oking yet anot-her mar-vel-lo-us me-al, she tri-ed to
re-ma-in angry. But the an-ger even-tu-al-ly sub-si-ded, as it al-ways did.
On the se-venth and eighth day of wa-iting re-cep-ti-on cle-ared up eno-ugh for the both of them to
catch so-me bro-ad-casts from furt-her north. Ken had eno-ugh char-ge in the ho-use bat-te-ri-es for
al-most eight ho-urs of te-le-vi-si-on shows, and they both cud-dled on the co-uch.

Mara be-gan to won-der if the Zephyr wo-uld ever show. The last vi-sit was two ye-ars ago, when
the gi-ant, whe-eled ca-ra-van sa-iled in-to town for a day. Tra-ders and merc-hants fes-to-oned its
va-ri-o-us decks with smi-les and stalls.
The Zephyr, Ma-ra knew from talks to its brid-ge crew, was one of the few links the outer towns of
Ame-ri-ca still had with the lar-ge ci-ti-es, and each ot-her. Ever sin-ce the pet-ro-le-um col-lap-se, with
the Mid-dle East nu-ked in-to ob-li-vi-on and por-ti-ons of Euro-pe glo-wing, the co-untry had be-en
trying to rep-la-ce an en-ti-re inf-rast-ruc-tu-re ba-sed on oil.
Almost two ge-ne-ra-ti-ons la-ter it was suc-ce-eding.
The lar-ge ci-ti-es used mo-re nuc-le-ar po-wer, or even har-nes-sed the se-wer systems, but small
towns we-re hit the har-dest. Ac-cus-to-med to po-wer, but drop-ped off the li-ne, iso-la-ted, a mi-nor
Dark Age had des-cen-ded on them. Li-fe ba-sed it-self he-re on ba-re es-sen-ti-als; wa-ter and wind.
Mara wan-ted to see a city lit up in a wan-ton elect-ri-cal bla-ze of light, for-cing away the dusk and
night with ar-ti-fi-ci-al man-ma-de day.
On the tenth day Ken fo-und her in the bed-ro-om fran-ti-cal-ly pac-king. "They spot-ted the Zephyr
co-ming in from the east," Ma-ra sa-id, ho-is-ting a pack on-to her sho-ul-ders.
"Are you su-re you want to do this?"
"What?"
"Go. You don't know what's out the-re. Stran-ge pla-ces, stran-ge pe-op-le. Dan-ger." Ma-ra
lo-oked at him. "Of co-ur-se."
Ken lo-oked down at the gro-und.
"I tho-ught we had so-met-hing. You, me."
"Of co-ur-se." Ma-ra pa-used. "I told you that I wo-uld be go-ing." "But I'd ho-ped…"
"Ken. I can’t."
"Go." His vo-ice har-de-ned, and he wal-ked in-to the kitc-hen. Ma-ra sat on the ed-ge of the bed
bi-ting back te-ars, then snatc-hed the two packs and left ang-rily.
The Zephyr rol-led thro-ugh Ma-in Stre-et, slo-wing down to a re-la-ti-ve crawl to al-low pe-op-le to
run along-si-de and le-ap up. Kids thron-ged the si-des of the stre-et, and fu-ri-o-us tra-de went on. The
fo-ur tall masts of the Zephyr to-we-red abo-ve the small two- and three-story town bu-il-dings. The
masts lo-oked li-ke ver-ti-cal wings, and used the sa-me prin-cip-les. Air flo-wing ac-ross the shor-ter
ed-ge of the bla-de li-ke mast ca-used a va-cu-um, dra-wing the mas-si-ve whe-eled ship for-ward.
Mara fol-lo-wed the eager crowd be-hind the ship. She nod-ded to the oc-ca-si-onal fa-mi-li-ar
fa-ce.
Plastic be-ads, mo-re pre-ci-o-us than gold due the ra-rity of oils, we-re dra-ped ac-ross stalls that
slid out of the si-de of the hull. Ma-ra aimed her qu-ick walk for one of the-se, but ins-te-ad fo-und
her-self bloc-ked by a fa-mi-li-ar form.
"Uncle Dan?"
"Hi." He had her arm in a firm grip. Ma-ra saw the bulk of the Zephyr slowly mo-ving away. She
tri-ed to pull out of his grip, but co-uldn't. Her dad pus-hed thro-ugh the crowd.
"Dad! What are you do-ing?"
"It's for yo-ur own go-od, Ma-ra," Unc-le Dan sa-id. "You don't know what you're do-ing."
"Yes I do," she yel-led, kic-king at her unc-le's shins. The crowd aro-und them pa-id no ob-vi-o-us
at-ten-ti-on, alt-ho-ugh Ma-ra knew full well that by night ti-me it wo-uld be the talk of the area.
She beg-ged, ple-aded, yel-led, kic-ked, scratc-hed and fo-ught. But the men of the ho-use al-re-ady
had the-ir minds ma-de. They loc-ked her in-to the ba-se-ment.
"You'll be out when the Zephyr le-aves," Mom pro-mi-sed.
There we-re no win-dows. Ma-ra co-uld only ima-gi-ne the Zephyrs slow prog-ress out of the town.
She tri-ed to put a bra-ve fa-ce on, then craw-led in-to a cor-ner and cri-ed. Af-ter that she be-at on the
do-or, but no ca-me to let her out.

The ba-se-ment was a com-for-tab-le area. The fa-mily den, it held se-ve-ral co-uc-hes and car-pet.
The do-or cre-aked open, and from lo-oking out Ma-ra gu-es-sed it to be dusk. Ken ca-me down the
sta-irs ca-re-ful-ly.
"It's me, Ma-ra."
"I sup-po-se you're in on this too?"
"Actually, no. You're fa-mily wants me to spe-ak so-me sen-se in-to you. I won't lie to you, Ma-ra. I
want you to stay. But hol-ding you he-re li-ke this is ri-di-cu-lo-us." "The lon-ger we all stay out he-re,
away from the ci-ti-es, the cra-zi-er it gets." "May-be. You're fa-mily's sca-red. They don't want to lo-se
you."
"That do-esn't gi-ve them the right to lock me up li-ke a damn dog!" Ma-ra yel-led. Ken ca-me
clo-ser.
"My sa-il-cart is out-si-de. That's as far as you ne-ed to get. You're a bet-ter sa-ilor than an-yo-ne
el-se, on-ce in you can out-run ever-yo-ne. The Zephyr is still re-ac-hab-le on a long tack. Hey, I ne-ver
did get along with yo-ur unc-le any-way."
Mara lo-oked up at him and ga-ve him a long hug.
"Thank you so much."
"If you're ever back in town, lo-ok me up."
"Will you co-me with me, then?"
"Ask me then."
Ken pul-led away and step-ped up the sta-irs.
"Stay clo-se."
He la-unc-hed him-self in-to her unc-le and dad, tack-ling them with a lo-ud yell. Ma-ra ran past,
lo-sing only a shoe, pus-hing past her mom and out in-to the yard.
The cart's sa-il puf-fed out with a snap, and she was bo-un-cing her way over the sand be-fo-re she
lo-oked back to see two fi-gu-res at the do-or watc-hing her go. No one bot-he-red to cha-se her. They
all knew her skill with the sa-il.
It to-ok the bet-ter part of a few ho-urs be-fo-re the fo-ur masts sho-wed up. Ma-ra co-uld he-ar
dis-tant sho-uting as she over-ha-uled the gi-ant land ship. "Ahoy Zephyr" she sho-uted.
Someone tos-sed a lad-der down, and Ma-ra ha-uled her-self up. The small sa-il-cart ve-ered off and
tip-ped in-to the dust, snap-ping its tiny mast in two. It felt fa-intly li-be-ra-ting to land on the deck with a
smi-le.
The merc-hant with the lad-der step-ped asi-de, let-ting an of-fi-cer in kha-ki step for-ward.
"We've be-en watc-hing you ap-pro-ach for the past few ho-urs," he sa-id. "We li-ke the way you
hand-le the wind."
"Can you re-ad a map?" as-ked a wo-man in uni-form. She wo-re stran-ge bra-ids on her
sho-ul-ders.
"No."
"You lo-oking for a po-si-ti-on on bo-ard the ship?" "Yes." Ma-ra felt her sto-mach flip-flop.
"Then we'll te-ach you how to re-ad charts," the wo-man sa-id. She stuck out a hand. "Wel-co-me
abo-ard, kid, I'm Cap-ta-in Sha-na. Ever cross me or gi-ve me a re-ason to, I'll toss you off the si-de of
the ship and le-ave you to the vul-tu-res. Un-ders-to-od?" Yes ma am.
"Good. Gi-ve her a ham-mock."
Mara sto-od on the deck of the Zephyr, enj-oying the mo-ment. Then the man in uni-form to-uc-hed
her sho-ul-der.
"It isn't fun and ga-mes; it's a lot of hard work, but worth it. Co-me on."
Mara pa-used and lo-oked out at the flat ho-ri-zon, full of temp-ting fu-tu-res. Then she fol-lo-wed
him be-low decks.

VIII - JACK MCDEVITT - NEVER DESPAIR

The ra-in be-gan to fall as they threw the last few spa-de-fuls of earth on-to the gra-ve.
Quait bo-wed his he-ad and mur-mu-red the tra-di-ti-onal fa-re-well. Cha-ka lo-oked at the wo-oden
mar-ker, which bo-re Flo-j-i-an's na-me, his da-tes, and the le-gend FAR FROM HO-ME.
She hadn't ca-red all that much for Flo-j-i-an. He was self-cen-te-red and he comp-la-ined a lot and
he al-ways knew bet-ter ways to do things. But you co-uld co-unt on him to pull his we-ight, and now
the-re we-re only two of them.
Quait fi-nis-hed, lo-oked up, and nod-ded. Her turn. She was glad it was over. The po-or son of a
bitch had fal-len on his he-ad out of the up-per le-vel of a ru-in, and du-ring fo-ur exc-ru-ci-ating days,
they'd be-en ab-le to do lit-tle for him. Po-int-less, silly way to die. "Flo-j-i-an," she sa-id, "we'll miss
you." She let it go at that be-ca-use she me-ant it, and the ra-in was co-ming har-der.
They ret-re-ated to the-ir hor-ses. Qu-a-it pac-ked his spa-de be-hind his sad-dle and mo-un-ted in
that awk-ward way that al-ways left her won-de-ring whet-her Light-fo-ot wo-uld chuck him off on the
ot-her si-de.
She sto-od lo-oking up at him.
"What's wrong?" He wi-ped the back of his hand aga-inst his che-ek. His hat was jam-med down on
his he-ad. Wa-ter spil-led out of it on-to his sho-ul-ders.
"It's ti-me to gi-ve it up," Cha-ka sa-id. "Go ho-me. If we can." Thun-der rumb-led. It was get-ting
very dark.
"Not the best ti-me to dis-cuss this." Qu-a-it wa-ited for her to get on her hor-se. The ra-in po-un-ded
the soft earth, fell in-to the tre-es.
She lo-oked back to-ward the gra-ve. Flo-j-i-an lay with the ru-ins now, bu-ri-ed li-ke them
be-ne-ath the rol-ling hills and the bro-ad fo-rest. It was the sort of gra-ve he wo-uld ha-ve pre-fer-red,
she sup-po-sed. He li-ked stuff that had be-en de-ad a long ti-me. She pul-led her jac-ket tight and
clim-bed in-to the sad-dle. Qu-a-it mo-ved off at a brisk trot.
They'd bu-ri-ed him at the top of the hig-hest rid-ge in the area. Now they ro-de slowly along the
crest, pic-king the-ir way among bro-ken conc-re-te casts and pet-ri-fi-ed tim-bers and cor-ro-ded
me-tal, the det-ri-tus of the old world, sin-king slowly in-to the gro-und. The deb-ris had be-en
sof-te-ned by ti-me: earth and grass had ro-un-ded the rub-ble, spil-led over it, ab-sor-bed its sharp
ed-ges. Even-tu-al-ly, she sup-po-sed, not-hing wo-uld be left, and vi-si-tors wo-uld stand on the ru-ins
and not know they we-re even he-re.
Quait bent aga-inst the ra-in, his hat pul-led low over his eyes, his right hand pres-sed aga-inst
Light-fo-ot's flank. He lo-oked worn and ti-red and dis-co-ura-ged, and Cha-ka re-ali-zed for the first
ti-me that he too had gi-ven up. That he was only wa-iting for so-me-one el-se to ta-ke res-pon-si-bi-lity
for ad-mit-ting fa-ilu-re.
They drop-ped down off the rid-ge, and ro-de thro-ugh a nar-row de-fi-le bor-de-red by blocks and
slabs.
"You okay?" he as-ked.
Chaka was fi-ne. Sca-red. Ex-ha-us-ted. Won-de-ring what they wo-uld say to the wi-dows and
mot-hers when they got ho-me. The-re had be-en six when they star-ted. "Yes," she sa-id. "I'm okay."
The grot-to lay ahe-ad, a squ-are black mo-uth rim-med by chalks-to-ne and half-hid-den by a
brac-ken. They'd left a fi-re bur-ning, and it lo-oked warm and go-od. They dis-mo-un-ted, and led
the-ir hor-ses in-si-de.
Quait threw a co-up-le of logs on-to the bla-ze. "Cold out the-re," he sa-id.
Lightning flas-hed in the ent-ran-ce.
They put the te-apot on-to its bo-iling rock, fed and wa-te-red the ani-mals, chan-ged in-to dry
clot-hes, and sank down in front of the fi-re. They didn't talk much for a long ti-me. Cha-ka sat,
wrap-ped in a blan-ket, enj-oying be-ing warm and away from the ra-in. Qu-a-it ma-de so-me no-tes in
the jo-ur-nal, trying to es-tab-lish the si-te of Flo-j-i-an's gra-ve, so that fu-tu-re tra-ve-lers, if the-re
we-re any, co-uld find it. Af-ter a whi-le he sig-hed and lo-oked up, not at her, but over her sho-ul-der,

in-to the mid-dle dis-tan-ce. "You re-al-ly think we sho-uld turn aro-und?"
"Yeah. I think we've had eno-ugh. Ti-me to go ho-me."
He nod-ded. "I ha-te to go back li-ke this."
"Me too. But it's ti-me." It was hard to gu-ess what the grot-to had be-en. It was not a ca-ve. The
walls we-re ar-ti-fi-ci-al. Wha-te-ver co-lo-ur they might on-ce ha-ve pos-ses-sed had be-en was-hed
away. Now they we-re gray and sta-ined, and they cur-ved in-to a high ce-iling. A pat-tern of slan-ted
li-nes, pro-bably in-ten-ded for de-co-ra-ti-ve ef-fect, cut thro-ugh them. The grot-to was wi-de, wi-der
than the co-un-cil hall, which co-uld ac-com-mo-da-te a hund-red pe-op-le; and it went far back un-der
the hill. Mi-les, may-be.
As a ge-ne-ral prin-cip-le, she avo-ided the ru-ins when she co-uld. It wasn't easy be-ca-use they
we-re everyw-he-re. But all sorts of crit-ters ma-de the-ir ho-mes among them. And the struc-tu-res
we-re dan-ge-ro-us, as Flo-j-i-an had fo-und out. Pro-ne to ca-ve-ins, col-lap-sing flo-ors, you na-me
it. The re-al re-ason, tho-ugh, was that she had he-ard too many sto-ri-es abo-ut spect-res and de-mons
among the crumb-ling walls. She was not su-pers-ti-ti-o-us, and wo-uld ne-ver ha-ve ad-mit-ted her
dis-com-fort to Qu-a-it. Still, you ne-ver knew.
They had fo-und the grot-to a few ho-urs af-ter Flo-j-i-an got hurt, and mo-ved in, gra-te-ful for the
shel-ter. But she was an-xi-o-us to be go-ne now.
Thunder sho-ok the walls, and they co-uld he-ar the ste-ady rhythm of ra-in-wa-ter po-uring off the
rid-ge. It was still la-te af-ter-no-on, but all the light had dra-ined out of the day.
"Tea sho-uld be re-ady," sa-id Cha-ka.
Quait sho-ok his he-ad. "I ha-te to gi-ve it up. We'll al-ways won-der if it might ha-ve be-en over the
next hill."
She had just pic-ked up the pot and be-gun to po-ur when a bolt exp-lo-ded di-rectly over-he-ad.
"Clo-se," she sa-id, gra-te-ful for the pro-tec-ti-on of the grot-to.
Quait smi-led, to-ok his tea, and lif-ted it in a mock to-ast to wha-te-ver po-wers li-ved in the area.
"May-be you're right," he sa-id. "May-be we sho-uld ta-ke the hint."
The bolt was drawn by a cor-ro-ded cros-spi-ece, a mis-sha-pen chunk of dis-sol-ving me-tal jut-ting
from the si-de of the hill. Most of the energy dis-si-pa-ted in-to the gro-und. But so-me of it le-aped to a
bu-ri-ed cab-le, fol-lo-wed it down to a mel-ted junc-ti-on box, flo-wed thro-ugh a se-ri-es of
con-du-its, and lit up se-ve-ral an-ci-ent cir-cu-it bo-ards. One of the cir-cu-it bo-ards re-la-yed po-wer
in-to a long-dor-mant auxi-li-ary system; anot-her tur-ned on an ar-ray of sen-sors which be-gan to
ta-ke no-te of so-unds in the grot-to. And a third, af-ter an ap-prop-ri-ate de-lay, threw a switch and
ac-ti-va-ted the only prog-ram that still sur-vi-ved.
They ate well. Cha-ka had co-me ac-ross an un-lucky tur-key that mor-ning, and Qu-a-it ad-ded
so-me ber-ri-es and fresh-ba-ked bis-cu-it. They'd long sin-ce ex-ha-us-ted the-ir sto-re of wi-ne, but a
bro-ok ran thro-ugh the grot-to abo-ut sixty yards back, and the wa-ter was cle-ar and cold.
"It's not as if we ha-ve any re-ason to think we're clo-se," sa-id Cha-ka. "I'm not su-re I be-li-eve in it
any-way. Even if it is out the-re, the pri-ce is too high."
The storm eased with the co-ming of night. Ra-in still fell ste-adily, but it was light ra-in, not much
mo-re than mist.
Quait tal-ked ex-ten-si-vely thro-ugh the eve-ning, abo-ut his am-bi-ti-ons, abo-ut how im-por-tant it
was to find out who had bu-ilt the gre-at ci-ti-es scat-te-red thro-ugh the wil-der-ness, and what had
hap-pe-ned to them, and abo-ut mas-te-ring the an-ci-ent wi-zard-ri-es. But she was cor-rect, he kept
sa-ying, glan-cing her way, pa-using to gi-ve her a chan-ce to in-ter-rupt. It was bet-ter to be sa-fe than
sorry. "Damn right," sa-id Cha-ka.
It was warm ne-ar the fi-re, and af-ter a whi-le Qu-a-it fell as-le-ep. He'd lost twenty po-unds sin-ce
they'd left Il-lyria ten we-eks be-fo-re. He had aged, and the go-od-hu-mo-ured nonc-ha-lan-ce that had
at-trac-ted her du-ring the early days had di-sap-pe-ared. Qu-a-it was all bu-si-ness now.
She tri-ed to sha-ke off her sen-se of des-pa-ir. They we-re a long way from ho-me, alo-ne in a

wil-der-ness fil-led with sa-va-ges and de-mons and de-ad ci-ti-es in which lights blin-ked and mu-sic
pla-yed and mec-ha-ni-cal things mo-ved. She shrank down in her blan-kets and lis-te-ned to the wa-ter
drip-ping off the tre-es. A log bro-ke and fell in-to the fi-re.
She was not su-re what bro-ught her out of it, but she was sud-denly awa-ke, sen-ses alert.
Someone, out-li-ned in mo-on-light, il-lu-mi-na-ted from be-hind by the fi-re, was stan-ding at the exit
to the grot-to, lo-oking out. Be-si-de her, Qu-a-it's chest gently ro-se and fell.
She was using her sad-dle bag for a pil-low. Wit-ho-ut any vi-sib-le mo-ve-ment, she eased her gun
out of it.
The fi-gu-re ap-pe-ared to be a man, so-mew-hat thick at the wa-ist, dres-sed in pe-cu-li-ar clot-hes.
He wo-re a dark jac-ket and dark tro-users of matc-hing style, a hat with a ro-un-ded top, and he
car-ri-ed a wal-king stick. The-re was a red glow ne-ar his mo-uth that al-ter-na-tely dim-med and
brigh-te-ned. She de-tec-ted an do-or that might ha-ve be-en bur-ning we-ed.
"Don't mo-ve," she sa-id softly, ri-sing to conf-ront the ap-pa-ri-ti-on. "I ha-ve a gun."
He tur-ned, lo-oked cu-ri-o-usly at her, and a clo-ud of smo-ke ro-se over his he-ad. He was
in-de-ed puf-fing on so-met-hing. And the smell was vi-le. "So you do," he sa-id. "I ho-pe you won't use
it."
He didn't se-em suf-fi-ci-ently imp-res-sed. "I me-an it," she sa-id.
"I'm sorry." He smi-led. "I didn't me-an to wa-ke you." He wo-re a whi-te shirt and a dark blue
rib-bon ti-ed in a bow at his thro-at. The rib-bon was sprink-led with whi-te pol-ka dots. His ha-ir was
whi-te, and he had gruff, al-most fi-er-ce, fe-atu-res. The-re was so-met-hing of the bul-ldog abo-ut him.
He ad-van-ced a co-up-le of pa-ces and re-mo-ved his hat.
"What are you do-ing he-re?" she as-ked. "Who are you?"
"I li-ve he-re, yo-ung lady."
"Where?" She glan-ced aro-und at the ba-re walls, which se-emed to mo-ve in the flic-ke-ring light.
"Here." He lif-ted his arms to in-di-ca-te the grot-to and to-ok anot-her step for-ward.
She glan-ced at the gun and back at him. "That's far eno-ugh," she sa-id. "Don't think I wo-uld
he-si-ta-te."
"I'm su-re you wo-uldn't, yo-ung lady." The stern cast of his fe-atu-res dis-sol-ved in-to an ami-ab-le
smi-le. "I'm re-al-ly not dan-ge-ro-us."
"Are you alo-ne?" she as-ked, ta-king a qu-ick lo-ok be-hind her. Not-hing stir-red in the depths of
the ca-ve.
"I am now. Frank-lin used to be he-re. And Ab-ra-ham Lin-coln. And an Ame-ri-can sin-ger. A
gu-itar pla-yer, as I re-call. Ac-tu-al-ly the-re used to be a con-si-de-rab-le crowd of us."
Chaka didn't li-ke the way the con-ver-sa-ti-on was go-ing. It so-un-ded as if he we-re trying to
dist-ract her. "If I get any surp-ri-ses," she sa-id, "the first bul-let's for you."
"It is go-od to ha-ve vi-si-tors aga-in. The last few ti-mes I've be-en up and abo-ut, the bu-il-ding's
be-en empty."
"Really?" What bu-il-ding?
"Oh, yes. We used to draw subs-tan-ti-al crowds. But the benc-hes and the gal-lery ha-ve go-ne
mis-sing." He lo-oked slowly aro-und. "I won-der what hap-pe-ned." "What is yo-ur na-me?" she sa-id.
He lo-oked puz-zled. Al-most ta-ken aback. "You don't know?" He le-aned on his ca-ne and
stu-di-ed her clo-sely. "Then I think the-re is not much po-int to this con-ver-sa-ti-on."
"How wo-uld I know you? We've ne-ver met." She wa-ited for a res-pon-se. When no-ne ca-me, she
con-ti-nu-ed: "I am Cha-ka of Il-lyria."
The man bo-wed slightly. "I sup-po-se, un-der the cir-cums-tan-ces, you must call me Wins-ton." He
drew his jac-ket abo-ut him. "It is drafty. Why don't we re-ti-re to the fi-re-si-de, Cha-ka of Il-lyria?"
If he we-re hos-ti-le, she and Qu-a-it wo-uld al-re-ady be de-ad. Or wor-se. She lo-we-red the
we-apon and put it in her belt. "I'm surp-ri-sed to find an-yo-ne he-re. No of-fen-se, but this pla-ce
lo-oks as if it has be-en de-ser-ted a long ti-me."
"Yes. It do-es, do-esn't it?"

She glan-ced at Qu-a-it, de-ad to the world. Lot of go-od he'd ha-ve be-en if Tuks ca-me sne-aking
up in the night. "Whe-re ha-ve you be-en?" she as-ked. "I beg yo-ur par-don?"
"We've be-en he-re se-ve-ral days. Whe-re ha-ve you be-en?"
He lo-oked un-cer-ta-in. "I'm not su-re," he sa-id. "I was cer-ta-inly he-re. I'm al-ways he-re." He
lo-we-red him-self uns-te-adily to the gro-und and held his hands up to the fi-re. "Fe-els go-od."
"It is cold."
"You ha-ven't any brandy, by chan-ce, I don't sup-po-se?"
What was brandy? "No," she sa-id. "We don't."
"Pity. It's go-od for old bo-nes." He shrug-ged and lo-oked aro-und. "Stran-ge," he sa-id. "Do you
know what's hap-pe-ned?"
"No." She didn't even un-ders-tand the qu-es-ti-on. "I ha-ve no idea."
Winston pla-ced his hat in his lap. "The pla-ce lo-oks qu-ite aban-do-ned," he sa-id. So-me-how, the
fact of de-so-la-ti-on ac-qu-ired sig-ni-fi-can-ce from his ha-ving no-ted it. "I reg-ret to say I ha-ve
ne-ver he-ard of Il-lyria. Whe-re is it, may I ask?"
"Several we-eks to the so-uth-west. In the val-ley of the Ma-wa-gon-di."
"I see." His to-ne sug-ges-ted very cle-arly that he did not see. "And who are the Ma-wa-gon-di?"
"It is a ri-ver. Do you re-al-ly not know of it?"
He pe-ered in-to her eyes. "I fe-ar the-re is a gre-at de-al I do not know." His mo-od se-emed to
ha-ve dar-ke-ned. "Are you and yo-ur fri-end go-ing ho-me?" he as-ked. "No," she sa-id. "We se-ek
Ha-ven."
"You are wel-co-me to stay he-re," sa-id Wins-ton. "But I do not think you will find it very
com-for-tab-le."
"Thank you, no. I was re-fer-ring to the Ha-ven. And I know how that so-unds."
Winston nod-ded, and his fo-re-he-ad crink-led. The-re was a bro-oding fi-re in his eyes. "Is it ne-ar
Bos-ton?"
Chaka lo-oked over at Qu-a-it and won-de-red whet-her she sho-uld wa-ke him. "I don't know," she
sa-id. "Whe-re is Bos-ton?"
That bro-ught a wi-de smi-le. "Well," he sa-id, "it cer-ta-inly ap-pe-ars one of us is ter-ribly lost. I
won-der which of us it is."
She saw the glint in his eye and re-tur-ned the smi-le. She un-ders-to-od what he was sa-ying in his
oddly ac-cen-ted dic-ti-on: they we-re both lost.
"Where's Bos-ton?" she as-ked aga-in.
"Forty mi-les east. Stra-ight down the high-way."
"What high-way? The-re's no high-way out the-re anyw-he-re. At le-ast no-ne that I've se-en."
The ci-gar tip brigh-te-ned and dim-med. "Oh, my. It must be a long ti-me." She pul-led up her kne-es
and wrap-ped her arms aro-und them. "Wins-ton, I re-al-ly don't un-ders-tand much of this
con-ver-sa-ti-on."
"Nor do I." His eyes lo-oked de-ep in-to hers. "What is this Ha-ven?" She was shoc-ked at his
ig-no-ran-ce. "You are not se-ri-o-us." "I am qu-ite se-ri-o-us. Ple-ase en-ligh-ten me."
Well, af-ter all he was li-ving out he-re in the wil-der-ness. How co-uld she ex-pect him to know such
things? "Ha-ven was the ho-me of Ab-ra-ham Polk," she sa-id ho-pe-ful-ly.
Winston sho-ok his he-ad she-epishly. "Try aga-in," he sa-id.
"Polk li-ved at the end of the age of the Ro-ad ma-kers. He knew the world was col-lap-sing, that the
ci-ti-es we-re dying. He sa-ved what he co-uld. The tre-asu-res. The know-led-ge. The his-tory.
Everyt-hing. And he sto-red it in a fort-ress with an un-der-sea ent-ran-ce."
"An un-der-sea ent-ran-ce," sa-id Wins-ton. "How do you pro-po-se to get in?" "I don't think we
shall," sa-id Cha-ka. "I be-li-eve we will gi-ve it up at this po-int and go ho-me." Wins-ton nod-ded.
"The fi-re's get-ting low," he sa-id.
She po-ked at it, and ad-ded a log. "No one even knows whet-her Polk re-al-ly li-ved. He may only
be a le-gend."
Light fil-led the grot-to ent-ran-ce. Se-conds la-ter, thun-der rumb-led. "Ha-ven so-unds qu-ite a lot

li-ke Ca-me-lot," he sa-id.
What the de-vil was Ca-me-lot?
"You've imp-li-ed," he con-ti-nu-ed af-ter ta-king a mo-ment to enj-oy his we-ed, "that the world
out-si-de is in ru-ins."
"Oh, no. The world out-si-de is lo-vely."
"But the-re are ru-ins?" "Yes."
"Extensive?"
"They fill the fo-rests, clog the ri-vers, lie in the shal-low wa-ters of the har-bo-urs. They are
everyw-he-re. So-me are even ac-ti-ve, in stran-ge ways. The-re is, for examp-le, a tra-in that still runs,
on which no one ri-des."
"And what do you know of the-ir bu-il-ders?"
She shrug-ged. "Very lit-tle. Al-most not-hing."
"Their sec-rets are loc-ked in this Ha-ven?"
"Yes."
"Which you are abo-ut to turn yo-ur back on." "We're ex-ha-us-ted, Wins-ton."
"Your dri-ving cu-ri-osity, Cha-ka, le-aves me bre-ath-less."
Damn. "Lo-ok, its easy eno-ugh for you to po-int a fin-ger. You ha-ve no idea what we've be-en
thro-ugh. No-ne."
Winston sta-red ste-adily at her. "I'm su-re I don't. But the pri-ze is very gre-at. And the sea is
clo-se."
"There are only two of us left," she sa-id.
"The tur-nings of his-tory are ne-ver di-rec-ted by crowds," he sa-id. "Nor by the ca-uti-o-us.
Al-ways, it is the lo-ne cap-ta-in who sets the co-ur-se." "It's over. We'll be lucky to get ho-me ali-ve."
"That may al-so be true. And cer-ta-inly go-ing on to yo-ur go-al en-ta-ils a gre-at risk. But you must
de-ci-de whet-her the pri-ze is not worth the risk." "We will de-ci-de. I ha-ve a part-ner in the
en-terp-ri-se." "He will abi-de by yo-ur de-ci-si-on. It is up to you."
She tri-ed to hold angry te-ars back. "We've do-ne eno-ugh. It wo-uld be un-re-aso-nab-le to go on."
"The va-lue of re-ason is of-ten exag-ge-ra-ted, Cha-ka. It wo-uld ha-ve be-en re-aso-nab-le to
ac-cept Hit-ler's of-fer of terms in 1940."
"What?"
He wa-ved the qu-es-ti-on away. "It's of no con-se-qu-en-ce. But re-ason, un-der pres-su-re,
usu-al-ly pro-du-ces pru-den-ce when bold-ness is cal-led for." "I am not a co-ward, Wins-ton."
"I did not imply you are." He bit down hard on his we-ed. A blue clo-ud drif-ted to-ward her. It hurt
her eyes and she bac-ked away.
"Are you a ghost?" she as-ked. The qu-es-ti-on did not se-em at all fo-olish.
"I sus-pect I am. I'm so-met-hing left be-hind by the ret-re-ating ti-de." The fi-re glo-wed in his eyes.
"I won-der whet-her, when an event is no lon-ger re-mem-be-red by any li-ving per-son, it lo-ses all
sig-ni-fi-can-ce. Whet-her it is as if it ne-ver hap-pe-ned?"
Quait stir-red in his sle-ep, but did not wa-ke.
"I'm su-re I don't know," sa-id Cha-ka.
For a long ti-me, ne-it-her of them spo-ke.
Winston got to his fe-et. "I'm not com-for-tab-le he-re," he sa-id. She tho-ught he was exp-res-sing
disp-le-asu-re with her.
"The flo-or is hard on an old man. And of co-ur-se you are right: you must de-ci-de whet-her you will
go on. Ca-me-lot was a ne-ver-ne-ver land. Its chi-ef va-lue lay in the fact that it exis-ted only as an
idea. Per-haps the sa-me thing is true of Ha-ven."
"No," she sa-id. "It exists."
"And is an-yo-ne el-se lo-oking for this pla-ce?"
"No one. We will be the se-cond mis-si-on to fa-il. I think the-re will be no mo-re."
"Then for God's sa-ke, Cha-ka of Il-lyria, you must ask yo-ur-self why you ca-me all this way. Why
yo-ur com-pa-ni-ons di-ed. What you se-ek."

"Money. Pu-re and simp-le. An-ci-ent ma-nusc-ripts are pri-ce-less. We'd ha-ve be-en fa-mo-us
thro-ug-ho-ut the Le-ague. That's why we ca-me."
His eyes grew tho-ught-ful. "Then go back," he sa-id. "If this is a pu-rely com-mer-ci-al ven-tu-re,
wri-te it off and put yo-ur mo-ney in re-al es-ta-te."
"Beg par-don?"
"But I wo-uld put it to you that tho-se are not the re-asons you da-red so much. And that you wish to
turn back be-ca-use you ha-ve for-got, why you ca-me." "That's not so," she sa-id.
"Of co-ur-se it's so. Shall I tell you why you un-der-to-ok to tra-vel thro-ugh an unk-nown world, on
the ho-pe that you might, might, find a pla-ce that's half-mythi-cal?" Mo-men-ta-rily he se-emed to fa-de,
to lo-se de-fi-ni-ti-on. "Ha-ven has not-hing to do with fa-me or we-alth. If you got the-re, if you we-re
ab-le to re-ad its sec-rets, you wo-uld ha-ve all that, pro-vi-ded you co-uld get ho-me with it. But you
wo-uld ha-ve ac-qu-ired so-met-hing in-fi-ni-tely mo-re va-lu-ab-le, and I be-li-eve you know that: you
wo-uld ha-ve dis-co-ve-red who you re-al-ly are. You wo-uld ha-ve le-ar-ned that you are a da-ugh-ter
of the pe-op-le who de-sig-ned the Ac-ro-po-lis, who wro-te Ham-let, who vi-si-ted the mo-ons of
Nep-tu-ne. Do you know abo-ut Nep-tu-ne?"
"No," she sa-id. "I don't think so."
"Then we've lost everyt-hing, Cha-ka. But you can get it back. If you are wil-ling to ta-ke it. And if not
you, then so-me-one el-se. But it is worth the ta-king, at wha-te-ver cost." Mo-men-ta-rily, he be-ca-me
one with the dark. "Wins-ton," she sa-id, "I can't see you. Are you still the-re?"
"I am he-re. The system is old, and will not ke-ep a char-ge." She was lo-oking thro-ugh him. "You
re-al-ly are a ghost," she sa-id.
"It is pos-sib-le you will not suc-ce-ed. Not-hing is cer-ta-in, sa-ve dif-fi-culty and tri-al. But ha-ve
co-ura-ge. Ne-ver sur-ren-der."
She sta-red at him.
"Never des-pa-ir," he sa-id.
A sud-den chill whis-pe-red thro-ugh her, a sen-se that she had be-en he-re be-fo-re, had known this
man in anot-her li-fe. "You se-em va-gu-ely fa-mi-li-ar. Ha-ve I se-en yo-ur pic-tu-re so-mew-he-re?"
"I'm su-re I do not know."
"Perhaps it is the words. They ha-ve an ec-ho."
He lo-oked di-rectly at her. "Pos-sibly." She co-uld see the ca-ve ent-ran-ce and a few stars thro-ugh
his sil-ho-u-et-te. "Ke-ep in mind, wha-te-ver hap-pens, you are one of a se-lect com-pany. A pro-ud
band of brot-hers. And sis-ters. You will ne-ver be alo-ne."
As she watc-hed, he fa-ded un-til only the glow of the ci-gar re-ma-ined. "It is yo-ur own true self you
se-ek."
"You pre-su-me a gre-at de-al."
"I know you, Cha-ka." Everyt-hing was go-ne now. Ex-cept the vo-ice. "I know who you are. And
you are abo-ut to le-arn."
"Was it his first or last na-me?" as-ked Qu-a-it, as they sad-dled the hor-ses.
"Now that you men-ti-on it, I re-al-ly don't know." She frow-ned. "I'm not su-re whet-her he was
re-al or not. He left no prints. No marks."
Quait lo-oked to-ward the ri-sing sun. The sky was cle-ar. "That's the way of it in the-se pla-ces.
So-me of its il-lu-si-on; so-me of it's so-met-hing el-se. But I wish you'd wo-ke me."
"So do I." She clim-bed up and pat-ted Brak's sho-ul-der. "He sa-id the sea is only forty mi-les."
Warm spring air flo-wed over them. "You want to go on?" "Qu-a-it, you ever he-ar of Nep-tu-ne?"
He sho-ok his he-ad.
"Maybe," she sa-id, "we can try that next."

IX - CORY DOCTOROW - WHEN SYSADMINS RULED THE EARTH

When Fe-lix's spe-ci-al pho-ne rang at two in the mor-ning, Kelly rol-led over and punc-hed him in
the sho-ul-der and his-sed, "Why didn't you turn that fuc-king thing off be-fo-re bed?"
"Because I'm on call," he sa-id.
"You're not a fuc-king doc-tor," she sa-id, kic-king him as he sat on the bed's ed-ge, pul-ling on the
pants he'd left on the flo-or be-fo-re tur-ning in. "You're a god-dam-ned systems ad-mi-nist-ra-tor."
"It's my job," he sa-id.
"They work you li-ke a go-vern-ment mu-le," she sa-id. "You know I'm right. For Christ's sa-ke,
you're a fat-her now; you can't go run-ning off in the mid-dle of the night every ti-me so-me-one's porn
supply go-es down. Don't ans-wer that pho-ne."
He knew she was right. He ans-we-red the pho-ne.
"Main ro-uters not res-pon-ding. BGP not res-pon-ding." The mec-ha-ni-cal vo-ice of the systems
mo-ni-tor didn't ca-re if he cur-sed at it, so he did, and it ma-de him fe-el a lit-tle bet-ter.
"Maybe I can fix it from he-re," he sa-id. He co-uld lo-gin to the UPS for the ca-ge and re-bo-ot the
ro-uters. The UPS was in a dif-fe-rent net block, with its own in-de-pen-dent ro-uters on the-ir own
unin-ter-rup-tib-le po-wer-sup-pli-es.
Kelly was sit-ting up in bed now, an in-dis-tinct sha-pe aga-inst the he-ad-bo-ard. "In fi-ve ye-ars of
mar-ri-age, you ha-ve ne-ver on-ce be-en ab-le to fix anyt-hing from he-re." This ti-me she was
wrong-he fi-xed stuff from ho-me all the ti-me, but he did it disc-re-etly and didn't ma-ke a fuss, so she
didn't re-mem-ber it. And she was right, too-he had logs that sho-wed that af-ter 1 A.M., not-hing
co-uld ever be fi-xed wit-ho-ut dri-ving out to the ca-ge. Law of In-fi-ni-te Uni-ver-sal
Per-ver-sity-AKA Fe-lix's Law.
Five mi-nu-tes la-ter Fe-lix was be-hind the whe-el. He hadn't be-en ab-le to fix it from ho-me. The
in-de-pen-dent ro-uters' net block was of-fli-ne, too. The last ti-me that had hap-pe-ned, so-me
dumb-fuck const-ruc-ti-on wor-ker had dri-ven a ditch-witch thro-ugh the ma-in con-du-it in-to the
da-ta cent-re and Fe-lix had jo-ined a cad-re of fifty en-ra-ged sysad-mins who'd sto-od atop the
re-sul-ting pit for a we-ek, scre-aming abu-se at the po-or bas-tards who la-bo-ured 24-7 to spli-ce ten
tho-usand wi-res back to-get-her.
His pho-ne went off twi-ce mo-re in the car and he let it over-ri-de the ste-reo and play the
mec-ha-ni-cal sta-tus re-ports thro-ugh the big, bassy spe-akers of mo-re cri-ti-cal net-work
inf-rast-ruc-tu-re of-fli-ne. Then Kelly cal-led.
"Hi," he sa-id.
"Don't crin-ge, I can he-ar the crin-ge in yo-ur vo-ice." He smi-led in-vo-lun-ta-rily. "Check, no
crin-ging." "I lo-ve you, Fe-lix," she sa-id.
"I'm to-tal-ly bon-kers for you, Kelly. Go back to bed."
"2.0's awa-ke," she sa-id. The baby had be-en Be-ta Test when he was in her womb, and when her
wa-ter bro-ke, he got the call and das-hed out of the of-fi-ce, sho-uting, The Gold Mas-ter just
ship-ped! They'd star-ted cal-ling him 2.0 be-fo-re he'd fi-nis-hed his first cry. "This lit-tle bas-tard was
born to suck tit."
"I'm sorry I wo-ke you," he sa-id. He was al-most at the da-ta cen-ter. No traf-fic at 2 A.M. He
slo-wed down and pul-led over be-fo-re the ent-ran-ce to the ga-ra-ge. He didn't want to lo-se Kelly's
call un-derg-ro-und.
"It's not wa-king me," she sa-id. "You've be-en the-re for se-ven ye-ars. You ha-ve three juni-ors
re-por-ting to you. Gi-ve them the pho-ne. You've pa-id yo-ur du-es."
"I don't li-ke as-king my re-ports to do anyt-hing I wo-uldn't do," he sa-id.
"You've do-ne it," she sa-id. "Ple-ase? I ha-te wa-king up alo-ne in the night. I miss you most at night."
"Kelly-"
"I'm over be-ing angry. I just miss you is all. You gi-ve me swe-et dre-ams."
"OK," he sa-id. "Simp-le as that?"
"Exactly. Simp-le as that. Can't ha-ve you ha-ving bad dre-ams, and I've pa-id my du-es. From now
on, I'm only go-ing on night call to co-ver ho-li-days."
She la-ug-hed. "Sysad-mins don t ta-ke ho-li-days." "This one will," he sa-id. "Pro-mi-se."

"You're won-der-ful," she sa-id. "Oh, gross. 2.0 just dum-ped co-re all over my bath-ro-be."
"That's my boy," he sa-id.
"Oh that he is," she sa-id. She hung up, and he pi-lo-ted the car in-to the da-ta cen-ter lot, bad-ging in
and pe-eling up a ble-ary eye-lid to let the re-ti-nal scan-ner get a go-od lo-ok at his sle-ep-dep-ped
eye-ball.
He stop-ped at the mac-hi-ne to get him-self a gu-ara-na me-da-fo-nil po-wer-bar and a cup of
let-hal ro-bot cof-fee in a spill-pro-of cle-an ro-om sip-py-cup. He wol-fed down the bar and sip-ped
the cof-fee, then let the in-ner do-or re-ad his hand-ge-ometry and si-ze him up for a mo-ment. It sig-hed
open and gus-ted the air-lock's lo-ad of po-si-ti-vely pres-su-ri-zed air over him as he pas-sed fi-nal-ly
to the in-ner sanc-tum.
It was bed-lam. The ca-ges we-re de-sig-ned to let two or three sysad-mins ma-no-e-uv-re aro-und
them at a ti-me. Every ot-her inch of cu-bic spa-ce was gi-ven over to hum-ming racks of ser-vers and
ro-uters and dri-ves. Jam-med among them we-re no fe-wer than twenty ot-her sysad-mins. It was a
re-gu-lar con-ven-ti-on of black tee-shirts with inexp-li-cab-le slo-gans, bel-li-es over-lap-ping belts with
pho-nes and mul-ti to-ols.
Normally it was prac-ti-cal-ly fre-ezing in the ca-ge, but all tho-se bo-di-es we-re over-he-ating the
small, enc-lo-sed spa-ce. Fi-ve or six lo-oked up and gri-ma-ced when he ca-me thro-ugh. Two
gre-eted him by na-me. He thre-aded his belly thro-ugh the press and the ca-ges, to-ward the Ar-dent
racks in the back of the ro-om.
"Felix." It was Van, who wasn't on call that night.
"What are you do-ing he-re?" he as-ked. "No ne-ed for both of us to be wrec-ked to-mor-row."
"What? Oh. My per-so-nal box is over the-re. It went down aro-und 1:30 and I got wo-ken up by my
pro-cess-mo-ni-tor. I sho-uld ha-ve cal-led you and told you I was co-ming down-spa-red you the trip."
Felix's own ser-ver-a box he sha-red with fi-ve ot-her fri-ends-was in a rack one flo-or down. He
won-de-red if it was of-fli-ne too.
"What's the story?"
"Massive flash-worm at-tack. So-me jac-kass with a ze-ro-day exp-lo-it has got every Win-dows
box on the net run-ning Mon-te Car-lo pro-bes on every IP block, inc-lu-ding IPv6. The big Cis-cos all
run ad-mi-nist-ra-ti-ve in-ter-fa-ces over v6, and they all fall over if they get mo-re than ten
si-mul-ta-ne-o-us pro-bes, which me-ans that just abo-ut every in-terc-han-ge has go-ne down. DNS is
screwy, too-li-ke may-be so-me-one po-iso-ned the zo-ne trans-fer last night. Oh, and the-re's an ema-il
and IM com-po-nent that sends pretty li-fe-li-ke mes-sa-ges to ever-yo-ne in yo-ur ad-dress bo-ok,
bar-fing up Eli-za-di-alog that keys off of yo-ur log-ged ema-il and mes-sa-ges to get you to open a
tro-j-an."
"Jesus."
"Yeah." Van was a type-two sysad-min, over six fe-et tall, long pony-ta-il, bob-bing Adam's ap-ple.
Over his to-ast-rack chest, his tee sa-id CHO-OSE YO-UR WE-APON and fe-atu-red a row of
poly-hed-ral RPG di-ce.
Felix was a type-one ad-min, with ext-ra se-venty or eighty po-unds all aro-und the mid-dle, and a
ne-at but full be-ard that he wo-re over his ext-ra chins. His tee sa-id
HELLO CTHUL-HU and fe-atu-red a cu-te, mo-uth-less, Hel-lo-Kit-ty-style Cthul-hu.
They'd known each ot-her for fif-te-en ye-ars, ha-ving met on Use-net, then f2f at To-ron-to Fre-enet
be-er-ses-si-ons, a Star Trek con-ven-ti-on or two, and even-tu-al-ly Fe-lix had hi-red Van to work
un-der him at Ar-dent. Van was re-li-ab-le and met-ho-di-cal. Tra-ined as an elect-ri-cal en-gi-ne-er, he
kept a pro-ces-si-on of spi-ral no-te-bo-oks fil-led with the de-ta-ils of every step he'd ever ta-ken, with
ti-me and da-te.
"Not even PEB-KAC this ti-me," Van sa-id. Prob-lem Exists Bet-we-en Key-bo-ard And Cha-ir.
Ema-il tro-j-ans fell in-to that ca-te-gory-if pe-op-le we-re smart eno-ugh not to open sus-pect
at-tach-ments, ema-il tro-j-ans wo-uld be a thing of the past. But worms that ate Cis-co ro-uters
we-ren't a prob-lem with the lu-sers-they we-re the fa-ult of in-com-pe-tent en-gi-ne-ers.
"No, it's Mic-ro-soft's fa-ult," Fe-lix sa-id. "Any ti-me I'm at work at 2 A.M., it's eit-her

PEBKAC or Mic-ros-loth."
They en-ded up just unp-lug-ging the frig-ging ro-uters from the In-ter-net. Not Fe-lix, of co-ur-se,
tho-ugh he was itc-hing to do it and get them re-bo-oted af-ter shut-ting down the-ir IPv6 in-ter-fa-ces.
It was do-ne by a co-up-le bull-go-ose Bas-tard Ope-ra-tors from Hell who had to turn two keys at
on-ce to get ac-cess to the-ir ca-ge-li-ke gu-ards in a Mi-nu-te-man si-lo. Ni-nety-fi-ve per-cent of the
long-dis-tan-ce traf-fic in Ca-na-da went thro-ugh this bu-il-ding. It had bet-ter se-cu-rity than most
Mi-nu-te-man si-los.
Felix and Van got the Ar-dent bo-xes back on-li-ne one at a ti-me. They we-re be-ing po-un-ded by
worm-pro-bes-put-ting the ro-uters back on-li-ne just ex-po-sed the downst-re-am ca-ges to the
at-tack. Every box on the In-ter-net was drow-ning in worms, or cre-ating worm-attacks, or both. Fe-lix
ma-na-ged to get thro-ugh to NIST and Bugt-raq af-ter abo-ut a hund-red ti-me-o-uts, and down-lo-ad
so-me ker-nel patc-hes that sho-uld re-du-ce the lo-ad the worms put on the mac-hi-nes in his ca-re. It
was 10 A.M., and he was hungry eno-ugh to eat the ass out of a de-ad be-ar, but he re-com-pi-led his
ker-nels and bro-ught the mac-hi-nes back on-li-ne. Van's long fin-gers flew over the ad-mi-nist-ra-ti-ve
key-bo-ard, his ton-gue prot-ru-ding as he ran lo-ad-stats on each one.
"I had two hund-red days of up-ti-me on Gre-edo," Van sa-id. Gre-edo was the ol-dest ser-ver in the
rack, from the days when they'd na-med the bo-xes af-ter Star Wars cha-rac-ters. Now they we-re all
na-med af-ter Smurfs, and they we-re run-ning out of Smurfs and had star-ted in on McDo-nald-land
cha-rac-ters, star-ting with Van's lap-top, Ma-yor McChe-ese.
"Greedo will ri-se aga-in," Fe-lix sa-id. "I've got a 486 downs-ta-irs with over fi-ve ye-ars of
up-ti-me. It's go-ing to bre-ak my he-art to re-bo-ot it."
"What the ever-las-ting shit do you use a 486 for?"
"Nothing. But who shuts down a mac-hi-ne with fi-ve ye-ars up-ti-me? That's li-ke eut-ha-ni-zing
yo-ur grand-mot-her." "I wan-na eat," Van sa-id.
"Tell you what," Fe-lix sa-id. "We'll get yo-ur box up, then mi-ne, then I'll ta-ke you to the
La-ke-vi-ew Lunch for bre-ak-fast piz-zas and you can ha-ve the rest of the day off."
"You're on," Van sa-id. "Man, you're too go-od to us grunts. You sho-uld ke-ep us in a pit and be-at
us li-ke all the ot-her bos-ses. It's all we de-ser-ve."
"It's yo-ur pho-ne," Van sa-id. Fe-lix ext-rac-ted him-self from the guts of the 486, which had
re-fu-sed to po-wer up at all. He had cad-ged a spa-re po-wer-sup-ply from so-me guys who ran a
spam ope-ra-ti-on and was trying to get it fit-ted. He let Van hand him the pho-ne, which had fal-len off
his belt whi-le he was twis-ting to get at the back of the mac-hi-ne.
"Hey, Kel," he sa-id. The-re was an odd, snuf-fling no-ise in the backg-ro-und. Sta-tic, may-be? 2.0
splas-hing in the bath? "Kelly?"
The li-ne went de-ad. He tri-ed to call back, but didn't get anyt-hing-no ring nor vo-ice-ma-il. His
pho-ne fi-nal-ly ti-med out and sa-id NET-WORK ER-ROR.
"Dammit," he sa-id, mildly. He clip-ped the pho-ne to his belt. Kelly wan-ted to know when he was
co-ming ho-me, or wan-ted him to pick so-met-hing up for the fa-mily. She'd le-ave vo-ice-ma-il.
He was tes-ting the po-wer-sup-ply when his pho-ne rang aga-in. He snatc-hed it up and ans-we-red
it. "Kelly, hey, what's up?" He wor-ked to ke-ep anyt-hing li-ke ir-ri-ta-ti-on out of his vo-ice. He felt
gu-ilty: tech-ni-cal-ly spe-aking, he had disc-har-ged his ob-li-ga-ti-ons to Ar-dent Fi-nan-ci-al LLC
on-ce the Ar-dent ser-vers we-re back on-li-ne. The past three ho-urs had be-en pu-rely
per-so-nal-even if he plan-ned on bil-ling them to the com-pany.
There was sob-bing on the li-ne.
"Kelly?" He felt the blo-od dra-ining from his fa-ce and his to-es we-re numb. "Fe-lix," she sa-id,
ba-rely comp-re-hen-sib-le thro-ugh the sob-bing. "He's de-ad, oh Jesus, he's de-ad." "Who? Who,
Kelly?"
"Will," she sa-id.
Will? he tho-ught. Who the fuck is-He drop-ped to his kne-es. Wil-li-am was the na-me they'd

writ-ten on the birth cer-ti-fi-ca-te, tho-ugh they'd cal-led him 2.0 all along. Fe-lix ma-de an an-gu-is-hed
so-und, li-ke a sick bark.
"I'm sick," she sa-id, "I can't even stand any-mo-re. Oh, Fe-lix. I lo-ve you so much."
"Kelly? What's go-ing on?"
"Everyone, ever-yo-ne-" she sa-id. "Only two chan-nels left on the tu-be. Christ, Fe-lix, it lo-oks li-ke
dawn of the de-ad out the win-dow-" He he-ard her retch. The pho-ne star-ted to bre-ak up, was-hing
her pu-ke-no-ises back li-ke an ec-hop-lex.
"Stay the-re, Kelly," he sho-uted as the li-ne di-ed. He punc-hed 911, but the pho-ne went
NET-WORK ER-ROR aga-in as so-on as he hit SEND.
He grab-bed Ma-yor McChe-ese from Van and plug-ged it in-to the 486's net-work cab-le and
la-unc-hed Fi-re-fox off the com-mand li-ne and go-og-led for the Met-ro Po-li-ce si-te. Qu-ickly, but
not fran-ti-cal-ly, he se-arc-hed for an on-li-ne con-tact form. Fe-lix didn't lo-se his he-ad, ever. He
sol-ved prob-lems, and fre-aking out didn't sol-ve prob-lems.
He lo-ca-ted an on-li-ne form and wro-te out the de-ta-ils of his con-ver-sa-ti-on with Kelly li-ke he
was fi-ling a bug re-port, his fin-gers fast, his desc-rip-ti-on comp-le-te, and then he hit SUB-MIT.
Van had re-ad over his sho-ul-der. "Fe-lix-" he be-gan.
"God," Fe-lix sa-id. He was sit-ting on the flo-or of the ca-ge and he slowly pul-led him-self up-right.
Van to-ok the lap-top and tri-ed so-me news si-tes, but they we-re all ti-ming out. Im-pos-sib-le to say
if it was be-ca-use so-met-hing ter-rib-le was hap-pe-ning or be-ca-use the net-work was lim-ping
un-der the su-per-worm.
"I ne-ed to get ho-me," Fe-lix sa-id.
"I'll dri-ve you," Van sa-id. "You can ke-ep cal-ling yo-ur wi-fe."
They ma-de the-ir way to the ele-va-tors. One of the bu-il-ding's few win-dows was the-re, a thick,
shi-el-ded port-ho-le. They pe-ered thro-ugh it as they wa-ited for the ele-va-tor. Not much traf-fic for a
Wed-nes-day. We-re the-re mo-re po-li-ce cars than usu-al?
"Oh my God-"Van po-in-ted.
The CN To-wer, a gi-ant whi-te elep-hant ne-ed-le of a bu-il-ding lo-omed to the east of them. It was
as-kew, li-ke a branch stuck in wet sand. Was it mo-ving? It was. It was he-eling over, slowly, but
ga-ining spe-ed, fal-ling nort-he-ast to-ward the fi-nan-ci-al dist-rict. In a se-cond, it slid over the
tip-ping po-int and cras-hed down. They felt the shock, then he-ard it, the who-le bu-il-ding roc-king
from the im-pact. A clo-ud of dust ro-se from the wrec-ka-ge, and the-re was mo-re thun-der as the
world's tal-lest fre-es-tan-ding struc-tu-re cras-hed thro-ugh bu-il-ding af-ter bu-il-ding.
"The Bro-ad-cast Cent-re's co-ming down," Van sa-id. It was-the CBC's to-we-ring bu-il-ding was
col-lap-sing in slow mo-ti-on. Pe-op-le ran every way, we-re crus-hed by fal-ling ma-sonry. Se-en
thro-ugh the port-ho-le, it was li-ke watc-hing a ne-at CGI trick down-lo-aded from a fi-le-sha-ring
si-te.
Sysadmins we-re clus-te-ring aro-und them now, jost-ling to see the dest-ruc-ti-on.
"What hap-pe-ned?" one of them as-ked.
"The CN To-wer fell down," Fe-lix sa-id. He so-un-ded far away in his own ears.
"Was it the vi-rus?"
"The worm? What?" Fe-lix fo-cu-sed on the guy, who was a yo-ung ad-min with just a lit-tle type-two
flab aro-und the mid-dle.
"Not the worm," the guy sa-id. "I got an ema-il that the who-le city's qu-aran-ti-ned be-ca-use of
so-me vi-rus. Bi-owe-apon, they say." He han-ded Fe-lix his Black-ber-ry.
Felix was so eng-ros-sed in the re-port-pur-por-tedly for-war-ded from He-alth Ca-na-da-that he
didn't even no-ti-ce that all the lights had go-ne out. Then he did, and he pres-sed the Black-ber-ry back
in-to its ow-ner's hand, and let out one small sob.
The ge-ne-ra-tors kic-ked in a mi-nu-te la-ter. Sysad-mins stam-pe-ded for the sta-irs. Fe-lix
grab-bed Van by the arm, pul-led him back.
"Maybe we sho-uld wa-it this out in the ca-ge," he sa-id. "What abo-ut Kelly?" Van sa-id.

Felix felt li-ke he was go-ing to throw up. "We sho-uld get in-to the ca-ge, now." The ca-ge had
mic-ro-par-ti-cu-la-te air-fil-ters.
They ran ups-ta-irs to the big ca-ge. Fe-lix ope-ned the do-or and then let it hiss shut be-hind him.
"Felix, you ne-ed to get ho-me-"
"It 's a bi-owe-apon," Fe-lix sa-id. "Su-per-bug. We'll be OK in he-re, I think, so long as the fil-ters
hold out."
"What?"
"Get on IRC," he sa-id.
They did. Van had Ma-yor McChe-ese and Fe-lix used Smur-fet-te. They skip-ped aro-und the chat
chan-nels un-til they fo-und one with so-me fa-mi-li-ar hand-les.
- Pentagons go-ne, whi-te ho-use too
- MY NE-IGH-BORS BAR-FING BLO-OD OFF HIS BAL-CONY IN SAN DI-EGO
- Someone knoc-ked over the Gher-kin. Ban-kers are fle-e-ing the City li-ke rats.
- I he-ard that the Gin-za's on fi-re
Felix typed: I'm in To-ron-to. We just saw the CN To-wer fall. I've he-ard re-ports of bi-owe-apons,
so-met-hing very fast.
Van re-ad this and sa-id, "You don't know how fast it is, Fe-lix. May-be we we-re all ex-po-sed
three days ago."
Felix clo-sed his eyes. "If that we-re so we'd be fe-eling so-me symptoms, I think."
- Looks li-ke an EMP to-ok out Hong Kong and may-be Pa-ris-re-al-ti-me sat fo-ota-ge shows them
comp-le-tely dark, and all netb-locks the-re aren't ro-uting
- You're in To-ron-to?
It was an un-fa-mi-li-ar hand-le.
- Yes-on Front Stre-et
- My sis-ters at UofT and i can't re-ach her - can you call her?
- No pho-ne ser-vi-ce
Felix typed, sta-ring at NET-WORK ER-ROR.
"I ha-ve a soft pho-ne on Ma-yor McChe-ese," Van sa-id, la-unc-hing his vo-ice-over-IP app. "I just
re-mem-be-red."
Felix to-ok the lap-top from him and punc-hed in his ho-me num-ber. It rang on-ce, then the-re was a
flat, blat-ting so-und li-ke an am-bu-lan-ce si-ren in an Ita-li-an mo-vie.
- No pho-ne ser-vi-ce
Felix typed aga-in.
He lo-oked up at Vin, and saw that his skinny sho-ul-ders we-re sha-king. Van sa-id, "Holy
mot-her-fuc-king shit. The world is en-ding."
Felix pri-ed him-self off of IRC an ho-ur la-ter. At-lan-ta had bur-ned. Man-hat-tan was
hot-ra-di-o-ac-ti-ve eno-ugh to screw up the web-cams lo-oking out over Lin-coln Pla-za. Ever-yo-ne

bla-med Is-lam un-til it be-ca-me cle-ar that Mec-ca was a smo-king pit and the Sa-udi Ro-yals had
be-en han-ged be-fo-re the-ir pa-la-ces.
His hands we-re sha-king, and Van was qu-i-etly we-eping in the far cor-ner of the ca-ge. He tri-ed
cal-ling ho-me aga-in, and then the po-li-ce. It didn't work any bet-ter than it had the last twenty ti-mes.
He sshed in-to his box downs-ta-irs and grab-bed his ma-il. Spam, spam, spam. Mo-re spam.
Auto-ma-ted mes-sa-ges. The-re-an ur-gent mes-sa-ge from the int-ru-si-on de-tec-ti-on system in the
Ar-dent ca-ge.
He ope-ned it and re-ad qu-ickly. So-me-one was cru-dely, re-pe-atedly pro-bing his ro-uters. It
didn't match a worm's sig-na-tu-re, eit-her. He fol-lo-wed the tra-ce ro-ute and dis-co-ve-red that the
at-tack had ori-gi-na-ted in the sa-me bu-il-ding as him, a system in a ca-ge one flo-or be-low.
He had pro-ce-du-res for this. He port scan-ned his at-tac-ker and fo-und that port 1337 was
open-1337 was "le-et" or "eli-te" in hac-ker num-ber/let-ter subs-ti-tu-ti-on co-de. That was the kind of
port that a worm left open to slit-her in and out of. He go-og-led known splo-its that left a lis-te-ner on
port 1337, nar-ro-wed this down ba-sed on the fin-gerp-rin-ted ope-ra-ting system of the
comp-ro-mi-sed ser-ver, and then he had it.
It was an an-ci-ent worm, one that every box sho-uld ha-ve be-en patc-hed aga-inst ye-ars be-fo-re.
No mind. He had the cli-ent for it, and he used it to cre-ate a ro-ot ac-co-unt for him-self on the box,
which he then log-ged in-to, and to-ok a lo-ok aro-und.
There was one ot-her user log-ged in, "sca-redy," and he chec-ked the pro-cess mo-ni-tor and saw
that sca-redy had spaw-ned all the hund-reds of pro-ces-ses that we-re pro-bing him and plenty of
ot-her bo-xen.
He ope-ned a chat:
- Stop pro-bing my ser-ver
He ex-pec-ted blus-ter, gu-ilt, de-ni-al. He was surp-ri-sed.
- Are you in the Front Stre-et da-ta cen-ter?
- Yes
- Christ I tho-ught I was the last one ali-ve. I'm on the fo-urth flo-or. I think the-re's a bi-owe-apon
at-tack out-si-de. I don't want to le-ave the cle-an ro-om.
Felix who-os-hed out a bre-ath.
- You we-re pro-bing me to get me to tra-ce back to you?
- Yeah
- That was smart
Clever bas-tard.
- I'm on the sixth flo-or, I've got one mo-re with me.
- What do you know?
Felix pas-ted in the IRC log and wa-ited whi-le the ot-her guy di-ges-ted it. Van sto-od up and
pa-ced. His eyes we-re gla-zed over.
"Van? Pal?"
"I ha-ve to pee," he sa-id.

"No ope-ning the do-or" Fe-lix sa-id. "I saw an empty Mo-un-ta-in Dew bot-tle in the trash the-re."
"Right," Van sa-id. He wal-ked li-ke a zom-bie to the trash can and pul-led out the empty mag-num.
He tur-ned his back.
- I'm Fe-lix
- Will
Felix's sto-mach did a slow so-mer-sa-ult as he tho-ught abo-ut 2.0.
"Felix, I think I ne-ed to go out-si-de," Van sa-id. He was mo-ving to-ward the air-lock do-or. Fe-lix
drop-ped his key-bo-ard and strug-gled to his fe-et and ran he-ad-long to Van, tack-ling him be-fo-re
he re-ac-hed the do-or.
"Van," he sa-id, lo-oking in-to his fri-end's gla-zed, un-fo-cu-sed eyes. "Lo-ok at me, Van."
"I ne-ed to go," Van sa-id. "I ne-ed to get ho-me and fe-ed the cats."
"There's so-met-hing out the-re, so-met-hing fast-acting and let-hal. May-be it will blow away with the
wind. May-be it's al-re-ady go-ne. But we're go-ing to sit he-re un-til we know for su-re or un-til we
ha-ve no cho-ice. Sit down, Van. Sit."
"I'm cold, Fe-lix."
It was fre-ezing. Fe-lix's arms we-re bro-ken out in go-osef-lesh and his fe-et felt li-ke blocks of ice.
"Sit aga-inst the ser-vers, by the vents. Get the ex-ha-ust he-at." He fo-und a rack and nest-led up
aga-inst it."
- Are you the-re?
- Still he-re-sor-ting out so-me lo-gis-tics
- How long un-til we can go out?
- I ha-ve no idea
No one typed anyt-hing for qu-ite so-me ti-me then.
Felix had to use the Mo-un-ta-in Dew bot-tle twi-ce. Then Van used it aga-in. Fe-lix tri-ed cal-ling
Kelly aga-in. The Met-ro Po-li-ce si-te was down.
Finally, he slid back aga-inst the ser-vers and wrap-ped his arms aro-und his kne-es and wept li-ke a
baby.
After a mi-nu-te, Van ca-me over and sat be-si-de him, with his arm aro-und Fe-lix's sho-ul-der.
"They're de-ad, Van," Fe-lix sa-id. "Kelly and my s-son. My fa-mily is go-ne." "You don't know for
su-re," Van sa-id.
"I'm su-re eno-ugh," Fe-lix sa-id. "Christ, it's all over, isn't it?"
"We'll gut it out a few mo-re ho-urs and then he-ad out. Things sho-uld be get-ting back to nor-mal
so-on. The fi-re de-part-ment will fix it. They'll mo-bi-li-ze the Army.
It'll be OK."
Felix's ribs hurt. He hadn't cri-ed sin-ce-sin-ce 2.0 was born. He hug-ged his kne-es har-der.
Then the do-ors ope-ned.
The two sysad-mins who en-te-red we-re wild-eyed. One had a tee that sa-id TALK NERDY TO
ME and the ot-her one was we-aring an Elect-ro-nic Fron-ti-ers Ca-na-da shirt.
"Come on," TALK NERDY sa-id. "We're all get-ting to-get-her on the top flo-or. Ta-ke the sta-irs."
Fe-lix fo-und he was hol-ding his bre-ath.
"If the-re's a bi-o-agent in the bu-il-ding, we're all in-fec-ted," TALK NERDY sa-id. "Just go, we'll
me-et you the-re."

"There's one on the sixth flo-or," Fe-lix sa-id, as he clim-bed to his fe-et. "Will, ye-ah, we got him.
He's up the-re."
TALK NERDY was one of the Bas-tard Ope-ra-tors From Hell who'd unp-lug-ged the big ro-uters.
Fe-lix and Van clim-bed the sta-irs slowly, the-ir steps ec-ho-ing in the de-ser-ted shaft. Af-ter the
fri-gid air of the ca-ge, the sta-ir-well felt li-ke a sa-una.
There was a ca-fe-te-ria on the top flo-or, with wor-king to-ilets, wa-ter and cof-fee and ven-ding
mac-hi-ne fo-od. The-re was an une-asy qu-e-ue of sysad-mins be-fo-re each. No one met an-yo-ne's
eye. Fe-lix won-de-red which one was Will and then he jo-ined the ven-ding mac-hi-ne qu-e-ue.
He got a co-up-le mo-re energy bars and a gi-gan-tic cup of va-nil-la cof-fee be-fo-re run-ning out of
chan-ge. Van had sco-red them so-me tab-le spa-ce and Fe-lix set the stuf-fdown be-fo-re him and got
in the to-ilet li-ne. "Just sa-ve so-me for me," he sa-id, tos-sing an energy bar in front of Van.
By the ti-me they we-re all set-tled in, tho-ro-ughly eva-cu-ated, and eating, TALK NERDY and his
fri-end had re-tur-ned aga-in. They cle-ared off the cash-re-gis-ter at the end of the fo-od-prep area and
TALK NERDY got up on it. Slowly the con-ver-sa-ti-on di-ed down.
"I'm Uri Po-po-vich, this is Di-ego Ro-sen-ba-um. Thank you all for co-ming up he-re. He-re's what
we know for su-re: the bu-il-ding's be-en on ge-ne-ra-tors for three ho-urs now. Vi-su-al
ob-ser-va-ti-on in-di-ca-tes that we're the only bu-il-ding in cent-ral To-ron-to with wor-king
po-wer-which sho-uld hold out for three mo-re days. The-re is a bio-agent of unk-nown ori-gin lo-ose
be-yond our do-ors. It kills qu-ickly, wit-hin ho-urs, and it is aero-so-li-zed. You get it from bre-at-hing
bad air. No one has ope-ned any of the ex-te-ri-or do-ors to this bu-il-ding sin-ce fi-ve this mor-ning.
No one will open the do-ors un-til I gi-ve the go-ahe-ad.
"Attacks on ma-j-or ci-ti-es all over the world ha-ve left emer-gency res-pon-ders in cha-os. The
at-tacks are elect-ro-nic, bi-olo-gi-cal, nuc-le-ar and con-ven-ti-onal exp-lo-si-ves, and they are very
wi-desp-re-ad. I'm a se-cu-rity en-gi-ne-er, and whe-re I co-me from, at-tacks in this kind of clus-ter
are usu-al-ly vi-ewed as op-por-tu-nis-tic: gro-up B blows up a brid-ge be-ca-use ever-yo-ne is off
ta-king ca-re of gro-up A's dirty nu-ke event. It's smart. An Aum Shin-rik-yo cell in Se-o-ul gas-sed the
sub-ways the-re abo-ut 2 A.M. Eas-tern, that's the ear-li-est event we can lo-ca-te, so it may ha-ve
be-en the Arch-du-ke that bro-ke the ca-mel's back. We're pretty su-re that Aum Shin-rik-yo co-uldn't
be be-hind this kind of may-hem: they ha-ve no his-tory of in-fo-war and ha-ve ne-ver shown the kind of
or-ga-ni-za-ti-onal acu-men ne-ces-sary to ta-ke out so many tar-gets at on-ce. Ba-si-cal-ly, they're not
smart eno-ugh.
"We're ho-ling up he-re for the fo-re-se-e-ab-le fu-tu-re, at le-ast un-til the bi-owe-apon has be-en
iden-ti-fi-ed and dis-per-sed. We're go-ing to staff the racks and ke-ep the net-works up. This is
cri-ti-cal inf-rast-ruc-tu-re, and it's our job to ma-ke su-re it's got fi-ve ni-nes of up-ti-me. In ti-mes of
na-ti-onal emer-gency, our res-pon-si-bi-lity to do that do-ub-les."
One sysad-min put up his hand. He was very da-ring in a gre-en Inc-re-dib-le Hulk ring-tee, and he
was at the yo-ung end of the sca-le.
"Who di-ed and ma-de you king?"
"I ha-ve cont-rols for the ma-in se-cu-rity system, keys to every ca-ge, and pas-sco-des for the
ex-te-ri-or do-ors-they're all loc-ked now, by the way. I'm the one who got ever-yo-ne up he-re first
and cal-led the me-eting. I don't ca-re if so-me-one el-se wants this job, it's a shitty one. But so-me-one
ne-eds to ha-ve this job."
"You're right," the kid sa-id. "And I can do it every bit as well as you. My na-me's Will Sa-rio."
Popovich lo-oked down his no-se at the kid. "Well, if you'll let me fi-nish tal-king, may-be I'll hand
things over to you when I'm do-ne."
"Finish, by all me-ans." Sa-rio tur-ned his back on him and wal-ked to the win-dow. He sta-red out of
it in-ten-sely. Fe-lix's ga-ze was drawn to it, and he saw that the-re we-re se-ve-ral oily smo-ke plu-mes
ri-sing up from the city.
Popovich's mo-men-tum was bro-ken. "So that's what we're go-ing to do," he sa-id.
The kid lo-oked aro-und af-ter a stretc-hed mo-ment of si-len-ce. "Oh, is it my turn now?"
There was a ro-und of go-od-na-tu-red chuck-ling.

"Here's what I think: the world is go-ing to shit. The-re are co-or-di-na-ted at-tacks on every cri-ti-cal
pi-ece of inf-rast-ruc-tu-re. The-re's only one way that tho-se at-tacks co-uld be so well
co-or-di-na-ted: via the In-ter-net. Even if you buy the the-sis that the at-tacks are all op-por-tu-nis-tic,
we ne-ed to ask how an op-por-tu-nis-tic at-tack co-uld be or-ga-ni-zed in mi-nu-tes: the In-ter-net."
"So you think we sho-uld shut down the In-ter-net?" Po-po-vich la-ug-hed a lit-tle, but stop-ped
when Sa-rio sa-id not-hing.
"We saw an at-tack last night that ne-arly kil-led the In-ter-net. A lit-tle DoS on the cri-ti-cal ro-uters,
a lit-tle DNS-foo, and down it go-es li-ke a pre-ac-her's da-ugh-ter. Cops and the mi-li-tary are a bunch
of tech-nop-ho-bic lu-sers, they hardly rely on the net at all. If we ta-ke the In-ter-net down, we'll
disp-ro-por-ti-ona-tely di-sad-van-ta-ge the at-tac-kers, whi-le only in-con-ve-ni-en-cing the
de-fen-ders. When the ti-me co-mes, we can re-bu-ild it."
"You're shit-ting me," Po-po-vich sa-id. His jaw li-te-ral-ly hung open.
"It's lo-gi-cal," Sa-rio sa-id. "Lots of pe-op-le don't li-ke co-ping with lo-gic when it dic-ta-tes hard
de-ci-si-ons. That's a prob-lem with pe-op-le, not lo-gic."
There was a buzz of con-ver-sa-ti-on that qu-ickly tur-ned in-to a ro-ar.
"Shut UP!" Po-po-vich hol-le-red. The con-ver-sa-ti-on dim-med by one watt. Po-po-vich yel-led
aga-in, stam-ping his fo-ot on the co-un-ter-top. Fi-nal-ly the-re was a semb-lan-ce of or-der. "One at a
ti-me," he sa-id. He was flus-hed red, his hands in his poc-kets.
One sysad-min was for sta-ying. Anot-her for go-ing. They sho-uld hi-de in the ca-ges. They sho-uld
in-ven-tory the-ir sup-pli-es and ap-po-int a qu-ar-ter-mas-ter. They sho-uld go out-si-de and find the
po-li-ce, or vo-lun-te-er at hos-pi-tals. They sho-uld ap-po-int de-fen-ders to ke-ep the front do-or
se-cu-re.
Felix fo-und to his surp-ri-se that he had his hand in the air. Po-po-vich cal-led on him.
"My na-me is Fe-lix Tre-mont," he sa-id, get-ting up on one of the tab-les, dra-wing out his PDA. "I
want to re-ad you so-met-hing.
"'Governments of the In-dust-ri-al World, you we-ary gi-ants of flesh and ste-el, I co-me from
Cybers-pa-ce, the new ho-me of Mind. On be-half of the fu-tu-re, I ask you of the past to le-ave us
alo-ne. You are not wel-co-me among us. You ha-ve no so-ve-re-ignty whe-re we gat-her.
"'We ha-ve no elec-ted go-vern-ment, nor are we li-kely to ha-ve one, so I ad-dress you with no
gre-ater aut-ho-rity than that with which li-berty it-self al-ways spe-aks. I dec-la-re the glo-bal so-ci-al
spa-ce we are bu-il-ding to be na-tu-ral-ly in-de-pen-dent of the tyran-ni-es you se-ek to im-po-se on
us. You ha-ve no mo-ral right to ru-le us nor do you pos-sess any met-hods of en-for-ce-ment we ha-ve
true re-ason to fe-ar.
"'Governments de-ri-ve the-ir just po-wers from the con-sent of the go-ver-ned. You ha-ve ne-it-her
so-li-ci-ted nor re-ce-ived ours. We did not in-vi-te you. You do not know us, nor do you know our
world. Cybers-pa-ce do-es not lie wit-hin yo-ur bor-ders. Do not think that you can bu-ild it, as tho-ugh
it we-re a pub-lic const-ruc-ti-on pro-j-ect. You can-not. It is an act of na-tu-re and it grows it-self
thro-ugh our col-lec-ti-ve ac-ti-ons.'
"That's from the Dec-la-ra-ti-on of In-de-pen-den-ce of Cybers-pa-ce. It was writ-ten twel-ve ye-ars
ago. I tho-ught it was one of the most be-a-uti-ful things I'd ever re-ad. I wan-ted my kid to grow up in a
world whe-re cybers-pa-ce was free-and whe-re that fre-edom in-fec-ted the re-al world, so
me-ats-pa-ce got fre-er too."
He swal-lo-wed hard and scrub-bed at his eyes with the back of his hand. Van awk-wardly pat-ted
him on the shoe.
"My be-a-uti-ful son and my be-a-uti-ful wi-fe di-ed to-day. Mil-li-ons mo-re, too. The city is
li-te-ral-ly in fla-mes. Who-le ci-ti-es ha-ve di-sap-pe-ared from the map."
He co-ug-hed up a sob and swal-lo-wed it aga-in.
"All aro-und the world, pe-op-le li-ke us are gat-he-red in bu-il-dings li-ke this. They we-re trying to
re-co-ver from last night's worm when di-sas-ter struck. We ha-ve in-de-pen-dent po-wer. Fo-od.
Wa-ter.
"We ha-ve the net-work, that the bad guys use so well and that the go-od guys ha-ve ne-ver fi-gu-red

out.
"We ha-ve a sha-red lo-ve of li-berty that co-mes from ca-ring abo-ut and ca-ring for the net-work.
We are in char-ge of the most im-por-tant or-ga-ni-za-ti-onal and go-vern-men-tal to-ol the world has
ever se-en. We are the clo-sest thing to a go-vern-ment the world has right now. Ge-ne-va is a cra-ter.
The East Ri-ver is on fi-re and the UN is eva-cu-ated.
"The Dist-ri-bu-ted Re-pub-lic of Cybers-pa-ce we-at-he-red this storm ba-si-cal-ly uns-cat-hed.
We are the cus-to-di-ans of a de-ath-less, monst-ro-us, won-der-ful mac-hi-ne, one with the po-ten-ti-al
to re-bu-ild a bet-ter world.
"I ha-ve not-hing to li-ve for but that."
There we-re te-ars in Van's eyes. He wasn't the only one. They didn't ap-pla-ud him, but they did one
bet-ter. They ma-in-ta-ined res-pect-ful, to-tal si-len-ce for se-conds that stretc-hed to a mi-nu-te.
"How do we do it?" Po-po-vich sa-id, wit-ho-ut a tra-ce of sar-casm.
The newsg-ro-ups we-re fil-ling up fast. They'd an-no-un-ced them in news.admin. net-abu-se.ema-il,
whe-re all the spam-figh-ters hung out, and whe-re the-re was a tight cul-tu-re of ca-ma-ra-de-rie in the
fa-ce of full-out at-tack.
The new gro-up was alt.no-vem-ber5-di-sas-ter.re-co-very, with.re-co-very.go-ver-nan-ce,
.re-co-very.fi-nan-ce, .re-co-very.lo-gis-tics and.re-co-very.de-fen-se han-ging off of it. Bless the
wo-oly alt. hi-erarchy and all tho-se who sa-il in her.
The sysad-mins ca-me out of the wo-od-work. The Go-og-lep-lex was on-li-ne, with the stal-wart
Qu-e-en Kong bos-sing a gang of rol-lerb-la-ded grunts who whe-eled thro-ugh the gi-gan-tic da-ta
cent-re swap-ping out de-ad bo-xen and hit-ting re-bo-ot switc-hes. The In-ter-net Arc-hi-ve was
of-fli-ne in the Pre-si-dio, but the mir-ror in Ams-ter-dam was li-ve and they'd re-di-rec-ted the DNS so
that you'd hardly know the dif-fe-ren-ce. Ama-zon was down. Pay-Pal was up. Blog-ger, Type-Pad and
Li-ve-j-o-ur-nal we-re all up, and fil-ling with mil-li-ons of posts from sca-red sur-vi-vors hud-dling
to-get-her for elect-ro-nic warmth.
The Flickr pho-tost-re-ams we-re hor-ri-fic. Fe-lix had to un-subsc-ri-be from them af-ter he ca-ught
a pho-to of a wo-man and a baby, de-ad in a kitc-hen, twis-ted in-to an ago-ni-zed hi-eroglyph by the
bi-o-agent. They didn't lo-ok li-ke Kelly and 2.0, but they didn't ha-ve to. He star-ted sha-king and
co-uldn't stop.
Wikipedia was up, but lim-ping un-der lo-ad. The spam po-ured in as tho-ugh not-hing had chan-ged.
Worms ro-amed the net-work.
Recovery, Lo-gis-tics was whe-re most of the ac-ti-on was.
- We can use the newsg-ro-up vo-ting mec-ha-nism to hold re-gi-onal elec-ti-ons
Felix knew that this wo-uld work. Use-net newsg-ro-up vo-tes had be-en run-ning for mo-re than
twenty ye-ars wit-ho-ut a subs-tan-ti-al hitch.
- We'll elect re-gi-onal rep-re-sen-ta-ti-ves and they'll pick a Pri-me Mi-nis-ter.
The Ame-ri-cans in-sis-ted on Pre-si-dent, which Fe-lix didn't li-ke. Se-emed too par-ti-san. His
fu-tu-re wo-uldn't be the Ame-ri-can fu-tu-re. The Ame-ri-can fu-tu-re had go-ne up with the Whi-te
Ho-use. He was bu-il-ding a big-ger tent than that.
There we-re French sysad-mins on-li-ne from Fran-ce Te-le-com. The EBU's da-ta cent-re had
be-en spa-red in the at-tacks that ham-me-red Ge-ne-va, and it was fil-led with wry Ger-mans who-se
Eng-lish was bet-ter than Fe-lix's. They got on well with the re-ma-ins of the BBC te-am in Ca-nary
Wharf.
They spo-ke polyg-lot Eng-lish in.re-co-very.lo-gis-tics, and Fe-lix had mo-men-tum on his si-de.
So-me of the ad-mins we-re co-oling out the ine-vi-tab-le stu-pid fla-me-wars with the prac-ti-ce of long
ye-ars. So-me we-re chip-ping in use-ful sug-ges-ti-ons.

Surprisingly few tho-ught that Fe-lix was off his roc-ker.
- I think we sho-uld hold elec-ti-ons as so-on as pos-sib-le. To-mor-row at the la-test. We can't ru-le
justly wit-ho-ut the con-sent of the go-ver-ned.
Within se-conds the reply lan-ded in his in-box.
- You can't be se-ri-o-us. Con-sent of the go-ver-ned? Un-less I miss my gu-ess, most of the
pe-op-le you're pro-po-sing to go-vern are pu-king the-ir guts out, hi-ding un-der the-ir desks, or
wan-de-ring shell-shoc-ked thro-ugh the city stre-ets. When do THEY get a vo-te?
Felix had to ad-mit she had a po-int. Qu-e-en Kong was sharp. Not many wo-men sysad-mins, and
that was a ge-nu-ine tra-gedy. Wo-men li-ke Qu-e-en Kong we-re too go-od to exc-lu-de from the
fi-eld. He'd ha-ve to hack a so-lu-ti-on to get wo-men ba-lan-ced out in his new go-vern-ment.
Re-qu-ire each re-gi-on to elect one wo-man and one man?
He hap-pily clat-te-red in-to ar-gu-ment with her. The elec-ti-ons wo-uld be the next day; he'd see to
it.
"Prime Mi-nis-ter of Cybers-pa-ce? Why not call yo-ur-self the Grand Po-obah of the Glo-bal Da-ta
Net-work? It's mo-re dig-ni-fi-ed, so-unds co-oler and it'll get you just as far." Will had the sle-eping
spot next to him, up in the ca-fe-te-ria, with Van on the ot-her si-de. The ro-om smel-led li-ke a
ding-le-ber-ry: twenty-fi-ve sysad-mins who hadn't was-hed in at le-ast a day all cram-med in-to the
sa-me ro-om. For so-me of them, it had be-en much, much lon-ger than a day.
"Shut up, Will," Van sa-id. "You wan-ted to try to knock the In-ter-net of-fli-ne."
"Correction: I want to knock the In-ter-net of-fli-ne. Pre-sent-ten-se."
Felix crac-ked one eye. He was so ti-red, it was li-ke lif-ting we-ights.
"Look, Sa-rio if you don't li-ke my plat-form, put one of yo-ur own for-ward. The-re are plenty of
pe-op-le who think I'm full of shit and I res-pect them for that, sin-ce they're all run-ning op-po-si-te me
or bac-king so-me-one who is. That's yo-ur cho-ice. What's not on the me-nu is nag-ging and
comp-la-ining. Bed-ti-me now, or get up and post yo-ur plat-form."
Sario sat up slowly, un-rol-ling the jac-ket he had be-en using for a pil-low and put-ting it on. "Screw
you guys, I'm out of he-re."
"I tho-ught he'd ne-ver le-ave," Fe-lix sa-id, and tur-ned over, lying awa-ke a long ti-me, thin-king
abo-ut the elec-ti-on.
There we-re ot-her pe-op-le in the run-ning. So-me of them we-ren't even sysad-mins. A US
Se-na-tor on ret-re-at at his sum-mer pla-ce in Wyo-ming had ge-ne-ra-tor po-wer and a sa-tel-li-te
pho-ne. So-me-how he'd fo-und the right newsg-ro-up and thrown his hat in-to the ring. So-me
anarc-hist hac-kers in Italy stra-fed the gro-up all night long, pos-ting bro-ken-English scre-eds abo-ut
the po-li-ti-cal bank-ruptcy of "go-ver-nan-ce" in the new world. Fe-lix lo-oked at the-ir netb-lock and
de-ter-mi-ned that they we-re pro-bably ho-led up in a small In-te-rac-ti-on De-sign ins-ti-tu-te ne-ar
Tu-rin. Italy had be-en hit very bad, but out in the small town, this cell of anarc-hists had ta-ken up
re-si-den-ce.
A surp-ri-sing num-ber we-re run-ning on a plat-form of shut-ting down the In-ter-net. Fe-lix had his
do-ubts abo-ut whet-her this was even pos-sib-le, but he tho-ught he un-ders-to-od the im-pul-se to
fi-nish the work and the world. Why not? From every in-di-ca-ti-on, it se-emed that the work to da-te
had be-en a cas-ca-de of di-sas-ters, at-tacks, and op-por-tu-nism, all of it ad-ding up to
Got-ter-dam-me-rung. A ter-ro-rist at-tack he-re, a let-hal co-un-te-rof-fen-si-ve the-re from an
over-re-ac-ti-ve go-vern-ment… Be-fo-re long, they'd ma-de short work of the world.
He fell as-le-ep thin-king abo-ut the lo-gis-tics of shut-ting down the In-ter-net, and dre-amed bad
dre-ams in which he was the net-work's so-le de-fen-der.
He wo-ke to a pa-pery, itchy so-und. He rol-led over and saw that Van was sit-ting up, his jac-ket

bal-led up in his lap, vi-go-ro-usly scratc-hing his skinny arms. They'd go-ne the co-lo-ur of cor-ned
be-ef, and had a scaly lo-ok. In the light stre-aming thro-ugh the ca-fe-te-ria win-dows, skin mo-tes
flo-ated and dan-ced in gre-at clo-uds.
"What are you do-ing?" Fe-lix sat up. Watc-hing Van's fin-ger-na-ils rip in-to his skin ma-de him itch
in sympathy. It had be-en three days sin-ce he'd last was-hed his ha-ir and his scalp so-me-ti-mes felt
li-ke the-re we-re lit-tle egg-la-ying in-sects pic-king the-ir way thro-ugh it. He'd adj-us-ted his glas-ses
the night be-fo-re and had to-uc-hed the back of his ears; his fin-ger ca-me away shi-ning with thick
se-bum. He got black-he-ads in the backs of his ears when he didn't sho-wer for a co-up-le days, and
so-me-ti-mes gi-gan-tic, de-ep bo-ils that Kelly fi-nal-ly pop-ped with sick re-lish.
"Scratching," Van sa-id. He went to work on his he-ad, sen-ding a clo-ud of dan-druff-crud in-to the
sky, the-re to jo-in the scurf that he'd al-re-ady eli-mi-na-ted from his ext-re-mi-ti-es."(Christ, I itch all
over."
Felix to-ok Ma-yor McChe-ese from Van's back-pack and plug-ged it in-to one of the Et-her-net
cab-les that sna-ked all over the flo-or. He go-og-led everyt-hing he co-uld think of that co-uld be
re-la-ted to this. "Itchy" yi-el-ded 40,600,000 links. He tri-ed com-po-und qu-eri-es and got slightly
mo-re disc-ri-mi-na-ting links.
"I think it's stress-re-la-ted ec-ze-ma," Fe-lix sa-id, fi-nal-ly.
"I don't get ec-ze-ma," Van sa-id.
Felix sho-wed him so-me lu-rid pho-tos of red, angry skin fla-ked with whi-te. "Stress-re-la-ted
ec-ze-ma," he sa-id, re-ading the cap-ti-on. Van exa-mi-ned his arms. "I ha-ve ec-ze-ma," he sa-id.
"Says he-re to ke-ep it mo-is-tu-ri-zed and to try cor-ti-so-ne cre-am. You might try the first aid kit in
the se-cond-flo-or to-ilets. I think I saw so-me the-re." Li-ke all of the sysad-mins, Fe-lix had had a bit
of a rum-ma-ge aro-und the of-fi-ces, bath-ro-oms, kitc-hen and sto-re-ro-oms, squ-ir-re-ling away a
roll of to-ilet-pa-per in his sho-ul-der-bag along with three or fo-ur po-wer-bars. They we-re sha-ring
out the fo-od in the ca-fe by uns-po-ken ag-re-ement, every sysad-min watc-hing every ot-her for signs
of glut-tony and ho-ar-ding. All we-re con-vin-ced that the-re was ho-ar-ding and glut-tony go-ing on
out of eyes-hot, be-ca-use all we-re gu-ilty of it them-sel-ves when no one el-se was watc-hing.
Van got up and when his fa-ce ho-ve in-to the light, Fe-lix saw how puf-fed his eyes we-re. "I'll post
to the ma-iling list for so-me an-ti-his-ta-mi-ne," Fe-lix sa-id. The-re had be-en fo-ur ma-iling lists and
three wi-kis for the sur-vi-vors in the bu-il-ding wit-hin ho-urs of the first me-eting's clo-se, and in the
in-ter-ve-ning days they'd set-tled on just one. Fe-lix was still on a lit-tle ma-iling list with fi-ve of his most
trus-ted fri-ends, two of whom we-re trap-ped in ca-ges in ot-her co-unt-ri-es. He sus-pec-ted that the
rest of the sysad-mins we-re do-ing the sa-me.
Van stumb-led off. "Go-od luck on the elec-ti-ons," he sa-id, pat-ting Fe-lix on the sho-ul-der.
Felix sto-od and pa-ced, stop-ping to sta-re out the grubby win-dows. The fi-res still bur-ned in
To-ron-to, mo-re than be-fo-re. He'd tri-ed to find ma-iling lists or blogs that To-ron-to-ni-ans we-re
pos-ting to, but the only ones he'd fo-und we-re be-ing run by ot-her ge-eks in ot-her da-ta cent-res. It
was pos-sib-le-li-kely, even-that the-re we-re sur-vi-vors out the-re who had mo-re pres-sing
pri-ori-ti-es than pos-ting to the In-ter-net. His ho-me pho-ne still wor-ked abo-ut half the ti-me but he'd
stop-ped cal-ling it af-ter the se-cond day, when he-aring Kelly's vo-ice on the vo-ice-ma-il for the
fif-ti-eth ti-me had ma-de him cry in the mid-dle of a plan-ning me-eting. He wasn't the only one.
Election Day. Ti-me to fa-ce the mu-sic.
- Are you ner-vo-us?
- Nope
Felix typed.
- I don't much ca-re if I win, to be ho-nest. I’m just glad we're do-ing this. The al-ter-na-ti-ve was
sit-ting aro-und with our thumbs up our ass, wa-iting for so-me-one to crack up and open the do-or.

The cur-sor hung. Qu-e-en Kong was very high la-tency as she bos-sed her gang of Go-og-lo-ids
aro-und the Go-og-lep-lex, do-ing everyt-hing she co-uld to ke-ep her da-ta cent-re on-li-ne. Three of
the of-fsho-re ca-ges had go-ne of-fli-ne and two of the-ir six re-dun-dant net-work links we-re
smo-ked. Lucky for her, qu-eri-es-per-se-cond we-re way down.
- There's still Chi-na
She typed. Qu-e-en Kong had a big bo-ard with a map of the world co-lo-ured in
Go-og-le-qu-eri-es-per-se-cond, and co-uld do ma-gic with it, sho-wing the drop-off over ti-me in
co-lo-ur-ful charts. She'd up-lo-aded lots of vi-deo clips sho-wing how the pla-gue and the bombs had
swept the world: the ini-ti-al ups-well of qu-eri-es from pe-op-le wan-ting to find out what was go-ing
on, then the grim, pre-ci-pi-to-us shel-ving off as the pla-gu-es to-ok hold.
- China's still run-ning abo-ut ni-nety per-cent no-mi-nal.
Felix sho-ok his he-ad.
- You can't think that they're res-pon-sib-le
- No
She typed, but then she star-ted to key so-met-hing and then stop-ped.
- No of co-ur-se not. I be-li-eve the Po-po-vich Hypot-he-sis. This is a bunch of as-sho-les all using
the rest for co-ver. But Chi-na put them down har-der and fas-ter than an-yo-ne el-se. May-be we've
fi-nal-ly fo-und a use for to-ta-li-ta-ri-an sta-tes.
Felix co-uldn't re-sist. He typed:
- You're lucky yo-ur boss can't see you type that. You guys we-re pretty ent-hu-si-as-tic
par-ti-ci-pants in the Gre-at Fi-re-wall of Chi-na.
- Wasn't my idea
She typed.
- And my boss is de-ad. They're pro-bably all de-ad. The who-le Bay Area got hit hard, and then
the-re was the qu-ake.
They'd watc-hed the USGS's auto-ma-ted Da-taSt-re-am from the 6.9 that tras-hed Nort-hern Cal
from Gil-roy to Se-bas-to-pol. So-me web-cams re-ve-aled the sco-pe of the da-ma-ge-gas ma-in
exp-lo-si-ons, se-is-mi-cal-ly ret-ro-fit-ted bu-il-dings crump-ling li-ke pi-les of child-ren's blocks af-ter
a go-od kic-king. The Go-og-lep-lex, flo-ating on a se-ri-es of gi-gan-tic ste-el springs, had sho-ok li-ke
a pla-te-ful of jel-lo, but the racks had sta-yed in pla-ce and the worst inj-ury they'd had was a badly
bru-ised eye on a sysad-min who'd ca-ught a flying cab-le-crim-per in the fa-ce.
- Sorry. I for-got.
- OK. We all lost pe-op-le, right?

- Yeah. Ye-ah. Any-way, I'm not wor-ri-ed abo-ut the elec-ti-on. Who-ever wins, at le-ast we're
do-ing SO-MET-HING
- Not if they vo-te for one of the fuck-rags
Fuckrag was the epit-het that so-me of the sysad-mins we-re using to desc-ri-be the con-tin-gent that
wan-ted to shut down the In-ter-net. Qu-e-en Kong had co-ined it ap-pa-rently it had star-ted li-fe as a
catch-all term to desc-ri-be clu-eless IT ma-na-gers that she'd che-wed up thro-ugh her ca-re-er.
- They won't. They're just ti-red and sad is all yo-ur en-dor-se-ment will carry the day
The Go-og-lo-ids we-re one of the lar-gest and most po-wer-ful blocs left be-hind, along with the
sa-tel-li-te up-link crews and the re-ma-ining tran-so-ce-anic crews. Qu-e-en Kong's en-dor-se-ment
had co-me as a surp-ri-se and he'd sent her an ema-il that she'd rep-li-ed to ter-sely: "can't ha-ve the
fuck-rags in char-ge."
› gtg
She typed and then her con-nec-ti-on drop-ped. He fi-red up a brow-ser and cal-led up
go-og-le.com. The brow-ser ti-med out. He hit re-lo-ad, and then aga-in, and then the Go-og-le
front-pa-ge ca-me back up. Wha-te-ver had hit Qu-e-en Kong's workp-la-ce po-wer fa-ilu-re, worms,
anot-her qu-ake-she had fi-xed it. He snor-ted when he saw that they'd rep-la-ced the Os in the
Go-og-le lo-go with lit-tle pla-net Earths with mush-ro-om clo-uds ri-sing from them.
"Got anyt-hing to eat?" Van sa-id to him. It was mid-after-no-on, not that ti-me par-ti-cu-larly pas-sed
in the da-ta cent-re. Fe-lix pat-ted his poc-kets. They'd put a qu-ar-ter-mas-ter in char-ge, but not
be-fo-re ever-yo-ne had snag-ged so-me chow out of the mac-hi-nes. He'd had a do-zen po-wer-bars
and so-me ap-ples. He'd ta-ken a co-up-le sand-wic-hes but had wi-sely eaten them first be-fo-re they
got sta-le.
"One po-wer-bar left," he sa-id. He'd no-ti-ced a cer-ta-in lo-ose-ness in his wa-ist-li-ne that
mor-ning and had bri-efly re-lis-hed it. Then he'd re-mem-be-red Kelly's te-asing abo-ut his we-ight and
he'd cri-ed so-me. Then he'd eaten two po-wer-bars, le-aving him with just one left.
"Oh," Van sa-id. His fa-ce was hol-lo-wer than ever, his sho-ul-ders slo-ping in on his to-ast-rack
chest.
"Here," Fe-lix sa-id. "Vo-te Fe-lix."
Van to-ok the po-wer-bar from him and then put it down on the tab-le. "OK, I want to gi-ve this back
to you and say, 'No, I co-uldn't,' but I'm fuc-king hungry, so I'm just go-ing to ta-ke it and eat it, OK?"
"That's fi-ne by me," Fe-lix sa-id. "Enj-oy."
"How are the elec-ti-ons co-ming?" Van sa-id, on-ce he'd lic-ked the wrap-per cle-an.
"Dunno," Fe-lix sa-id. "Ha-ven't chec-ked in a whi-le." He'd be-en win-ning by a slim mar-gin a few
ho-urs be-fo-re. Not ha-ving his lap-top was a ma-j-or han-di-cap when it ca-me to stuff li-ke this. Up
in the ca-ges, the-re we-re a do-zen mo-re li-ke him, po-or bas-tards who'd left the ho-use on Der Tag
wit-ho-ut thin-king to snag so-met-hing Wi-Fi-enab-led.
"You're go-ing to get smo-ked," Sa-rio sa-id, sli-ding in next to them. He'd be-co-me fa-mo-us in the
cent-re for ne-ver sle-eping, for eavesd-rop-ping, for pic-king fights in RL that had the ill-con-si-de-red
he-at of a Use-net fi-ame-war. "The win-ner will be so-me-one who un-ders-tands a co-up-le of
fun-da-men-tal facts." He held up a fist, then tic-ked off his bul-let po-ints by ra-ising a fin-ger one at a
ti-me. "Po-int: The ter-ro-rists are using the In-ter-net to dest-roy the world, and we ne-ed to dest-roy
the In-ter-net first. Po-int: Even if I'm wrong, the who-le thing is a joke. We'll run out of
ge-ne-ra-tor-fu-el so-on eno-ugh. Po-int: Or if we don't, it will be be-ca-use the old world will be back
and run-ning, and it won't gi-ve a crap abo-ut yo-ur new world. Po-int: We're gon-na run out of fo-od

be-fo-re we run out of shit to ar-gue abo-ut or re-asons not to go out-si-de. We ha-ve the chan-ce to do
so-met-hing to help the world re-co-ver: we can kill the net and cut it off as a to-ol for bad guys. Or we
can re-ar-ran-ge so-me mo-re deck cha-irs on the brid-ge of yo-ur per-so-nal Ti-ta-nic in the ser-vi-ce
of so-me swe-et dre-am abo-ut an 'inde-pen-dent cybers-pa-ce.'"
The thing was that Sa-rio was right. They wo-uld be out of fu-el in two days-inter-mit-tent po-wer
from the grid had stretc-hed the-ir ge-ne-ra-tor li-fes-pan. And if you bo-ught his hypot-he-sis that the
In-ter-net was pri-ma-rily be-ing used as a to-ol to or-ga-ni-ze mo-re may-hem, shut-ting it down
wo-uld be the right thing to do.
But Fe-lix's da-ugh-ter and his wi-fe we-re de-ad. He didn't want to re-bu-ild the old world. He
wan-ted a new one. The old world was one that didn't ha-ve any pla-ce for him. Not any-mo-re.
Van scratc-hed his raw, fla-king skin. Puffs of dan-der and scruff swir-led in the musty, gre-asy air.
Sa-rio cur-led a lip at him. "That is dis-gus-ting. We're bre-at-hing recyc-led air, you know. Wha-te-ver
lep-rosy is eating you, aero-so-li-zing it in-to the air supply is pretty an-ti-so-ci-al."
"You're the world's le-ading aut-ho-rity on an-ti-so-ci-al, Sa-rio," Van sa-id. "Go away or I'll
mul-ti-to-ol you to de-ath." He stop-ped scratc-hing and pat-ted his she-at-hed mul-tip-li-ers li-ke a
guns-lin-ger.
"Yeah, Fm an-ti-so-ci-al. The got As-per-ger's and I ha-ven't ta-ken any meds in fo-ur days. What's
yo-ur fuc-king ex-cu-se?"
Van scratc-hed so-me mo-re. "I'm sorry," he sa-id. "I didn't know."
Sario crac-ked up. "Oh, you are pri-ce-less. I'd bet that three-qu-ar-ters of this bunch is bor-der-li-ne
autis-tic. Me, I'm just as as-sho-le. But I'm one who isn't af-ra-id to tell the truth, and that ma-kes me
bet-ter than you, dick-we-ed."
"Fuckrag," Fe-lix sa-id, "fuck off."
They had less than a day's worth of fu-el when Fe-lix was elec-ted the first ever Pri-me Mi-nis-ter of
Cybers-pa-ce. The first co-unt was spo-iled by a bot that spam-med the vo-ting pro-cess and they lost a
cri-ti-cal day whi-le they ad-ded up the vo-tes a se-cond ti-me.
But by then, it was all se-eming li-ke mo-re of a joke. Half the da-ta-cent-res had go-ne dark.
Qu-e-en Kong's net-maps of Go-og-le qu-eri-es we-re lo-oking grim-mer and grim-mer as mo-re of the
world went of-fli-ne, tho-ugh she ma-in-ta-ined a le-ader-bo-ard of new and ri-sing qu-eri-es lar-gely
re-la-ted to he-alth, shel-ter, sa-ni-ta-ti-on and self-de-fen-ce.
Worm-load slo-wed. Po-wer was go-ing off to many ho-me PC users, and sta-ying off, so the-ir
comp-ro-mi-sed PCs we-re go-ing dark. The back-bo-nes we-re still lit up and blin-king, but the
mis-si-ves from tho-se da-ta cent-res we-re lo-oking mo-re and mo-re des-pe-ra-te. Fe-lix hadn't eaten
in a day and ne-it-her had an-yo-ne in a sa-tel-li-te Earth-sta-ti-on of tran-so-ce-anic he-ad-end.
Water was run-ning short, too.
Popovich and Ro-sen-ba-um ca-me and got him be-fo-re he co-uld do mo-re than ans-wer a few
cong-ra-tu-la-tory mes-sa-ges and post a can-ned ac-cep-tan-ce spe-ech to newsg-ro-ups.
"We're go-ing to open the do-ors," Po-po-vich sa-id. Li-ke all of them, he'd lost we-ight and wa-xed
scruffy and oily. His BO was li-ke a clo-ud co-ming off trash-bags be-hind a fish-mar-ket on a sunny
day. Fe-lix was qu-ite su-re he smel-led no bet-ter.
"You're go-ing to go for a reccy? Get mo-re fu-el? We can char-ter a wor-king gro-up for it-gre-at
idea."
Rosenbaum sho-ok his he-ad sadly. "We're go-ing to go find our fa-mi-li-es. Wha-te-ver is out the-re
has bur-ned it-self out. Or it hasn't. Eit-her way, the-re's no fu-tu-re in he-re."
"What abo-ut net-work ma-in-te-nan-ce?" Fe-lix sa-id, tho-ugh he knew the ans-wers. "Who'll ke-ep
the ro-uters up?"
"We'll gi-ve you the ro-ot pas-swords to everyt-hing," Po-po-vich sa-id. His hands we-re sha-king
and his eyes we-re ble-ary. Li-ke many of the smo-kers stuck in the da-ta cent-re, he'd go-ne cold
tur-key this we-ek. They'd run out of caf-fe-ine pro-ducts two days ear-li-er, too. The smo-kers had it
ro-ugh.

"And I'll just stay he-re and ke-ep everyt-hing on-li-ne?"
"You and an-yo-ne el-se who ca-res any-mo-re."
Felix knew that he'd squ-an-de-red his op-por-tu-nity. The elec-ti-on had se-emed nob-le and
bra-ve, but in hind-sight all it had be-en was an ex-cu-se for in-figh-ting when they sho-uld ha-ve be-en
fi-gu-ring out what to do next. The prob-lem was that the-re was not-hing to do next.
"I can t ma-ke you stay" he sa-id.
"Yeah, you can’t." Po-po-vich tur-ned on his he-el and wal-ked out. Ro-sen-ba-um watc-hed him go,
then he grip-ped Fe-lix's sho-ul-der and squ-e-ezed it.
"Thank you, Fe-lix. It was a be-a-uti-ful dre-am. It still is. May-be we'll find so-met-hing to eat and
so-me fu-el and co-me back."
Rosenbaum had a sis-ter whom he'd be-en in con-tact with over IM for the first days af-ter the cri-sis
bro-ke. Then she'd stop-ped ans-we-ring. The sysad-mins we-re split among tho-se who'd had a
chan-ce to say go-odb-ye and tho-se who hadn't. Each was su-re the ot-her had it bet-ter.
They pos-ted abo-ut it on the in-ter-nal newsg-ro-up-they we-re still ge-eks, af-ter all, and the-re was
a lit-tle ho-no-ur gu-ard on the gro-und flo-or, ge-eks who watc-hed them pass to-ward the do-ub-le
do-ors. They ma-ni-pu-la-ted the key-pads and the ste-el shut-ters lif-ted, then the first set of do-ors
ope-ned. They step-ped in-to the ves-ti-bu-le and pul-led the do-ors shut be-hind them. The front
do-ors ope-ned. It was very bright and sunny out-si-de, and apart from how empty it was, it lo-oked
very nor-mal. He-artb-re-akingly so.
The two to-ok a ten-ta-ti-ve step out in-to the world. Then anot-her. They tur-ned to wa-ve at the
as-semb-led mas-ses. Then they both grab-bed the-ir thro-ats and be-gan to jerk and twitch, crump-ling
in a he-ap on the gro-und.
"Shiii-!" was all Fe-lix ma-na-ged to cho-ke out be-fo-re they both dus-ted them-sel-ves off and
sto-od up, la-ug-hing so hard they we-re clutc-hing the-ir si-des. They wa-ved on-ce mo-re and tur-ned
on the-ir he-els.
"Man, tho-se guys are sick," Van sa-id. He scratc-hed his arms, which had long, blo-ody scratc-hes
on them. His clot-hes we-re so co-ve-red in scurf they lo-oked li-ke they'd be-en dus-ted with icing
su-gar.
"I tho-ught it was pretty funny" Fe-lix sa-id.
"Christ I'm hungry," Van sa-id, con-ver-sa-ti-onal-ly.
"Lucky for you, we've got all the pac-kets we can eat," Fe-lix sa-id.
"You're too go-od to us grunts, Mr. Pre-si-dent," Van sa-id.
"Prime Mi-nis-ter," he sa-id. "And you're no grunt, you're the De-puty Pri-me Mi-nis-ter. You're my
de-sig-na-ted rib-bon-cut-ter and han-der-out of over-si-zed no-velty checks."
It bu-oyed both of the-ir spi-rits. Watc-hing Po-po-vich and Ro-sen-ba-um go, it bu-oyed them up.
Fe-lix knew then that they'd all be go-ing so-on.
That had be-en pre-or-da-ined by the fu-el-sup-ply, but who wan-ted to wa-it for the fu-el to run out,
any-way?
- half my crew split this mor-ning
Queen Konn typed. Go-og-le was hol-ding up pretty flo-od any-way, of co-ur-se. The lo-ad on the
ser-vers was a lot ligh-ter than it had be-en sin-ce the days when Go-og-le fit on a bunch of hand-bu-ilt
PCs un-der a desk at Stan-ford.
- we're down to a qu-ar-ter
Felix typed back. It was only a day sin-ce Po-po-vich and Ro-sen-ba-um left, but the traf-fic on the
newsg-ro-ups had fal-len down to ne-ar ze-ro. He and Van hadn't had much ti-me to play Re-pub-lic of
Cybers-pa-ce. They'd be-en too busy le-ar-ning the systems that Po-po-vich had tur-ned over to them,
the big, big ro-uters that had went on ac-ting as the ma-j-or in-terc-han-ge for all the net-work

back-bo-nes in Ca-na-da.
Still, so-me-one pos-ted to the newsg-ro-ups every now and aga-in, ge-ne-ral-ly to say go-odb-ye.
The old fla-me-wars abo-ut who wo-uld be PM, or whet-her they wo-uld shut down the net-work, or
who to-ok too much fo-od-it was all go-ne.
He re-lo-aded the newsg-ro-up. The-re was a typi-cal mes-sa-ge.
- Runaway pro-ces-ses on So-la-ris
- Uh, hi. I'm just a light-we-ight MSCE but I'm the only one awa-ke he-re and fo-ur of the DSLAMs
just went down. Lo-oks li-ke the-re's so-me cus-tom ac-co-un-ting co-de that's trying to fi-gu-re out
how much to bill our cor-po-ra-te cus-to-mers and it's spaw-ned ten tho-usand thre-ads and its eating all
the swap. I just want to kill it but I can't se-em to do that. Is the-re so-me ma-gic in-vo-ca-ti-on I ne-ed
to do to get this god-dam-ned we-enix box to kill this shit? I me-an, it's not as if any of our cus-to-mers
are ever go-ing to pay us aga-in. I'd ask the guy who wro-te this co-de, but he's pretty much de-ad as
far as an-yo-ne can work out.
He re-lo-aded. The-re was a res-pon-se. It was short, aut-ho-ri-ta-ti-ve, and help-ful-just the sort of
thing you al-most ne-ver saw in a high-ca-lib-re newsg-ro-up when a no-ob pos-ted a dumb qu-es-ti-on.
The apo-calyp-se had awo-ken the spi-rit of pa-ti-ent help-ful-ness in the world's sysop com-mu-nity.
Van sho-ul-der sur-fed him. "Holy shit, who knew he had it in him?"
He lo-oked at the mes-sa-ge aga-in. It was from Will Sa-rio.
He drop-ped in-to his chat win-dow.
- sario i tho-ught you wan-ted the net-work de-ad why are you hel-ping msces fix the-ir bo-xen?
- ‹sheepish grin› Gee Mr PM, may-be I just can't be-ar to watch a com-pu-ter suf-fer at the hands of
an ama-te-ur.
He flip-ped to the chan-nel with Qu-e-en Kong in it.
- How long?
- Since I slept? Two days. Un-til we run out of fu-el? Three days. Sin-ce we ran out of fo-od? Two
days.
- Jeez. I didn't sle-ep last night eit-her. We're a lit-tle short han-ded aro-und he-re.
- asl? I’m Mo-ni-ca and I li-ve in Pa-sa-de-na and I’m bo-red with my ho-me-work. Wo-uld you
li-ke to down-lo-ad my pic???
The Tro-j-an bots we-re all over IRC the-se days, jum-ping to every chan-nel that had any traf-fic on
it. So-me-ti-mes you ca-ught fi-ve or six flir-ting with each ot-her. It was pretty we-ird to watch a pi-ece
of mal-wa-re try to con anot-her ins-tan-ce of it-self in-to down-lo-ading a Tro-j-an.
They both kic-ked the bot off the chan-nel si-mul-ta-ne-o-usly. He had a script for it now. The spam
hadn't even ta-iled off a lit-tle.
- How co-me the spam isn't re-du-cing? Half the god-dam-ned da-ta cent-res ha-ve go-ne dark
Queen Kong pa-used a long ti-me be-fo-re typing. As had be-co-me auto-ma-tic when she went
high-la-tency, he re-lo-aded the Go-og-le ho-me-pa-ge. Su-re eno-ugh, it was down.

- Sario, you got any fo-od?
- You won't miss a co-up-le mo-re me-als, Yo-ur Ex-cel-lency
Van had go-ne back to Ma-yor McChe-ese but he was in the sa-me chan-nel. "What a dick. You're
lo-oking pretty buff, tho-ugh, du-de."
Van didn't lo-ok so go-od. He lo-oked li-ke you co-uld knock him over with a stiff bre-eze and he
had a phlegmy, we-ak qu-ality to his spe-ech.
- Hey Kong everyt-hing ok?
- Everything's fi-ne just had to go kick so-me ass
"How's the traf-fic, Van?"
"Down twenty-fi-ve per-cent from this mor-ning," he sa-id. The-re we-re a bunch of no-des who-se
con-nec-ti-ons ro-uted thro-ugh them. Pre-su-mably most of the-se we-re ho-me or com-mer-ci-al
cus-to-mers in pla-ces whe-re the po-wer was still on and the pho-ne com-pany's COs we-re still ali-ve.
Every on-ce in a whi-le, Fe-lix wo-uld wi-re-tap the con-nec-ti-ons to see if he co-uld find a per-son
who had news of the wi-de world. Al-most all of it was auto-ma-ted traf-fic, tho-ugh: net-work
bac-kups, sta-tus up-da-tes. Spam. Lots of spam.
- Spam’s still up be-ca-use the ser-vi-ces that stop spam are fa-iling fas-ter than the ser-vi-ces that
cre-ate it. All the an-ti-worm stuff is cent-ra-li-zed in a co-up-le pla-ces. The bad stuff is on a mil-li-on
zom-bie com-pu-ters. If only the lo-sers had had the go-od sen-se to turn off the-ir ho-me PCs be-fo-re
ke-eling over or ta-king off
- At the ra-te we-re go-ing well be ro-uting not-hing but spam by din-ner-ti-me
Van cle-ared his thro-at, a pa-in-ful so-und. "Abo-ut that," he sa-id. "I think it's go-ing to hit so-oner
than that. Fe-lix, I don't think an-yo-ne wo-uld no-ti-ce if we just wal-ked away from he-re."
Felix lo-oked at him, his skin the co-lo-ur of cor-ned-be-ef and stre-aked with long, angry scabs. His
rin-gers tremb-led. "You drin-king eno-ugh wa-ter?"
Van nod-ded. "All frig-ging day, every ten se-conds. Anyt-hing to ke-ep my belly full." He po-in-ted
to a re-fil-led Pep-si Max bot-tle full of wa-ter by his si-de. "Let's ha-ve a me-eting," he sa-id.
There had be-en forty-three of them on D-Day. Now the-re we-re fif-te-en. Six had res-pon-ded to
the call for a me-eting by simply le-aving. Ever-yo-ne knew wit-ho-ut ha-ving to be told what the
me-eting was abo-ut.
"So that's it, you're go-ing to let it all fall apart?" Sa-rio was the only one with the energy left to get
pro-perly angry. He'd go angry to his gra-ve. The ve-ins on his thro-at and fo-re-he-ad sto-od out
ang-rily. His fists sho-ok ang-rily. All the ot-her ge-eks went lids-down at the si-te of him, lo-oking up in
uni-son for on-ce at the dis-cus-si-on, not ke-eping one eye on a chat-log or a ta-iled ser-vi-ce log.
"Sario, you've got to be shit-ting me," Fe-lix sa-id. "You wan-ted to pull the god-dam-ned plug!"
"I wan-ted it to go cle-an" he sho-uted. "I didn't want it to ble-ed out and ke-el over in lit-tle gasps
and pu-kes fo-re-ver. I wan-ted it to be an act of will by the glo-bal com-mu-nity of its ca-re-ta-kers. I
wan-ted it to be an af-fir-ma-ti-ve act by hu-man hands. Not ent-ropy and bad co-de and worms
win-ning out. Fuck that, that's just what's hap-pe-ned out the-re."
Up in the top-flo-or ca-fe-te-ria, the-re we-re win-dows all aro-und, har-de-ned and light-ben-ding,
and by cus-tom, they we-re all blinds-down. Now Sa-rio ran aro-und the ro-om, yan-king on the blinds.
How the hell can he get the energy to run? Fe-lix won-de-red. He co-uld ba-rely walk up the sta-irs to
the me-eting ro-om.
Harsh day-light flo-oded in. It was a fi-ne sunny day out the-re, but everyw-he-re you lo-oked

ac-ross that com-man-ding vi-ew of To-ron-to's skyli-ne, the-re we-re ri-sing plu-mes of smo-ke. The
TD to-wer, a gi-gan-tic black mo-der-nist glass brick, was go-uting fla-me to the sky. "It's all fal-ling
apart, the way everyt-hing do-es.
"Listen, lis-ten. If we le-ave the net-work to fall over slowly, parts of it will stay on-li-ne for months.
May-be ye-ars. And what will run on it? Mal-wa-re. Worms. Spam. System-pro-ces-ses. Zo-ne
trans-fers. The things we use fall apart and re-qu-ire cons-tant ma-in-te-nan-ce. The things we aban-don
don't get used and they last fo-re-ver. We're go-ing to le-ave the net-work be-hind li-ke a li-me-pit
fil-led with in-dust-ri-al was-te. That will be our fuc-king le-gacy-the le-gacy of every keyst-ro-ke you
and I and an-yo-ne, anyw-he-re ever typed. You un-ders-tand? We're go-ing to le-ave it to die slow
li-ke a wo-un-ded dog, ins-te-ad of gi-ving it one cle-an shot thro-ugh the he-ad."
Van scratc-hed his che-eks, then Fe-lix saw that he was wi-ping away te-ars.
"Sario, you're not wrong, but you're not right eit-her," he sa-id. "Le-aving it up to limp along is right.
We're go-ing to all be lim-ping for a long ti-me, and may-be it will be so-me use to so-me-one. If the-re's
one pac-ket be-ing ro-uted from any user to any ot-her user, anyw-he-re in the world, it's do-ing its job."
"If you want a cle-an kill, you can do that," Fe-lix sa-id. "I'm the PM and I say so. I'm gi-ving you
ro-ot. All of you." He tur-ned to the whi-te-bo-ard whe-re the ca-fe-te-ria wor-kers used to scrawl the
day's spe-ci-als. Now it was co-ve-red with the rem-nants of he-ated tech-ni-cal de-ba-tes that the
sysad-mins had en-ga-ged in over the days sin-ce the day.
He scrub-bed away a cle-an spot with his sle-eve and be-gan to wri-te out long, comp-li-ca-ted
alp-ha-nu-me-ric pas-swords sal-ted with punc-tu-ati-on. Fe-lix had a gift for re-mem-be-ring that kind
of pas-sword. He do-ub-ted it wo-uld do him much go-od, ever aga-in.
- Were go-ing, Kong. Fu-els al-most out any-way
- Yeah well that’s right then, it was an ho-no-ur, Mr. pri-me mi-nis-ter
- You go-ing to be ok?
- I've com-man-de-ered a yo-ung sysad-min to see to my fe-mi-ni-ne ne-eds and we've fo-und
anot-her cac-he of fo-od that’ll last us a co-up-le we-eks now we-re down to fif-te-en ad-mins, I’m in
hog he-aven pal
- You're ama-zing, Qu-e-en Kong, se-ri-o-usly. Don’t be a he-ro tho-ugh. When you ne-ed to go go.
The-re’s got to be so-met-hing out the-re
- Be sa-fe Fe-lix, se-ri-o-usly-btw did I tell you qu-eri-es are up in Ro-ma-nia? May-be they’re
get-ting back on the-ir fe-et
- Really?
- Yeah, re-al-ly, we're hard to kill-li-ke fuc-king ro-ac-hes
Her con-nec-ti-on di-ed. He drop-ped to Fi-re-fox and re-lo-aded Go-og-le and it was down. He hit
re-lo-ad and hit re-lo-ad and hit re-lo-ad, but it didn't co-me up. He clo-sed his eyes and lis-te-ned to
Van scratch his legs and then he-ard Van type a lit-tle.
"They're back up," he sa-id.
Felix who-os-hed out a bre-ath. He sent the mes-sa-ge to the newsg-ro-up, one that he'd run thro-ugh
fi-ve drafts be-fo-re set-tling on: "Ta-ke ca-re of the pla-ce, OK? We'll be back, so-me-day."
Everyone was go-ing ex-cept Sa-rio. Sa-rio wo-uldn't le-ave. He ca-me down to see them off,
tho-ugh.
The sysad-mins gat-he-red in the lobby and Fe-lix ma-de the sa-fety do-or go up, and the light

rus-hed in.
Sario stuck his hand out. "Go-od luck," he sa-id.
"You too," Fe-lix sa-id. He had a firm grip, Sa-rio, stron-ger than he had any right to be. "May-be you
we-re right," he sa-id. "May-be," he sa-id. "You go-ing to pull the plug?"
Sario lo-oked up at the drop-ce-iling, se-eming to pe-er thro-ugh the re-in-for-ced flo-ors at the
hum-ming racks abo-ve. "Who knows?" he sa-id at last.
Van scratc-hed and a flurry of whi-te mo-tes dan-ced in the sun-light.
"Let's go find you a phar-macy," Fe-lix sa-id. He wal-ked to the do-or and the ot-her sysad-mins
fol-lo-wed.
They wa-ited for the in-te-ri-or do-ors to clo-se be-hind them and then Fe-lix ope-ned the ex-te-ri-or
do-ors. The air smel-led and tas-ted li-ke mown grass, li-ke the first drops of ra-in, li-ke the la-ke and
the sky, li-ke the out-do-ors and the world, an old fri-end not he-ard from in an eter-nity.
"Bye, Fe-lix," the ot-her sysad-mins sa-id. They we-re drif-ting away whi-le he sto-od trans-fi-xed at
the top of the short conc-re-te sta-ir-ca-se. The light hurt his eyes and ma-de them wa-ter.
"I think the-re's a Shop-pers Drug Mart on King Stre-et," he sa-id to Van. "We'll throw a brick
thro-ugh the win-dow and get you so-me cor-ti-so-ne, OK?" "You're the Pri-me Mi-nis-ter," Van sa-id.
"Le-ad on."
They didn't see a sing-le so-ul on the fif-te-en-mi-nu-te walk. The-re wasn't a sing-le so-und ex-cept
for so-me bird no-ises and so-me dis-tant gro-ans, and the wind in the elect-ric cab-les over-he-ad. It
was li-ke wal-king on the sur-fa-ce of the mo-on.
"Bet they ha-ve cho-co-la-te bars at the Shop-per's," Van sa-id.
Felix's sto-mach lurc-hed. Fo-od. "Wow," he sa-id, aro-und a mo-uth-ful of sa-li-va.
They wal-ked past a lit-tle hatch-back and in the front se-at was the dri-ed body of a wo-man
hol-ding the dri-ed body of a baby, and his mo-uth fil-led with so-ur bi-le, even tho-ugh the smell was
fa-int thro-ugh the rol-led-up win-dows.
He hadn't tho-ught of Kelly or 2.0 in days. He drop-ped to his kne-es and retc-hed aga-in. Out he-re
in the re-al world, his fa-mily was de-ad. Ever-yo-ne he knew was de-ad. He just wan-ted to lie down
on the si-de-walk and wa-it to die, too.
Van's ro-ugh hands slip-ped un-der his arm-pits and ha-uled we-akly at him. "Not now," he sa-id.
"Once we're sa-fe in-si-de so-mew-he-re and we've eaten so-met-hing, then you can do this, but not
now. Un-ders-tand me, Fe-lix? Not fuc-king now."
The pro-fa-nity got thro-ugh to him. He got to his fe-et. His kne-es we-re tremb-ling.
"Just a block mo-re "Van sa-id, and slip-ped Fe-lix's arm aro-und his sho-ul-ders and led him along.
"Thank you, Van. I'm sorry."
"No swe-at," he sa-id. "You ne-ed a sho-wer, bad. No of-fen-se." "No-ne ta-ken."
The Shop-per's had a me-tal se-cu-rity ga-te, but it had be-en torn away from the front win-dows,
which had be-en ru-dely smas-hed. Fe-lix and Van squ-e-ezed thro-ugh the gap and step-ped in-to the
dim drug-sto-re. A few of the disp-lays we-re knoc-ked over, but ot-her than that, it lo-oked OK. By
the cash-re-gis-ters, Fe-lix spot-ted the racks of candy bars at the sa-me ins-tant that Van saw them,
and they hur-ri-ed over and grab-bed a hand-ful each, stuf-fing the-ir fa-ces. "You two eat li-ke pigs."
They both whir-led at the so-und of the wo-man's vo-ice. She was hol-ding a fi-re-axe that was
ne-arly as big as she was. She wo-re a lab-co-at and com-for-tab-le sho-es.
"You ta-ke what you ne-ed and go, OK? No sen-se in the-re be-ing any tro-ub-le." Her chin was
po-inty and her eyes we-re sharp. She lo-oked to be in her for-ti-es. She lo-oked not-hing li-ke Kelly,
which was go-od, be-ca-use Fe-lix felt li-ke run-ning and gi-ving her a hug as it was. Anot-her per-son
ali-ve!
"Are you a doc-tor?" Fe-lix sa-id. She was we-aring scrubs un-der the co-at, he saw. "You go-ing to
go?" She bran-dis-hed the axe.
Felix held his hands up. "Se-ri-o-usly, are you a doc-tor? A phar-ma-cist?" "I used to be an RN, ten
ye-ars ago. I'm mostly a Web-de-sig-ner." "You're shit-ting me," Fe-lix sa-id.

"Haven't you ever met a girl who knew abo-ut com-pu-ters?" "Actu-al-ly, a fri-end of mi-ne who runs
Go-og-le's da-ta cent-re is a girl. A wo-man, I me-an."
"You're shit-ting me," she sa-id. "A wo-man ran Go-og-le's da-ta cent-re?" "Runs," Fe-lix sa-id. "It's
still on-li-ne." "NFW," she sa-id. She let the axe lo-wer.
"Way. Ha-ve you got any cor-ti-so-ne cre-am? I can tell you the story. My na-me's Fe-lix and this is
Van, who ne-eds any an-ti-his-ta-mi-nes you can spa-re."
"I can spa-re? Fe-lix old pal, I ha-ve eno-ugh do-pe he-re to last a hund-red ye-ars. This stuff's go-ing
to ex-pi-re long be-fo-re it runs out. But are you tel-ling me that the net's still up?"
"It's still up," he sa-id. "Kind of. That's what we've be-en do-ing all we-ek. Ke-eping it on-li-ne. It
might not last much lon-ger, tho-ugh."
"No," she sa-id. "I don't sup-po-se it wo-uld." She set the axe down. "Ha-ve you got anyt-hing to
tra-de? I don't ne-ed much, but I've be-en trying to ke-ep my spi-rits up by tra-ding with the
ne-igh-bo-urs. It's li-ke pla-ying Ci-vi-li-za-ti-on." "You ha-ve ne-igh-bo-urs?"
"At le-ast ten," she sa-id. "The pe-op-le in the res-ta-urant ac-ross the way ma-ke a pretty go-od
so-up, even if most of the veg is can-ned. They cle-aned me out of Ster-no, tho-ugh."
"You've got ne-igh-bo-urs and you tra-de with them?"
"Well, no-mi-nal-ly. It'd be pretty lo-nely wit-ho-ut them. I've ta-ken ca-re of wha-te-ver snif-fles I
co-uld. Set a bo-ne-bro-ken wrist. Lis-ten, do you want so-me Won-der Bre-ad and pe-anut but-ter? I
ha-ve a ton of it, yo-ur fri-end lo-oks li-ke he co-uld use a me-al."
"Yes ple-ase," Van sa-id. "We don't ha-ve anyt-hing to tra-de, but we're both com-mit-ted
wor-ka-ho-lics lo-oking to le-arn a tra-de. Co-uld you use so-me as-sis-tants?"
"Not re-al-ly." She spun her axe on its he-ad. "But I wo-uldn't mind so-me com-pany."
They ate the sand-wic-hes and then so-me so-up. The res-ta-urant pe-op-le bro-ught it over and
ma-de the-ir man-ners at them, tho-ugh Fe-lix saw the-ir no-ses wrink-le up and as-cer-ta-ined that
the-re was wor-king plum-bing in the back ro-om. Van went in to ta-ke a spon-ge bath and then he
fol-lo-wed.
"None of us know what to do," the wo-man sa-id. Her na-me was Ro-sa, and she had fo-und them a
bot-tle of wi-ne and so-me dis-po-sab-le plas-tic cups from the ho-use-wa-res ais-le. "I tho-ught we'd
ha-ve he-li-cop-ters or tanks or even lo-oters, but it's just qu-i-et."
"You se-em to ha-ve kept pretty qu-i-et yo-ur-self," Fe-lix sa-id. "Didn't want to at-tract the wrong
kind of at-ten-ti-on."
"You ever think that may-be the-re's a lot of pe-op-le out the-re do-ing the sa-me thing? May-be if
we all get to-get-her we'll co-me up with so-met-hing to do." "Or may-be they'll cut our thro-ats," she
sa-id. Van nod-ded. "She's got a po-int."
Felix was on his fe-et. "No way, we can't think li-ke that. Lady, we're at a cri-ti-cal junc-tu-re he-re.
We can go down thro-ugh neg-li-gen-ce, dwind-ling away in our hi-ding ho-les, or we can try to bu-ild
so-met-hing bet-ter."
"Better?" She ma-de a ru-de no-ise.
"OK, not bet-ter. So-met-hing tho-ugh. Bu-il-ding so-met-hing new is bet-ter than let-ting it dwind-le
away. Christ, what are you go-ing to do when you've re-ad all the ma-ga-zi-nes and eaten all the
po-ta-to chips he-re?"
Rosa sho-ok her he-ad. "Pretty talk," she sa-id. "But what the hell are we go-ing to do, any-way?"
"Something," Fe-lix sa-id. "We're go-ing to do so-met-hing. So-met-hing is bet-ter than not-hing.
We're go-ing to ta-ke this patch of the world whe-re pe-op-le are tal-king to each ot-her, and we're
go-ing to ex-pand it. We're go-ing to find ever-yo-ne we can and we're go-ing to ta-ke ca-re of them
and they're go-ing to ta-ke ca-re of us. We'll pro-bably fuck it up. We'll pro-bably fa-il. I'd rat-her fa-il
than gi-ve up, tho-ugh."
Van la-ug-hed. "Fe-lix, you are cra-zi-er than Sa-rio, you know it?"
"We're go-ing to go and drag him out, first thing to-mor-row. He's go-ing to be a part of this, too.
Ever-yo-ne will. Screw the end of the world. The world do-esn't end. Hu-mans aren't the kind of things
that ha-ve en-dings."

Rosa sho-ok her he-ad aga-in, but she was smi-ling a lit-tle now. "And you'll be what, the
Po-pe-Empe-ror of the World?"
"He pre-fers Pri-me Mi-nis-ter," Van sa-id in a sta-gey whis-per. The an-ti-his-ta-mi-nes had
wor-ked mi-rac-les on his skin, and it had fa-ded from angry red to a fi-ne pink.
"You want to be Mi-nis-ter of He-alth, Ro-sa?" he sa-id.
"Boys," she sa-id. "Pla-ying ga-mes. How abo-ut this. I’ll help out ho-we-ver I can, pro-vi-ded you
ne-ver ask me to call you Pri-me Mi-nis-ter and you ne-ver call me the Mi-nis-ter of He-alth?"
"It's a de-al," he sa-id.
Van re-fil-led the-ir glas-ses, upen-ding the wi-ne bot-tle to get the last few drops out. They ra-ised
the-ir glas-ses. "To the world," Fe-lix sa-id. "To hu-ma-nity." He tho-ught hard. "To re-bu-il-ding." "To
anyt-hing," Van sa-id. "To anyt-hing," Fe-lix sa-id. "To everyt-hing." "To everyt-hing," Ro-sa sa-id.
They drank. He wan-ted to go see the ho-use-see Kelly and 2.0, tho-ugh his sto-mach chur-ned at
the tho-ught of what he might find the-re. But the next day, they star-ted to re-bu-ild. And months la-ter,
they star-ted over aga-in, when di-sag-re-ements dro-ve apart the fra-gi-le lit-tle gro-up they'd pul-led
to-get-her. And a ye-ar af-ter that, they star-ted over aga-in. And fi-ve ye-ars la-ter, they star-ted
aga-in.
It was ne-arly six months be-fo-re he went ho-me. Van hel-ped him along, ri-ding co-ver be-hind him
on the bicyc-les they used to get aro-und town. The furt-her north they ro-de, the stron-ger the smell of
burnt wo-od be-ca-me. The-re we-re lots of burnt-out ho-uses. So-me-ti-mes ma-ra-uders burnt the
ho-uses they'd lo-oted, but mo-re of-ten it was just na-tu-re, the kinds of fi-res you got in fo-rests and on
mo-un-ta-ins. The-re we-re six cho-king, burnt blocks whe-re every ho-use was burnt be-fo-re they
re-ac-hed ho-me.
But Fe-lix's old ho-using de-ve-lop-ment was still stan-ding, an oasis of eerily pris-ti-ne bu-il-dings
that lo-oked li-ke may-be the-ir so-mew-hat neg-lect-ful ow-ners had me-rely step-ped out to buy
so-me pa-int and fresh lawn-mo-wer bla-des to bring the-ir old ho-mes back up to the-ir ne-at,
gro-omed sel-ves.
That was wor-se, so-me-how. He got off the bi-ke at the entry of the sub-di-vi-si-on and they
wal-ked the bi-kes to-get-her in si-len-ce, lis-te-ning to the so-ugh of the wind in the tre-es. Win-ter was
co-ming la-te that ye-ar, but it was co-ming, and as the swe-at dri-ed in the wind, Fe-lix star-ted to
shi-ver.
He didn't ha-ve his keys any-mo-re. They we-re at the da-ta cent-re, months and worlds away. He
tri-ed the do-or-hand-le, but it didn't turn. He ap-pli-ed his sho-ul-der to the do-or and it rip-ped away
from its wet, rot-ted jamb with a lo-ud, splin-te-ring so-und. The ho-use was rot-ting from the in-si-de.
The do-or splas-hed when it lan-ded. The ho-use was full of stag-nant wa-ter, fo-ur inc-hes of
stin-king pond-scum-med wa-ter in the li-ving ro-om. He splas-hed ca-re-ful-ly thro-ugh it, fe-eling the
flo-or-bo-ards sag spon-gily be-ne-ath each step.
Up the sta-irs, his no-se full of that ter-rib-le gre-en mil-dewy stench. In-to the bed-ro-om, the
fur-ni-tu-re fa-mi-li-ar as a child-ho-od fri-end.
Kelly was in the bed with 2.0. The way they both lay, it was cle-ar they hadn't go-ne easy-they we-re
twis-ted do-ub-le, Kelly cur-led aro-und 2.0. The-ir skin was blo-ated, ma-king them al-most
un-re-cog-ni-zab-le. The smell-God, the smell.
Felix's he-ad spun. He tho-ught he wo-uld fall over and clutc-hed at the dres-ser. An emo-ti-on he
co-uldn't na-me ra-ge, an-ger, sor-row?-ma-de him bre-at-he hard, gulp for air li-ke he was drow-ning.
And then it was over. The world was over. Kelly and 2.0-over. And he had a job to do. He fol-ded
the blan-ket over them-Van hel-ped, so-lemnly. They went in-to the front yard and to-ok turns dig-ging,
using the sho-vel from the ga-ra-ge that Kelly had used for gar-de-ning. They had lots of ex-pe-ri-en-ce
dig-ging gra-ves by then. Lots of ex-pe-ri-en-ce hand-ling the de-ad. They dug, and wary dogs
watc-hed them from the tall grass on the ne-igh-bo-uring lawns, but they we-re al-so go-od at cha-sing
off dogs with well-thrown sto-nes.
When the gra-ve was dug, they la-id Fe-lix's wi-fe and son to rest in it. Fe-lix qu-es-ted af-ter words
to say over the mo-und, but no-ne ca-me. He'd dug so many gra-ves for so many men's wi-ves and so

many wo-men's hus-bands and so many child-ren-the words we-re long go-ne.
Felix dug ditc-hes and sal-va-ged cans and bu-ri-ed the de-ad. He plan-ted and har-ves-ted. He
fi-xed so-me cars and le-ar-ned to ma-ke bi-odi-esel. Fi-nal-ly he fetc-hed up in a da-ta cent-re for a
lit-tle go-vern-ment-lit-tle go-vern-ments ca-me and went, but this one was smart eno-ugh to want to
ke-ep re-cords and ne-eded so-me-one to ke-ep everyt-hing run-ning, and Van went with him.
They spent a lot of ti-me in chat ro-oms and so-me-ti-mes they hap-pe-ned upon old fri-ends from the
stran-ge ti-me they'd spent run-ning the Dist-ri-bu-ted Re-pub-lic of Cybers-pa-ce, ge-eks who
in-sis-ted on cal-ling him PM, tho-ugh no one in the re-al world ever cal-led him that any-mo-re.
It wasn't a go-od li-fe, most of the ti-me. Fe-lix's wo-unds ne-ver he-aled, and ne-it-her did most
ot-her pe-op-le's. The-re we-re lin-ge-ring sick-nes-ses and sud-den ones. Tra-gedy on tra-gedy.
But Fe-lix li-ked his da-ta cent-re. The-re in the hum-ming of the racks, he ne-ver felt li-ke it was the
first days of a bet-ter na-ti-on, but he ne-ver felt li-ke it was the last days of one, eit-her.
- Go to bed, Fe-lix
- Soon, Kong, so-on-almost got this bac-kup run-ning
- You're a jun-kie, du-de.
- Look who’s tal-king
He re-lo-aded the Go-og-le ho-me-pa-ge. Qu-e-en Kong had had it on-li-ne for a co-up-le ye-ars
now. The Os in Go-og-le chan-ged all the ti-me, whe-ne-ver she got the ur-ge. To-day they we-re lit-tle
car-to-on glo-bes, one smi-ling the ot-her frow-ning.
He lo-oked at it for a long ti-me and drop-ped back in-to a ter-mi-nal to check his bac-kup. It was
run-ning cle-an, for a chan-ge. The lit-tle go-vern-ment's re-cords we-re sa-fe.
- ok night night
- take ca-re
Van wa-ved at him as he cre-aked to the do-or, stretc-hing out his back with a long se-ri-es of pops.
"Sleep well, boss," he sa-id.
"Don't stick aro-und he-re all night aga-in," Fe-lix sa-id. "You ne-ed yo-ur sle-ep, too."
"You're too go-od to us grunts," Van sa-id, and went back to typing.
Felix went to the do-or and wal-ked out in-to the night. Be-hind him, the bi-odi-esel ge-ne-ra-tor
hum-med and ma-de its ac-rid fu-mes. The har-vest mo-on was up, which he lo-ved. To-mor-row, he'd
go back and fix anot-her com-pu-ter and fight off ent-ropy aga-in. And why not?
It was what he did. He was a sysad-min.

X - JAMES VAN PELT - THE LAST OF THE O-FORMS
Beyond the big rig's open win-dow, the Mis-sis-sip-pi ri-ver lands rol-led darkly by. Boggy are-as
ca-ught the mo-on low on the ho-ri-zon li-ke a sil-ver co-in, flic-ke-ring thro-ugh black-tre-ed
hum-mocks, or stra-ined by split-ra-il fen-ce, mi-le af-ter mi-le. The air smel-led damp and de-ad-fish
mossy, he-avy as a wet to-wel, but it was bet-ter than the ani-mal enc-lo-su-res on a hot af-ter-no-on
when the sun po-un-ded the aw-nings and the ex-hi-bits hud-dled in we-ak sha-de. Tra-vel-ling at night
was the way to go. Tre-vin co-un-ted the dis-tan-ce in mi-nu-tes. They'd blow thro-ugh Ro-xie so-on,
then hit Ham-burg, McNa-ir, and Har-ris-ton in qu-ick suc-ces-si-on. In Fa-yet-te, the-re was a ni-ce

di-ner whe-re they co-uld get bre-ak-fast, but it me-ant tur-ning off the high-way and they'd hit the worst
of Vicks-burg's mor-ning traf-fic if they stop-ped. No, the thing to do was to ke-ep dri-ving, dri-ving to
the next town, whe-re he co-uld sa-ve the show.
He re-ac-hed ac-ross the se-at to the gro-cery sack bet-we-en him and Cap-ri-ce. She was as-le-ep,
her baby-blon-de he-ad res-ting aga-inst the do-or, her small hands hol-ding a Gre-ek edi-ti-on of the
Odys-sey open on her lap. If she we-re awa-ke, she co-uld glan-ce at the map and tell him exactly how
many mi-les they had left to Ma-yers-vil-le, how long to the mi-nu-te at this spe-ed it wo-uld ta-ke, and
how much di-esel, to the oun-ce, they'd ha-ve left in the-ir tanks. Her lit-tle-girl eyes wo-uld pin him to
the wall. "Why can’t you fi-gu-re this out on yo-ur own?" they'd ask. He tho-ught abo-ut hi-ding her
pho-ne bo-ok so she'd ha-ve not-hing to sit on and co-uldn't lo-ok out the win-dow. That wo-uld show
her. She might lo-ok two ye-ars old, but she was re-al-ly twel-ve, and had the so-ul of a mid-dle-aged
tax at-tor-ney.
At the sack's bot-tom, be-ne-ath an empty do-nut box, he fo-und the be-ef jerky. It tas-ted mostly of
pep-per, but un-der-ne-ath it had a tingly, me-tal-lic fla-vo-ur he tri-ed not to think abo-ut. Who knew
what it might ha-ve be-en ma-de from? He do-ub-ted the-re we-re any ori-gi-nal-form cows, the
o-cows, left to sla-ugh-ter.
After a long cur-ve, a city li-mit sign lo-omed out of the dark. Tre-vin step-ped on the bra-kes, then
ge-ared down. Ro-xie cops we-re in-fa-mo-us for spe-ed traps, and the-re wasn't eno-ugh bri-be
mo-ney in the kitty to ma-ke a tic-ket go away. In his re-ar-vi-ew mir-ror, the ot-her truck and a car
with Hardy the handy-man and his crew of ro-us-ta-bo-uts clo-sed ranks.
Roxie's traf-fic sig-nal blin-ked yel-low over an empty in-ter-sec-ti-on, whi-le the clo-sed shops
sto-od mu-te un-der a hand-ful of stre-et-lights. Af-ter the fo-ur-block-long down-town, anot-her mi-le
of be-at-up ho-uses and tra-ilers li-ned the ro-ad, whe-re bro-ken was-hing mac-hi-nes and pic-kups on
cin-der blocks dot-ted mo-on-lit front yards. So-met-hing bar-ked at him from be-hind a cha-in-link
fen-ce. Tre-vin slo-wed for a clo-ser lo-ok. Pro-fes-si-onal cu-ri-osity. It lo-oked li-ke an o-dog un-der
a porch light, an ori-gi-nal-form ani-mal, an old one, if his stiff-ga-ited walk was an in-di-ca-tor. We-ren't
many of tho-se left any-mo-re. Not sin-ce the mu-ta-gen hit. Tre-vin won-de-red if the ow-ners ke-eping
an o-dog in the back-yard had tro-ub-les with the-ir ne-igh-bo-urs, if the-re was je-alo-usy.
A tod-dler vo-ice sa-id, "If we don't cle-ar $2,600 in Ma-yers-vil-le, we'll ha-ve to sell a truck,
Daddy."
"Don't call me Daddy, ever" He to-ok a long cur-ve si-lently. Two-la-ned high-ways of-ten had no
sho-ul-der, and con-cent-ra-ti-on was re-qu-ired to ke-ep sa-fe. "I didn't know you we-re awa-ke.
Be-si-des, a tho-usand will do it."
Caprice clo-sed her bo-ok. In the dark-ness of the cab, Tre-vin co-uldn't see her eyes, but he knew
that they we-re po-lar-ice blue. She sa-id, "A tho-usand for di-esel, su-re, but we're we-eks be-hind on
pay-roll. The ro-us-ta-bo-uts won't stand for anot-her de-lay, not af-ter what you pro-mi-sed in
Gulf-port. The ex-ten-si-on on the qu-ar-terly ta-xes is past, and I can't ke-ep the feds off li-ke the
ot-her cre-di-tors by pled-ging ext-ra pay-ments for a co-up-le months. We've got fo-od for most of the
ani-mals for ten days or so, but we ha-ve to buy fresh me-at for the ti-ger-zel-le and the cro-co-mo-use
or they'll die. We stay af-lo-at with $2,600, but just ba-rely."
Trevin scow-led. It had be-en ye-ars sin-ce he'd fo-und her lit-tle-girl vo-ice and lit-tle-girl
pro-nun-ci-ati-on to be cu-te, and al-most everyt-hing she sa-id was sar-cas-tic or cri-ti-cal. It was li-ke
li-ving with a pint-si-zed ad-vo-ca-te for his own self-do-ubt. "So we ne-ed a ho-use of…" He wrink-led
his fo-re-he-ad. "$2,600 di-vi-ded by fo-ur and a half bucks”
"Five hund-red and se-venty-eight. That'll le-ave you an ext-ra dol-lar for a cup of cof-fee," Cap-ri-ce
sa-id. "We ha-ven't had a ta-ke that big sin-ce Fer-ri-day last fall, and that was be-ca-use
Ok-to-ber-fest in Natc-hez clo-sed early. Thank God for Lo-u-isi-ana li-qu-or laws! We ought to
ad-mit the show's was-hed up, cut the in-ven-tory lo-ose, sell the ge-ar, and pay off the help."
She tur-ned on the go-ose nec-ked re-ading light that ar-ced from the dash-bo-ard and ope-ned her
bo-ok.
"If we can hold on un-til Ro-se-da-le…" He re-mem-be-red Ro-se-da-le when they last ca-me

thro-ugh, se-ven ye-ars ago. The city had rec-ru-ited him. Sent let-ters and e-ma-ils. They'd met him in
New Or-le-ans with a com-mit-tee, inc-lu-ding a bru-net-te be-a-uty who squ-e-ezed his leg un-der the
tab-le when they went out to din-ner.
"We can't," Cap-ri-ce sa-id.
Trevin re-cal-led the hand on his leg fe-eling go-od and warm. He'd al-most jum-ped from the tab-le,
his fa-ce flus-hed. "The soy-be-an fes-ti-val draws them in. Everyt-hing's ma-de out of soy-be-ans.
Soy-be-an pie. Soy-be-an be-er. Soy-be-an ice cre-am." He chuck-led. "We cle-aned up the-re. I got
to ri-de down Ma-in Stre-et with the Ro-se-da-le Soy-be-an Qu-e-en."
"We're de-ad. Ta-ke yo-ur pul-se." She didn't lo-ok up.
The Ro-se-da-le Soy-be-an Qu-e-en had be-en fri-endly too, and oh so gra-te-ful that he'd bro-ught
the zoo to town. He won-de-red if she still li-ved the-re. He co-uld lo-ok her up. "Ye-ah, if we ma-ke
the soy-be-an fes-ti-val, we'll do fi-ne. One go-od show and we're sa-iling aga-in. I'll re-pa-int the
trucks. Folks lo-ve us when we co-me in-to town, mu-sic pla-ying. World's gre-atest tra-vel-ling
no-velty zoo! You re-mem-ber when News-we-ek did that story? God, that was a day!" He glan-ced
out the win-dow aga-in. The mo-on res-ted on the ho-ri-zon now, pa-cing them, big as a be-ach ball,
li-ke a bur-nis-hed hub-cap rol-ling with them in the night, rol-ling up the Mis-sis-sip-pi twenty mi-les to
the west. He co-uld smell the ri-ver flo-wing to the sea. How co-uld she do-ubt that they wo-uld ma-ke
it big? I'll show her, he tho-ught. Wi-pe that smirk off her lit-tle-girl fa-ce. I'll show her in Ma-yers-vil-le
and then Ro-se-da-le. Mo-ney'll be fal-ling off the tab-les. We'll ha-ve to sto-re it in sacks. She'll see.
Grin-ning, he dug de-ep for anot-her pi-ece of be-ef jerky, and he didn't think at all what it tas-ted li-ke
this ti-me.
Trevin pul-led the truck in-to Ma-yers-vil-le at half past ten, ke-eping his eyes pe-eled for the-ir
pos-ters and flyers. He'd sent a box of them up two we-eks ear-li-er, and if the boy he'd hi-red had
do-ne his job, they sho-uld ha-ve be-en plas-te-red everyw-he-re, but he only saw one, and it was torn
ne-arly in half. The-re we-re se-ve-ral ban-ners wel-co-ming Soft-ball te-ams to the So-uth-Cent-ral
Spring Ti-me Re-gi-onal Soft-ball To-ur-ney, and the ho-tels spor-ted NO VA-CANCY signs, so the
crowds we-re the-re. He tur-ned the mu-sic on, and it bla-red from the lo-uds-pe-akers on top of the
truck. Zoo's in town, he tho-ught. Co-me see the zoo! But ot-her than a co-up-le of ge-ezers sit-ting in
front of the bar-bers-hop, who watc-hed them co-ol-ly as they pas-sed, no one se-emed to no-te the-ir
ar-ri-val.
"They can't play ball all day, eh, Cap-ri-ce. They've got to do so-met-hing in bet-we-en ga-mes."
She grun-ted. Her lap-top was open on the se-at be-si-de her, and she was do-ub-le-ente-ring
re-ce-ipts and bills in-to the led-ger.
The fa-irg-ro-unds we-re on the north ed-ge of town, next to the ball fi-elds. A park at-ten-dant met
them at the ga-tes, then clim-bed on-to the run-ning bo-ard so his he-ad was just be-low the win-dow.
"There's a hund-red dol-lar oc-cu-pancy fee," he sa-id, his fa-ce hid-den be-ne-ath a wi-de-brim-med
straw hat that lo-oked li-ke it had be-en aro-und the world a few ti-mes.
Trevin drum-med his fin-gers on the ste-ering whe-el and sta-yed calm. "We pa-id for the si-te up
front."
The at-ten-dant shrug-ged. "It's a hund-red dol-lars or you find so-me ot-her pla-ce to plant
yo-ur-self."
Caprice, on her kne-es, le-aned ac-ross Tre-vin. She de-epe-ned her vo-ice in her best Tre-vin
im-per-so-na-ti-on. "Do we ma-ke that check out to Ma-yers-vil-le City Parks or to Is-sa-qu-ena
Co-unty?"
Startled, the at-ten-dant lo-oked up be-fo-re Cap-ri-ce co-uld duck out of sight, his sixty-ye-ar-old
fa-ce as dusty as his hat. "Cash. No checks."
"That's what I tho-ught," she sa-id to Tre-vin as she mo-ved back from the win-dow. "Gi-ve him
twenty. The-re bet-ter be the por-tab-le pot-ti-es and the elect-ri-cal ho-ok-ups we or-de-red."
Trevin flic-ked the bill to him, and the at-ten-dant ca-ught it ne-atly in flight as he step-ped off the
run-ning bo-ard. "Hey, mis-ter," he sa-id. "How old's yo-ur lit-tle girl?"
"A mil-li-on and ten, as-sho-le," sa-id Tre-vin, drop-ping the clutch to mo-ve the big rig for-ward.

"I've told you to stay out of sight. We'll get in-to all kinds of tro-ub-le if the lo-cals find out I've got a
mu-tant ke-eping the bo-oks. They ha-ve la-bo-ur laws, you know. Why'd you tell me to gi-ve him any
mo-ney any-way? We co-uld ha-ve bo-ught a day or two of me-at with that."
Caprice sta-yed on her kne-es to lo-ok out her win-dow. "He's re-al-ly a jani-tor. Ne-ver piss off the
jani-tor. Hey, they cle-aned this pla-ce up a bit! The-re was a patch of wo-ods bet-we-en us and the
ri-ver last ti-me."
Trevin le-aned on the whe-el. Tur-ning the truck was to-ugh at anyt-hing less than high-way spe-ed.
"Wo-uld you want tre-es and brush next to whe-re you we-re pla-ying Soft-ball? You cha-se a fo-ul
shot in-to the un-derg-rowth and ne-ver co-me back…"
Beyond the fa-irg-ro-unds, the land slo-ped down to the le-vee, and past that flo-wed the
Mis-sis-sip-pi, less than a hund-red yards away, a gre-at, muddy pla-in mar-ked with li-nes of sul-len
grey fo-am drif-ting un-der the mid-mor-ning sun. A black bar-ge so dis-tant that he co-uldn't he-ar it
chug up-stre-am. Tre-vin no-ted with ap-pro-val the end-less stretch of ten-fo-ot-tall cha-in-link fen-ce
bet-we-en them and the ri-ver. Who knew what god-awful thing might co-me craw-ling out of the-re?
As al-ways, it to-ok most of the day to set up. The big ani-mals, stin-king of hot fur and un-was-hed
ca-ge bot-toms in the-ir eight-fo-ot-high enc-lo-su-res, ca-me out of the se-mi-tra-ilers first. Lo-oking
let-har-gic and sick, the ti-ger-zel-le, a long-leg-ged, ho-ofed ani-mal spor-ting al-most no neck be-low
an imp-res-si-ve fa-ce fil-led with sa-ber li-ke te-eth, ba-rely lo-oked up as its ca-ge was lo-we-red to
the soggy gro-und. It ho-oted softly. Tre-vin chec-ked its wa-ter. "Get a tarp over it right away," he sa-id
to handy-man Har-per, a big, gro-uchy man who wo-re old rock con-cert T-shirts in-si-de out. Tre-vin
ad-ded, "That tra-iler had to be a hund-red and twenty deg-re-es in-si-de." Lo-oking at the ani-mal
fondly, Tre-vin re-mem-be-red when he'd ac-qu-ired it from a farm in Il-li-no-is, one of the first
Ame-ri-can mu-ta-ba-bi-es, be-fo-re the mu-ta-gen was re-cog-ni-zed and na-med, be-fo-re it
be-ca-me a pla-gue. The ti-ger-zel-le's sis-ter was al-most as bi-zar-re: he-avy legs, scaly skin, and a
long, thin he-ad, li-ke a whip-pet, but the far-mer had al-re-ady kil-led it by the ti-me Tre-vin ar-ri-ved.
The-ir mot-her, as or-di-nary a cow as you'd ever see, lo-oked at its child-ren with dull con-fu-si-on.
"What the hell’s wrong with my cow?" as-ked the far-mer se-ve-ral ti-mes, un-til they star-ted
dic-ke-ring for the pri-ce. On-ce Tre-vin had pa-id him, the man sa-id, "If I get any ot-her
we-ird-lo-okin' ani-mal, you want I sho-uld gi-ve you a call?"
Trevin smel-led pro-fit. Char-ging twenty dol-lars per cus-to-mer, he cle-ared ten tho-usand a we-ek
in June and July, sho-wing the ti-ger-zel-le from the back of his pic-kup. He tho-ught, I may not be too
smart, but I do know how to ma-ke a buck. By the end of the sum-mer, Dr. Tre-vin's Tra-ve-ling
Zo-olo-gi-cal Ext-ra-va-gan-za was born. That was the ye-ar Cap-ri-ce ro-de be-si-de him in a child's
car se-at, her mom-ma de-ad in child-birth. In August, they we-re go-ing north from Se-ne-to-bia to
Memp-his, and, at ele-ven months old, Cap-ri-ce sa-id her first words: "Isn't eighty over the spe-ed
li-mit?" Even then, the-re was a bi-ting, sar-do-nic to-ne to her vo-ice. Tre-vin ne-arly wrec-ked the
truck.
The cro-co-mo-use snar-led and bit at the bars as it ca-me out, its furry sno-ut ban-ging aga-inst the
me-tal. It threw its two hund-red po-unds aga-inst the do-or and al-most tip-ped the ca-ge out of the
hand-lers' grip. "Ke-ep yo-ur hands away," snap-ped Har-per to his crew, "or you'll be ta-ping a pen-cil
to a stub to wri-te yo-ur mom-mas!"
Then the rest of the ani-mals we-re un-lo-aded: a por-cu-man-der, the war-ped child of a bul-lfrog
that wa-ved its wet, thorny hi-de at every sha-dow; the uni-go-ose, abo-ut the si-ze of a wild tur-key
atop fo-ur tiny legs, shed-ding rag-ged fe-at-hers by the hand-ful be-low the pe-arl li-ke glin-ting horn,
and each of the ot-her mu-ta-ba-bi-es, the un-re-cog-ni-zab-le pro-geny of cats and squ-ir-rels and
hor-ses and mon-keys and se-als and every ot-her ani-mal Tre-vin co-uld gat-her to the zoo. Big ca-ges,
lit-tle ones, aqu-ari-ums, ter-ra-ri-ums, lit-tle cor-rals, bird ca-ges, tet-he-ring po-les-all ca-me out for
disp-lay.
By sun-set, the last ani-mal had be-en ar-ran-ged and fed. Cir-cus flags flut-te-red from the
se-mi-tra-iler truck tops. The lo-uds-pe-akers perc-hed atop the-ir posts.
The park at-ten-dant wan-de-red thro-ugh the ca-ges, his hands pus-hed de-ep in-to his poc-kets, as

ca-su-al and fri-endly as if he hadn't tri-ed to rip them off ear-li-er in the day. "Y'all best stay in yo-ur
trucks on-ce the sun sets if you're cam-ping he-re."
Suspicious, Tre-vin as-ked, "Why's that?"
The man ra-ised his chin to-ward the ri-ver, which was glo-wing red li-ke a blo-ody sta-in in the
set-ting sun. "Wa-ter le-vel was up a co-up-le days ago, over the fen-ces. The le-vee held, but any
sor-ta te-ethy mu-to-id might be flop-pin' aro-und on our si-de now. It's got so you can't step in a
pud-dle wit-ho-ut so-met-hin' ta-kin' a bi-te out-ta ya! Ci-vil De-fen-ce vo-lun-te-ers walk the banks
every day, lo-okin' for the mo-re can-tan-ke-ro-us crit-ters, but it's a big old ri-ver. You got a gun?"
Trevin shrug-ged. "Ba-se-ball bat. May-be we'll get lucky and add so-met-hing to the zoo. You
ex-pec-ting crowds for the soft-ball to-ur-na-ment?"
"Thirty-two te-ams. We ship-ped in ext-ra ble-ac-hers."
Trevin nod-ded. If he star-ted the mu-sic early in the mor-ning, may-be he'd at-tract folks wa-iting for
ga-mes. Not-hing li-ke a lit-tle amu-se-ment be-fo-re the he-at set in. Af-ter a co-up-le of mi-nu-tes, the
park at-ten-dant left. Tre-vin was glad to see him walk away. He had the dis-tinct imp-res-si-on that the
man was lo-oking for so-met-hing to ste-al.
After din-ner, Cap-ri-ce clam-be-red in-to the up-per bunk, her short legs ba-rely gi-ving her eno-ugh
of a re-ach to ma-ke it. Tre-vin kic-ked his blan-ket asi-de. Even tho-ugh it was af-ter ten, it was still
over ni-nety deg-re-es, and the-re wasn't a hint of a bre-eze. Most of the ani-mals had set-tled in the-ir
ca-ges. Only the ti-ger-zel-le ma-de no-ise, one long warb-ling ho-ot af-ter anot-her, a soft, me-lo-dic
call that hardly fit its fe-ro-ci-o-us ap-pe-aran-ce.
"You lay low to-mor-row. I'm not kid-ding," sa-id Tre-vin af-ter he'd tur-ned off the light. "I don't
want you dri-ving pe-op-le off."
Caprice snif-fed lo-udly. "It's pretty iro-nic that I can't show myself at a mu-to-id zoo. I'm ti-red of
hi-ding away li-ke a fre-ak. Anot-her fifty ye-ars and the-re won't be any of yo-ur kind left any-way.
Might as well ac-cept the ine-vi-tab-le. I'm the fu-tu-re. They sho-uld be ab-le to de-al with that."
Trevin put his hands be-hind his he-ad and sta-red up at her bunk. Thro-ugh the scre-en he'd fit-ted
over the win-dows, he co-uld he-ar the Mis-sis-sip-pi lap-ping aga-inst the bank. An ani-mal
scre-ec-hed in the dis-tan-ce, its call a cross bet-we-en a whist-le and a bad co-ugh. He tri-ed to
ima-gi-ne what wo-uld ma-ke a so-und li-ke that. Fi-nal-ly he sa-id, "Pe-op-le don't li-ke hu-man
mu-to-ids, at le-ast ones that lo-ok hu-man."
"Why's that?" she as-ked, all the sar-casm and bit-ter-ness sud-denly go-ne. "I'm not a bad per-son, if
they'd get to know me. We co-uld dis-cuss bo-oks, or phi-lo-sophy. I'm a mind, not just a body."
The ani-mal cri-ed out aga-in in the dark, over and over, un-til in mid-scre-ech, it stop-ped. A he-avy
thras-hing so-und fol-lo-wed by splas-hes mar-ked the cre-atu-re's end. "I gu-ess it ma-kes them sad,
Cap-ri-ce."
"Do I ma-ke you sad?" In the truck cab's dim in-te-ri-or, she so-un-ded exactly li-ke a two-ye-ar-old.
He re-mem-be-red when she was a lit-tle girl, be-fo-re he knew that she wasn't nor-mal, that she'd
ne-ver "grow up," that her DNA sho-wed that she wasn't hu-man. Be-fo-re she star-ted tal-king up-pity
and ma-king him fe-el stu-pid with her baby-doll eyes. Be-fo-re he'd for-bid-den her to call him Dad.
He'd tho-ught she lo-oked a lit-tle li-ke her mot-her then. He still ca-ught ec-ho-es of her when
Cap-ri-ce com-bed her ha-ir, or when she fell as-le-ep and her lips par-ted to ta-ke a bre-ath, just li-ke
her mot-her. The air ca-ught in his thro-at thin-king of tho-se ti-mes.
"No, Cap-ri-ce. You don't ma-ke me sad."
Hours la-ter, long af-ter Cap-ri-ce had go-ne to sle-ep, Tre-vin drif-ted off in-to a se-ri-es of dre-ams
whe-re he was be-ing smot-he-red by ste-aming Tur-kish to-wels, and when he threw the to-wels off,
his cre-di-tors sur-ro-un-ded him. They car-ri-ed pay-ment-over-due no-ti-ces, and no-ne of them
we-re hu-man.
Trevin was up be-fo-re dawn to fe-ed the ani-mals. Half the trick of ke-eping the zoo run-ning was in
fi-gu-ring out what the cre-atu-res ate. Just be-ca-use the pa-rent had be-en, say, an o-form hor-se
didn't me-an hay was go-ing to do the trick. Cap-ri-ce kept ex-ten-si-ve charts for him: the ani-mal's
we-ight, how much fo-od it con-su-med, what vi-ta-min sup-ple-ments se-emed most help-ful. The-re

we-re prac-ti-ca-li-ti-es to run-ning a zoo. He dum-ped a buc-ket of corn on the cob in-to the
pi-ga-hump's ca-ge. It snor-ted, then lum-be-red out of the dog-ho-use it sta-yed in, not lo-oking much
li-ke a pig, or any ot-her ani-mal Tre-vin knew. Eyes li-ke sa-ucers, it ga-zed at him gra-te-ful-ly
be-fo-re bur-ying its fa-ce in the tro-ugh.
He mo-ved down the rows. Me-al-worms in one ca-ge. Gra-in in the next. Bo-nes from the butc-her.
Dog fo-od. Spo-iled fish. Bre-ad. Ce-re-al. Old ve-ge-tab-les. Oats. The ti-ger-zel-le tas-ted the rump
ro-ast he tos-sed in, its de-li-ca-te ton-gue, so li-ke a cat's, lap-ping at the me-at be-fo-re it to-re a small
chunk off to chew de-li-ca-tely. It co-o-ed in con-tent-ment.
At the end of the row, clo-sest to the ri-ver, two ca-ges we-re knoc-ked off the-ir disp-lay stands and
smas-hed. Black blo-od and bits of me-at clung to the twis-ted bars, and both ani-mals the ca-ges had
con-ta-ined, blind, le-at-hery bird-li-ke cre-atu-res, we-re go-ne. Tre-vin sig-hed and wal-ked aro-und
the ca-ges, ins-pec-ting the gro-und. In a muddy patch, a sing-le web-bed print a fo-ot ac-ross, mar-ked
with fo-ur de-ep claw in-dents, sho-wed the culp-rit. A co-up-le of par-ti-al prints led up from the ri-ver.
Tre-vin put his fin-ger in the track, which was a half-inch de-ep. The gro-und was wet but firm. It to-ok a
hard press to push just his fin-ger-tip a half-inch. He won-de-red at the we-ight of the cre-atu-re, and
ma-de a no-te to him-self that to-night they'd ha-ve to sto-re the smal-ler ca-ges in the truck, which
wo-uld me-an mo-re work. He sig-hed aga-in.
By eight, the soft-ball fi-elds ac-ross the park had fil-led. Pla-yers war-med up out-si-de the fen-ces,
whi-le ga-mes to-ok pla-ce. Tents to ho-use te-ams or for fo-od bo-oths sprang up. Tre-vin smi-led and
tur-ned on the mu-sic. Ban-ners hung from the trucks. DR. TRE-VIN'S TRA-VE-LING

Leaving Hardy in char-ge of tic-kets, Tre-vin lo-aded a box with hand-bil-ls, hung a stap-le gun to his
belt, then marc-hed to the ball fi-elds, han-ding out flyers. The sun be-at down li-ke a hu-mid fur-na-ce,
and only the pla-yers in the fi-eld we-ren't un-der tents or umb-rel-las. Se-ve-ral folks of-fe-red him a
be-er-he to-ok one-but his flyers, wrinkly with hu-mi-dity, va-nis-hed un-der cha-irs or be-hind co-olers.
"We're do-ing a first day of the to-ur-na-ment spe-ci-al," he sa-id. "Two bucks each, or three for you
and a fri-end." His shirt clung to his back. "We'll be open af-ter sun-set, when it's co-oler. The-se are
disp-lays not to be mis-sed, folks!"
A wo-man in her twen-ti-es, her che-eks sun-red-de-ned, her blon-de ha-ir ti-ed back, sa-id, "I don't
ne-ed to pay to see a re-min-der, damn it!" She crump-led the pa-per and drop-ped it. One of her
te-am-ma-tes, sit-ting on the gro-und, a be-er bet-we-en his kne-es, sa-id, "Gi-ve him a bre-ak, Do-ris.
He's just trying to ma-ke a li-ving."
Trevin sa-id, "We we-re in News-we-ek. You might ha-ve re-ad abo-ut us."
"Maybe we'll co-me over la-ter, fel-la," sa-id the pla-yer on the gro-und.
Doris pop-ped a can open. "It might snow this af-ter-no-on, too."
"Maybe it will," sa-id Tre-vin con-ge-ni-al-ly. He he-aded to-ward town, on the ot-her si-de of the
fa-irg-ro-unds. The sun pres-su-red his scalp with prickly fi-re. By the ti-me he'd go-ne a hund-red
yards, he wis-hed he'd worn a hat, but it was too hot to go back.
He stap-led a flyer to the first te-lep-ho-ne po-le he ca-me to. "Yep," he sa-id to him-self. "A lit-tle
pub-li-city and we'll ra-ke it in!"The si-de-walk shim-me-red in whi-te he-at wa-ves a co-up-le of
mi-nu-tes, the park at-ten-dant left. Tre-vin was glad to see him walk away. He had the dis-tinct

every sto-re and as-ked the ow-ner to post his sign. Most did. Be-hind Ma-in Stre-et sto-od se-ve-ral
blocks of ho-mes. Tre-vin tur-ned up one stre-et and down the next, stap-ling flyers, no-ting with
ap-pro-val the wi-re mesh over the win-dows. "Can t be too ca-re-ful, no-wa-days," he sa-id, his he-ad
swim-ming in the he-at. The be-er se-emed to be eva-po-ra-ting thro-ugh his skin all at on-ce, and he felt
sticky with it. The sun pul-sed aga-inst his back. The ma-gic num-ber is fi-ve-se-venty-eight, he tho-ught.
It be-at wit-hin him li-ke a song. Call it six hund-red. Six hund-red folks, co-me to the zoo, co-me to the
zoo, co-me to the zoo!
When he fi-nal-ly ma-de his way back to the fa-irg-ro-unds, the sun was on its way down. Tre-vin
drag-ged his fe-et, but the flyers we-re go-ne.
Evening fell. Tre-vin wa-ited at the tic-ket co-un-ter in his zoo-mas-ter's uni-form, a
bro-ad-sho-ul-de-red red su-it with gold epa-ulets. The chan-ge box pop-ped open with jingly joy; the
roll of tic-kets was re-ady. Cir-cus mu-sic pla-yed softly from the lo-uds-pe-akers as fi-ref-li-es
flic-ke-red in the dark-ness abo-ve the ri-ver. Funny, he tho-ught, how the mu-ta-gen af-fec-ted only the
big-ger ver-teb-ra-te ani-mals, not mi-ce-si-zed mam-mals or lit-tle li-zards, not small fish or bugs or
plants. What wo-uld a bug mu-ta-te in-to any-way? They lo-ok ali-en to be-gin with. He chuck-led to
him-self, his wal-king-up-the-si-de-walk song still ec-ho-ing: six hund-red folks, co-me to the zoo,
co-me to the zoo, co-me to the zoo.
Every car that pas-sed on the high-way, Tre-vin watc-hed, wa-iting for it to slow for the turn in-to the
fa-irg-ro-unds.
From sun-set un-til mid-night, only twenty cus-to-mers bo-ught ad-mis-si-ons; most of them we-re
ball pla-yers who'd dis-co-ve-red that the-re wasn't much night-li-fe in Ma-yers-vil-le. Clo-uds had
mo-ved in, and dis-tant light-ning flic-ke-red wit-hin the-ir ste-el wo-ol depths.
Trevin spun the roll of tic-kets back and forth on its spo-ol. An old far-mer co-up-le we-aring
ove-ral-ls, the-ir clot-hes sta-ined with rich, Mis-sis-sip-pi so-il, shuf-fled past on the-ir way out. "You
got so-me stran-ge ani-mals he-re, mis-ter," sa-id the old man. His wi-fe nod-ded. "But not-hing
stran-ger than what I've fo-und wan-de-ring in my fi-elds for the last few ye-ars. Get-tin' so I don't
re-mem-ber what o-form nor-mal lo-oks li-ke."
"Too clo-se to the ri-ver," sa-id his wi-fe. "That's our pla-ce right over the-re." She po-in-ted at a
small farm ho-use un-der a lo-ne light, just be-yond the last ball fi-eld. Tre-vin won-de-red if they ever
ret-ri-eved ho-me-run balls off the-ir porch.
The thin pi-le of bills in the cash box rust-led un-der Tre-vin's fin-gers. The mo-ney sho-uld be fal-ling

off the tab-les, he tho-ught. We sho-uld be drow-ning in it. The old co-up-le sto-od be-si-de him,
lo-oking back in-to the zoo. They re-min-ded him of his pa-rents, not in the-ir ap-pe-aran-ce, but in
the-ir so-lid pa-ti-en-ce. They we-ren't go-ing anyw-he-re fast.
He had no re-ason to talk to them, but the-re was not-hing el-se left to do. "I was he-re a few ye-ars
ago. Did re-al-ly well. What's hap-pe-ned?"
The wi-fe held her hus-band's hand. She sa-id, "This town's dyin', mis-ter. Dyin' from the bot-tom up.
They clo-sed the ele-men-tary scho-ol last fall. No ele-men-tary-age kids. If you want to see a re-al zoo
disp-lay, go down to Is-sa-qu-ena Co-unty Hos-pi-tal pe-di-at-rics. The pe-nalty of pa-rent-ho-od. Not
that many folks are ha-ving ba-bi-es, tho-ugh."
"Or wha-te-ver you want to call them," ad-ded the old man. "Yo-ur zoo's dep-res-sin.
"I'd he-ard you had so-met-hin' spe-ci-al, tho-ugh," sa-id the wo-man shyly. "Did you see the
cro-co-mo-use?" as-ked Tre-vin. "The-re's qu-ite a story abo-ut that one. And the ti-ger-zel-le. Ha-ve
you se-en that one?" "Saw 'em," she sa-id, lo-oking di-sap-po-in-ted.
The old co-up-le clim-bed in-to the-ir pic-kup, and it rat-tled in-to li-fe af-ter a half-do-zen
star-ter-grin-ding tri-es.
"I fo-und a bu-yer in Vicks-burg for the truck," sa-id Cap-ri-ce.
Trevin whir-led. She sto-od in the sha-dows be-si-de the tic-ket co-un-ter, a no-te-bo-ok jam-med
un-der her arm. "I told you to stay out of vi-ew."
"Who's go-ing to see me? You can't get cus-to-mers even on a dis-co-unt!" She ga-zed at the va-cant
lot. "We don't ha-ve to de-li-ver it. He's co-ming to town next we-ek on ot-her bu-si-ness. I can do the
who-le tran-sac-ti-on, trans-fer the de-ed, ta-ke the mo-ney, all of it, over the In-ter-net."
One ta-il-light out, the far-mer's pic-kup tur-ned from the fa-irg-ro-unds and on-to the dirt ro-ad that
led to the-ir ho-use, which wasn't mo-re than two hund-red yards away. "What wo-uld we do with the
ani-mals?" He felt li-ke we-eping.
"Let the sa-fe ones go. Kill the dan-ge-ro-us ones."
Trevin rub-bed his eyes. She stam-ped her fo-ot. "Lo-ok, this is no ti-me for sen-ti-men-ta-lity! The
zoo's a bust. You're go-ing to lo-se the who-le thing so-on any-way. If you're too stub-born to gi-ve it all
up, sell this truck now and you get a few ext-ra we-eks, may-be a who-le se-ason if we eco-no-mi-ze."
Trevin lo-oked away from her. The fi-ref-li-es still flic-ke-red abo-ve the ri-ver. "I'll ha-ve to ma-ke
so-me de-ci-si-ons," he sa-id he-avily.
She held out the no-te-bo-ok. "I've al-re-ady ma-de them. This is what will fit in one se-mi-tra-iler. I
al-re-ady let Hardy and the ro-us-ta-bo-uts go with a se-ve-ran-ce check, post-da-ted."
"What abo-ut the ge-ar, ca-ges?"
"The co-unty dump is north of he-re."
Was that a no-te of tri-umph he de-tec-ted in her vo-ice? Tre-vin to-ok the no-te-bo-ok. She
drop-ped her hands to her si-de, chin up, sta-ring at him. The zoo's lights cast long sha-dows ac-ross her
fa-ce. I co-uld kick her, he tho-ught, and for a se-cond his leg tremb-led with the idea of it.
He tuc-ked the no-te-bo-ok un-der his arm. "Go to bed."
Caprice ope-ned her mo-uth, then clam-ped it shut on wha-te-ver she might ha-ve sa-id. She tur-ned
away.
Long af-ter she'd va-nis-hed in-to the cab, Tre-vin sat on the sto-ol, el-bow on his knee, chin in his
hand, watc-hing in-sects circ-le the lights. The ti-ger-zel-le squ-at-ted on its ha-unc-hes, alert, lo-oking
to-ward the ri-ver. Tre-vin re-mem-be-red a ghastly car-to-on he'd se-en on-ce. A co-up-le of cro-nes
sat on the se-at of a wa-gon full of bo-di-es. The one hol-ding the re-ins tur-ned to the ot-her and sa-id,
"You know, on-ce the pla-gue is over, we're out of a job."
The ti-ger-zel-le ro-se to its fe-et, fo-cu-sing on the ri-ver. It pa-ced in-tently in its ca-ge, ne-ver
tur-ning its he-ad from the dark-ness. Tre-vin stra-igh-te-ned. What did it see out the-re? For a long
mo-ment, the tab-le-au re-ma-ined the sa-me: in-sects swir-led aro-und the lights, which buz-zed softly,
high-ligh-ting the ca-ges; shi-ning me-tal aga-inst the en-ve-lo-ping spring night, the pa-cing ti-ger-zel-le,
the tic-ket co-un-ter's po-lis-hed wo-od aga-inst Tre-vin's hand, and the Mis-sis-sip-pi's pun-gent
mur-mu-ring in the backg-ro-und.

Beyond the ca-ges, from the ri-ver, a pi-ece of black-ness de-tac-hed it-self from the night. Tre-vin
blin-ked in fas-ci-na-ted pa-raly-sis, all the ha-irs dan-cing on the back of his neck. The short-armed
cre-atu-re sto-od tal-ler than a man, sur-ve-yed the zoo, then drop-ped to all fo-urs li-ke a be-ar,
ex-cept that its skin gle-amed with sa-la-man-der wet-ness. Its tri-an-gu-lar he-ad snif-fed at the
gro-und, mo-ving over the mo-ist dirt as if fol-lo-wing a scent. When it re-ac-hed the first ca-ge, a small
one that held the we-asels-na-ke, the ri-ver cre-atu-re lif-ted its fo-re-legs off the gro-und, gras-ping the
ca-ge in web-fin-ge-red claws. In an ins-tant, the ca-ge was un-re-cog-ni-zab-le, and the
we-asels-na-ke was go-ne.
"Hey!" Tre-vin yel-led, sha-king off his stu-por. The cre-atu-re lo-oked at him. Re-ac-hing un-der the
tic-ket co-un-ter, Tre-vin grab-bed the ba-se-ball bat and ad-van-ced. The mons-ter tur-ned away to
pick up the next ca-ge. Tre-vin's fa-ce flus-hed. "No, no, no, damn it!" He step-ped for-ward aga-in,
step-ped aga-in, and sud-denly he was run-ning, bat held over-he-ad. "Get away! Get away!" He
bro-ught the bat down on the ani-mal's sho-ul-der with a me-aty whump.
It shri-eked.
Trevin fell back, drop-ping the bat to co-ver his ears. It shri-eked aga-in, lo-ud as a tra-in whist-le.
For a do-zen he-art-be-ats, it sto-od abo-ve him, claws ex-ten-ded, then it se-emed to lo-se in-te-rest
and mo-ved to the next ca-ge, dis-mant-ling it with one jerk on the bars.
His ears rin-ging, Tre-vin snatc-hed the bat off the gro-und and wa-ded in, swin-ging. On its re-ar
legs, the mons-ter ba-red its te-eth, do-zens of glin-ting ne-ed-les in the tri-an-gu-lar jaw. Tre-vin na-iled
the cre-atu-re in the si-de. It fol-ded with surp-ri-sing fle-xi-bi-lity, bac-king away, claws dis-ten-ded,
snar-ling in a de-afe-ning ro-ar. Tre-vin swung. Mis-sed. The mons-ter swi-ped at his leg, rip-ping his
pants and al-most jer-king his fe-et out from un-der him.
The thing mo-ved clum-sily, bac-king down the hill to-ward the le-vee fen-ce as Tre-vin swung aga-in.
Mis-sed. It how-led, tri-ed to circ-le aro-und him. Tre-vin scut-tled si-de-ways, ca-re-ful of his
ba-lan-ce on the slick dirt. If he sho-uld fall! The thing char-ged, mo-uth open, but pul-led back li-ke a
thre-ate-ned dog when Tre-vin ra-ised the bat. He bre-at-hed in short gasps, po-ked the bat's end at it,
al-ways shep-her-ding it away from the zoo. Be-hind him, a po-li-ce si-ren so-un-ded, and car en-gi-nes
ro-ared, but he didn't da-re lo-ok aro-und. He co-uld only stalk and ke-ep his bat at the re-ady.
After a long se-ri-es of fe-ints, its back to the fen-ce, the night-ma-re stop-ped, hunc-hed its back,
and be-gan to ri-se just as Tre-vin bro-ught the bat down in a two-han-ded, over-the-he-ad chop.
Thro-ugh the bat, he felt the skull crunch, and the cre-atu-re drop-ped in-to a shud-dery mass in the
mud. Tre-vin, his pul-se po-un-ding, swa-yed for a mo-ment, then sat be-si-de the be-ast.
Up the hill, un-der the zoo's lights, pe-op-le sho-uted in-to the dark-ness. We-re they ball pla-yers?
Town pe-op-le? A po-li-ce cru-iser's lights blin-ked blue then red, and three or fo-ur cars, he-ad-lights
on, we-re par-ked ne-ar the trucks. Ob-vi-o-usly they co-uldn't see him, but he was too ti-red to call.
Ig-no-ring the wet gro-und, he lay back.
The de-ad cre-atu-re smel-led of blo-od and ri-ver mud. Tre-vin res-ted a fo-ot on it, al-most sorry
that it was de-ad. If he co-uld ha-ve cap-tu-red it, what an ad-di-ti-on it wo-uld ha-ve ma-de to the zoo!
Gra-du-al-ly, the he-avy be-at in his chest cal-med. The mud felt soft and warm. Over-he-ad, the
clo-uds thin-ned a bit, scud-ding ac-ross the full mo-on.
At the zoo, the-re was tal-king. Tre-vin cra-ned his he-ad aro-und to see. Pe-op-le jost-led abo-ut,
and flash-lights cut thro-ugh the air. They star-ted down the hill. Tre-vin sig-hed. He hadn't sa-ved the
zoo, not re-al-ly. To-mor-row wo-uld co-me and they'd le-ave one of the trucks be-hind. In a co-up-le
of months, it wo-uld all be go-ne, the ot-her truck, the ani-mals-he was most sorry abo-ut the
ti-ger-zel-le-the pul-ling in-to town with mu-sic bla-ring and flags flap-ping and pe-op-le li-ned up to see
the me-na-ge-rie. No mo-re re-ason to we-ar the zoo-mas-ter's uni-form with its be-a-uti-ful gold
epa-ulets. News-we-ek wo-uld ne-ver in-ter-vi-ew him aga-in. It was all go-ne. If he co-uld only sink
in-to the mud and di-sap-pe-ar, then he wo-uldn't ha-ve to watch the dis-sol-ving of his own li-fe.
He sat up so that they wo-uldn't think he was de-ad; wa-ved a hand when the first flash-light fo-und
him. Mud drip-ped from his jac-ket. The po-li-ce-men ar-ri-ved first.
"God al-mighty, that's a big one!" The cop tra-ined his light on the ri-ver cre-atu-re.

"Told you the fen-ces warn't no go-od," sa-id the ot-her.
Everyone sta-yed back ex-cept the po-li-ce. The first cop tur-ned the corp-se over. La-ying on its
back, its lit-tle arms flop-ped to the si-de, it didn't lo-ok ne-arly as big or in-ti-mi-da-ting. Mo-re folk
ar-ri-ved: so-me tow-ni-es he didn't re-cog-ni-ze, the old co-up-le from the farm-ho-use ac-ross the ball
fi-elds, and fi-nal-ly, Cap-ri-ce, the flash-light lo-oking al-most too big for her to carry.
The first cop knelt next to the cre-atu-re, sho-ved his hat up off his fo-re-he-ad, then sa-id low
eno-ugh that Tre-vin gu-es-sed that only the ot-her cop co-uld he-ar him, "Hey, do-esn't this lo-ok li-ke
the An-der-sons' kid? They sa-id they'd smot-he-red him."
"He wasn't half that big, but I think you're right." The ot-her cop threw a co-at over the cre-atu-re's
fa-ce, then sto-od for a long ti-me lo-oking down at it. "Don't say anyt-hing to them, all right? Mag-gie
An-der-son is my wi-fe's co-usin."
"Nothing he-re to see, pe-op-le," an-no-un-ced the first cop in a much lo-uder vo-ice. "This is a de-ad
'un. Y'all can he-ad back ho-me."
But the crowd's at-ten-ti-on wasn't on them any-mo-re. The flash-lights tur-ned on Cap-ri-ce.
"It's a baby girl!" so-me-one sa-id, and they mo-ved clo-ser.
Caprice shi-ned her flash-light from one fa-ce to the ot-her. Then, des-pe-ra-ti-on on her fa-ce, she
ran clum-sily to Tre-vin, bur-ying her fa-ce in his chest. "What are we go-ing to do?" she whis-pe-red.
"Quiet. Play along." Tre-vin stro-ked the back of her he-ad, then sto-od. A sharp twin-ge in his leg
told him he'd pul-led so-met-hing. The world was all bright lights, and he co-uldn't co-ver his eyes. He
squ-in-ted aga-inst them.
"Is that yo-ur girl, mis-ter?" so-me-one sa-id.
Trevin grip-ped her clo-ser. Her lit-tle hands fis-ted in his co-at.
"I ha-ven't se-en a child in ten ye-ars," sa-id anot-her vo-ice. The flash-lights mo-ved in clo-ser.
The old far-mer wo-man step-ped in-to the circ-le, her fa-ce sud-denly il-lu-mi-na-ted. "Can I hold
yo-ur lit-tle girl, son? Can I just hold her?" She ex-ten-ded her arms, her hands qu-ive-ring.
"I'll gi-ve you fifty bucks if you let me hold her," sa-id a vo-ice be-hind the lights.
Trevin tur-ned slowly, lights all aro-und, un-til he fa-ced the old wo-man aga-in. A pic-tu-re for-med
in his mind, dim at first but gro-wing cle-arer by the se-cond. One se-mi-tra-iler truck, the tra-iler set up
li-ke a child's ro-om-no, li-ke a nur-sery! Win-nie-the-Po-oh wal-lpa-per. A crib. One of tho-se
mu-si-cal ro-ta-ting things, what cha' call urns-a mo-bi-le! A lit-tle roc-king cha-ir. Kid's mu-sic. And
they'd go from town to town. The ban-ner wo-uld say THE LAST O-FORM GIRL CHILD, and he
wo-uld char-ge them, yes he wo-uld, and they wo-uld li-ne up. The mo-ney wo-uld fall off the tab-le!
Trevin pus-hed Cap-ri-ce away from him, her hands clin-ging to his co-at. "It's okay, dar-ling. The
ni-ce wo-man just wants to hold you for a bit. I'll be right he-re."
Caprice lo-oked at him, des-pa-ir cle-ar in her fa-ce. Co-uld she al-re-ady see the truck with the
nur-sery? Co-uld she pic-tu-re the ban-ner and the unen-ding pro-ces-si-on of lit-tle towns?
The old wo-man to-ok Cap-ri-ce in her arms li-ke a pre-ci-o-us va-se. "That's all right, lit-tle girl.
That's all right." She fa-ced Tre-vin, te-ars on her che-eks. "She's just li-ke the grand-da-ugh-ter I
al-ways wan-ted! Do-es she talk yet? I ha-ven’t he-ard a baby's vo-ice in fo-re-ver. Do-es she talk?"
"Go ahe-ad, Cap-ri-ce de-ar. Say so-met-hing to the ni-ce lady."
Caprice loc-ked eyes with him. Even by flash-light, he co-uld see the po-lar blue. He co-uld he-ar her
sar-do-nic vo-ice night af-ter night as they dro-ve ac-ross co-untry. "It's not fi-nan-ci-al-ly fe-asib-le to
con-ti-nue," she'd say in her two-ye-ar-old vo-ice. "We sho-uld ad-mit the ine-vi-tab-le."
She lo-oked at him, lip tremb-ling. She bro-ught her fist up to her fa-ce. No one mo-ved. Tre-vin
co-uldn't even he-ar them bre-at-hing.
Caprice put her thumb in her mo-uth. "Daddy," she sa-id aro-und it. "Sca-red, Daddy!"
Trevin flinc-hed, then for-ced a smi-le. "That's a go-od girl." "Daddy, sca-red"
Up the hill, the ti-ger-zel-le ho-oted, and, just be-yond the fen-ce, ba-rely vi-sib-le by flash-light, the
Mis-sis-sip-pi gurg-led and wept.

XI - RICHARD KADREY - STILL LIFE WITH APOCALYPSE
They're drag-ging anot-her hor-se from the ca-nal, its chest-nut co-at she-ened bub-ble-gum-pink
from the fre-on. Each night, mo-re po-ols bub-ble to the sur-fa-ce from de-ep un-derg-ro-und. Fre-on.
Old en-gi-ne oil. He-avy wa-ter from for-got-ten nu-kes. Every day, a few do-zen mo-re hungry
ani-mals drown in the stag-nant po-ols.
Loose-limbed in de-ath, the hor-se sways, rag li-ke, as the lit-tle di-esel cra-ne pulls it no-isily from
the muck and sets in on the pi-er with the ot-her bo-di-es. In the blue-tin-ted work lights, we di-vi-de the
de-ad in-to Hu-man and Ani-mal, sub-di-vi-de the Ani-mals in-to Mam-mals and Ot-her, then
sub-di-vi-de the Ot-hers in-to Ver-teb-ra-tes and In-ver-teb-ra-tes, and so on.
I star-ted out on In-for-ma-ti-on Ret-ri-eval, lo-oking for do-cu-ments in sub-mer-ged go-vern-ment
of-fi-ces, old lib-ra-ri-es and bo-oks-to-res. On-ce, I ca-me up in a po-li-ce re-cords va-ult,
sur-ro-un-ded by mug shots and pho-tos of mur-der sce-nes and ra-pes. I ca-me up in an IKS of-fi-ce
whe-re a dis-sa-tis-fi-ed ci-ti-zen had gut-ted an audi-tor, then pla-ced the bu-re-a-uc-rat s vis-ce-ra on
a pho-to-co-pi-er. I swam thro-ugh hund-reds of gra-iny dup-li-ca-tes of his li-ver and in-tes-ti-nes. I
ca-me up in adult bo-oks-hops and bro-ught back wa-ter-log-ged sex toys and old is-su-es of Wet &
Messy Fun. Bring back anyt-hing use-ful, HO why not? Everyt-hing I bro-ught back went in-to one big
pi-le to be ano-in-ted by In-for-ma-ti-on.
I wish the-re had Iron a war, a pla-gue or No-me new, grand Cher-nobyl. So-met-hing we co-uld
po-int to and say, "That's it. That's what kil-led the world." But it wasn't li-ke that.
It star-ted in New York. Or Lon-don. Mum-bai, pos-sibly. A mi-nor traf-fic ac-ci-dent-just a fen-der
ben-der-and so-me-one mis-sed a me-eting, which me-ant so-me-one el-se co-uldn't send a fax, which
ma-de so-me-one el-se miss a pla-ne. That so-me-one got in-to an ar-gu-ment with the cab-bie and was
shot. No one knows by whom. Wha-te-ver hap-pe-ned, the sho-oting spar-ked a ri-ot. TV ca-me-ras
bro-ad-cast the ri-ot li-ve to a co-untry so knot-ted with fury and ten-si-on that ri-ots bro-ke out from
Ma-ine to Ha-wa-ii. When the fo-ota-ge hit the sa-tel-li-tes, ri-ots spon-ta-ne-o-usly exp-lo-ded
aro-und the world.
In the He-lins-ki-Van-taa air-port, a gro-up of bag-ga-ge hand-lers and stri-king sex wor-kers
pus-hed ven-ding mac-hi-nes from third flo-or win-dows in-to the par-king lot, kil-ling a vi-si-ting
Spa-nish dip-lo-mat. In Shang-hai, far-mers and stu-dents went on a ram-pa-ge, dest-ro-ying the newly
bu-ilt oce-an-front ca-si-nos, bur-ning the bu-il-dings and tos-sing bil-li-ons of yen in-to the har-bo-ur. In
New Or-le-ans, child-ren in-va-ded the abo-veg-ro-und ce-me-te-ri-es and drag-ged the de-ad
thro-ugh the stre-ets.
Ancient na-ti-onal ri-val-ri-es and re-cent je-alo-usi-es sur-fa-ced. Aro-und the world, go-vern-ments
went in-to emer-gency ses-si-ons. Many po-li-ti-ci-ans saw the sud-den erup-ti-on of vi-olen-ce as an
at-tack on the-ir ci-ti-zens as the work of ter-ro-rist cells. Ot-hers cla-imed it was a bib-li-cal pla-gue,
Rag-na-rok or the early re-turn of the Rud-ras.
I can't say how long it's be-en sin-ce the world went to pi-eces. All the clocks se-em to ha-ve
stop-ped. A co-up-le of kids bu-ilt a sun-di-al, but with half the ci-ti-es in the world still bur-ning the sky
is mostly a swir-ling so-up of ash. We ke-ep warm by lo-oting the lib-ra-ri-es I used to wa-de thro-ugh,
bur-ning first the old pe-ri-odi-cals, then the card ca-ta-logs, best-sel-lers and self-help bo-oks, fi-nal-ly
wor-king our way up to the first edi-ti-ons.
Some days, the sky bursts open and ra-ins fish. So-me-ti-mes sto-nes or Bar-bie dolls. Last night, I
co-oked a sky sal-mon over an autog-rap-hed copy of The Gre-at Gatsby. I sha-red the fish with
Na-tas-ha, a mu-te girl who runs one of the cra-nes, ha-uling car-cas-ses from the fre-on po-ols. She's
be-en sta-ying with me out by the docks, in the car-go con-ta-iner I com-man-de-ered. I kil-led a man
to get the con-ta-iner and still ha-ve to sli-ce and di-ce the oc-ca-si-onal ho-use cras-her. Na-tas-ha's
not shy with a kni-fe or length of re-bar and has do-ne mo-re than a few int-ru-ders her-self. I as-su-me
the ones she did we-re int-ru-ders. Any-way, it ke-eps us in me-at.
I'm not su-re that you'd call what we ha-ve a typi-cal ro-man-ce. I li-ve with a girl who can ma-ke
glo-ves from a po-od-le's hi-de and sca-ven-ges bo-ots and clot-hes for me, and they're al-ways my

si-ze. She grows herbs in a bath-tub on the ro-of and de-co-ra-tes our ho-me with wind-up toys and
parts of smas-hed sta-tu-es from lo-oted mu-se-ums. I miss ice cre-am, con-ver-tib-les and go-ing to the
mo-vi-es. I'm not fo-ol eno-ugh to say that I'm hap-pi-er sin-ce the world went away, but ex-cept for the
ra-ins of sto-nes, I'm no mo-re mi-se-rab-le.
They fo-und a la-yer of zoo ani-mals un-der the col-lap-sed ro-ad-way of the Wil-li-ams-burg
Brid-ge. Pe-op-le over the-re ha-ve be-en li-ving lar-ge on elep-hant ste-aks and gi-raf-fe bur-gers. The
lo-cal go-vern-ment wants us to help gat-her up the re-ma-ining body parts, so we do. No one asks
why. It's so-met-hing to do. Be-si-des, the pa-per pus-hers re-fu-se to let the world end un-til every
form is tur-ned in, ti-me stam-ped and pro-perly ini-ti-al-led. Apo-calyp-se is the last gasp of
bu-re-a-uc-racy.
After din-ner, Na-tas-ha and I sit on top of the car-go con-ta-iner watc-hing a fi-eld full of cop cars
sink slowly in-to a newly ri-sen tar pit. Ever-yo-ne from the docks is the-re. We gi-ve a mighty Who-op!
As the last car sli-des, bub-bling, be-low the sur-fa-ce.
Will the last per-son on the pla-net ple-ase turn off the lights?

XII - CATHERINE WELLS - ARTIE'S ANGELS
When you set out to per-pet-ra-te a lie, I sup-po-se it's co-un-terp-ro-duc-ti-ve to wri-te down the
truth li-ke this. But wha-te-ver po-pu-la-ti-on sur-vi-ves he-re on Earth is not li-kely to re-ad this, much
less be-li-eve it. Most of them can't re-ad any-mo-re as it is-not Bo-ok Eng-lish, any-way-and it will
pro-bably get wor-se be-fo-re it gets bet-ter. Much, much wor-se.
My birth na-me is Fa-ye, but I ha-ve not used it sin-ce I was ten. That's the ye-ar we mo-ved in-si-de
the ra-di-ati-on shi-eld, in-to a wreck of a bu-il-ding in Kan-sas Ha-bi-tat. My mot-her cri-ed,
be-ca-use my lit-tle brot-her di-ed just be-fo-re we got the-re, and she kept mo-aning that if only we'd
got-ten in-si-de so-oner, he might ha-ve li-ved. But you had to ha-ve eit-her mo-ney or skills to get
in-si-de the ra-di-ati-on shi-eld, and my pa-rents had ne-it-her. So we fri-ed our skins and our eye-bal-ls
in Earth's un-fil-te-red sun-light un-til eno-ugh rich pe-op-le mo-ved off world to ma-ke ro-om for us
un-der the shi-eld.
Artie knoc-ked at my win-dow the first night; he'd shin-ni-ed up the dra-in-pi-pe from his apart-ment
just be-low. The ar-ti-fi-ci-al ra-in no lon-ger wor-ked in our sec-tor, of co-ur-se, be-ca-use the
inf-rast-ruc-tu-re was well on the ro-ad to hell, but the dra-in-pi-pe was still the-re. Ar-tie D'Ange-lo
was this skinny kid, just my age, a lit-tle go-ofy-lo-oking, but agi-le as a mon-key. When 1 saw him
han-ging on that dra-in-pi-pe, I was mo-re ama-zed than frigh-te-ned. Hi!" he sa-id thro-ugh the glass,
grin-ning wi-dely. He had dark, curly ha-ir, de-ep brown eyes, and big ears.
I clim-bed on-to my bed, which was un-der the win-dow, and sta-red at him. "You gon-na open up?"
he as-ked. "Or let me hang on this dra-in-pi-pe all night?"
With a glan-ce over my sho-ul-der to ma-ke su-re my do-or was shut, I lif-ted the sash and Ar-tie
clim-bed in. "I'm Ar-tie," he int-ro-du-ced. "I li-ve downs-ta-irs."
"Faye," I rep-li-ed. "You can't use the do-or?"
"I knoc-ked be-fo-re," he sa-id, "but no one wo-uld ans-wer."
I knew the ca-use of that. "My dad's sca-red to open the do-or," I told Ar-tie.
He shrug-ged. "In this ne-igh-bo-ur-ho-od, you're bet-ter off. But I saw you mo-ving in, and I
tho-ught you must be from out-si-de, so you'd pro-bably ne-ed so-me-one to show you aro-und."
During the next months, Ar-tie did just that. Born in Kan-Hab, he knew its grid upg-ro-und and
un-der. If not for his tu-te-la-ge, I wo-uld pro-bably ha-ve di-ed in that first ye-ar. By the ti-me they got
aro-und to let-ting dregs li-ke my fa-mily in, half the sec-tors we-re mo-re or less law-less, and a
ten-ye-ar-old kid co-uld easily get snuf-fed if she didn't know whe-re to run and whe-re to hi-de. Ar-tie
ta-ught me that and mo-re. In tho-se early days, he was my sal-va-ti-on; in the-se lat-ter days, I shall be
his.
It was whi-le we we-re hi-ding from the Ci-ti-zen Pat-rols in B4 that he first spo-ke the na-me I to-ok

as my own. That was back when the Sis-ters of Li-te-racy still tri-ed to run scho-ols in B4, which was as
clo-se as they wo-uld get to B9 whe-re Ar-tie and I li-ved. Scho-ol didn't ex-ci-te me, but Mom
wan-ted me to go, and Ar-tie in-sis-ted cros-sing in-to B4 was at le-ast as sa-fe as li-ving in B9. Most of
the ti-me that was true, but not when the Ci-ti-zen Pat-rols we-re out.
We knew the-re was go-ing to be tro-ub-le that day, be-ca-use Me-lis-sa's desk had be-en empty at
roll call, and word got aro-und by re-cess that she'd be-en fo-und in a trash bin, mis-sing a few parts. So
the Ci-ti-zen Pat-rols we-re out that af-ter-no-on, lo-oking for so-me-one to pu-nish. B9ers we-re a
fa-vo-uri-te tar-get. Ar-tie and I ran from sha-dow to shaft, upg-ro-und and un-der, trying to stay out of
the-ir way. We watc-hed from be-ne-ath an aban-do-ned ma-in-te-nan-ce cart as they ro-us-ted three
te-ena-ge boys pla-ying ho-ops in the stre-et.
The boys must ha-ve scan-ned as B4s, be-ca-use the CPs star-ted to walk away; but then one of the
boys sa-id so-met-hing. So-met-hing dirty, and cru-el. And a CP just shot him. With a cros-sbow, that
is, be-ca-use no pul-se or pro-j-ec-ti-le we-apons we-re ever al-lo-wed in the ha-bi-tats-too much
dan-ger of da-ma-ging the shi-el-ding. When the ot-her two boys went for the-ir kni-ves, the CPs shot
them, too.
I'd se-en pe-op-le die be-fo-re-things we-re even wor-se out-si-de than un-der the shi-eld. But this
was the first ti-me I knew-I knew-if I twitc-hed, I'd be next. One CP went over to kick the boys and
ma-ke su-re they we-re de-ad. Anot-her one cut open the mo-uthy boy's pants and sli-ced off his
pri-va-tes. "That's for Me-lis-sa," I he-ard him say, and he flung the blo-ody flesh ac-ross the stre-et. It
lan-ded right be-si-de the cart whe-re we lay hid-den.
The sight of it the-re, so clo-se to my fa-ce, ma-de me gag in hor-ror. I stuf-fed my fist in my mo-uth
to ke-ep from scre-aming, and Ar-tie pul-led me to him, pus-hing my fa-ce aga-inst his scrawny chest
and hol-ding me tight. "Sh," he bre-at-hed in my ear, kno-wing both how ter-ri-fi-ed I was and how bad
it wo-uld be if the CP he-ard us. "They can't hurt you. They can't hurt you, Fa-ye, be-ca-use-be-ca-use
you're ma-gic."
I was so start-led I stop-ped crying, won-de-ring what in the dying world he was tal-king abo-ut. I
co-uldn't see the Ci-vi-li-an Pat-rol, the way he had me pres-sed up aga-inst him, but af-ter a mi-nu-te or
two he let go of me so I knew they had go-ne. "What you say, ma-gic?" I de-man-ded in the ba-rest of
whis-pers, not kno-wing how far away they we-re.
"They left, didn't they?" he whis-pe-red back. "Ma-gic. You've got the ma-gic na-me."
I told him what I tho-ught he was full of.
"Maybe," he ag-re-ed, chec-king the stre-et ca-re-ful-ly to be su-re it re-al-ly was cle-ar. "But yo-ur
na-me, 'Fa-ye,' that's li-ke Mor-gan Le-Fey, right?" He star-ted to squ-irm out from un-der the cart.
I squ-ir-med right af-ter him. "Who?"
"King Art-hur's sis-ter," he sa-id. "She was ma-gic. She to-ok Art-hur to the Is-le of Ava-lon whe-re
he co-uldn't die."
Later that night, Ar-tie shin-ni-ed up the dra-in-pi-pe to my ro-om, and we sat the-re for ho-urs in the
dark whi-le he told me sto-ri-es of King Art-hur and his knights: men who de-fen-ded the help-less
ins-te-ad of vic-ti-mi-zing them, men who fo-ught aga-inst the vil-la-ins of the-ir age and ine-vi-tably
pre-va-iled. Not un-til many ye-ars la-ter did I le-arn what a spin he put on the sto-ri-es for me that
night, to ma-ke me be-li-eve that on-ce, the-re had be-en pe-op-le who ca-red abo-ut the li-kes of me,
who sto-od for jus-ti-ce and no-bi-lity of spi-rit, who ma-de it ho-no-urab-le to pro-tect the we-ak.
That night I to-ok the na-me of Mor-gan, not be-ca-use I ever be-li-eved it was ma-gic, but
be-ca-use I wan-ted to be a part of that ide-al. I ne-eded the ho-pe that King Art-hur rep-re-sen-ted,
and I saw it in my Art-hur-Artie. To think of myself as his sis-ter ple-ased me in a qu-i-et, de-ep way I
co-uld not exp-la-in.
Nor was I the only one so drawn to Ar-tie. He had al-re-ady be-gun to ac-qu-ire a fol-lo-wing when I
met him: child-ren he had grown up with, and ot-hers li-ke myself whom he bef-ri-en-ded along the way.
The-re was sa-fety in num-bers, as long as no cros-sbows we-re in-vol-ved. A pack of-fe-red the
pro-tec-ti-on of a do-zen kni-ves that co-uld not all be ta-ken away at on-ce. And then we
dis-co-ve-red anot-her form of pro-tec-ti-on or rat-her, Ar-tie dis-co-ve-red it, and it chan-ged him. It

chan-ged us all.
We we-re thi-eves in tho-se days; I ha-te to say it, but that's what we we-re. Ar-tie was a thi-ef. I
was a thi-ef. The-re was an et-hic to our lar-ceny, for we ne-ver sto-le from pe-op-le po-orer and
we-aker than we we-re-the rat-her ru-de be-gin-nings of the Co-de. But we to-ok things we did not
own and tho-ught no mo-re of it than a go-at thinks of crop-ping grass. That's how we ca-me by the first
bicyc-les.
Jose star-ted it. A pro-cu-re-ment con-voy had co-me in from out-si-de, lo-aded with go-ods for the
La-unch Pad. That's what we cal-led the sec-tors whe-re the en-gi-ne-ers and ad-mi-nist-ra-tors and
ot-her eli-te li-ve, tho-se who will su-rely ha-ve berths on the next trans-port ship car-rying pe-op-le
away from this dying pla-net. Whi-le the last dri-ver stop-ped to flirt with the ga-te-ke-eper, Josh
jim-mi-ed the lock on his truck and slip-ped in-si-de. He was wor-king for so-me ol-der kids, of
co-ur-se, but by the ti-me they ro-ad bloc-ked the con-voy in G5, Jose had the car-go map-ped out so
they knew which cra-tes to snatch. One of them had six bicyc-les.
The bi-ke was his fee. No one co-uld ha-ve be-en pro-uder than Jose when he sho-wed up with that
bicyc-le. He car-ri-ed it on his sho-ul-der, be-ca-use he didn't know how to ri-de, and it had slip-ped its
cha-in, any-way. Ar-tie lo-oked at it, and lo-oked at it, and I co-uld see the ide-as spin-ning thro-ugh his
he-ad li-ke a cyclo-ne. He was thir-te-en by then, and tho-ugh he was still skinny, he'd grown in-to his
ears and his te-eth eno-ugh so the girls we-re star-ting to gi-ve him se-cond lo-oks; but when an idea
pos-ses-sed him, he still lo-oked li-ke a go-ofy kid, his mo-uth han-ging slack and his eyes gla-zed over.
"You can ri-de it, right?" Jose as-ked, be-ca-use li-ke most of the yo-un-ger kids, he be-li-eved
imp-li-citly that Ar-tie knew everyt-hing worth kno-wing and had all skills worth ac-qu-iring. Ar-tie had
even wrang-led his way in-to Spark Aca-demy, which ama-zed ever-yo-ne. Kids from B9 didn't get
in-to Spark Aca-demy. Most of them didn't bot-her with scho-ol at all.
Artie had not ans-we-red Jose's qu-es-ti-on; I wasn't su-re he had even he-ard it. I nud-ged him. "I
can ri-de," I told him softly. "Le-ar-ned out-si-de. Bi-kes lay aro-und free-for-not-hing; my old man, he
fix one up for me."
Finally Ar-tie's eyes left the bicyc-le and fas-te-ned on me, still whir-ling with the enc-hant-ment of his
ra-cing tho-ughts. "Yo-ur dad can fix bicyc-les?"
I shrug-ged. "He know mac-hi-nes 'n' things. That how we got un-der shi-eld, fi-nal-ly. Le-ar-ned him
wel-ding."
At that, Ar-tie scow-led and ca-me back to the pre-sent. "Don't talk stre-et, Mor-gan," he chi-ded.
"You've got to prac-ti-ce Bo-ok Eng-lish if you're go-ing to get in-to the Aca-demy with me."
That was his dre-am for me, that I wo-uld pass the ent-ran-ce exams to go to Spark Aca-demy, too. I
wor-ked at it, be-ca-use he tho-ught I sho-uld, but I ne-ver had much ho-pe. "Yes, Ar-tie, he knows
so-met-hing abo-ut bicyc-les," I sa-id with exag-ge-ra-ted ar-ti-cu-la-ti-on. "I'm not su-re how much."
It was eno-ugh. When my fat-her got off shift, he had the bi-ke run-ning in less than fif-te-en
mi-nu-tes; then Ar-tie to-ok it, and me, and fo-und a de-ser-ted stretch of tun-nel whe-re he co-uld
mas-ter the two-whe-eler wit-ho-ut an audi-en-ce. I was the only one he trus-ted to wit-ness the
ig-no-miny of his early fa-ilu-res. A we-ek la-ter when he re-tur-ned the bi-ke to Jose, he ro-de in-to the
stre-et whe-re the ot-hers wa-ited, bra-ked to a smo-oth stop, and dis-mo-un-ted with prac-ti-ced ease.
"We ne-ed mo-re of the-se," Ar-tie an-no-un-ced. "We ne-ed every one of us to be mo-un-ted. We
can out-run an-yo-ne on the-se things. We can pick up our fa-mi-li-es' ra-ti-ons and not worry abo-ut
be-ing mug-ged on the way ho-me, be-ca-use no one will be ab-le to catch us. We can get to a fri-end
who's in tro-ub-le, and we can get away from tro-ub-le when it co-mes lo-oking for us. Bicyc-les are the
ans-wer."
And be-ca-use he was Ar-tie, we all be-li-eved him.
Over the next ye-ar, bicyc-les spro-uted li-ke pri-mal-loy mush-ro-oms in the stre-ets of B9. We lost
one kid in the pro-cess-To-rey got shot by Se-cu-rity ma-king a run out of F5, whe-re he sho-uld ne-ver
ha-ve be-en gra-zing-but that left se-ven-te-en of us on whe-els, Kni-uhts of the Whe-el Ro-und, I
la-ug-hed.
You might won-der how Ar-tie co-uld de-ve-lop such a fol-lo-wing, win the lo-yalty of so many

pe-op-le who wo-uld-and so-me-ti-mes did-sac-ri-fi-ce them-sel-ves and the-ir own well-be-ing to
fol-low his Co-de. The ans-wer, I'm con-vin-ced, li-es in three qu-ali-ti-es Ar-tie pos-ses-sed in gre-ater
me-asu-re than ot-her hu-man be-ings: com-pas-si-on, con-vic-ti-on, and com-pul-si-on. When Ar-tie
latc-hed on-to a no-ti-on, he pur-su-ed it with a fo-cus or-di-nary mor-tals can t ho-pe to ac-hi-eve, and
the in-ten-sity of his de-vo-ti-on suc-ked ot-her pe-op-le in li-ke a black ho-le.
Bicycles be-ca-me his world. Bet-we-en my fat-her's sketchy know-led-ge and so-me bo-oks we
fo-und on-li-ne, Ar-tie not only le-ar-ned how to ma-in-ta-in and re-pa-ir the bi-kes, he al-so le-ar-ned
fra-me ge-ometry and stress fac-tors and per-for-man-ce met-rics. I le-ar-ned so-me, too, be-ca-use
you co-uldn't hang aro-und Ar-tie and not le-arn, but mostly I stuck with ma-in-te-nan-ce and re-pa-ir. It
wasn't eno-ugh for him, tho-ugh, that we sho-uld all le-arn to ri-de and ca-re for our bi-kes-we had to
tra-in. He had us up be-fo-re dawn each day, ra-cing along the empty stre-ets of B9 and B7. Our legs
grew thick with musc-le as we vi-ed with each ot-her for do-mi-nan-ce in spe-ed and en-du-ran-ce.
Soon we ven-tu-red out of our ho-me sec-tors, be-co-ming a fa-mi-li-ar sight thro-ug-ho-ut the
upg-ro-und Bs and Gs, and even in parts of the As. Se-ven-te-en cyclists who-os-hing along in a pack at
twenty-plus mi-les an ho-ur is an imp-res-si-ve sight-that was both go-od and bad. A pack of thugs in
A12 cal-led the Big Dogs tri-ed to lay traps for us whe-ne-ver we cros-sed the-ir sec-tor, and we
cros-sed it of-ten es-cor-ting Ar-tie to and from Spark Aca-demy. But we we-re al-ways too qu-ick
and too smart and too mo-bi-le for them.
There we-re two re-asons Ar-tie kept run-ning the ga-unt-let to get to Spark Aca-demy. Okay, three.
The third was that he co-uldn't stand for so-me-one to tell him he co-uldn't do so-met-hing. But the first
was that he li-ked le-ar-ning. It char-ged his bat-te-ri-es. He was in-to mec-ha-ni-cal en-gi-ne-ering, and
the te-ac-hers at Spark ac-tu-al-ly en-co-ura-ged him in that. I gu-ess they tho-ught he co-uld help
ke-ep ha-bi-tat inf-rast-ruc-tu-re from col-lap-sing aro-und us.
But the se-cond re-ason he kept go-ing to the Aca-demy was Yvon-ne.
Now, Ar-tie had girlf-ri-ends in the ne-igh-bo-ur-ho-od, and had sin-ce he was old eno-ugh to
un-ders-tand why a man wo-uld want to in-sert Tab A in-to Slot B. He didn't exactly tell me the first
ti-me he got la-id-he did ha-ve so-me no-ti-on that I was a girl and wo-uldn't ap-pre-ci-ate he-aring
abo-ut his con-qu-ests-but I knew it had hap-pe-ned, be-ca-use I saw the girl try to ta-ke ow-ners-hip
of him. Fat chan-ce she had. Ar-tie al-ways had cham-pag-ne tas-te when it ca-me to girls, and you
don't find cham-pag-ne in B9.
Yvonne was cham-pag-ne. I ne-ver met her, but I knew be-ca-use Ar-tie told me all abo-ut her. He'd
lost his he-art, and it wasn't the kind of thing you co-uld tell ot-her guys, so he told me. Most of what he
was le-ar-ning in Spark Aca-demy, he con-fi-ded, he co-uld pick up out of bo-oks and vids that we-re
ava-ilab-le re-mo-tely, even on the arc-ha-ic B9 equ-ip-ment. And be-si-des, he co-uld earn a ra-ti-on
just run-ning the co-uri-er ser-vi-ce he'd star-ted, so he didn't re-al-ly ne-ed to get in-to a uni-ver-sity
prog-ram. But a girl li-ke Yvon-ne wo-uldn't marry a co-uri-er and li-ve in B9. So he had to get a
deg-ree, and a bet-ter ho-using as-sign-ment, so he co-uld ma-ke a li-fe with Yvon-ne.
For the re-cord, I think he wo-uld ha-ve go-ne to the Aca-demy any-way. Not that he didn't li-ke
run-ning co-uri-er-he li-ked using his cycling skills, eva-ding obs-tac-les, flir-ting with dan-ger only to
es-ca-pe. He li-ked or-ga-ni-zing the rest of us as co-uri-ers, and he li-ked be-ing ab-le to de-li-ver
pac-ka-ges qu-ickly and sa-fely for pe-op-le who we-re af-ra-id to walk the stre-ets. As with
pro-tec-ting smal-ler child-ren, and hel-ping out-si-ders adj-ust to the ha-bi-tat, it was a way for him to
to-uch pe-op-le's li-ves and ma-ke them bet-ter. The ne-ed to do that was de-ep in him, and it was the
fo-un-da-ti-on of the Co-de he es-tab-lis-hed.
For Yvon-ne, tho-ugh, he ne-eded to be mo-re than a co-uri-er. The ot-hers in our pack knew Ar-tie
had an Aca-demy girlf-ri-end, but they as-su-med she was no dif-fe-rent than the girls he fo-oled
aro-und with in B9-except it was so-me-how mo-re ex-ci-ting to get yo-ur rocks of-fwith so-me C5
prin-cess, so the rest of the guys lo-oked at Ar-tie in awe. That was why, when Yvon-ne dum-ped him,
he clim-bed the dra-in-pi-pe to my ro-om and cri-ed in my arms.
We we-re ne-ver lo-vers, Ar-tie and I. He ne-ver wan-ted me that way, and I knew bet-ter than to
try en-ti-cing him. It wo-uld ha-ve be-en la-ug-hab-le: I am a ho-mely wo-man, and I was an ugly child.

My mot-her sa-id it was the ra-di-ati-on I en-du-red out-si-de-she bla-med everyt-hing on
ra-di-ati-on-but I didn't ha-ve to lo-ok far to find the long jaw and the clo-se-set eyes I in-he-ri-ted, or
the limp, co-lor-less ha-ir and cro-oked te-eth. My sha-pe, too, esc-hews be-a-uty: I ha-ve a bony
fra-me and tiny bre-asts. The-re are boys who don't ca-re what Slot B lo-oks li-ke, as long as it will
ac-com-mo-da-te Tab A, but Ar-tie was ne-ver one of them.
So I held him the night Yvon-ne re-j-ec-ted his lo-ve, kno-wing this was as clo-se to him as I wo-uld
ever get. The next day he went out and bu-ilt his first bicyc-le.
Before he gra-du-ated from Spark Aca-demy, the co-un-sel-lors the-re tri-ed to push him in-to
vo-ca-ti-onal tra-ining be-ca-use he was so gif-ted in wor-king with his hands: car-ving, mo-ul-ding,
wel-ding. "Wo-uldn't you be hap-pi-er," they as-ked, "craf-ting com-po-nents? Bu-il-ding mac-hi-nes?
Tur-ning out a pro-duct?" If Yvon-ne had dum-ped him ear-li-er, he might ha-ve yi-el-ded to the-ir
pres-su-re; but he had told them he co-uld do both: de-sign and bu-ild. With his he-art torn to shreds, he
ne-eded to pro-ve that.
It was no work of art, that first bicyc-le: pri-mal-loy tu-bes patch-wel-ded to-get-her. But it was
ser-vi-ce-ab-le, and it was a start. De-Ron and I to-ok over run-ning the co-uri-er bu-si-ness-we
al-re-ady hand-led the ro-uti-ne ma-in-te-nan-ce and re-pa-ir of our pack bicyc-les-so Ar-tie wo-uld
ha-ve ti-me to bu-ild. His inst-ruc-tors in the uni-ver-sity en-gi-ne-ering prog-ram de-ri-ded him, he told
me, for was-ting his ti-me bu-il-ding "toys." New ro-bots to eva-cu-ate clog-ged wa-ter and se-wer
li-nes, or in-no-va-ti-ve ge-omet-ri-es to prop up the sag-ging tun-nels of Kan-Hab-tho-se we-re
pro-j-ects worthy of a mec-ha-ni-cal en-gi-ne-er, they sa-id. Not swift trans-por-ta-ti-on thro-ugh the
un-sa-vo-ury stre-ets of law-less sec-tors.
But he did all they as-ked of him by day, and when dark-ness blan-ke-ted Kan-Hab, he loc-ked the
front do-or of the aban-do-ned sto-ref-ront that ser-ved as our he-ad-qu-ar-ters, cal-led up his
dra-wings, and be-gan to bu-ild.
Artie ma-de it his bu-si-ness to see that every child in B9 who kept the Co-de had a sle-ek,
ef-fi-ci-ent mac-hi-ne that co-uld carry him or her away from dan-ger. The Co-de was fa-irly simp-le at
that po-int: Ta-ke ca-re of yo-ur bi-ke and yo-ur fri-ends; ne-ver fight when you can run; study and
le-arn; ma-ke things bet-ter for ever-yo-ne, not just yo-ur-self. Tho-se sa-me te-nets we-re re-qu-ired of
ever-yo-ne in his pack.
By this ti-me we had left thi-every be-hind and we-re a le-gi-ti-ma-te bu-si-ness, re-cog-ni-zed by
Ad-min, de-li-ve-ring par-cels and pro-vi-ding re-con-na-is-san-ce for elect-ric cart con-voys and
gro-ups of pe-dest-ri-ans thro-ug-ho-ut Kan-Hab. We wo-re patc-hes that sho-wed we we-re part of
Ar-tie's pack-Artie's An-gels, we cal-led our-sel-ves-with aut-ho-ri-za-ti-on to cross sec-tors and ri-de
thro-ugh pub-lic tun-nels and bu-il-dings. Ad-min ga-ve us hel-mets, glo-ves, and light body ar-mo-ur as
part of our ra-ti-on, and they stam-ped out cle-ats for Ar-tie to fas-ten on fle-xib-le, ste-el-shan-ked
sho-es so we co-uld lock in-to our pe-dals. When we ro-de as a pack, ar-mo-ured and shod
iden-ti-cal-ly, pe-op-le sto-od asi-de, ga-ping.
As our cus-to-mer ba-se ex-pan-ded to ot-her sec-tors, our fe-es ori-gi-nal-ly ac-cep-ted as
co-mes-tib-les, to-ols, and clot-hing-we-re pa-id mo-re and mo-re in Ex-Ce-es, or Exc-han-ge
Cre-dits, flus-hed thro-ugh ha-bi-tat ac-co-un-ting and re-de-emab-le in ra-ti-ons, en-ter-ta-in-ment, or
just abo-ut anyt-hing el-se we co-uld want. I drew a sing-le ra-ti-on for myself and ga-ve everyt-hing
el-se I ear-ned to Ar-tie, to buy ma-te-ri-als for the bicyc-les that ga-ve the kids of B9 a chan-ce: a
chan-ce to le-arn, a chan-ce to grow, a chan-ce to be-li-eve in the go-od-ness and worth of ot-her
pe-op-le.
But it's hard to gi-ve ho-pe to a dying pla-net.
All the ti-me Ar-tie was trying to ma-ke things bet-ter in B9, out-si-de Kan-Hab, li-fe be-ca-me
mo-re and mo-re fu-ti-le. Plants and ani-mals di-ed in the un-fil-te-red sun-light, pe-op-le star-ved to
de-ath, ba-bi-es we-re born with mu-ta-ti-ons so hor-rib-le the-ir own pa-rents kil-led them. Bru-ta-lity
re-ig-ned, for li-fe was short and ugly, and pe-op-le snatc-hed what ple-asu-re they co-uld; too of-ten
that me-ant the ad-re-na-lin rush ga-ined by inf-lic-ting one's will on so-me-one or so-met-hing el-se.
How long the Re-apers we-re a prob-lem out-si-de, I don't know; but the day they bro-ke thro-ugh

Se-cu-rity in-to Kan-Hab is a day we will ne-ver for-get.
They ro-de old com-bus-ti-on-engi-ne mo-torcyc-les, po-we-red by wha-te-ver al-co-hol they
co-uld ma-nu-fac-tu-re to fu-el them. The-ir phi-lo-sophy was ni-hi-lis-tic: Earth and its in-ha-bi-tants
we-re do-omed, so why not help them along the path to dest-ruc-ti-on? Whet-her or not they di-ed in
the pro-cess se-emed of no con-se-qu-en-ce to the Re-apers. Of the twenty or so who cras-hed the
ga-te that day, only two ma-de any ef-fort to es-ca-pe the cer-ta-in de-ath they fo-und at the hands of
Kan-Hab's de-fen-ders. But be-fo-re they di-ed, eigh-te-en Se-cu-rity of-fi-cers and over a hund-red
ci-vi-li-ans fell to the Re-apers' pro-j-ec-ti-le we-apons-not to men-ti-on the pe-op-le they simply ro-de
down. Hund-reds mo-re bur-ned to de-ath in the fi-res they star-ted.
Infrastructure at the ga-te, inc-lu-ding the ra-di-ati-on shi-eld, was so badly da-ma-ged that Ad-min
se-aled off the en-ti-re sec-tor and simply bu-ilt a new ga-te furt-her in. They did not-hing to re-pa-ir the
col-lap-sed tun-nels and fi-re-gut-ted bu-il-dings of A7 and 8. Why sho-uld they? Physi-cal spa-ce was
not what kept pe-op-le out of Kan-Hab, but the lack of fo-od from our gre-en-ho-uses. Ho-using was
plen-ti-ful, and it was only re-si-den-ti-al are-as the Re-apers had ter-ro-ri-zed in the-ir eigh-te-en-ho-ur
frenzy of dest-ruc-ti-on.
Artie got two months off from clas-ses whi-le he and ot-her stu-dents hel-ped re-pa-ir the da-ma-ge
to the shi-eld and ot-her cri-ti-cal parts of the inf-rast-ruc-tu-re. One day as we wor-ked in C17
un-derg-ro-und-Artie as fi-eld en-gi-ne-er and De-Ron and I as his crew chi-efs-the most stri-kingly
be-a-uti-ful wo-man I ha-ve ever se-en ap-pro-ac-hed us: tall and lit-he, with high che-ek-bo-nes in an
oval fa-ce and dark, unb-le-mis-hed skin.
"Mr. D'Ange-lo?" she as-ked, and her vo-ice was li-ke thick cre-am, a smo-oth, rich flu-id that
spil-led out and so-aked in-to the thirsty air.
Artie was smit-ten; it was writ-ten all over his fa-ce as he step-ped down from the lad-der he had just
mo-un-ted. "I'm Ar-tie D'Ange-lo," he sa-id.
I tri-ed to see what Sa-ron-da was se-e-ing: a wiry yo-ung man well shy of six fe-et, with a flat gut
and thighs li-ke tree trunks; dark ha-ir clum-ped in curls from swe-ating be-ne-ath his hard hat;
red-rim-med eyes and two days' growth of be-ard tel-ling how lit-tle he had do-ne the past forty-eight
ho-urs ex-cept work to sal-va-ge so-met-hing from the dest-ruc-ti-on.
But she smi-led, a smi-le as warm and sin-ce-re as it was bril-li-antly whi-te. "I'm Sa-ron-da
McCa-be. I un-ders-tand you bu-ild bicyc-les."
She was an elect-ri-cal en-gi-ne-ering stu-dent, and her fat-her wor-ri-ed abo-ut her tra-vel-ling from
her ho-me in F3 to her prac-ti-cum in C7. She tho-ught a bicyc-le might be the ans-wer. Ar-tie ag-re-ed,
pro-vi-ded she al-so got so-me prac-ti-cal tra-ining in avo-iding dan-ger-which he, of co-ur-se, wo-uld
be happy to pro-vi-de at no char-ge. De-Ron and I exc-han-ged a lo-ok, then to-ok our crew in se-arch
of so-me lunch whi-le the two of them ma-de eyes and tra-ded comp-li-ments. "Ten Ex-Ce-es he's in her
pants be-fo-re mor-ning," De-Ron mut-te-red as we tur-ned a cor-ner.
I didn't think so-she was high-class stuff-but I wasn't stu-pid eno-ugh to ta-ke the bet. Go-od thing-I
wo-uld ha-ve lost.
Once Sa-ron-da's bicyc-le was ma-de, we star-ted swin-ging thro-ugh F3 on our mor-ning ri-des to
pick her up for a co-up-le of mi-les, af-ter which she and Ar-tie wo-uld bre-ak off and go the-ir own
way-be-ca-use, he sa-id, she co-uldn't ke-ep up with us qu-ite yet. That was true, and they did stay with
us lon-ger as she imp-ro-ved. But she had a ho-using as-sign-ment se-pa-ra-te from her pa-rents-her
fat-her was high up in Ad-min-and wit-hin a co-up-le of months we we-re pic-king up Ar-tie in F3, too.
His bicyc-le bu-il-ding went by the way-si-de. All the kids in B9 had bi-kes by this ti-me, any-way,
and every An-gel had a top-notch cus-tom mac-hi-ne. On we-ekends he ca-me back to B9 to check on
the co-uri-er ope-ra-ti-on and hang with his pack, and he was still the sa-me Ar-tie: sa-me hu-ge smi-le,
sa-me warm la-ugh, sa-me abi-ding con-cern for his ne-igh-bo-ur-ho-od. But the kids mis-sed him, and
so-me of them star-ted ac-ting out, bre-aking the Co-de. That bro-ught him back for a whi-le, be-ca-use
he re-cog-ni-zed that his pre-sen-ce was ne-ces-sary to ke-ep them on track, to ke-ep them be-li-eving.
I wor-ri-ed mo-re abo-ut him then, tho-ugh, be-ca-use when night ca-me and things star-ted loc-king up,
that's when he'd get on his bicyc-le and he-ad for F3 to see Sa-ron-da. It was a bad ho-ur to be out

wit-ho-ut yo-ur pack.
I told myself that Ar-tie was ma-king a ter-rib-le mis-ta-ke, that he was he-aded for anot-her fall li-ke
with Yvon-ne; but I don't think I re-al-ly be-li-eved that. He was too happy, and Sa-ron-da-blast her
sculp-ted, per-fect fa-ce-was a ni-ce per-son. Ge-nu-inely ni-ce. I li-ked her, hard as I tri-ed not to.
On-ce she ca-me with us in-to B9, be-ca-use she wan-ted to see whe-re Ar-tie and the rest of us li-ved,
to me-et the child-ren and he-ar them re-ci-te the Co-de. "I wan-ted to jo-in the Sis-ters of Li-te-racy
when I was yo-un-ger," she con-fi-ded to me as Ar-tie exp-la-ined to a ni-ne-ye-ar-old how the
de-ra-il-le-ur wor-ked and the easi-est way to rep-la-ce a slip-ped cha-in. "But my dad wo-uldn't he-ar
of it. He po-in-ted out that whe-re we're go-ing-"
She bro-ke off sud-denly, and I saw the pa-in on her fa-ce be-fo-re she chan-ged the to-pic qu-ickly.
But I knew. I knew. And I wan-ted to scre-am at Ar-tie for be-ing so stu-pid, and at Sa-ron-da for not
stop-ping this, and at myself for not sha-king them both and ma-king them fa-ce re-ality-but they we-re
so in lo-ve. All we ha-ve he-re in B9 is mo-ments. I fi-gu-red they we-re en-tit-led to the-irs.
It was Sep-tem-ber when the trans-port ship ar-ri-ved and be-gan to lo-ad tho-se who co-uld pay the
co-op fee for the-ir pas-sa-ge off world. The-re was a bri-ef stir of ex-ci-te-ment as a re-ne-ga-de
Re-aper pop-ped out from whe-re-ver he'd be-en hi-ding for ten months to throw a ho-me-ma-de
gre-na-de at the shut-tle when it doc-ked. He di-ed with six cros-sbow bolts in his chest, and so-me
he-ro-ic Se-cu-rity of-fi-cer threw him-self on the gre-na-de so the-re was no da-ma-ge to the shut-tle.
But I watc-hed it all on the news wit-ho-ut much in-te-rest, wa-iting ins-te-ad for the tap at my win-dow.
Artie's grin thro-ugh the glass was for-ced. "You gon-na open up?" he as-ked. "Or let me hang on this
dra-in-pi-pe all night?"
I ex-pec-ted a re-pe-at of the night Yvon-ne dum-ped him, be-ca-use I knew what had hap-pe-ned:
Sa-ron-da's fa-mily was de-par-ting on the trans-port, and she'd cho-sen li-fe off world-whe-re you can
li-ve for hund-reds of ye-ars in pe-ace and com-fort-over a co-up-le of de-ca-des with a boy from B9.
But I was wrong. Her fat-her had purc-ha-sed Ar-tie's pas-sa-ge, as well, for Sa-ron-da's
hap-pi-ness and be-ca-use he fo-und Ar-tie to be a man worth sa-ving, a man with a cont-ri-bu-ti-on to
ma-ke.
"Then this is go-od-bye," I sa-id, my vo-ice cho-ked with my loss.
But Ar-tie sho-ok his he-ad. "I'm not go-ing," he sa-id, as tho-ugh he had ne-ver se-ri-o-usly
con-si-de-red it.
"What do you me-an?" I de-man-ded. "You ha-ve to go, Ar-tie. You ha-ve to get out."
"And le-ave you guys he-re to ha-ve all the fun?" he as-ked, tho-ugh his vo-ice bro-ke and his eyes
swam with te-ars. "Naa."
"You ha-ve to!" I sho-uted aga-in, and I struck his chest with my fist. "You ha-ve to, Ar-tie! For all of
us! You're the only B9er who's ever, ever be-en of-fe-red trans-port out of he-re, and you ha-ve to go!
You ha-ve to go whe-re you can li-ve for hund-reds of ye-ars, you ha-ve to do it for us. You ha-ve to
li-ve all tho-se ye-ars for us, Ar-tie-you're the only one who can."
Still he sho-ok his he-ad, tho-ugh it to-ok him a mo-ment lon-ger to spe-ak this ti-me. "Naa," he
re-pe-ated. "Who'd ma-ke bi-kes for the kids? Who'd ma-ke them li-ve by the Co-de? You saw what
hap-pe-ned when I was go-ne for just a co-up-le of months." He smi-led at me, tho-ugh he had to brush
his eyes with the back of his hand. "Be-si-des,
I can't le-ave the An-gels. De-Ron wo-uld go mer-ce-nary in-si-de of six we-eks, and Stash is
al-re-ady smug-gling on the si-de-I'm go-ing to ha-ve to co-me down on him be-fo-re he drags the
who-le ope-ra-ti-on law-less: And you know, the-re are bi-ke packs in fi-ve ot-her sec-tors now, and
three of them fol-low the Co-de. I've got to stick aro-und and ma-ke su-re it stays that way."
"And Sa-ron-da?" I chal-len-ged, des-pe-ra-te for so-me way to talk him in-to go-ing.
He drew a de-ep bre-ath. "She thinks I'm al-re-ady on-bo-ard. Her dad won't tell her till they la-unch,
he pro-mi-sed me." Then he lo-oked out my win-dow as a bright stre-ak of light flas-hed ac-ross the
dar-ke-ned sky: the shut-tle le-aping up-ward to me-et the wa-iting trans-port.
"Damn you, Ar-tie!" I scre-amed at him, as tho-ugh I we-re the one he had aban-do-ned. "Damn you,
Ar-tie, you sho-uld ha-ve go-ne with her!" And I hit him aga-in, and aga-in, and aga-in, un-til he

grab-bed my fists to ma-ke me stop and I dis-sol-ved in we-eping. Then he held me clo-se and we both
wept un-til, ex-ha-us-ted, we fi-nal-ly slept in each ot-her's arms; and our dre-ams ec-ho-ed with the
whis-per of Sa-ron-da's an-gu-is-hed wa-ils.
What a story it wo-uld be, if it en-ded the-re. You wo-uld un-ders-tand, then, and per-haps be-li-eve,
all the le-gends that sur-ro-und Ar-tie and his An-gels. You wo-uld think that he de-vo-ted the rest of his
li-fe to pro-tec-ting the child-ren of B9, and even-tu-al-ly of ot-her sec-tors, and that he res-to-red
pri-de and ho-no-ur and-da-re I say-chi-valry to a so-ci-ety that had lost all that. That was his
in-ten-ti-on, cer-ta-inly. But he ne-ver had the chan-ce.
We had known for months the-re was a Re-aper han-ging with the Big Dogs, one who had es-ca-ped
de-ath on the day of the-ir in-va-si-on. We knew be-ca-use the Re-apers' in-si-di-o-us phi-lo-sophy
be-gan cre-eping out of A12. When the as-sa-ult was ma-de on the shut-tle, tho-ugh, we all sup-po-sed
that was him, and the as-sa-ilant's de-ath put an end to the thre-at.
We we-re wrong.
It was six months la-ter, and Ar-tie was in his shop bu-il-ding a bicyc-le for a kid who had just co-me
in from out-si-de. I was in my ro-om, just ac-ross the stre-et, stud-ying Ta-nin-ger's tre-ati-se on folk
myths. Alt-ho-ugh I was ne-ver ac-cep-ted for ad-van-ced scho-oling, Ar-tie had in-sis-ted that I ke-ep
stud-ying re-mo-tely. With his help, I was wor-king at the first-ye-ar uni-ver-sity le-vel in math and
sci-en-ce, and hig-her in so-ci-al stu-di-es. It had just oc-cur-red to me, re-ading Ta-nin-ger, that the
Art-hu-ri-an cycle had many pa-ral-lels to the Christ cycle, when I he-ard the do-ub-le shot-gun blasts.
I bol-ted for the do-or, not even pa-using to lo-ok out my win-dow. Tho-ugh the so-und was
fo-re-ign to me, and I wo-uldn't know un-til much la-ter what had ma-de it, I was se-ized with a dre-ad
con-vic-ti-on that it had co-me from Ar-tie's shop.
The Re-aper hadn't stuck aro-und, but his han-di-work was all too evi-dent. The fi-ber-for-ced glass
in the sto-ref-ront win-dow was not me-ant to withs-tand the ons-la-ught of out-law pro-j-ec-ti-le
we-apons; it had shat-te-red in-to a mil-li-on harm-less shards that crunc-hed un-der my fe-et as I
stumb-led thro-ugh the wrec-ka-ge to the back of the ro-om. Ar-tie was on the flo-or bet-we-en the
tru-ing stand and his fra-me bu-il-ding jig, in a lit-ter of pri-mal-loy tu-bing and jo-ining patc-hes. His
chest was shred-ded whe-re the brunt of one blast had ca-ught him, and spots of blo-od glis-te-ned on
his legs and arms from a spray of pel-lets.
Someone el-se en-te-red be-hind me-Lo-u-is, it tur-ned out. "Get a doc-tor!" I scre-amed. "Call for
med-evac!"
But the light was al-re-ady fa-ding from Ar-tie's eyes. "Wan-ted to ta-ke you with me," he slur-red,
blo-od fo-aming with the words from his lips.
"Don't talk," I com-man-ded. "Lie still. Help is co-ming."
"Said I'd go if you co-uld, too," he ma-na-ged.
"Shut up, Ar-tie!" I sho-uted. "Don't you lay that on me! Don't you do it!" Then, im-pos-sibly, he
smi-led. "Mor-gan Le-Fey," he whis-pe-red. "Ta-ke me to Ava-lon… "
The story go-es that we got him to a hos-pi-tal, and the doc-tors we-re ab-le to sta-bi-li-ze him
eno-ugh to put him in a cryo-ge-nic cham-ber. That cham-ber went on the next trans-port ship to a
dis-tant world whe-re Sa-ron-da was wa-iting, and whe-re they ha-ve the me-di-cal sci-en-ce to he-al
him. So-me-day, when he's re-co-ve-red, he'll co-me back to Earth aga-in, to Kan-Hab. In the
me-an-ti-me, Ar-tie's An-gels are still he-re, se-e-ing that what he star-ted do-esn't die.
That's the story. But Ar-tie di-ed in my arms that night, and no med-evac bot-he-red to co-me. Not to
B9. Lo-u-is and I to-ok him un-derg-ro-und, to a pla-ce whe-re a col-lap-sed tun-nel had left only a
crawl spa-ce. We la-id him in the-re and se-aled it up, and we didn't tell an-yo-ne el-se. Then I
con-coc-ted that story abo-ut the cryo-ge-nic cham-ber. Ha. As if Kan-Hab had any such thing.
So that is the truth of what hap-pe-ned to Ar-tie D'Ange-lo, but don't try to tell that to an-yo-ne in
Kan-Hab. He has be-co-me lar-ger in de-ath than he ever was in li-fe-I ha-ve se-en to that. A bru-tal
act of ni-hi-lism dep-ri-ved me of my fri-end, my pack le-ader, my gu-iding light, but I will not let it
dep-ri-ve Kan-Hab of ho-pe. The sto-ri-es of Ar-tie's exp-lo-its grow ric-her with each tel-ling; and in
them he suc-ce-eds, in ways he co-uld only dre-am of, in pro-tec-ting the help-less and imp-ro-ving the

li-ves of tho-se he left be-hind.
For us, he tur-ned down a chan-ce to li-ve hund-reds of ye-ars in com-fort and pe-ace with his
be-lo-ved. I will gi-ve him, in its pla-ce, im-mor-ta-lity.
Sleep well in Ava-lon, my Art-hur. Kan-Hab will not for-get.

XIII - JERRY OLTION - JUDGMENT PASSED
It was cold that mor-ning, and the snow squ-e-aked be-ne-ath my bo-ots as I wal-ked up the la-ne in
se-arch of Jody. Last night's storm had left an ank-le-de-ep la-yer of fresh pow-der over the we-ek-old
crust, and her tracks sto-od out sharp and cle-ar as they led away thro-ugh the ba-re ske-le-tons of
as-pen tre-es and out of sight aro-und the bend. She had go-ne to-ward the mo-un-ta-ins. I didn't ne-ed
to see her tracks to know that she had go-ne alo-ne.
Except for Jody's fo-otp-rints the-re was no sign of hu-ma-nity anyw-he-re. My bo-ots on the snow
ma-de the only so-und in the fo-rest, and the only mo-ti-on ot-her than my own was in the clo-uds that
puf-fed away be-hind me with every bre-ath. In-su-la-ted as I was in-si-de my down-fil-led co-at, I felt
an overw-hel-ming sen-se of so-li-tu-de. I knew why Jody had co-me this way. In a pla-ce that was
sup-po-sed to be empty, she wo-uldn't find her-self lo-oking for pe-op-le who we-ren't the-re.
I fo-und her sit-ting on a ra-il fen-ce, sta-ring out ac-ross a snow-co-ve-red fi-eld at the mo-un-ta-ins.
She sat on the bot-tom ra-il with her chin res-ting on her mit-te-ned hands on the top ra-il. Her
sho-ul-der-length brown ha-ir stuck out be-low a gre-en stoc-king cap. The-re we-re trenc-hes dug in
the snow whe-re she had be-en swin-ging her fe-et. She tur-ned her he-ad as I squ-e-aked up be-hind
her, sa-id, "Hi, Gre-gor," then tur-ned back to the mo-un-ta-ins. I sat down be-si-de her, prop-ping my
chin on my hands li-ke she had, and lo-oked up at them myself.
Sunlight was shi-ning full on the pe-aks, ma-king the snow-fi-elds glow bril-li-ant whi-te and gi-ving
the rocks a co-lo-ur of fal-se warmth. No tre-es grew on the-ir jag-ged flanks. They we-re not-hing but
rock and ice.
The Te-tons, I tho-ught. God's co-untry. How true that had pro-ved to be.
"I'd for-got-ten how imp-res-si-ve mo-un-ta-ins co-uld be," I sa-id, my bre-ath fros-ting the ed-ges of
my glo-ves.
"So had I," she sa-id. "It's be-en a long ti-me."
Twelve ye-ars. Fi-ve ye-ars go-ing, fi-ve ye-ars co-ming, and two ye-ars spent the-re, on a dusty
pla-net aro-und a fo-re-ign star.
She sa-id, "The-re was not-hing li-ke this on Des-si-ca."
"No gla-ci-ers. It ta-kes gla-ci-ers to car-ve up a mo-un-ta-in li-ke that."
"Hmm."
We sta-red up at the sun-lit pe-aks, each thin-king our own tho-ughts. I tho-ught abo-ut Des-si-ca.
We'd wa-ited two months af-ter lan-ding to na-me it, but the de-ci-si-on was una-ni-mo-us. Hot, dry,
with dust storms that co-uld blow for we-eks at a ti-me-if ever the-re was a Hell, that pla-ce had to be it.
But eight of us had sta-yed the-re for two ye-ars, exp-lo-ring and col-lec-ting da-ta; the first
in-ters-tel-lar ex-pe-di-ti-on at work. And then we had pac-ked up and co-me back-to an empty Earth.
Not a so-ul left anyw-he-re. Not-hing to gre-et us but wild ani-mals and aban-do-ned ci-ti-es full of
yel-lo-wed news-pa-pers, fo-ur ye-ars old.
According to tho-se pa-pers, this was whe-re Jesus had first ap-pe-ared. Not in Jeru-sa-lem, nor at
the Va-ti-can, nor even Salt La-ke City. The Grand Te-ton. Tal-lest of the ran-ge, rug-gedly be-a-uti-ful,
a fit-ting mo-nu-ment to the Son of God. I co-uld al-most see Him myself, flo-ating down from the pe-ak
and aligh-ting next to the Cha-pel of the Trans-fi-gu-ra-ti-on back by the lod-ge whe-re we'd spent the
night. Hard as it was to be-li-eve, it was easy to ima-gi-ne.
What ca-me next was the hard part. He'd ap-pa-rently gi-ven pe-op-le six days to pre-pa-re
them-sel-ves, then on the se-venth He had cal-led them all to judg-ment. No spe-ci-al call for the
fa-ith-ful, no ti-me of tri-bu-la-ti-on for the un-be-li-evers; He'd ha-uled ever-yo-ne off at on-ce,

pre-su-mably to sort them out la-ter. The news-pa-pers we-re si-lent on the met-hod He'd used, all the
re-por-ters and edi-tors and press ope-ra-tors ap-pa-rently ca-ught up in the mo-ment along with
ever-yo-ne el-se, but I co-uldn't ima-gi-ne how it had wor-ked. Most pe-op-le had ex-pec-ted to ri-se
in-to the sky; but abo-ve 15,000 fe-et they wo-uld start to asphy-xi-ate and abo-ve 40,000 or so the-ir
blo-od wo-uld bo-il. Not qu-ite the sort of thing I ima-gi-ned even the Old Tes-ta-ment God wo-uld
want His fa-ith-ful to en-du-re. Slip-ping in-to an al-ter-na-te di-men-si-on se-emed mo-re li-kely, but I
co-uldn't ima-gi-ne what that wo-uld be li-ke, eit-her.
Trying to vi-su-ali-ze the uni-ma-gi-nab-le re-min-ded me why I'd co-me lo-oking for Judy. "The
cap-ta-in's go-ing to be hol-ding ser-vi-ces in a lit-tle whi-le. She tho-ught may-be you'd li-ke to be
the-re."
Jody lo-oked over at me with an exp-res-si-on usu-al-ly re-ser-ved for a stu-pid yo-un-ger brot-her.
"Why, to pray? To try get-ting God's at-ten-ti-on?"
I nod-ded. "Da-ve tal-ked her in-to it. He fi-gu-res the mo-re of us do-ing it, the stron-ger the sig-nal."
"Very sci-en-ti-fic."
"Dave's an en-gi-ne-er. Gwen ag-re-es with him."
"I sup-po-se she's go-ing to ask God to send Jesus back for us."
"That's the ge-ne-ral idea, ye-ah," I sa-id, be-gin-ning to get em-bar-ras-sed.
She ga-ve me the lo-ok aga-in. "You don't re-al-ly think it'll work, do you?"
"It's worth a try. It can't hurt, can it?"
She la-ug-hed. "Spo-ken li-ke a true ag-nos-tic."
I shif-ted my we-ight so a knot on the fen-ce ra-il wo-uld stop po-king me in the thigh. The jo-int
whe-re the ra-il met the post squ-e-aked. "We're all ag-nos-tic," I po-in-ted out. "Or we-re." When the
mis-si-on plan-ners se-lec-ted the crew, they had wan-ted pe-op-le who ma-de de-ci-si-ons ba-sed on
the in-for-ma-ti-on at hand, not wish-ful thin-king or he-ar-say. Tho-se sort of pe-op-le ten-ded to be
ag-nos-tic.
"I still am," she sa-id.
I lo-oked at her in surp-ri-se. "How can you be? The en-ti-re po-pu-la-ti-on of the world
di-sap-pe-ars, every news-pa-per we find has sto-ri-es abo-ut the Se-cond Co-ming of
Christ-comp-le-te with pic-tu-res-and all the gra-ve-yards are empty. Do-esn't that ma-ke a be-li-ever
out of you?"
She sho-ok her he-ad and as-ked simply, "Why are we he-re?"
"What do you me-an?"
"I me-an if I'm sup-po-sed to be-li-eve that Jesus ca-me back for the se-cond ti-me, cal-led the Day
of Judg-ment and to-ok every hu-man so-ul to He-aven, then what are we do-ing he-re? Why didn't He
ta-ke us, too?"
"We we-ren't on Earth."
"Neither we-re three tho-usand Lu-nar co-lo-nists, and they got ta-ken."
"We we-re do-ing ni-nety-eight per-cent of the spe-ed of light. We we-re three and a half light-ye-ars
away."
"And so God mis-sed us. That's my po-int. If He was om-nis-ci-ent He wo-uld ha-ve known we
we-re the-re."
I'd be-en thin-king abo-ut that myself in the days sin-ce we'd be-en ho-me. "May-be
He did," I sa-id. "Huh?"
"Maybe God did know abo-ut us. May-be He left us be-hind on pur-po-se, as pu-nish-ment for not
be-li-eving in Him."
She snor-ted. What abo-ut at-he-ists, then? What abo-ut ot-her ag-nos-tics? Why just us eight?"
I held up my glo-ved hands, palms up. "I don't know. I'm not God." "If you we-re, you'd ha-ve do-ne
a bet-ter job."
I wasn't su-re whet-her to ta-ke that as a comp-li-ment or what, so I de-ci-ded to ig-no-re it. "What
do you think hap-pe-ned, then, if it wasn't God?"
"I don't know. May-be ali-ens ca-me and to-ok us all for sla-ves. May-be we we-re a lab

ex-pe-ri-ment and they got all the da-ta they ne-eded. May-be we tas-te li-ke chic-ken. The-re are
plenty of mo-re be-li-evab-le exp-la-na-ti-ons than God."
"What abo-ut the pho-tos of Jesus?" I as-ked.
She rub-bed her red no-se with a mit-ten. "If you we-re go-ing to har-vest an en-ti-re pla-net's
po-pu-la-ti-on, wo-uldn't you use the-ir lo-cal re-li-gi-on to ke-ep them in li-ne?"
"Jesus wo-uldn't ha-ve much sway with Jews," I po-in-ted out. "Or Mos-lems. Or at-he-ists."
"So says the for-mer ag-nos-tic who be-li-eves in him be-ca-use of what he re-ad in the pa-per." She
sa-id it kindly, but it still stung.
"Look," I sa-id, "Gwen's go-ing to start pretty so-on. You co-ming or not?"
She shrug-ged. "What the hell. It ought to be fun lis-te-ning to an ag-nos-tic ser-mon."
We swung our legs aro-und off the fen-ce ra-il and sto-od up, then star-ted fol-lo-wing our tracks
back to the lod-ge, an enor-mo-us log ho-tel bu-ilt aro-und the turn of the last cen-tury to ho-use the
crush of to-urists who ca-me to vi-sit one of the last uns-po-iled pla-ces on Earth.
I to-ok Jody's right hand in my left as we wal-ked. It was an un-cons-ci-o-usly na-tu-ral act; we
we-ren't a pa-ir at the mo-ment, but we had be-en a few ti-mes. With the small crew on the ship and lots
of ti-me to ex-pe-ri-ment, we had tri-ed just abo-ut every com-bi-na-ti-on at le-ast on-ce. The warmth
and com-fort I felt as we wal-ked thro-ugh the fresh snow to-get-her ma-de me glad we'd ne-ver
bro-ken up hard. It felt li-ke may-be we we-re he-aded for anot-her stretch of ti-me to-get-her.
Jody must ha-ve be-en fe-eling the sa-me way. When we got down in among the as-pen tre-es, she
sa-id, "Assu-ming God re-al-ly is be-hind all this, and it's not just so-me sort of enor-mo-us prac-ti-cal
joke, then may-be this is a re-ward."
"A re-ward?"
She nod-ded. "I li-ke it he-re. It's pretty, and pe-ace-ful. The last ti-me I was he-re it was a zoo.
To-urists whe-re-ver you lo-oked, li-nes of mo-tor ho-mes and SUVs on the ro-ad as far as you co-uld
see, trash blo-wing all aro-und. I fe-el li-ke now I'm fi-nal-ly get-ting to see it the way it's sup-po-sed to
be."
"The way God in-ten-ded?"
"Yeah, may-be." She grin-ned an ag-nos-tic-the-olo-gi-an grin and sa-id, "May-be we're the next
Ark. We we-re all set to start our own co-lony, af-ter all. We're the best ge-ne-tic stock the UN Spa-ce
Aut-ho-rity co-uld find, and we've got mo-re fer-ti-li-zed ova in the fre-ezer. May-be God de-ci-ded it
wo-uld be a go-od ti-me to cle-ar away all the riff-raff and gi-ve hu-ma-nity a fresh start."
"It's a lit-tle cold for Eden," I sa-id.
"We've got the who-le world," she po-in-ted out. '
I tho-ught abo-ut that. I sup-po-sed we did, at le-ast un-til the airp-la-nes and ho-ver-cars all fell
apart. The-re was no way eight pe-op-le co-uld ma-in-ta-in a tech-no-lo-gi-cal ci-vi-li-za-ti-on
in-de-fi-ni-tely. Our co-lo-ni-za-ti-on equ-ip-ment was de-sig-ned to ke-ep us at what the UN's so-ci-al
sci-en-tists cal-led an "arti-fi-ci-al-ly aug-men-ted in-dust-ri-al age" un-til we co-uld inc-re-ase the
po-pu-la-ti-on eno-ugh to bu-ild our own fac-to-ri-es and so forth, but that le-vel wasn't par-ti-cu-larly
cos-mo-po-li-tan. The idea had be-en to pick a spot and set-tle in rat-her than to play to-urist on a new
pla-net. Of co-ur-se the pla-net ne-eded at le-ast one ha-bi-tab-le spot, which was why we'd gi-ven up
af-ter two ye-ars of se-arc-hing and co-me ho-me.
"I'd ne-ver con-si-de-red just go-ing on with our li-ves," I sa-id. "I me-an, af-ter the Se-cond Co-ming
of Christ, that simply ne-ver oc-cur-red to me."
Jody shrug-ged. "We just lan-ded; we've all be-en too busy trying to fi-gu-re out what hap-pe-ned.
Gi-ve 'em ti-me, tho-ugh, and I think most of us will start thin-king abo-ut it. I me-an, this co-uld be all
the He-aven we ne-ed if we do it right."
A sud-den chill ran up my spi-ne, and it wasn't from the snow. "We may not ha-ve ti-me," I sa-id. "If
Gwen's lit-tle pra-yer me-eting works, God may co-me back for us to-day."
Jody lo-oked up at me, her fa-ce mir-ro-ring the con-cern in my own. "Damn," she sa-id, then she
to-ok off run-ning for the cha-pel. I to-ok off af-ter her, both of us sho-uting, "Gwen! Gwen, wa-it up!"

Running in snow isn't easy. Our fe-et punc-hed right thro-ugh the crust that had sup-por-ted us when
we'd be-en wal-king, and we wo-und up strug-gling for every step. We we-re both swe-ating and
pan-ting when we burst in-to the cha-pel, gas-ping for eno-ugh bre-ath to cry out, "Don't pray!"
Gwen was stan-ding be-hind the pul-pit, we-aring a long whi-te ro-be with gold hems a hand's width
wi-de. She'd fo-und it in a clo-set in the pri-est's sac-risty. The wall be-hind her was mostly win-dow,
af-for-ding the cong-re-ga-ti-on-Da-ve and Ma-ria and Ham-mad and Arj-una and Ke-ung in the front
pew-a fan-tas-tic vi-ew of the Te-tons be-hind her own splen-dor. Ever-yo-ne tur-ned and lo-oked at us
as Jody sa-id aga-in, "Don't pray. We've got to think this thro-ugh first."
Gwen frow-ned. "What's the-re to think thro-ugh? We've got to con-tact God."
"Do we?"
"What do you me-an? Of co-ur-se we do. He left us be-hind!"
"Maybe that's a go-od thing." Tug-ging off her mit-tens, stoc-king hat, and co-at as she tal-ked, Jody
told her what she'd told me, en-ding with, "So may-be we ought to just ke-ep qu-i-et and go on abo-ut
our bu-si-ness."
Gwen had be-en sha-king her he-ad the who-le ti-me Jody had be-en spe-aking. She was a big
wo-man, with a thick ha-lo of curly black ha-ir that wag-ged from si-de to si-de as she sho-ok it. Now
she sa-id, "We don't know what that bu-si-ness is. This co-uld just as easily be a test of so-me sort."
"Exactly! It co-uld be a test, so I think we'd be smart to be ca-re-ful what we ask for. We might get
it."
Dave had be-en lis-te-ning with as much im-pa-ti-en-ce as Gwen. Be-fo-re she co-uld ans-wer, he
sa-id, "If God in-tends for us to re-po-pu-la-te the Earth, wo-uldn't He ha-ve told us so? He told No-ah
what He wan-ted him to do."
Jody shrug-ged. "God was a lot mo-re tal-ka-ti-ve in tho-se days."
"If you be-li-eve the Judeo-Chris-ti-an bib-le," Ham-mad put in.
"The Chris-ti-an Day of Judg-ment has co-me and go-ne," Gwen sa-id. "What el-se are we
sup-po-sed to be-li-eve?"
Hammad spre-ad his hands to in-di-ca-te the cha-pel, and by imp-li-ca-ti-on everyt-hing be-yond it.
"We sho-uld be-li-eve what we ha-ve al-ways be-li-eved: the evi-den-ce of our own sen-ses. The Earth
has be-en de-po-pu-la-ted. News-pa-pers left be-hind tell us a be-ing cal-ling him-self Jesus Christ
cla-imed res-pon-si-bi-lity. Be-yond that we can only spe-cu-la-te."
"Wait a mi-nu-te" Ma-ria sa-id, but be-fo-re she had a chan-ce to fi-nish her tho-ught Arj-una sa-id,
"We can too-" and Ke-ung sa-id, "Ye-ah, what abo-ut-" and the ro-om des-cen-ded in-to bab-ble.
Gwen hadn't be-en cho-sen cap-ta-in for not-hing. She let it go on for a few se-conds, then sho-uted
at top vo-lu-me, "Qu-i-et!"
The cha-pel grew qu-i-et.
"All right," she sa-id in-to the si-len-ce. "I ob-vi-o-usly ma-de a fal-se as-sump-ti-on when I tho-ught
we all wan-ted to ask God to co-me back for us. Jody do-esn't think we sho-uld try to con-tact Him at
all. What do the rest of you think?"
A cho-rus of vo-ices ne-arly drow-ned her out aga-in. "One at a ti-me," she yel-led.
"You, Da-ve."
"I think we sho-uld ask His for-gi-ve-ness and ask Him to ta-ke us with Him."
"Hammad?"
"Ask what He wants us to do, rat-her than just as-su-me."
"Maria?"
"I…uh, I de-fi-ni-tely think we sho-uld try to con-tact Him, but I think Ham-mad kind of ma-kes
sep-se, ac-tu-al-ly." "Thank you," sa-id Ham-mad. Gwen lo-oked at me. "Gre-gor?"
I lo-oked at Ham-mad, then at Jody. "I'm not su-re it's a go-od idea to call His at-ten-ti-on to us at all.
De-pen-ding on who-se ver-si-on of Chris-ti-anity is true, we co-uld do a lot wor-se than whe-re we are
now."
"Arjuna?"
Arjuna sa-id, "I kind of ag-ree with Jody and Gre-gor, ex-cept I won-der what we'd do if God

de-ci-des to turn out the lights." "It's be-en fo-ur ye-ars," Ham-mad sa-id.
"That do-esn't me-an-" Da-ve sa-id, and the bab-ble star-ted up aga-in.
"Quiet!" sho-uted Gwen. She snatc-hed the wo-oden cross from the front of the pul-pit and ban-ged it
down li-ke a ga-vel on the ang-led top. "All right," she sa-id when we'd qu-i-eted down, "let's try this
aga-in. Ke-ung, what do you think?"
Keung shrug-ged. "I don't think it mat-ters. If we can re-ach Him with pra-yer, then one of us wo-uld
ha-ve do-ne it al-re-ady. I think if we can get His at-ten-ti-on at all, then the-re's no po-int in hi-ding out
be-ca-use He'll even-tu-al-ly re-ali-ze we're he-re."
"Is that a vo-te for or aga-inst pra-ying to Him?"
"It's an don't ca-re.'"
Gwen nod-ded. "Well then, it lo-oks li-ke the pra-yer con-tin-gent wins, but I don't see anyt-hing
wrong with as-king po-li-tely what God in-tends for us to do be-fo-re we start beg-ging for di-vi-ne
in-ter-ven-ti-on. Can we all ag-ree on that?"
"No," Jody sa-id, but Da-ve's and Ma-ria's and Ham-mad's as-sent was lo-uder.
Gwen sa-id, "Jody, Ke-ung's right; if pra-yer works, then so-me-body's bo-und to get God's
at-ten-ti-on so-oner or la-ter."
"No they're not," Jody sa-id. "The-re's mil-li-ons of guns lying aro-und, but that do-esn't me-an we
ha-ve to start sho-oting each ot-her with them. We don't ha-ve to pray."
"I do," Da-ve sa-id.
Jody sta-red at him a mo-ment, then sho-ok her he-ad and pic-ked up her co-at and hat and mit-tens
aga-in. "I'll wa-it out-si-de, then," she sa-id, brus-hing past me to-ward the do-or. "May-be He'll miss
me aga-in when he co-mes for you idi-ots."
I fol-lo-wed her out. I hadn't ta-ken my co-at off, just un-zip-ped it; the cold air felt go-od thro-ugh
my shirt.
"Idiots," Jody sa-id aga-in when we we-re alo-ne. "They're pla-ying with dyna-mi-te in the-re.
Wor-se. An-ti-mat-ter."
"Maybe li-te-ral-ly," I sa-id. "Who knows what God might be ma-de of?"
"Aaahhh, God, God, God," she grow-led. "I'm sick of the who-le su-bj-ect. I wish He'd just sta-yed
the hell out of my li-fe."
I po-ked a fin-ger in her ribs. "He did, silly."
"It's not funny."
"Sure it is. We've spent our who-le li-ves sa-ying it didn't mat-ter what we tho-ught or did abo-ut
re-li-gi-on, sin-ce the truth is in-he-rently unk-no-wab-le, and now we're af-ra-id so-me-body is go-ing
to pray us out of exis-ten-ce. I think it's hi-la-ri-o-us."
We we-re wal-king back to-ward the gu-est lod-ge along a path sur-ro-un-ded by pi-ne tre-es and
snow banks. On im-pul-se I re-ac-hed up and slap-ped a branch just as Jody wal-ked un-der it. "Yow!"
she scre-amed as a clump of snow went down her neck, and be-fo-re I co-uld back out of ran-ge she
bent down, sco-oped up a hand-ful, and hur-led it at my fa-ce. I stumb-led back-ward and sat down
unex-pec-tedly in a snow bank, which sa-ved me from anot-her fa-ce-ful that flew over my he-ad
ins-te-ad.
As long as I was on the gro-und I fi-gu-red I might as well de-fend myself, so I star-ted thro-wing
snow back at her as fast as I co-uld sco-op it up. It was too cold to stick in-to balls, so we just
sho-vel-led it at each ot-her, shri-eking and la-ug-hing li-ke fo-ols whi-le the rest of hu-ma-nity pra-yed
for a mi-rac-le.
The pra-yer me-eting bro-ke up a half ho-ur or so la-ter. By then Jody and I we-re snug-gling on the
be-ar rug in front of the lod-ge's ma-in fi-rep-la-ce, an enor-mo-us flags-to-ne const-ruc-ti-on with a
fi-re-box big eno-ugh to ro-ast a ho-ver car in. Ham-mad fo-und us first.
"We se-em to ha-ve fa-iled in ra-ising the de-ity," he sa-id as he strip-ped off his co-at and hung it
over a peg on the wall. "Unless of co-ur-se the-re's a ti-me-lag in-vol-ved."
"Oh gre-at," sa-id Jody. "Now I'll be wa-iting all night for the ski-es to open and a cho-ir of an-gels to

wa-ke me up."
"By the lo-oks of you two, you won't be sle-eping much in the first pla-ce, un-less it's from
ex-ha-us-ti-on." He sat down in one of the overs-tuf-fed cha-irs be-si-de us and stuck his fe-et to-ward
the fla-mes. "You know, I think you ha-ve the right of it," he sa-id. "We sho-uld get on with our li-ves,
and let God get on with His. I ha-ve to ad-mit I fe-el gre-atly re-li-eved to ha-ve mis-sed all the
com-mo-ti-on."
"Me too," I sa-id. "Ever sin-ce we fo-und out He exists, I've felt li-ke an out-si-der in gang ter-ri-tory.
I ke-ep wa-iting for the tap on the sho-ul-der that me-ans I'm in big tro-ub-le."
"I won-der if that's how re-li-gi-o-us pe-op-le nor-mal-ly get thro-ugh li-fe so they wo-uldn't at-tract
the wrong kind of at-ten-ti-on."
Hammad sho-ok his he-ad. "I do-ubt if most pe-op-le even con-si-de-red it that way. They
pro-bably-"
The so-lid wo-od do-or ban-ged open and Da-ve, Gwen, and the ot-hers ca-me in, stom-ping snow
from the-ir bo-ots and tal-king. Da-ve gla-red at Jody and me and to-ok off for his ro-om or
so-mew-he-re, but Gwen, Ma-ria, Arj-una, and Ke-ung to-ok off the-ir co-ats and jo-ined us by the
fi-re.
"Well, at le-ast we can say we tri-ed," Gwen sa-id as she pre-sen-ted her back-si-de to the fla-mes.
She had left the ro-be in the cha-pel and was we-aring a re-gu-lar shirt and pants.
"So what now?" as-ked Jody. "Tra-vel? Sight-see? Play with the lef-to-ver toys be-fo-re they all rust
back in-to the gro-und? Or do we get stra-ight to work star-ting a co-lony?"
Arjuna sa-id, "No of-fen-se, but af-ter twel-ve ye-ars of clo-se con-tact with you guys I'm re-ady for
so-me ti-me alo-ne."
Keung ed-ged play-ful-ly away from her, but he sa-id, "My sen-ti-ments exactly. I wo-uldn't mind
ha-ving a who-le con-ti-nent to myself for a whi-le."
Maria lo-oked shoc-ked. "Wa-it a mi-nu-te. Split-ting up co-uld me-an so-me of us might get left
be-hind aga-in if God co-mes back."
"He's not co-ming back," Ke-ung sa-id.
"What ma-kes you so su-re?"
He shrug-ged. "I'm not, ac-tu-al-ly, but I didn't spend my who-le li-fe dis-re-gar-ding the is-sue just to
start wor-rying abo-ut it now. If He co-mes for me, He co-mes, and if not, that's fi-ne too. I've got plenty
to do on my own."
"That's kind of how I fe-el abo-ut it," I sa-id. "I'd li-ke to see the world a lit-tle whi-le I've got the
chan-ce."
"Me too," sa-id Jody.
Gwen tur-ned aro-und to fa-ce the fi-re, sa-ying over her sho-ul-der, "The sa-tel-li-te pho-ne system
still works, so it sho-uldn't be too hard to stay in to-uch. The-re's hund-reds of cell pho-nes right he-re in
the ho-tel, and I'll bet at le-ast so-me of them still ha-ve ac-ti-ve ac-co-unts, pa-id auto-ma-ti-cal-ly
every month by cre-dit card. It sho-uldn't be hard to find a wor-king pho-ne for each of us. Of co-ur-se
we don't all ha-ve to play to-urist. Who-ever wants to co-uld start set-ting up the co-lony."
"Where?" Ham-mad as-ked.
"The Me-di-ter-ra-ne-an," Arj-una sa-id, just as I sa-id, "Ca-li-for-nia." We lo-oked at each ot-her
for a mo-ment, then I shrug-ged and sa-id, "Okay, the Me-di-ter-ra-ne-an." A sharp bang so-un-ded
from the back of the lod-ge.
"That so-un-ded li-ke a gun," Gwen sa-id, and she to-ok off run-ning down the hal-lway, sho-uting,
"Da-ve! Da-ve!" the who-le way. The rest of us fol-lo-wed clo-se be-hind her, but I to-ok the ti-me to
grab the fi-rep-la-ce po-ker. May-be he'd com-mit-ted su-ici-de and may-be he hadn't. A po-ker wasn't
much of a we-apon aga-inst a gun, but it felt bet-ter than not-hing.
We fo-und Da-ve out-si-de on the deck over-lo-oking the Sna-ke Ri-ver, a shot-gun in his hand and
a mess of fe-at-hers and blo-od sme-ared ac-ross the snow. I co-uld see bird se-ed among the
fe-at-hers; evi-dently Da-ve had scat-te-red a hand-ful and wa-ited for so-met-hing to co-me for it. That
so-met-hing had be-en hardly big-ger than a mo-use by the lo-oks of its re-ma-ins.

"Kind of small for din-ner, isn't it?" I as-ked, re-ac-hing out with the po-ker and flip-ping the tiny bird
body over so I co-uld see its un-der-si-de.
"It's an ex-pe-ri-ment," Da-ve sa-id. I was glad to see he was ca-re-ful-ly po-in-ting the shot-gun
away from ever-yo-ne. "Accor-ding to Jesus, not even a spar-row can fall wit-ho-ut God no-ti-cing. I
fi-gu-red that wo-uld be pretty easy to test."
Jody had co-me up be-si-de me and was exa-mi-ning the bird. "It wo-uld be if you'd ma-na-ged to
sho-ot a spar-row," she sa-id. "This is a chic-ka-dee."
Dave blus-hed when we all la-ug-hed, but he sa-id, "It's not the spe-ci-es; it's the con-cept."
"Whatever, it do-esn't se-em to be wor-king."
"Maybe you sho-uld ha-ve ti-ed a mes-sa-ge to its fo-ot first," I sa-id.
Keung la-ug-hed. "You're sup-po-sed to use a pi-ge-on for that."
"It's not funny," Da-ve snap-ped. He to-ok a de-ep bre-ath, then sa-id, "I am trying to at-tract the
at-ten-ti-on of God. If you think it's funny or use-less, I'm sorry, but I think it's im-por-tant and I'm
go-ing to try everyt-hing I can un-til I get the job do-ne."
"What's next?" Gwen as-ked him. "Sac-ri-fi-cing she-ep? Re-bu-il-ding the Ark of the
Covenant?"
"Whatever is ne-ces-sary," Da-ve sa-id.
I felt myself shi-ve-ring, and when it didn't stop I sud-denly re-ali-zed all of us but Da-ve we-re out
the-re wit-ho-ut our co-ats.
"Come on," I sa-id to Jody. "Let's get in-si-de be-fo-re we catch our de-ath."
We left the next mor-ning for Yel-lows-to-ne Park. The rest of the crew split up for ot-her parts of the
glo-be, but Jody and I de-ci-ded as long as we we-re that clo-se we might as well vi-sit the big-gest
to-urist at-trac-ti-on in the world. We fo-und a ho-ver car that still ran and who-se di-ag-nos-tics told us
it wo-uld con-ti-nue to run for anot-her few hund-red ho-urs, tos-sed our per-so-nal be-lon-gings in the
back, and flew low up the Sna-ke Ri-ver val-ley past Jack-son La-ke and in-to the park. We ig-no-red
the lo-ading ramps and the ra-il cars that had fer-ri-ed to-urists thro-ugh for the last fifty ye-ars, blo-wing
right past the sign proc-la-iming it a fe-de-ral cri-me to dri-ve a pri-va-te ve-hic-le wit-hin the park's
bor-ders.
The fo-rest se-emed end-less. We flew along the old ro-ad-bed down among the tre-es so we co-uld
see mo-re of it, inc-lu-ding the ani-mals the park was fa-mo-us for. In parts of the world whe-re the
hu-man po-pu-la-ti-on had be-en den-ser, the ecosys-tem was still out of whack from our sud-den
di-sap-pe-aran-ce, but Yel-lows-to-ne had al-re-ady re-ac-hed a ba-lan-ce wit-ho-ut us be-fo-re the
Se-cond Co-ming. We watc-hed mo-ose and elk and buf-fa-lo plod-ding along li-ke gre-at ho-ofed
snowp-lo-ughs, and we even ca-ught a glimp-se of a wolf drin-king out of a stre-am ne-ar Old Fa-ith-ful.
The gey-sers we-re pro-bably the sa-me as al-ways, too, but with just the two of us stan-ding the-re
on the snow-co-ve-red bo-ard-walk in front of Old Fa-ith-ful it se-emed to me that we must be
watc-hing its best erup-ti-on ever. Ste-am and bo-iling wa-ter shot up over a hund-red fe-et in the air,
and the gro-und sho-ok with the for-ce of its erup-ti-on.
"You know," Jody sa-id as it sub-si-ded, "I just re-ali-zed how silly it is to co-me he-re right now."
"Silly how?" I as-ked.
"If Da-ve suc-ce-eds in re-ac-hing God, we might ha-ve all of eter-nity to watch this sort of thing in
ac-ti-on."
I lo-oked out at the ste-aming mo-und of red-dish rock, then at the bril-li-ant whi-te snow-fi-eld and
gre-en fo-rest be-yond it. "You tal-king abo-ut the pretty parts, or the hot parts?" "Who knows?"
Yeah, who knew? I'd li-ved a per-fectly mo-ral li-fe, by ag-nos-tic stan-dards, but who co-uld tell if
that wo-uld be go-od eno-ugh for God? For that mat-ter, who knew whet-her He-aven or Hell re-al-ly
exis-ted, even now? So Jesus had co-me and ta-ken ever-yo-ne away; he co-uld ha-ve ha-uled them to
And-ro-me-da for all we knew.
All the sa-me, I won-de-red if we we-re wi-se for le-aving Da-ve free to pur-sue God. The crew had
tal-ked abo-ut it be-fo-re we'd go-ne our se-pa-ra-te ways, but no-ne of us knew what el-se we co-uld

do abo-ut him. He wo-uldn't rest un-til he'd tri-ed everyt-hing he co-uld think of, and no-ne of us
wan-ted to at-tempt con-fi-ning him to pre-vent it. I sup-po-se af-ter the pra-yer me-eting and the
chic-ka-dee in-ci-dent no-ne of us re-al-ly be-li-eved he wo-uld suc-ce-ed, which was why we we-ren't
mo-re con-cer-ned abo-ut it. We we-re all ho-ping he'd gi-ve it up af-ter a whi-le and be-co-me the
nor-mal-if so-mew-hat ob-ses-si-ve-fri-end and crew-mem-ber we'd all le-ar-ned to li-ve with.
We re-ali-zed we'd ma-de a mis-ta-ke when Gwen got a call from him a few days la-ter. She had
for-mal-ly re-no-un-ced her tit-le as cap-ta-in and flown to Ha-wa-ii, but she was still ac-ting as our
co-or-di-na-tor. Da-ve had cal-led to find out whe-re the rest of us we-re, and when she'd as-ked him
why, he wo-uld only tell her to warn us away from Che-yen-ne, Wyo-ming, or any pla-ce down-wind of
it.
"Downwind?" I as-ked when Gwen cal-led us to re-lay his mes-sa-ge. "What the hell is he trying this
ti-me?" *
Jody and I we-re in the car aga-in, he-aded north to-ward Mam-moth hot springs. A ghost of Gwen's
fa-ce pe-ered at us thro-ugh the pho-ne's he-ads-up winds-hi-eld disp-lay. "He wo-uldn't tell me," she
rep-li-ed. "He just sa-id to ke-ep ever-yo-ne away from the Ame-ri-can Mid-west for a whi-le."
"I bet he's go-ing to blow up a nuc-le-ar bomb," Jody sa-id. "Che-yen-ne's one of the Air For-ce
ba-ses whe-re they sto-red them."
"A nuc-le-ar bomb?" as-ked Gwen. "What do-es that ha-ve to do with God?"
I la-ug-hed. "May-be he thinks we just ne-ed to knock lo-ud eno-ugh to be he-ard."
"Yeah, but whe-re's the do-or?" Jody as-ked. "Cer-ta-inly not in Che-yen-ne. I've be-en the-re; it's a
dirty lit-tle go-vern-ment town out on the pra-irie."
My smi-le fa-ded. "If physi-cal lo-ca-ti-on mat-ters at all, I'd gu-ess the Grand Te-ton,
"He wo-uldn't nu-ke the Te-tons, wo-uld he?" Jody as-ked, hor-ri-fi-ed at the tho-ught.
"I don't know," Gwen sa-id. "Pro-bably not for his first shot, at le-ast. He'll pro-bably just lob one
in-to Neb-ras-ka or so-mew-he-re. But if that do-esn't work, then he might."
We'd be-en pas-sing thro-ugh a long stra-ight notch cut in an oce-an of lod-ge po-le pi-ne; I let off the
throt-tle and the ho-ver car slid to a stop, snow bil-lo-wing up all aro-und it. "We're still in
Yel-lows-to-ne," I told Gwen, "but we co-uld get to Che-yen-ne in-what, fo-ur ho-urs? Fi-ve?" We'd
be-en dawd-ling along on gro-und-effect un-til now, but we co-uld fly as high as we li-ked if we had to.
"I don't know if that's a go-od idea or not," Gwen sa-id. "I don't li-ke the idea of you two he-ading
to-ward a nuc-le-ar exp-lo-si-on."
"I don't exactly li-ke it eit-her," I sa-id, "but I'm even less happy abo-ut the idea of him blo-wing up an
en-ti-re mo-un-ta-in ran-ge just to get God's at-ten-ti-on."
"And scre-wing up the ecosys-tem just as it's star-ting to stra-igh-ten out aga-in," Jody put in.
Snow had qu-it swir-ling aro-und us. The car's fans had blown it all away. I til-ted the joys-tick to the
si-de un-til the car pi-vo-ted half-way aro-und, then pul-led up-ward on it and sho-ved it for-ward
aga-in. The car ro-se up abo-ve the tre-es and be-gan ac-ce-le-ra-ting so-ut-he-ast.
I sa-id, "Che-yen-ne it-self sho-uld be sa-fe eno-ugh. That's whe-re Da-ve will be, af-ter all. Do you
think we sho-uld call and let him know we're co-ming, or sho-uld we try to catch him off gu-ard?"
"He'll just hi-de if we tell him we're co-ming," Jody sa-id.
"But he might not blow the bomb if we ma-ke him think you're ne-ar the blast zo-ne," Gwen sa-id.
"Might not?" I as-ked. "Just how far aro-und the bend do you fi-gu-re he's go-ne?"
"Maybe not at all," Gwen sa-id. "I don't know. This is a very emo-ti-onal-ly char-ged is-sue for all of
us. I do-ubt if any of us are be-ha-ving en-ti-rely ra-ti-onal-ly, but how can we tell if we are or we aren't?
We're on comp-le-tely new gro-und he-re."
"I don't think exp-lo-ding a nuc-le-ar bomb is a ra-ti-onal act," Jody sa-id.
"Not even if he suc-ce-eds in get-ting God to no-ti-ce us?"
"Especially not then."
Gwen smi-led wryly. "That's not en-ti-rely ra-ti-onal eit-her, Jody."
"It's the way I fe-el."

"And Da-ve no do-ubt fe-els he has to get God to co-me back for him." "No do-ubt. Well I fe-el li-ke
I ha-ve to stop him."
Nodding, Gwen sa-id, "Just don't get yo-ur-self kil-led in the pro-cess."
Jody la-ug-hed. "That wo-uld kind of de-fe-at the pur-po-se, now, wo-uldn't it?"
We we-re flying over a winds-wept ba-sin abo-ut a hund-red ki-lo-met-res north-west of Che-yen-ne
when we saw the mush-ro-om clo-ud pe-ek up over the ho-ri-zon.
For a se-cond I was too stun-ned to mo-ve, watc-hing the way the shock wa-ve ra-ced in-ward in a
sphe-ri-cal shell and how the sur-fa-ce of the clo-ud ro-iled and chur-ned in-si-de it. Then,
re-mem-be-ring whe-re we we-re, I sho-uted, "Christ!" and yan-ked the emer-gency des-cent hand-le
un-der the dash-bo-ard. It was the first ti-me I'd ever do-ne that in a car; the air bags blos-so-ming out
of the do-ors and ro-of and dash slam-med me back in the se-at and comp-le-tely bloc-ked my vi-ew
for ten or fif-te-en ter-rif-ying se-conds whi-le the auto-ma-tic lan-ding se-qu-en-ce to-ok over and
drop-ped us li-ke a rock. We bob-bed on-ce, hard, li-ke a cork smac-king in-to wa-ter, then set-tled
with a crunch on the gro-und. The air bags suc-ked back in-si-de the-ir cub-byho-les and I fell for-ward
aga-inst the dash. We we-re lis-ting at abo-ut a thirty-deg-ree ang-le to-ward the front.
Jody had ca-ught her-self with her hands be-fo-re she fell for-ward. She lo-oked out the win-dow and
sa-id, "We're sit-ting on a sa-geb-rush."
I lo-oked out my si-de. Su-re eno-ugh, a gnar-led, knobby lit-tle bush was hol-ding the re-ar end of
the car in the air. Not a go-od po-si-ti-on to be in when the shock wa-ve rol-led over us. I star-ted the
mo-tor and lif-ted the joys-tick to ra-ise us off it, and with a so-und li-ke ice cu-bes in a blen-der the car
chop-ped the bush to shreds, blo-wing blue-gray bits of fo-li-age everyw-he-re and sen-ding an
eye-wa-te-ring burst of sa-ge smell in thro-ugh the vents. We lif-ted up, tho-ugh, and the wind sho-ved
us for-ward a few me-ters be-fo-re I co-uld set us back down aga-in. We sat the-re watc-hing the
clo-ud ri-se and wa-ited for the blast to re-ach us.
And wa-ited, and wa-ited. The wind shif-ted a lit-tle, then shif-ted back, and af-ter a whi-le we
re-ali-zed we we-ren't go-ing to fe-el anyt-hing mo-re this far away so I ca-uti-o-usly to-ok us up a few
me-ters and star-ted flying so-ut-he-ast aga-in. The car had pic-ked up a bad vib-ra-ti-on from the
sa-geb-rush, but it still flew.
The mush-ro-om clo-ud blew east-ward in front of us as we ap-pro-ac-hed, the wind at dif-fe-rent
al-ti-tu-des slowly te-aring it apart. We we-re mo-ving fas-ter than the wind, tho-ugh, and as we
ap-pro-ac-hed it we re-ali-zed the bomb co-uldn't ha-ve go-ne off very far out of Che-yen-ne.
Jody lo-oked at me with a wor-ri-ed exp-res-si-on. "I tho-ught Gwen sa-id he'd lob one in-to
Neb-ras-ka."
I was star-ting to worry, too. "May-be it went off in the la-unch tu-be."
"We'd bet-ter call and see if he's okay."
I didn't want to blow our chan-ces of surp-ri-sing him, but if he was hurt I sup-po-sed we sho-uld
know it. "Okay," I sa-id, and Jody di-al-led his num-ber.
When it rang half a do-zen ti-mes wit-ho-ut an ans-wer I be-gan wor-rying in ear-nest, but then the
pho-ne disp-lay flic-ke-red on and his fa-ce ap-pe-ared be-fo-re us. "Da-ve he-re," he sa-id.
Jody put on a stern exp-res-si-on. "God cal-led, and He told me to tell you to knock it off."
For just a mo-ment, I co-uld see ho-pe blos-som in Da-ve's fa-ce. Then he scow-led and sa-id, "Very
funny. Did you call just to ha-rass me or do you ha-ve so-met-hing im-por-tant to say?"
"We cal-led to see if you we-re okay. That blast lo-oked li-ke it was pretty clo-se to town."
"It was in town," sa-id Da-ve."At the Air For-ce ba-se, any-way, which is pretty much the sa-me
thing. No-ne of the roc-kets we-re in sha-pe to fly, so I just blew one of the mis-si-les in pla-ce."
"Where we-re you?" I as-ked.
Dave la-ug-hed. "Co-lo-ra-do Springs. NO-RAD cont-rol. I've got a half mi-le of mo-un-ta-in over
my he-ad right now, in ca-se you we-re thin-king of trying to stop me."
In a te-asing vo-ice, Jody sa-id, "Aren't you af-ra-id God will miss you aga-in?"
Dave sho-ok his he-ad. "You wo-uldn't be-li-eve the spy net-work they've got he-re. I've got

sa-tel-li-te sur-ve-il-lan-ce all over the world. If He shows up I'll know it, and I'll set off anot-her one
clo-ser to ho-me. He'll know I'm he-re."
And so did we, now. I ang-led the car stra-ight so-uth.
"Have you ever con-si-de-red how God might fe-el abo-ut nuc-le-ar bombs?" Jody as-ked him.
"Dest-ro-ying so much of His han-di-work all at on-ce might ma-ke Him mad."
"It's a risk I'm wil-ling to ta-ke," Da-ve sa-id.
"But you're ta-king it for all of us, and I'm not wil-ling."
"Not now," Da-ve sa-id, "but you'll thank me when I suc-ce-ed."
"And what if you don't? No-ne of us are go-ing to thank you for blo-wing a bunch of fal-lo-ut in-to the
air. We're go-ing to ha-ve to li-ve he-re, Da-ve. You too, pro-bably."
He la-ug-hed. "That's what the en-vi-ron-men-ta-lists tho-ught. So they qu-it cut-ting the fo-rests and
bur-ning fos-sil fu-els, and all for what? The en-vi-ron-men-ta-lists are go-ne and the fo-rests and the
fos-sil fu-els are still he-re. It was a comp-le-te was-te."
I co-uld hardly be-li-eve my ears. "You re-al-ly be-li-eve that?"
"I re-al-ly do."
"Then you're a lot wor-se off than I tho-ught."
His eyes nar-ro-wed. "Ah, why am I even tal-king to you?" He re-ac-hed for-ward, and his ima-ge
flic-ked out.
Jody lo-oked over at me. "I don't think sub-du-ing him's go-ing to be easy. If he's in the NO-RAD
com-mand cent-re, then I don't know if we'll even be ab-le to get to him."
"We'll fi-gu-re out so-met-hing when we get the-re," I sa-id. I was trying to con-vin-ce myself as well
as her. I didn't ha-ve any idea what we'd do, but what el-se co-uld we do but try?
Thin as our plans we-re, the car put an unex-pec-ted twist in them just so-uth of the
Wyo-ming-Co-lo-ra-do bor-der. The vib-ra-ti-on in the re-ar fans had be-en get-ting ste-adily wor-se,
and I'd bro-ught us down clo-ser to the gro-und to re-du-ce the stra-in on them, ho-ping to ma-ke it to
anot-her city be-fo-re they di-ed comp-le-tely, but we we-re still qu-ite a ways north of Fort Col-lins
when the right one ga-ve up with a shri-ek and the car drop-ped on that si-de, hit the gro-und, then
sle-wed half-way aro-und and flip-ped comp-le-tely over. The air bags who-os-hed out to hold us in
pla-ce aga-in, but the one in front of Jody burst with a bang and I he-ard her shri-ek in surp-ri-se as she
fell he-ad first in-to the winds-hi-eld.
"Jody!" I fo-ught to re-ach her over the bags still hol-ding me in pla-ce. We skid-ded to a stop, but
with the car up-si-de down they def-la-ted slowly, so we wo-uldn't fall to the ro-of and bre-ak our
necks. I ma-na-ged to squ-e-eze out thro-ugh the gap bet-we-en the one in front of me and the one
bet-we-en the se-ats. Jody lay in the hol-low ma-de by the ro-of and the cur-ved winds-hi-eld, her fa-ce
blo-ody from a gash in her fo-re-he-ad. She was gro-ping for so-met-hing to pull her-self up aga-inst.
My first tho-ught was that she sho-uld lie flat in ca-se she'd hurt her neck or spi-ne, but then I
re-ali-zed the-re wasn't eno-ugh spa-ce for that and she'd pro-bably be bet-ter off sit-ting up-right
any-way. I to-ok her hand in mi-ne and hel-ped her twist aro-und un-til she co-uld sit on the ro-of. The
se-ats we-re just over our he-ads. "Is anyt-hing bro-ken?" I as-ked as I lo-oked in the gap bet-we-en
se-ats and flo-or for a me-di-cal kit.
"I don't know." She fle-xed her arms and legs, then sa-id, "Do-esn't fe-el li-ke it." She held a hand to
her fo-re-he-ad to ke-ep the blo-od out of her eyes whi-le she blin-ked to cle-ar them. "Both eyes are
okay," she sa-id af-ter a mo-ment. Her vo-ice was a lit-tle slur-red but comp-le-tely calm, the re-sult of
ye-ars of tra-ining for emer-gen-ci-es.
I co-uldn't find a me-di-cal kit, so I to-re a strip of cloth from my shirt and used that to sop up the
blo-od from her wo-und. She win-ced when I blot-ted her cut with it, but I was glad to see musc-le
ins-te-ad of bo-ne be-fo-re the blo-od wel-led up aga-in.
"I think you'll li-ve," I sa-id, trying not to let her he-ar the worry in my vo-ice. Her inj-uri-es pro-bably
wo-uldn't kill her, but a night out-si-de in Co-lo-ra-do in the win-ter-ti-me just might. I bent down so I
co-uld lo-ok out the win-dows. The Sun was still fa-irly high over the mo-un-ta-ins. We had a co-up-le

of ho-urs of day-light left, but I co-uldn't see any ho-uses and I didn't know how far we co-uld walk to
find one. The wind wasn't as strong he-re as it had be-en fart-her north, but it was still blo-wing hard
eno-ugh to drop the chill fac-tor by twenty deg-re-es or so. It was al-re-ady suc-king the he-at out of the
car.
Jody had be-en thin-king along the sa-me li-nes. "All of a sud-den I'm not so happy the world's
empty," she sa-id.
"We're not in tro-ub-le yet," I told her. "For one thing, the world's not empty." I flic-ked on the car's
pho-ne, di-al-led up-si-de down, and wa-ited, ho-ping the trans-mit-ter co-uld ma-ke con-tact with its
an-ten-na un-der-ne-ath us.
"Who are you cal-ling?" Jody as-ked. "Da-ve?"
"That's right. He's the only one anyw-he-re clo-se to us."
"What ma-kes you think he'll help us?"
"I don't know if he will or not. But it can't hurt to ask."
We wa-ited for ten or fif-te-en se-conds whi-le the pho-ne tri-ed to ma-ke a con-nec-ti-on. Fi-nal-ly
we saw a flic-ke-ring, snowy phan-tom on the winds-hi-eld, and Da-ve's vo-ice, shot thro-ugh with
sta-tic, sa-id, "What now?"
"This is Gre-gor," I sa-id. "We've be-en in a wreck just north of Fort Col-lins. Jody's be-en hurt. Can
you co-me get us?"
His up-si-de-down fa-ce lo-oked us over sus-pi-ci-o-usly. "This is a trick to get me out of he-re."
"No it's not," Jody sa-id. "He-re, ha-ve a lo-ok." She bent down to-ward the ca-me-ra eye and to-ok
the blo-od-so-aked rag from her fo-re-he-ad. Da-ve's exp-res-si-on grew a lit-tle mo-re sympat-he-tic,
but not eno-ugh.
"Sorry," he sa-id. "You got yo-ur-sel-ves in-to this, you can get yo-ur-sel-ves out."
I sa-id, "Da-ve, we're not just as-king a fa-vo-ur. We co-uld die of ex-po-su-re out he-re."
"Quit be-ing me-lod-ra-ma-tic. You're re-so-ur-ce-ful-" His ima-ge bro-ke up for a se-cond, then
ca-me back."-must ha-ve bro-ught co-ats and hats and stuff."
"We're in an up-si-de-down car in the mid-dle of now-he-re and you're tel-ling us to put on our
co-ats? Damn it, Jody's inj-ured! We ne-ed to get her to a hos-pi-tal and see if she's bro-ken anyt-hing.
She co-uld ha-ve in-ter-nal inj-uri-es."
It was hard to re-ad his exp-res-si-on in the snowy, up-si-de-down ima-ge. I tho-ught he was
scow-ling, then for a bri-ef mo-ment the scowl re-ver-sed it-self. "All right," he sa-id. "I'll co-me. It'll
ta-ke me a whi-le to get out of the mo-un-ta-in, and an ho-ur or two mo-re to get up the-re and find you.
Just sit tight." Then be-fo-re eit-her of us co-uld say anyt-hing mo-re, he switc-hed off.
I tho-ught for a mo-ment abo-ut his sud-den ca-pi-tu-la-ti-on. I didn't li-ke the fe-el of it, and pretty
so-on I re-ali-zed why.
"The bas-tard isn't go-ing to co-me."
Jody lo-oked aro-und at me sharply. "What? He just sa-id-" "He wants us to think he's co-ming, but
he's go-ing to wa-it for us to die of ex-po-su-re. Think abo-ut it. What bet-ter way to get God's
at-ten-ti-on than to send a co-up-le of free so-uls to go knock on He-aven's ga-tes for him?"
"But…he…wo-uld he do that?"
"Sure he wo-uld. He just sa-id so. It's go-ing to ta-ke him a 'whi-le' to get out of the mo-un-ta-in, and
a whi-le' to fly up he-re, and a 'whi-le' lon-ger to find us. He'll ma-ke su-re it ta-kes a long whi-le, so
when he gets he-re he can ho-nestly say he tri-ed to res-cue us, but he was just too la-te."
She sho-ok her he-ad. "No, I don't think he'd do that."
"I do. I'm not wa-iting aro-und to find out the hard way."
"What are you go-ing to do?"
I re-ac-hed un-der the se-ats in-to the back for our co-ats. As I hel-ped Jody in-to hers, I sa-id, "I'm
go-ing to walk to-ward Fort Col-lins and see if I can find a ho-use or anot-her car that works. I won't go
any fart-her than I can walk back be-fo-re dark."
She tho-ught abo-ut it, then sa-id, "All right. Whi-le you're do-ing that I'll call Gwen and see who el-se
might be ab-le to co-me get us."

"Good." I pul-led on my co-at and hat and glo-ves, then ope-ned the win-dow and slid out on-to the
fro-zen gro-und. A cold blast of air swir-led snow in-si-de. I le-aned in to gi-ve Jody a kiss, then
bac-ked away and ma-de su-re she clo-sed the win-dow tight be-fo-re I sto-od up.
The car was a dark ob-long aga-inst whi-te snow; I wo-uldn't ha-ve much tro-ub-le fin-ding it aga-in if
I got back be-fo-re dark. I star-ted off to-ward whe-re I ho-ped town wo-uld be, tur-ning back
pe-ri-odi-cal-ly to ma-ke su-re I co-uld spot the car aga-in un-til the slo-pe of the land hid it from vi-ew.
The Co-lo-ra-do fo-ot-hil-ls didn't ha-ve ne-arly as much snow as Yel-lows-to-ne, but the-re was
eno-ugh to le-ave a pretty go-od set of tracks. It wo-uld ta-ke a few ho-urs for them to fill in, so I wasn't
that wor-ri-ed. I trud-ged along, hands in poc-kets and he-ad til-ted to the si-de to ke-ep the wind from
blo-wing down my neck, lo-oking for any sign of ci-vi-li-za-ti-on.
As I wal-ked, 1 re-ali-zed how much I was go-ing to ha-te li-ving a pri-mi-ti-ve li-fe when all the
mac-hi-nery star-ted fal-ling apart. By the ti-me I was an old man, I'd pro-bably be wal-king
everyw-he-re I went. I might even be bur-ning wo-od for he-at, de-pen-ding on how long the co-lony's
po-wer plant las-ted. No won-der Da-ve was so des-pe-ra-te to ha-ve God co-me back for him.
I tho-ught abo-ut Jody wa-iting for me in the car, pos-sibly dying of inj-uri-es or ex-po-su-re be-fo-re
I got back. At the mo-ment I didn't mind the idea of a God watc-hing over us, eit-her, pro-vi-ded He'd
ac-tu-al-ly do so-met-hing to help if we ne-eded it. Even if He wo-uldn't-or co-uldn't-ke-ep her ali-ve,
the idea that I might so-me-how jo-in her aga-in af-ter we both di-ed was at le-ast a lit-tle com-fort. Not
much, be-ca-use I co-uld ne-ver be su-re it wo-uld hap-pen un-til it did, but the pos-si-bi-lity might
ke-ep me go-ing for a whi-le.
It ca-me to me then that if Jody di-ed, I co-uld easily jo-in Da-ve in his qu-est. But she wasn't go-ing
to die. All I ne-eded was to find so-me shel-ter and we'd both be fi-ne.
I even-tu-al-ly spot-ted what I was lo-oking for down in a gent-le val-ley: a ho-use and barn set in
among a stand of tall, ba-re cot-ton-wo-od tre-es. The-re we-re a co-up-le of ve-hic-les par-ked out
front and a long, win-ding ro-ad le-ading down to them from a high-way off to my left. I kept go-ing
cross-co-untry stra-ight for it.
It was fart-her away than it lo-oked, but I ma-de it just as the Sun to-uc-hed the mo-un-ta-ins. The
ho-use was un-loc-ked, so I didn't ha-ve to bre-ak in. It was al-so un-he-ated, but it felt won-der-ful
com-pa-red to out-si-de. I tri-ed to call Jody on my cell pho-ne, but when I ope-ned it up the scre-en
had a big crack in it and it fa-iled to light. I had ap-pa-rently lan-ded on it in the crash. The ho-use
pho-ne was de-ad, too; no surp-ri-se af-ter fo-ur ye-ars of we-at-her li-ke this. But I fo-und a ho-ok by
the back do-or with a set of keys dang-ling from it, so I to-ok them out-si-de and tri-ed them in the
ve-hic-les.
There was a ho-ver car and a fo-ur-whe-eler pic-kup truck in the dri-ve-way. The ho-ver car was as
de-ad as the pho-ne, but the pic-kup lurc-hed for-ward when I tur-ned the key. I pus-hed in the clutch
and tri-ed aga-in, and was re-war-ded with the whi-ne of a flywhe-el win-ding up to spe-ed. The po-wer
ga-uge re-ad low, but I didn't think I'd ne-ed much just to re-ach Jody and co-me back.
While the flywhe-el spun up I chec-ked in the glo-ve box for a wor-king pho-ne, but all I fo-und
we-re a bunch of wrenc-hes and fu-ses. That wasn't re-as-su-ring. I let out the clutch slowly and the
truck be-gan to roll for-ward, tho-ugh, so I ste-ered it aro-und the dri-ve-way and be-gan to bo-un-ce
and spin my way up to-ward the high-way. I'd he-ard it was easy to get a whe-eled ve-hic-le stuck in
snow, so I fi-gu-red I sho-uld dri-ve on ro-ads as much as I co-uld un-til I got clo-se eno-ugh to try
dri-ving cross-co-untry.
It was a go-od idea, and it wo-uld ha-ve wor-ked if the-re hadn't be-en a big drift abo-ut a
ki-lo-met-re down the ro-ad whe-re it cros-sed the bot-tom of the val-ley and be-gan to climb the ot-her
si-de. I re-ali-zed too la-te that the ro-ad didn't ri-se up with the ter-ra-in, and by the ti-me the pic-kup
no-sed in-to the bank, shud-de-red as it dug it-self in a few mo-re me-ters and ca-me to a stop, it was
tho-ro-ughly stuck. I co-uldn't back out or go for-ward, not even when 1 left it in ge-ar and got out and
pus-hed.
Of co-ur-se the-re was no sho-vel in the truck. I wo-uld ha-ve to go back to the ho-use to get one.
Cur-sing my stu-pi-dity in not thin-king ahe-ad, I fol-lo-wed the ti-re tracks back the way I had co-me.

It was star-ting to get dark by the ti-me I re-ac-hed the ho-use aga-in, so I prow-led thro-ugh the
kitc-hen dra-wers un-til I fo-und a flash-light that wor-ked, then went out to the barn and fo-und a
sho-vel. I jog-ged back to the truck and star-ted dig-ging it out, ho-ping Jody wasn't too wor-ri-ed that I
hadn't co-me back yet. She was only a ki-lo-met-re or two away; if I was ca-re-ful not to get stuck
aga-in I co-uld be the-re in a few mi-nu-tes.
I had just dug a path for the left whe-el and was star-ting in on the right when I saw a bright light
des-cen-ding to-ward me from the so-uth. It slid on past, still drop-ping, right to-ward the car. Da-ve.
"Well I'll be dam-ned," I sa-id alo-ud. "He ac-tu-al-ly ca-me." I le-aned back aga-inst the pic-kup for
a mo-ment, catc-hing my bre-ath. I didn't ha-ve to bre-ak my back at it now; he and Jody wo-uld
pro-bably be co-ming for me pretty so-on.
If they co-uld find me. My tracks wo-uld be pretty hard to fol-low in a ho-ver car, and if they mis-sed
the farm-ho-use then they co-uld very easily miss me out on the ro-ad in a pic-kup.
I re-ac-hed in-si-de and tur-ned on the he-ad-lights. That wo-uld help. But I star-ted dig-ging aga-in,
too.
Ten mi-nu-tes la-ter I fi-nis-hed the ot-her whe-el track. They still hadn't co-me for me. I clim-bed
in-to the pic-kup, put it in for-ward, and let out the clutch, but it didn't bud-ge.
Back out-si-de with the sho-vel, this ti-me dig-ging the snow out from un-der-ne-ath. It to-ok
anot-her fif-te-en mi-nu-tes. When I tri-ed it aga-in the truck mo-ved a lit-tle, and I roc-ked it back and
forth un-til it star-ted rol-ling, then dro-ve on up the ro-ad as fast as I co-uld. So-met-hing wasn't right.
Dave had left his lan-ding light on. As so-on as I ca-me up over the ed-ge of the val-ley I saw it,
shi-ning stra-ight at our over-tur-ned car. I co-uld see a fi-gu-re stan-ding be-si-de it, but I co-uldn't tell
if it was Da-ve or Jody.
The ro-ad cur-ved the wrong way. Cur-sing my luck, I gun-ned the pic-kup and swer-ved off the
ro-ad, bo-un-cing over rocks and sa-geb-rush and trying to ste-er whe-ne-ver the whe-els to-uc-hed
gro-und. The ti-res spun and the flywhe-el mo-tor scre-ec-hed in pro-test, but I kept the throt-tle all the
way to the flo-or and held on whi-le the pic-kup bo-un-ced to-ward the two air cars. As I drew clo-ser I
co-uld see that it was Da-ve stan-ding in the light, and Jody was lying flat on the gro-und in front of him.
She wasn't mo-ving.
I pop-ped open the glo-ve box just as the truck hit a hard bump, scat-te-ring wrenc-hes all over the
se-at and flo-or. I snatc-hed one of the big-ger ones in my right hand as I skid-ded to a stop be-si-de
Da-ve's car, le-aped out with it up-ra-ised, and sho-uted, "What ha-ve you do-ne to her?"
He didn't even try to de-fend him-self. He just sto-od the-re with a be-ati-fic smi-le on his fa-ce and
sa-id, "Go ahe-ad. It won't mat-ter. I'll even tell God it was jus-ti-fi-ed."
"God ain't the guy you'll be tal-king with," I sa-id. I ra-ised the wrench to ca-ve in his he-ad, but with
him just stan-ding the-re 1 fo-und that I co-uldn't do it. Not even with Jody lying be-fo-re us on the
gro-und.
He'd ta-ken off her co-at and glo-ves. Her fa-ce and hands we-re whi-te as the snow, and no bre-ath
ro-se from her open mo-uth.
"We sho-uld ha-ve re-ali-zed right away that one of us wo-uld ha-ve to go get Him for the rest of us,"
Da-ve told me as I bent down to fe-el her neck for a pul-se. "I wo-uld ha-ve go-ne myself on-ce I
fi-gu-red it out, but Jody was al-re-ady so clo-se I fi-gu-red she might as well be the one. It re-al-ly
do-esn't mat-ter."
I didn't see any wo-unds ot-her than the one on her fo-re-he-ad. She must ha-ve be-en
un-cons-ci-o-us when he ar-ri-ved, or he'd stun-ned her so-me-how. I co-uldn't find a pul-se, but my
fin-gers we-re so cold from dig-ging snow that I pro-bably co-uldn't ha-ve fo-und my own. I bent down
and felt for bre-ath aga-inst my che-ek, but the-re was no-ne. Not kno-wing what el-se to do, I
co-ve-red her mo-uth with mi-ne and blew a bre-ath in-to her lungs.
Dave grab-bed me by the col-lar. "No, I can't al-low that. You can't bring her back un-til we're su-re
she's do-ne the job."
In one qu-ick mo-ti-on I sto-od up and smac-ked him in the left temp-le with the flat of the wrench.
His he-ad jer-ked si-de-ways, and he fell over back-wards with a thump that swir-led snow up aro-und

him. I bent back down to Jody.
Five comp-res-si-ons of the chest, bre-ath, fi-ve comp-res-si-ons of the chest, bre-ath, over and over
aga-in. So-me-ti-me bet-we-en fo-re-ver and an eter-nity la-ter, she shud-de-red, gas-ped a bre-ath on
her own, and mo-aned.
I who-oped with joy, lif-ted her up in my arms, and car-ri-ed her over to Da-ve's car, whe-re I set her
in the pas-sen-ger se-at and tur-ned the he-ater up all the way.
I ran aro-und to the ot-her si-de and clim-bed in. She wo-ke with a scre-am when I slam-med the
do-or, then she saw it was me and slum-ped back in the se-at. "Christ you sca-red me," she sa-id. "I had
a hell of a crazy dre.... wa-it a mi-nu-te." She lo-oked aro-und at the car, a much big-ger one than what
we'd be-en flying.
"This is Da-ve's car," she sa-id af-ter a mo-ment. "He did co-me."
"That's right, and he drag-ged you out-si-de to die, too." I lo-oked out to ma-ke su-re he was still
lying whe-re he'd drop-ped. I had just eno-ugh ti-me to re-ali-ze he wasn't when the do-or be-si-de me
pop-ped open and he sto-od the-re with my wrench in his hand.
I lun-ged for the lift cont-rols, but he re-ac-hed ac-ross me and rap-ped my hand with the wrench
be-fo-re the car even be-gan to mo-ve. "No you don't," he sa-id. "Get out. We're go-ing to fi-nish this
ex-pe-ri-ment one way or anot-her."
I crad-led my sud-denly numb right hand in my left, won-de-ring if I co-uld clench it in-to a fist, and
whet-her I co-uld do any go-od with it if I co-uld.
Jody le-aned over so he co-uld see her. "It's al-re-ady fi-nis-hed," she sa-id.
"What do you me-an? It can't be. You're still ali-ve."
She la-ug-hed. "I'm ali-ve aga-in, idi-ot. I was de-ad. I was the-re. I saw yo-ur pre-ci-o-us ga-tes to
He-aven, and they're slam-med tight."
"You did?" I as-ked.
"They are?" as-ked Da-ve.
"Yup." Jody's eyes held a spark of ele-men-tal fi-re as she lo-oked at him.
In a sub-du-ed vo-ice, he sa-id, "Let me in. It's cold out he-re."
I tho-ught abo-ut it a mo-ment, much pre-fer-ring the idea of le-aving him out-si-de a whi-le lon-ger,
but Jody sa-id, "Go ahe-ad, I've got so-met-hing I want to tell him," so I til-ted my se-at for-ward and let
him climb in back. The mo-ment he sat down I pul-led on the lift cont-rol and to-ok us stra-ight up a
hund-red me-ters or so.
"Where are you go-ing?" he as-ked.
"High eno-ugh to ma-ke you think twi-ce abo-ut trying so-met-hing cu-te," I rep-li-ed.
"He won't try anyt-hing," Jody sa-id. "Not now or ever aga-in." "What ma-kes you so su-re?" I
as-ked.
She grin-ned li-ke a who-le pack of wol-ves sur-ro-un-ding a de-er. "Be-ca-use if he do-es, he might
get hurt, and if you think it's lo-nely on this si-de of the gre-at di-vi-de, wa-it 'til you see what's wa-iting
for us over the-re."
"What?" Da-ve as-ked, le-aning for-ward bet-we-en the se-ats. "What did you find?"
She got a fa-ra-way lo-ok in her eyes. "I fo-und the pla-ce whe-re He-aven used to be. At the end of
a long tun-nel of light. The-re we-ren't ga-tes re-al-ly; it was mo-re of a…a pla-ce. It's hard to
desc-ri-be physi-cal-ly. But I co-uld tell that was whe-re I was sup-po-sed to go, and I co-uld tell it was
clo-sed."
"Permanently?" Da-ve as-ked.
"It felt that way. The-re was just the me-mory of a do-or-way, no pro-mi-se of one to co-me. So I
tur-ned aro-und to co-me back, but I co-uldn't find the way at first. I wan-de-red aro-und qu-ite a
whi-le be-fo-re I stumb-led ac-ross it. If Gre-gor hadn't kept my body go-ing, I don't think I wo-uld
ha-ve fo-und it."
"Wandered aro-und whe-re?" Da-ve de-man-ded. "What was it li-ke?"
"Like fog," Jody sa-id. Her vo-ice pic-ked up a tre-mor as she ad-ded, "I was just a vi-ew-po-int in a
form-less, sha-pe-less, gray fog. The-re wasn't any so-und, any smell; I didn't even ha-ve a body to

he-ar or smell or fe-el with. I don't even know if I was ac-tu-al-ly se-e-ing anyt-hing. The-re was
not-hing the-re to see."
"Then how did you know whe-re yo-ur body was?"
"How do you know whe-re yo-ur chin is? It was just the-re." Jody tur-ned away from him and le-aned
back in her se-at. "Lo-ok, I'm ti-red and my he-ad hurts and I've be-en de-ad on-ce too of-ten to-day. I
just want to get so-me rest. I'll tell you all abo-ut it to-mor-row."
I to-ok the hint and flew us away in se-arch of a hos-pi-tal.
Later, af-ter we'd ban-da-ged her he-ad and ma-de su-re she had no ot-her inj-uri-es, we to-ok the
bri-dal su-ite at the top of the Fort Col-lins Hil-ton. Da-ve was in one of the ro-oms down be-low. I'd
wan-ted to put him in the city ja-il, but Jody wo-uldn't let me.
"His te-eth are pul-led," she told me as we lay in the enor-mo-us bed, a do-zen blan-kets pul-led over
us for warmth and as many cand-les pro-vi-ding light. "He'll be-li-eve anyt-hing I tell him now. Be-si-des,
we ne-ed him. The best thing we can do is tre-at him li-ke a re-co-ve-ring al-co-ho-lic or so-met-hing
and just in-teg-ra-te him back in-to our li-ves as fast as we can."
"Integrate him back in-to our li-ves?" I as-ked inc-re-du-lo-usly. "After what he did to you? He
mur-de-red you. You we-re de-ad!"
She gig-gled. "Well, I'm not so su-re abo-ut that."
"Huh? What abo-ut the tun-nel of light, and the ga-tes to He-aven and all that?"
She lo-we-red her vo-ice to a whis-per. "That was all to-tal va-cu-um. I told him what he wan-ted to
he-ar. Well, what I wan-ted him to he-ar, any-way."
I sta-red at her in the flic-ke-ring cand-le-light, dumb-fo-un-ded.
She shrug-ged. "I don't re-mem-ber a thing from the mo-ment Da-ve knoc-ked me out un-til the
mo-ment I wo-ke up with you next to me."
"You don't?"
"No."
"You're one hell of an act-ress, then." "Go-od, be-ca-use I want him con-vin-ced."
I tho-ught abo-ut that. "Even if we aren't?" I as-ked af-ter a whi-le.
"What?"
"You want Da-ve con-vin-ced, but we're still in the sa-me sha-pe we we-re be-fo-re. We don't know
anyt-hing at all abo-ut what's wa-iting for us af-ter we die."
She gig-gled aga-in and snug-gled up clo-ser to me un-der the co-vers. "Then God is just, if He
exists," she sa-id. "After all, I'm ag-nos-tic. I wo-uldn't ha-ve it any ot-her way."

XIV - GENE WOLFE - MUTE
Jill was not cer-ta-in it was a bus at all, alt-ho-ugh it was sha-ped li-ke a bus and of a bus-li-ke
co-lo-ur. To be-gin with (she sa-id to her-self) Jim-my and I are the only pe-op-le. If it's a scho-ol bus,
why aren't the-re ot-her kids? And if it's a pay-when-you-get-on bus, why do-esn't any-body get on?
Be-si-des the-re was a sign that sa-id BUS STOP, and it didn't.
The ro-ad was nar-row, crac-ked and bro-ken; the bus ne-go-ti-ated it slowly. Tre-es clo-sed
abo-ve it to shut out the sun, re-len-ted for a mo-ment or two, then clo-sed aga-in.
As it se-emed, fo-re-ver.
There we-re no cars on the ro-ad, no trucks or SUVs, and no ot-her bu-ses. They pas-sed a rusty
sign with a pic-tu-re of a girl on a hor-se, but the-re we-re no girls and no hor-ses. A de-er with wi-de,
in-no-cent eyes sto-od be-si-de a sign sho-wing a le-aping buck and watc-hed the-ir bus (if it re-al-ly
was a bus) rumb-le past. It re-min-ded Jill of a pic-tu-re in a bo-ok: a lit-tle girl with long blond ha-ir with
her arm aro-und the neck of just such a de-er. That girl was al-ways me-eting bad ani-mals and
hor-rib-le, ugly pe-op-le; and it se-emed to Jill that the ar-tist had be-en ni-ce to gi-ve her this res-pi-te.
Jill lo-oked at the ot-her pic-tu-res with hor-ri-fi-ed fas-ci-na-ti-on, then tur-ned to this one with a sen-se

of re-li-ef. The-re we-re bad things, but the-re we-re go-od things too.
"Do you re-mem-ber the knight fal-ling off his hor-se?" she whis-pe-red to her brot-her.
"You ne-ver saw a knight, Jel-ly. Me ne-it-her."
"In my bo-ok. Most of the pe-op-le that girl met we-re aw-ful, but she li-ked the knight and he
li-ked-"
The dri-ver's vo-ice cut thro-ugh hers. "Right over yon-der's whe-re yo-ur ma's bu-ri-ed." He
po-in-ted, co-ug-hing. Jill tri-ed to see it, and saw only tre-es.
After that she tri-ed to re-mem-ber Mot-her. No cle-ar ima-ge wo-uld co-me, no to-ne of vo-ice or
re-mem-be-red words. The-re had be-en a mot-her. The-ir mot-her. Her mot-her. She had lo-ved her
mot-her, and Mot-her had lo-ved her. She wo-uld hold on to that, she pro-mi-sed her-self. They co-uld
not bury that.
Trees ga-ve way to a sto-ne wall pi-er-ced by a wi-de ga-te of twis-ted bars, a ga-te flan-ked by
sto-ne pil-lars on which sto-ne li-ons cro-uc-hed and gla-red. An iron sign on the iron bars re-ad
POP-LAR HILL.
Gate, sign, pil-lars, and li-ons we-re go-ne al-most be-fo-re she co-uld draw bre-ath. The sto-ne wall
ran on and on, with tre-es in front of it and mo-re tre-es be-hind it. Al-ders in front, she de-ci-ded, and
map-les and birc-hes in back. No pop-lars.
"Did I ever re-ad yo-ur story-bo-ok?"
She sho-ok her he-ad.
"I didn't think so. I was al-ways go-ing to, but I ne-ver got aro-und to it. Was it go-od?"
Seeing her exp-res-si-on, he put his arm aro-und her. "It's not go-ne fo-re-ver, Jel-ly. Okay? May-be
they'll send it."
When she had dri-ed her eyes, the bus had left the ro-ad and was cre-eping up a nar-row win-ding
dri-ve bet-we-en tre-es. It slo-wed for a cur-ve, slo-wed mo-re. Tur-ned aga-in. Thro-ugh the
winds-hi-eld she glimp-sed a big ho-use. A man in a twe-ed jac-ket sto-od in what se-emed to be its
back do-or-way, smo-king a pi-pe.
The dri-ver co-ug-hed and spat. "This he-re's yo-ur pa-pa's pla-ce," he an-no-un-ced. "He'll be
aro-und so-mew-he-re, and glad to see you. You be go-od kids so he's not sorry he was glad, you
he-ar?"
Jill nod-ded.
The bus co-as-ted to a stop and its do-or ope-ned. "This's whe-re you get out. Don't you for-get them
bags."
She wo-uld not ha-ve for-got-ten hers wit-ho-ut the re-min-der. It held all the worldly go-ods she had
be-en al-lo-wed to ta-ke, and she pic-ked it up wit-ho-ut dif-fi-culty. Her brot-her pre-ce-ded her out of
the bus car-rying his own bag, and the do-or shut be-hind them.
She sta-red at the back do-or of the ho-use. It was clo-sed. "Dad was he-re," she sa-id. "I saw him."
"I didn't," her brot-her sa-id. "He was stan-ding in the do-or wa-iting for us." Her brot-her shrug-ged.
"May-be the pho-ne rang."
Behind them the bus bac-ked up, pul-led for-ward, bac-ked a se-cond ti-me, and star-ted down the
dri-ve. Jill wa-ved. "Wa-it! Wa-it a mi-nu-te!" If its dri-ver he-ard her, the-re was no sign of it.
"We ought to go in the ho-use." Her brot-her stro-de away. "He might be in the-re wa-iting for us."
"Maybe it's loc-ked." Re-luc-tantly, Jill fol-lo-wed him.
It was not, and was not even clo-sed eno-ugh to latch. The-re we-re le-aves on the flo-or of the big
kitc-hen, as tho-ugh the do-or had sto-od open for ho-urs whi-le the wind blew. Jill pus-hed it so-lidly
shut be-hind her.
"He might be" (her brot-her's vo-ice crac-ked) "in front."
"If he was tal-king on the pho-ne, we'd he-ar him."
"Not if the ot-her per-son was tal-king." Her brot-her had al-re-ady se-en eno-ugh of the kitc-hen.
"Co-me on."
She did not. The-re was an elect-ric sto-ve who-se bur-ners glo-wed crim-son then fi-ery scar-let, a
ref-ri-ge-ra-tor con-ta-ining a po-und of che-ese and two bot-tles of be-er, and a pantry full of cans.

The-re we-re dis-hes, pots, pans, kni-ves, spo-ons, and forks in plenty.
Her brot-her re-tur-ned. "The TV's on in the front ro-om, but the-re's no-body the-re."
"Dad has to be aro-und so-mew-he-re," Jill sa-id. "I saw him."
"I didn't." "Well, I did."
She fol-lo-wed her brot-her down a wi-de hall with high, dark win-dows on one si-de, past the big
do-or to a big di-ning ro-om whe-re no one sat eating, and in-to a li-ving ro-om in which half a do-zen
dri-vers might ha-ve par-ked half a do-zen bu-ses, full of suns-hi-ne. "A man did this," she sa-id,
lo-oking aro-und.
"Did what?"
"In he-re. A man pic-ked out this fur-ni-tu-re, the rugs, and everyt-hing." Her brot-her po-in-ted.
"Ha-ve a lo-ok over the-re. The-re's a cha-ir ma-de out of horns. I think that's hot."
She nod-ded. "So do I. Only I wo-uldn't ha-ve bo-ught it. A ro-om is-it's a fra-me, and the pe-op-le
in it are the pic-tu-res." "You're crazy."
"No, I'm not." She sho-ok her he-ad in self-de-fen-ce. "You're sa-ying Dad got this stuff to ma-ke him
lo-ok go-od."
"To ma-ke him lo-ok right. You can't ma-ke pe-op-le lo-ok go-od. If they don't, they don't. That's all
the-re is to it. But you can ma-ke them lo-ok right and that's mo-re im-por-tant. Every-body lo-oks right
in the right pla-ce. If you had a pic-tu-re of Dad-"
"I don't."
"If you did. And you we-re go-ing to get a fra-me for it. The man in the fra-me sto-re says ta-ke any
of the-se you want. Wo-uld you ta-ke a pretty black one with sil-ver flo-wers?"
"Heck no!"
"There you are. But I'd li-ke a pic-tu-re of me in a fra-me li-ke that." Her brot-her smi-led. "I'll do it
so-me-day, Jel-ly. Did you no-ti-ce the TV?" She nod-ded. "I saw it as so-on as we ca-me in. Only you
can't he-ar what that man's sa-ying, be-ca-use it's on mu-te."
"So he co-uld talk on the pho-ne, may-be."
"In anot-her ro-om?" The te-lep-ho-ne was on an end tab-le ne-ar the te-le-vi-si-on; she lif-ted the
re-ce-iver and held it to her ear. "What's wrong? Co-uld you he-ar him?"
"No." Gently, she re-tur-ned the re-ce-iver to its crad-le. "The-re's no no-ise at all. It's not ho-oked
up."
"He's not on a pho-ne in anot-her ro-om, then."
It was not lo-gi-cal, but she felt too dra-ined to ar-gue.
"I don't think he's he-re at all," her brot-her sa-id.
"The TV is on." She sat down in a cha-ir, ba-re wa-xed wo-od and brown-and-oran-ge cus-hi-ons.
"Did you turn on the-se lights?" Her brot-her sho-ok his he-ad.
"Besides, I saw him. He was stan-ding in the do-or."
"Okay." Her brot-her was si-lent for a mo-ment. He was tall and blond, li-ke Dad, with a fa-ce that
was al-re-ady be-gin-ning to dis-co-ver that it had be-en ma-de for se-ri-o-us-ness. "I'd ha-ve he-ard
the car if he went away. I've be-en lis-te-ning for so-met-hing li-ke that."
"So ha-ve I." She sen-sed, alt-ho-ugh she did not say, that the-re was a pre-sen-ce in this empty
ho-use that ma-de you lis-ten. Lis-ten, lis-ten. All the ti-me. MU-TE, sa-id the scre-en, and ma-de no
so-und.
"I'd li-ke to know what that man on the TV's sa-ying," she told her brot-her. "It's on mu-te, and I can't
find the re-mo-te. I lo-oked."
She sa-id not-hing, snug-gling back aga-inst the brown-and-oran-ge cus-hi-on and sta-ring at the
scre-en. The cha-ir ma-de her fe-el that she was enc-lo-sed by so-me de-fen-ce, ho-we-ver small.
"Want me to chan-ge the chan-nel?"
"You sa-id you co-uldn't find the chan-ger."
"There's but-tons." He swung back a hin-ged pa-nel at the si-de of the scre-en. "On and off. Chan-nel
up and chan-nel down, vo-lu-me up and vo-lu-me down. Only no Mu-te but-ton."
"We don't ne-ed a Mu-te but-ton," she whis-pe-red, "we ne-ed an Un-mu-te but-ton." "Want to

chan-ge the chan-nel? Lo-ok."
The next chan-nel was a gray scre-en with wavy li-nes and the yel-low word mu-te in one cor-ner, but
the next one af-ter it had a pretty, fri-endly lo-oking wo-man sit-ting at a tab-le and tal-king. The yel-low
MU-TE was in the cor-ner of her scre-en, too. She had a very sharp yel-low pen-cil in her hands, and
she pla-yed with it as she tal-ked.
Jill wis-hed that she wo-uld wri-te so-met-hing ins-te-ad, but she did not.
The next chan-nel sho-wed an al-most empty stre-et, and the yel-low MU-TE. The stre-et was not
qu-ite empty be-ca-use two pe-op-le, a man and a wo-man, we-re lying down in it. They did not mo-ve.
"You want to watch this?"
Jill sho-ok her he-ad. "Go back to the man Dad was watc-hing." "The first one?"
She nod-ded, and chan-nels flic-ked past.
"You li-ke-" Her brot-her fro-ze in mid-sen-ten-ce. Se-conds crept past, fe-ar-ful and so-me-how
gu-ilty.
"I-"Jill be-gan.
"Shhh! So-me-one's wal-king aro-und ups-ta-irs. He-ar it?" Her brot-her das-hed out of the ro-om.
She, who had he-ard not-hing, mur-mu-red to her-self, "I re-al-ly don't li-ke him at all. But he talks
slo-wer than the wo-man, and I think may-be I can le-arn to re-ad his lips if I watch him long eno-ugh."
She tri-ed, and se-arc-hed for the cont-rol bet-we-en ti-mes.
There had be-en no one ups-ta-irs, but the-re was a big bed-ro-om the-re with two small beds, one
aga-inst the east wall and one aga-inst the so-uth, three win-dows, and two dres-sers. Her brot-her had
wan-ted a ro-om of his own; but she, ter-ri-fi-ed at the tho-ught of lying alo-ne in the dark, pro-mi-sed
that the ro-om wo-uld be his ro-om and she wo-uld ha-ve no ro-om-that she wo-uld swe-ep and dust
his ro-om for him every day, and ma-ke his bed for him.
Reluctantly, he con-sen-ted.
They ate can-ned chi-li the first night, and oat-me-al the next mor-ning. The ho-use, they fo-und, had
three flo-ors and fo-ur-te-en ro-oms fif-te-en co-un-ting the pantry. The TV, which Jill had tur-ned off
when she had left the ro-om to he-at the-ir sup-per, was on aga-in, still on mu-te.
There was an at-tac-hed ga-ra-ge, with two cars. Her brot-her spent all af-ter-no-on hun-ting for the
keys to one or the ot-her wit-ho-ut fin-ding them. In-de-ed, wit-ho-ut fin-ding any keys at all.
In the li-ving ro-om, the man who had be-en (si-lently) tal-king tal-ked si-lently still, on and on. Jill
spent most of her ti-me watc-hing him, and even-tu-al-ly conc-lu-ded that he was on ta-pe. His last
re-mark (at which he lo-oked down at the po-lis-hed top of his desk) be-ing fol-lo-wed by his first.
That eve-ning, as she pre-pa-red Vi-en-na sa-usa-ges and can-ned po-ta-to sa-lad, she he-ard her
brot-her sho-ut, "Dad!" The sho-ut was fol-lo-wed by the ban-ging of a do-or and the so-und of her
brot-her's run-ning fe-et.
She ran too, and ca-ught up with him as he was lo-oking thro-ugh a nar-row do-or-way in the back
hall. "I saw him!" he sa-id. "He was stan-ding the-re lo-oking right at me."
The nar-row do-or-way ope-ned upon dark-ness and equ-al-ly nar-row wo-oden steps.
"Then I he-ard this slam. I know it was this one. It had to be!"
Jill lo-oked down, tro-ub-led by a draft from the do-or-way that was su-rely cold, dank, and fo-ul. "It
lo-oks li-ke the ba-se-ment," she sa-id.
"It is the ba-se-ment. I've be-en down he-re a co-up-le ti-mes, only I ne-ver co-uld find the light. I
kept thin-king I'd find a flash-light and co-me down aga-in." Her brot-her star-ted down the steps, and
tur-ned in surp-ri-se when a sing-le dim bulb sus-pen-ded from a wi-re ca-me on. "How'd you do that,
Jel-ly?"
"The switch is he-re in the hall, on the wall be-hind the do-or."
"Well, co-me on! Aren't you co-ming?"
She did. "I wish we we-re back at that pla-ce."
Her brot-her did not he-ar her. Or if he he-ard her, cho-se to ig-no-re her. "He's down he-re
so-mew-he-re, Jel-ly-he's got to be. With two of us, he can't hi-de very long." "Isn't the-re any ot-her

way out?"
"I don't think so. Only I didn't stay long. It was re-al-ly dark, and it smel-led bad."
They fo-und the so-ur-ce of that smell in back of a bank of fre-es-tan-ding shel-ves he-aped with
to-ols and pa-int cans. It was rot-ting and had sta-ined its clot-hing. In pla-ces its flesh had fal-len in, and
in ot-hers had fal-len away. Her brot-her cle-ared scrap wo-od, a gar-den spra-yer, and half a do-zen
bot-tles and jugs from the shel-ves so that the light might bet-ter re-ach the de-ad thing on the flo-or;
af-ter a mi-nu-te or two, Jill hel-ped him.
When they had do-ne all they co-uld, he sa-id, "Who was it?" and she whis-pe-red,
"Dad."
After that, she tur-ned away and went back up the sta-irs, was-hed her hands and arms at the kitc-hen
sink, and sat at the tab-le un-til she he-ard the ba-se-ment do-or clo-se and her brot-her ca-me in.
"Wash," she told him. "We ought to ta-ke baths, re-al-ly. Both of us."
"Then let's do it."
There we-re two bath-ro-oms ups-ta-irs. Jill used the one ne-arest the-ir ro-om, her brot-her the
ot-her. When she had bat-hed and dri-ed her-self, she put on a ro-be that had per-haps be-en her
mot-her's on-ce, hitc-hing it up and knot-ting the sash tight to ke-ep the hem off the flo-or. So at-ti-red,
she car-ri-ed the-ir clot-hes downs-ta-irs and in-to the la-undry ro-om, and put them in the mac-hi-ne.
In the li-ving ro-om, the man who-se lips she had tri-ed to re-ad was go-ne. The scre-en was gray and
empty now sa-ve for the sing-le word MU-TE in glo-wing yel-low. She fo-und the pa-nel her brot-her
had shown her. Ot-her chan-nels she tri-ed we-re equ-al-ly empty, equ-al-ly gray, equ-al-ly mu-ted.
Her brot-her ca-me in, in un-ders-horts and sho-es. "Aren't you go-ing to eat?"
"Later," Jill sa-id. "I don't fe-el li-ke it." "You mind if I do?"
She shrug-ged.
"You think that was Dad, don't you? What we fo-und in the ba-se-ment." "Yes," she sa-id, "I didn't
know be-ing de-ad was li-ke that."
"I saw him. I didn't be-li-eve you did, that ti-me. But I did. and he clo-sed the ba-se-ment do-or. I
he-ard it." She sa-id not-hing.
"You think we'll see him any-mo-re?"
"No."
"Just li-ke that? He wan-ted us to find him, and we did, and that was all he wan-ted?"
"He was tel-ling us that he was de-ad." Her vo-ice was flat, exp-res-si-on-less. "He wan-ted us to
know he wo-uldn't be aro-und to help us. Now we do. You're go-ing to eat?" "Ye-ah."
"Wait just a mi-nu-te and I'll eat with you. Did you know the-re isn't any mo-re TV?"
"There wasn't any be-fo-re," her brot-her sa-id.
"I gu-ess. To-mor-row I'm go-ing out. You re-mem-ber that ga-te we pas-sed on the bus?"
He nod-ded. "Pop-lar Hill."
"That's it. I'm go-ing to walk the-re. May-be it will be un-loc-ked to let cars in. If it isn't, I can
pro-bably get over the wall so-me way. The-re we-re a lot of tre-es, and it wasn't very high. I'd li-ke it if
you ca-me with me, but if you won't I'm go-ing to any-how."
"We'll both go," he sa-id. "Co-me on, let's eat."
They set out next mor-ning, shut-ting the kitc-hen do-or but ma-king very cer-ta-in that it was
un-loc-ked, and wal-king down the long, cur-ving dri-ve the bus had clim-bed. When the ho-use was
al-most out of sight, Jill stop-ped to lo-ok back at it. "It's sort of li-ke we we-re run-ning away from
ho-me," she sa-id.
"We're not," her brot-her told her.
"I don't know."
"Well, I do. Lis-ten, that's our ho-use. Dad's de-ad, so it be-longs to you and me."
"I don't want it," Jill sa-id; and then, when the ho-use was out of sight, "but it's the only ho-me we've
got."
The dri-ve was long, but not im-pos-sibly so, and the high-way-if it co-uld be cal-led a

high-way-stretc-hed away to right and left at the end of it. Stretc-hed si-lent and empty. "I was thin-king
if the-re we-re so-me cars, we co-uld flag one down," her brot-her sa-id. "Or may-be the bus will co-me
by."
"There's grass in the cracks."
"Yeah, I know. This way, Jel-ly." He set out, lo-oking as se-ri-o-us as al-ways, and very, very
de-ter-mi-ned.
She trot-ted be-hind. "Are you go-ing in-to Pop-lar Hill with me?"
"If we can flag down a car first, or a truck or anyt-hing, I'm go-ing with them if they'll ta-ke me. So are
you."
She sho-ok her he-ad.
"But if we can't, I'm go-ing to Pop-lar Hill li-ke you say. May-be the-re's so-me-body
"I'll bet so-me-body is." She tri-ed to so-und mo-re con-fi-dent than she felt. "The-re's no pic-tu-re on
the TV. I tri-ed all the chan-nels." He was three pa-ces ahe-ad of her, and did not lo-ok back. "So did
I." It was a lie, but she had tri-ed se-ve-ral.
"It me-ans the-re's no-body in the TV sta-ti-ons. Not in any of them." He cle-ared his thro-at, and his
vo-ice sud-denly de-epe-ned, as the vo-ices of ado-les-cent boys will. "No-body ali-ve, any-how."
"Maybe the-re's so-me-body ali-ve who do-esn't know how to work it," she sug-ges-ted. Af-ter a
mo-ment's tho-ught she ad-ded, "May-be they don't ha-ve any elect-ri-city whe-re they are."
He stop-ped and lo-oked aro-und at her. "We do." "So pe-op-le are still ali-ve. That's what I sa-id."
"Right! And it me-ans a car might co-me past, and that's what I sa-id."
A small bush, fresh and gre-en, spro-uted from a cre-vi-ce in the mid-dle of the high-way. Se-e-ing it,
Jill sen-sed that so-me unk-nown and unk-no-wab-le po-wer had over-he-ard them and was gently
trying to show them that they we-re wrong. She shud-de-red, and sum-mo-ned up all the go-od re-asons
that ar-gu-ed that the bush was wrong ins-te-ad. "The-re we-re li-ve pe-op-le back at that pla-ce. The
bus dri-ver was all right, too."
The iron ga-tes we-re still the-re, just as she had se-en them the pre-vi-o-us day, gra-ce-ful and strong
bet-we-en the-ir pil-lars of cut sto-ne. The li-ons still snar-led atop tho-se pil-lars, and the iron sign on
the iron bars still proc-la-imed POP-LAR HILL.
"They're loc-ked," her brot-her an-no-un-ced. He rat-tled the lock to show her-a husky brass
pad-lock that lo-oked new.
"We've got to get in."
"Sure. I'm go-ing to go along this wall, see? I'm go-ing to lo-ok for a pla-ce whe-re I can climb over,
or may-be it's fal-len down so-mew-he-re. When I find one, I'll co-me back and tell you."
"I want to go with you." Fe-ar had co-me li-ke a chill wind. What if Jim-my went away and she ne-ver
saw him aga-in?
"Listen, back at the ho-use you we-re go-ing to do this all by yo-ur-self. If you co-uld do it by
yo-ur-self, you can stay he-re for ten mi-nu-tes to watch for cars. Now don’t fol-low me!"
She did not; but an ho-ur la-ter she was wa-iting for him when he ca-me back along the in-si-de of the
wall, scratc-hed and dirty and in-tent on spe-aking to her thro-ugh the ga-te. "How'd you get in?" he
as-ked when she ap-pe-ared at his sho-ul-der.
She shrug-ged. "You first. How did you?"
"I fo-und a lit-tle tree that had di-ed and fal-len over. It was small eno-ugh that I co-uld drag it if I
didn't try to pick up the ro-ot end. I le-aned it on the wall and clim-bed up it, and jum-ped down."
"Then you can't get out," she told him, and star-ted up a ro-ad le-ading away from the ga-te.
"I'll find so-me way. How did you get in?"
"Through the bars. It was tight and scrappy, tho-ugh. I don't think you co-uld."
Somewhat ma-li-ci-o-usly, she ad-ded, "I've be-en wa-iting in he-re a long ti-me."
The pri-va-te ro-ad led up a hill bet-we-en rows of slen-der tre-es that ma-de her think of mo-dels
sho-wing off gre-en gowns. The big front do-or of the big squ-are ho-use at the top of the hill was
loc-ked; and the big brass knoc-ker pro-du-ced only empty ec-ho-es from in-si-de the ho-use no
mat-ter how hard her brot-her po-un-ded. The pretty pe-arl-co-lo-ured but-ton that she pres-sed

so-un-ded dis-tant chi-mes that bro-ught no one.
Peering thro-ugh the win-dow to the left of the do-or, she saw a mostly wo-oden cha-ir with
brown-and-oran-ge cus-hi-ons, and a gray TV scre-en. One cor-ner of the gray scre-en re-ad MU-TE
in bright yel-low let-ters.
Circling the ho-use they fo-und the kitc-hen do-or un-loc-ked, as they had left it. She was he-aping
cor-ned be-ef hash out of her frying pan when the lights went out.
"That me-ans no mo-re hot fo-od," she told her brot-her. "It's elect-ric. My sto-ve is."
"They'll co-me back on," he sa-id con-fi-dently, but they did not.
That night she und-res-sed in the dark bed-ro-om they had ma-de the-ir own, in the light-less ho-use,
fol-ding clot-hes she co-uld not see and la-ying them as ne-atly as her fin-gers co-uld ma-na-ge upon an
in-vi-sib-le cha-ir be-fo-re slip-ping bet-we-en the she-ets.
Warm and na-ked, her brot-her fol-lo-wed her half a mi-nu-te la-ter. "You know, Jel-ly," he sa-id as
he drew her to him, "we're pro-bably the only li-ve pe-op-le in the who-le world."

XV - NANCY KRESS - INERTIA
At dusk the back of the bed-ro-om falls off. One mi-nu-te it's a wall, ex-po-sed studs and crac-ked
blue drywall, and the next it's snap-ped-off two-by-fo-urs and an ir-re-gu-lar fen-ce as high as my
wa-ist, the ed-ges both jag-ged and furry, as if they we-re co-ve-red with pow-der. Thro-ugh the ho-le a
sickly tree po-kes up-ward in the nar-row spa-ce bet-we-en the back of our bar-racks and the back of
a bar-racks in E Block. I try to get out of bed for a clo-ser lo-ok, but to-day my arth-ri-tis is too bad,
which is why I'm in bed in the first pla-ce. Rac-hel rus-hes in-to the bed-ro-om. "What hap-pe-ned,
Gram? Are you all right?"
I nod and po-int. Rac-hel bends in-to the ho-le, her ha-ir ha-lo-ed by Ca-li-for-nia twi-light. The
bed-ro-om is hers, too; her mat-tress li-es sto-red un-der my scar-red fo-ur-pos-ter. "Ter-mi-tes!
Damn. I didn't know we had them. You su-re you're all right?" "I'm fi-ne. I was all the way ac-ross the
ro-om, ho-ney. I'm fi-ne." "Well-we'll ha-ve to get Mom to get so-me-body to fix it."
I say not-hing. Rac-hel stra-igh-tens, throws me a qu-ick glan-ce, lo-oks away. Still I say not-hing
abo-ut Ma-mie, but in a sud-den flic-ker from my oil lamp I lo-ok di-rectly at Rac-hel, just be-ca-use
she is so go-od to lo-ok at. Not pretty, not even he-re In-si-de, alt-ho-ugh so far the di-se-ase has
af-fec-ted only the left si-de of her fa-ce. The rid-ge of thic-ke-ned, ropy skin, co-ar-se as old hemp,
isn't vi-sib-le at all when she stands in right pro-fi-le. But her no-se is lar-ge, her eyeb-rows he-avy and
low, her chin a bony knob. An ho-nest no-se, exp-res-si-ve brows, di-rect gray eyes, chin that juts
for-ward when she tilts her he-ad in in-tel-li-gent lis-te-ning-to a grand-mot-her's eye, Rac-hel is go-od
to lo-ok at. They wo-uldn't think so, Out-si-de. But they wo-uld be wrong.
Rachel says, "May-be I co-uld tra-de a lot-tery card for mo-re drywall and na-ils, and patch it
myself."
"The ter-mi-tes will still be the-re."
"Well, yes, but we ha-ve to do so-met-hing." I don't cont-ra-dict her. She is six-te-en ye-ars old.
"Fe-el that air co-ming in-you'll fre-eze at night this ti-me of ye-ar. It'll be ter-rib-le for yo-ur arth-ri-tis.
Co-me in the kitc-hen now, Gram-I've bu-ilt up the fi-re."
She helps me in-to the kitc-hen, whe-re the me-tal wo-od-bur-ning sto-ve throws a rosy warmth that
fe-els go-od on my jo-ints. The sto-ve was do-na-ted to the co-lony a ye-ar ago by who-knows-what
cha-rity or spe-ci-al in-te-rest gro-up for, I sup-po-se, wha-te-ver tax bre-aks still hold for that sort of
thing. If any do. Rac-hel tells me that we still get news-pa-pers, and on-ce or twi-ce I've wrap-ped
ve-ge-tab-les from our patch in so-me fa-irly new-lo-oking ones. She even says that the yo-ung
Ste-ven-son boy works a do-na-ted com-pu-ter news net in the Block J com-mu-nity hall, but I no
lon-ger fol-low Out-si-de tax re-gu-la-ti-ons. Nor do I ask why Ma-mie was the one to get the
wo-od-bur-ning sto-ve when it wasn't a lot-tery month.

The light from the sto-ve is stron-ger than the oil fla-me in the bed-ro-om; I see that be-ne-ath her
con-cern for our de-ad bed-ro-om wall, Rac-hel's fa-ce is flus-hed with ex-ci-te-ment. Her yo-ung skin
glows right from in-tel-li-gent chin to the ropy rid-ge of di-se-ase, which of co-ur-se ne-ver chan-ges
co-lo-ur. I smi-le at her. Six-te-en is so easy to ex-ci-te. A new ha-ir rib-bon from the do-na-ti-ons
re-po-si-tory, a glan-ce from a boy, a sec-ret with her co-usin Jen-nie.
"Gram," she says, kne-eling be-si-de my cha-ir, her hands rest-less on the bat-te-red wo-oden arm,
"Gram-the-re's a vi-si-tor. From Out-si-de. Jen-nie saw him."
I go on smi-ling. Rac-hel-nor Jen-nie, eit-her-can't re-mem-ber when di-se-ase co-lo-ni-es had lots of
vi-si-tors. First bulky fi-gu-res in con-ta-mi-na-ti-on su-its, then a few ye-ars la-ter, sle-eker fi-gu-res in
the sa-ni-su-its that to-ok the-ir pla-ce. Pe-op-le we-re still be-ing in-ter-red from Out-si-de, and for
ye-ars the check-po-ints at the Rim had traf-fic flo-wing both ways. But of co-ur-se Rac-hel do-esn't
re-mem-ber all that; she wasn't born. Ma-mie was only twel-ve when we we-re in-ter-red he-re. To
Rac-hel, a vi-si-tor might well be a gre-at event. I put out one hand and stro-ke her ha-ir.
"Jennie sa-id he wants to talk to the ol-dest pe-op-le in the co-lony, the ones who we-re bro-ught
he-re with the di-se-ase. Hal Ste-ven-son told her."
"Did he, swe-et-he-art?" Her ha-ir is soft and silky. Ma-mie's ha-ir had be-en the sa-me at Rac-hel's
age.
"He might want to talk to you!"
"Well, he-re I am."
"But aren't you ex-ci-ted? What do you sup-po-se he wants?"
I'm sa-ved from ans-we-ring her be-ca-use Ma-mie co-mes in, her boyf-ri-end Pe-ter Ma-lo-ne
fol-lo-wing with a string-bag of gro-ce-ri-es from the re-po-si-tory.
At the first so-und of the do-ork-nob tur-ning, Rac-hel gets up from be-si-de my cha-ir and po-kes at
the fi-re. Her fa-ce go-es comp-le-tely blank, alt-ho-ugh I know that part is only tem-po-rary. Ma-mie
cri-es, "He-re we are!" in her high, doll-baby vo-ice, cold air from the hall swir-ling aro-und her li-ke
bright wa-ter. "Ma-ma dar-ling-how are you fe-eling? And Rac-hel! You'll ne-ver gu-ess, Pe-te had
ext-ra de-po-si-tory cards and he got us so-me chic-ken! I'm go-ing to ma-ke a stew!"
"The back wall fell off the bed-ro-om," Rac-hel says flatly. She do-esn't lo-ok at Pe-ter with his
string-cros-sed chic-ken, but I do. He grins his pa-ti-ent, wol-fish grin. I gu-ess that he won the
de-po-si-tory cards at po-ker. His fin-ger-na-ils are dirty. The part of the news-pa-per I can see says
ESI-DENT CON-FIS-CA-TES C.
Mamie says, "What do you me-an, Tell off?'" Rac-hel shrugs. "Just fell off. Ter-mi-tes."
Mamie lo-oks help-les-sly at Pe-ter, who-se grin wi-dens. I can see how it will be: They will ha-ve a
sce-ne la-ter, not comp-le-tely for our be-ne-fit, alt-ho-ugh it will ta-ke pla-ce in the kitc-hen for us to
watch. Ma-mie will beg pret-tily for Pe-ter to fix the wall. He will de-mur, grin-ning. She will of-fer
va-ri-o-us smir-king hints abo-ut bar-ter, each hint be-co-ming mo-re exp-li-cit. He will ag-ree to fix the
wall. Rac-hel and I, ha-ving no ot-her warm ro-om to go to, will watch the fi-re or the flo-or or our
sho-es un-til Ma-mie and Pe-ter re-ti-re os-ten-ta-ti-o-usly to her ro-om. It's the os-ten-ta-ti-on that
em-bar-ras-ses us. Ma-mie has al-ways ne-eded wit-nes-ses to her de-si-ra-bi-lity.
But Pe-ter is watc-hing Rac-hel, not Ma-mie. "The chic-ken isn't from Out-si-de, Rac-hel. It's from
that chic-ken-yard in Block B. I he-ard you say how cle-an they are."
"Yeah," Rac-hel says shortly, gra-ce-les-sly.
Mamie rolls her eyes. "Say 'thank you,' dar-ling. Pe-te went to a lot of tro-ub-le to get this chic-ken."
"Thanks."
"Can't you say it li-ke you me-an it?" Ma-mie's vo-ice go-es shrill.
"Thanks," Rac-hel says. She he-ads to-wards our three-wal-led bed-ro-om. Pe-ter, still watc-hing her
clo-sely, shifts the chic-ken from one hand to the ot-her. The pres-su-re of the string bag cuts li-nes
ac-ross the chic-ken's yel-lo-wish skin.
"Rachel An-ne Wil-son-"
"Let her go," Pe-ter says softly.
"No," Ma-mie says. Bet-we-en the fi-ve cris-scros-sing li-nes of di-se-ase, her fa-ce sets in un-lo-vely

li-nes. "She can at le-ast le-arn so-me man-ners. And I want her to he-ar our an-no-un-ce-ment!
Rac-hel, you just co-me right back out he-re this mi-nu-te!"
Rachel re-turns from the bed-ro-om; I've ne-ver known her to di-so-bey her mot-her. She pa-uses by
the open bed-ro-om do-or, wa-iting. Two empty cand-le sco-nes, both blac-ke-ned by old smo-ke,
fra-me her he-ad. It has be-en sin-ce at le-ast last win-ter that we've had can-di-es for them. Ma-mie,
her fo-re-he-ad cre-ased in ir-ri-ta-ti-on, smi-les brightly.
"This is a spe-ci-al din-ner, all of you. Pe-te and I ha-ve an an-no-un-ce-ment. We're go-ing to get
mar-ri-ed."
"That's right," Pe-ter says. "Cong-ra-tu-la-te us."
Rachel, al-re-ady mo-ti-on-less, so-me-how go-es even stil-ler. Pe-ter watc-hes her ca-re-ful-ly.
Ma-mie casts down her eyes, blus-hing, and I fe-el a stab of im-pa-ti-ent pity for my da-ugh-ter,
prop-ping up mid-thir-ti-es gir-lish-ness on such a slen-der re-ed as Pe-ter Ma-lo-ne. I sta-re at him
hard. If he ever to-uc-hes Rac-hel…but I don't re-al-ly think he wo-uld. Things li-ke that don't hap-pen
any-mo-re. Not In-si-de.
"Congratulations," Rac-hel mumb-les. She cros-ses the ro-om and emb-ra-ces her mot-her, who hugs
her back with the-at-ri-cal fer-vo-ur. In anot-her mi-nu-te, Ma-mie will start to cry. Over her sho-ul-der
I glimp-se Rac-hel's fa-ce, mo-men-ta-rily sor-ro-wing and lo-ving, and I drop my eyes.
"Well! This calls for a to-ast!" Ma-mie cri-es ga-ily. She winks, ma-kes a clumsy pi-ro-u-et-te, and
pulls a bot-tle from the back shelf of the cup-bo-ard Rac-hel got at the last do-na-ti-ons lot-tery. The
cup-bo-ard lo-oks stran-ge in our kitc-hen: gle-aming whi-te lac-qu-er, va-gu-ely Ori-en-tal-lo-oking,
amid the wobbly cha-irs and scar-red tab-le with the bro-ken dra-wer no one has ever got-ten aro-und
to men-ding. Ma-mie flo-uris-hes the bot-tle, which I didn't know was the-re. It's cham-pag-ne.
What had they be-en thin-king, the Out-si-ders who do-na-ted cham-pag-ne to a di-se-ase co-lony?
Po-or de-vils, even if they ne-ver ha-ve anyt-hing to ce-leb-ra-te…Or he-re's so-met-hing they won't
know what to do with…Or bet-ter them than me-as long as the sic-ki-es stay In-si-de…It do-esn't
re-al-ly mat-ter.
"I just lo-ve cham-pag-ne!" Ma-mie cri-es fe-ve-rishly; I think she has drunk it on-ce. "And oh
lo-ok-he-re's so-me-one el-se to help us ce-leb-ra-te! Co-me in, Jen-nie-co-me in and ha-ve so-me
cham-pag-ne!"
Jennie co-mes in, smi-ling. I see the sa-me eager ex-ci-te-ment that ani-ma-ted Rac-hel be-fo-re her
mot-her's an-no-un-ce-ment. It glows on Jen-nie's fa-ce, which is be-a-uti-ful. She has no di-se-ase on
her hands or her fa-ce. She must ha-ve it so-mew-he-re, she was born In-si-de, but one do-esn't ask
that. Pro-bably Rac-hel knows. The two girls are in-se-pa-rab-le. Jen-nie, the da-ugh-ter of Ma-mie's
de-ad hus-band's brot-her, is Rac-hel's co-usin, and tech-ni-cal-ly Ma-mie is her gu-ar-di-an. But no
one pays at-ten-ti-on to such things any-mo-re, and Jen-nie li-ves with so-me pe-op-le in a bar-racks in
the next Block, alt-ho-ugh Rac-hel and I as-ked her to li-ve he-re. She sho-ok her he-ad, the
be-a-uti-ful ha-ir so blon-de it's al-most whi-te bo-un-cing on her sho-ul-ders, and blus-hed in
em-bar-ras-sment, pa-in-ful-ly not lo-oking at Ma-mie.
"I'm get-ting mar-ri-ed, Jen-nie," Ma-mie says, aga-in cas-ting down her eyes bash-ful-ly. I won-der
what she did, and with whom, to get the cham-pag-ne.
"Congratulations!" Jen-nie says warmly. "You, too, Pe-ter."
"Call me Pe-te," he says, as he has sa-id be-fo-re. I catch his hungry lo-ok at Jen-nie. She do-esn't,
but so-me sixth sen-se-even he-re, even In-si-de-ma-kes her step slightly back-wards. I know she will
go on cal-ling him "Pe-ter."
Mamie says to Jen-nie, "Ha-ve so-me mo-re cham-pag-ne. Stay for din-ner."
With her eyes Jen-nie me-asu-res the amo-unt of cham-pag-ne in the bot-tle, the si-ze of the chic-ken
ble-eding slightly on the tab-le. She me-asu-res unobt-ru-si-vely, and then of co-ur-se she li-es. "I'm
sorry, I can’t-we ate our me-al at no-on to-day. I just wan-ted to ask if I co-uld bring so-me-one over
to see you la-ter, Gram. A vi-si-tor." Her vo-ice drops to a hush, and the glow is back. "From
Out-si-de."
I lo-ok at her spark-ling blue eyes, at Rac-hel's fa-ce, and I don't ha-ve the he-art to re-fu-se. Even

tho-ugh I can gu-ess, as the two girls can-not, how the vi-sit will be. I am not Jen-nie's grand-mot-her,
but she has cal-led me that sin-ce she was three. "All right."
"Oh, thank you!" Jen-nie cri-es, and she and Rac-hel lo-ok at each ot-her with de-light. "I'm so glad
you sa-id yes, or el-se we might ne-ver get to talk to a vi-si-tor up clo-se at all!"
"You're wel-co-me," I say. They are so yo-ung. Ma-mie lo-oks pe-tu-lant; her an-no-un-ce-ment has
be-en ups-ta-ged. Pe-ter watc-hes Jen-nie as she im-pul-si-vely hugs Rac-hel. Sud-denly I know that he
too is won-de-ring whe-re Jen-nie's body is di-se-ased, and how much. He catc-hes my eye and lo-oks
at the flo-or, his dark eyes lid-ded, half-asha-med. But only half. A log cack-les in the wo-oden sto-ve,
and for a bri-ef mo-ment the fi-re fla-res.
The next af-ter-no-on Jen-nie brings-the vi-si-tor. He surp-ri-ses me im-me-di-ately: he isn't we-aring
a sa-ni-su-it, and he isn't a so-ci-olo-gist.
In the ye-ars fol-lo-wing the in-tern-ments, the di-se-ase co-lo-ni-es had a lot of vi-si-tors. Doc-tors
still ho-pe-ful of a cu-re for the thick gray rid-ges of skin that spre-ad slowly over a hu-man body-or
didn't, no-body knew why. Dis-fi-gu-ring. Ugly. May-be even-tu-al-ly fa-tal. And com-mu-ni-cab-le.
That was the big-gie: com-mu-ni-cab-le. So doc-tors in sa-ni-su-its ca-me lo-oking for ca-uses or
cu-res. Jo-ur-na-lists in sa-ni-su-its ca-me lo-oking for sto-ri-es with fo-ur-co-lor pho-to spre-ads.
Le-gis-la-ti-ve fact-fin-ding com-mit-te-es in sa-ni-su-its ca-me lo-oking for facts, at le-ast un-til
Cong-ress to-ok away the po-wer of co-lo-ni-es to vo-te, pres-su-red by tax-pa-yers who,
inc-re-asingly pres-su-red them-sel-ves, re-sen-ted our dol-lar-de-pen-dent sta-tus. And the
so-ci-olo-gists ca-me in dro-ves, mi-ni-cams in hand, re-ady to re-cord the col-lap-se of the
ill-orga-ni-zed and ill co-lo-ni-es in-to stre-et-gang, dog-eat-dog anarchy.
Later, when this did not hap-pen, dif-fe-rent so-ci-olo-gists ca-me in la-ter-mo-del sa-ni-su-its to
re-cord the re-asons why the co-lo-ni-es we-re not col-lap-sing on sche-du-le. All the-se gro-ups went
away dis-sa-tis-fi-ed. The-re was no cu-re, no ca-use, no story, no col-lap-se, no re-asons.
The so-ci-olo-gists hung on lon-ger than any-body el-se. Jo-ur-na-lists ha-ve to be ti-mely and
in-te-res-ting, but so-ci-olo-gists me-rely ha-ve to pub-lish. Be-si-des, everyt-hing in the-ir cul-tu-ral
tra-di-ti-on told them that In-si-de must so-oner or la-ter de-ge-ne-ra-te in-to war zo-nes: Dep-ri-ve
pe-op-le of elect-ri-city (po-wer be-ca-me ex-pen-si-ve), of mu-ni-ci-pal po-li-ce (who re-fu-sed to go
In-si-de), of fre-edom to le-ave, of po-li-ti-cal clo-ut, of jobs, of fre-eways and mo-vie the-at-res and
fe-de-ral jud-ges and sta-te ad-mi-nis-te-red ele-men-tary scho-ol ac-cre-di-ta-ti-on-and you get
un-rest-ra-ined vi-olen-ce to just sur-vi-ve. Everyt-hing in the cul-tu-re sa-id so. Bom-bed-out in-ner
ci-ti-es. Lord of the Fli-es. The Chi-ca-go pro-j-ects. Wes-tern mo-vi-es. Pri-son me-mo-irs. The
Bronx. East L.A. Tho-mas Hob-bes. The so-ci-olo-gists knew.
Only it didn't hap-pen.
The so-ci-olo-gists wa-ited. And In-si-de we le-ar-ned to grow ve-ge-tab-les and ra-ise chic-kens
who, we le-ar-ned, will eat anyt-hing. Tho-se of us with com-pu-ter know-led-ge wor-ked re-al jobs
over mo-dems for a few ye-ars-may-bes it was as long as a de-ca-de-be-fo-re the equ-ip-ment
be-ca-me too ob-so-le-te and un-rep-la-ced. Tho-se who had be-en te-ac-hers or-ga-ni-zed clas-ses
among the child-ren, alt-ho-ugh the cur-ri-cu-lum, I think, must ha-ve got-ten simp-ler every ye-ar:
Rac-hel and Jen-nie don't se-em to ha-ve much know-led-ge of his-tory or sci-en-ce. Doc-tors
prac-ti-ced with me-di-ci-nes do-na-ted by cor-po-ra-ti-ons for the tax wri-te-offs, and af-ter a
de-ca-de or so they be-gan to tra-in ap-pren-ti-ces. For a whi-le-it might ha-ve be-en a long whi-le-we
lis-te-ned to ra-di-os and watc-hed TV. May-be so-me pe-op-le still do, if we ha-ve any wor-king ones
do-na-ted from Out-si-de.
Eventually the so-ci-olo-gists re-mem-be-red ol-der mo-dels of dep-ri-va-ti-on and
disc-ri-mi-na-ti-on and iso-la-ti-on from the lar-ger cul-tu-re: Jewish shtetls. French Hu-gu-enots. Amish
far-mers. Self-suf-fi-ci-ent mo-dels, stag-nant but un-col-lap-sed. And whi-le they we-re
re-mem-be-ring, we held go-ods lot-te-ri-es, and to-ok on ap-pren-ti-ces, and ra-ti-oned de-po-si-tory
fo-od ac-cor-ding to who ne-eded it, and rep-la-ced our bro-ken-down fur-ni-tu-re with ot-her
bro-ken-down fur-ni-tu-re, and got mar-ri-ed and bo-re child-ren. We pa-id no ta-xes, fo-ught no wars,

wi-el-ded no vo-tes, pro-vi-ded no dra-ma. Af-ter a whi-le-a long whi-le-the vi-si-tors stop-ped
co-ming. Even the so-ci-olo-gists.
But he-re stands this yo-ung man, wit-ho-ut a sa-ni-su-it, smi-ling from brown eyes un-der thick dark
ha-ir and ta-king my hand. He do-esn't win-ce when he to-uc-hes the ro-pes of di-se-ase. Nor do-es he
ap-pe-ar to be ca-ta-lo-gu-ing the kitc-hen fur-ni-tu-re for la-ter re-cor-ding: three cha-irs, one
do-na-ted imi-ta-ti-on Qu-e-en An-ne and one In-si-de ge-nu-ine Joe Kle-insch-midt; the tab-le; the
wo-od sto-ve; the spark-ling new Ori-en-tal lac-qu-ered cup-bo-ard; plas-tic sink with hand pump
con-nec-ted to the re-ser-vo-ir pi-pe from Out-si-de; wo-od-box with do-na-ted wo-od stam-ped "Gift
of Bo-ise-Cas-ca-de"; two eager and in-tel-li-gent and lo-ving yo-ung girls he had bet-ter not try to
pat-ro-ni-ze as di-se-ased fre-aks. It has be-en a long ti-me, but I re-mem-ber.
"Hello, Mrs. Pratt. I'm Tom McHa-be. Thank you for ag-re-e-ing to talk to me."
I nod. "What are we go-ing to talk abo-ut, Mr. McHa-be? Are you a jo-ur-na-list?"
"No. I'm a doc-tor."
I didn't ex-pect that. Nor do I ex-pect the sud-den stra-in that flas-hes ac-ross his fa-ce be-fo-re it's
lost in anot-her smi-le. Alt-ho-ugh it is na-tu-ral eno-ugh that stra-in sho-uld be the-re: Ha-ving co-me
In-si-de, of co-ur-se, he can ne-ver le-ave. I won-der whe-re he pic-ked up the di-se-ase. No ot-her
new ca-ses ha-ve be-en ad-mit-ted to our co-lony for as long as I co-uld re-mem-ber. Had they be-en
ta-ken, for so-me Out-si-de po-li-ti-cal re-ason, to one of the ot-her co-lo-ni-es ins-te-ad?
McHabe says, "I don't ha-ve the di-se-ase, Mrs. Pratt."
"Then why on earth-"
"I'm wri-ting a pa-per on the prog-ress of the di-se-ase in long-estab-lis-hed co-lony re-si-dents. I
ha-ve to do that from In-si-de, of co-ur-se," he says, and im-me-di-ately I know he is lying. Rac-hel and
Jen-nie, of co-ur-se, do not. They sit one on each si-de of him li-ke eager birds, lis-te-ning.
"And how will you get this pa-per out on-ce it's writ-ten?" I sa-id. "Short-wa-ve ra-dio. Col-le-agu-es
are ex-pec-ting it," but he do-esn't qu-ite me-et my eyes.
"And this pa-per is worth per-ma-nent in-tern-ment?"
"How ra-pidly did yo-ur ca-se of the di-se-ase prog-ress?" he says, not ans-we-ring my qu-es-ti-on.
He lo-oks at my fa-ce and hands and fo-re-arms, an obj-ec-ti-ve and pro-fes-si-onal scru-tiny that
ma-kes me de-ci-de at le-ast one part of his story is true. He is a doc-tor.
"Any pa-in in the in-fec-ted are-as?"
"None."
"Any func-ti-onal di-sa-bi-lity or dec-re-ased ac-ti-vity as a re-sult of the di-se-ase?" Rac-hel and
Jen-nie lo-ok slightly puz-zled; he's tes-ting me to see if I un-ders-tand the ter-mi-no-logy.
"None."
"Any chan-ge in ap-pe-aran-ce over the last few ye-ars in the first skin are-as to be af-fec-ted?
Chan-ges in co-lo-ur or tis-sue den-sity or si-ze of the thic-ke-ned rid-ges?"
"None."
"Any ot-her kinds of chan-ges I ha-ven't tho-ught to men-ti-on?" "No-ne."
He nods and rocks back on his he-els. He's co-ol, for so-me-one who is go-ing to de-ve-lop
non-dysfunc-ti-onal ro-pes of di-se-ase him-self. I wa-it to see if he's go-ing to tell me why he's re-al-ly
he-re. The si-len-ce lengt-hens. Fi-nal-ly McHa-be says, "You we-re a CPA," at the sa-me ti-me that
Rac-hel says, "Anyo-ne want a glass of 'ade?"
McHabe ac-cepts gladly. The two girls, re-li-eved to be in mo-ti-on, busy them-sel-ves pum-ping
cold wa-ter, crus-hing can-ned pe-ac-hes, mi-xing the 'ade in a brown plas-tic pitc-her with a de-ep
wart on one si-de whe-re it on-ce to-uc-hed the hot sto-ve.
"Yes," I say to McHa-be, "I was a CPA. What abo-ut it?"
"They're out-la-wed now."
"CPAs? Why? Sta-unch pil-lars of the es-tab-lish-ment," I say, and re-ali-ze how long it's be-en
sin-ce I used words li-ke that. They tas-te me-tal-lic, li-ke old tin.
"Not any-mo-re. IRS do-es all tax com-pu-ta-ti-ons and sends every ho-use-hold a cus-to-mi-zed
bill. The cal-cu-la-ti-ons on how they re-ach yo-ur par-ti-cu-lar cus-to-mi-zed fi-gu-re is clas-si-fi-ed.

To pre-vent fo-re-ign ene-mi-es from gu-es-sing at re-ve-nue ava-ilab-le for de-fen-se."
"Ah."
"My unc-le was a CPA." "What is he now?"
"Not a CPA," McHa-be says. He do-esn't smi-le. Jen-nie hands glas-ses of 'ade to me and then to
McHa-be, and then he do-es smi-le. Jen-nie drops her las-hes and a lit-tle co-lo-ur ste-als in-to her
che-eks. So-met-hing mo-ves be-hind McHa-be's eyes. But it's not li-ke Pe-ter; not at all li-ke Pe-ter.
I glan-ce at Rac-hel. She do-esn't se-em to ha-ve no-ti-ced anyt-hing. She isn't je-alo-us, or
wor-ri-ed, or hurt. I re-lax a lit-tle.
McHabe says to me. "You al-so Pub-lis-hed that ar-ti-cal."
"How do you hap-pen to know that?"
Again he do-esn't ans-wer me. "It's an unu-su-al com-bi-na-ti-on of abi-li-ti-es, ac-co-un-ting and
his-tory wri-ting."
"I sup-po-se so," I say, wit-ho-ut in-te-rest. It was so long ago. Rac-hel says to McHa-be, "Can I ask
you so-met-hing?"
"Sure."
"Outside, do you ha-ve me-di-ci-nes that will cu-re wo-od of ter-mi-tes?"
Her fa-ce is de-adly se-ri-o-us. McHa-be do-esn't grin, and I ad-mit-re-luc-tantly-that he is li-kab-le.
He ans-wers her co-ur-te-o-usly. "We don't cu-re the wo-od, we do away with the ter-mi-tes. The best
way is to bu-ild with wo-od sa-tu-ra-ted with cre-oso-te, a che-mi-cal they don't li-ke, so that they don't
get in-to the wo-od in the first pla-ce. But the-re must be che-mi-cals that will kill them af-ter they're
al-re-ady the-re. I'll ask aro-und and try to bring you so-met-hing on my next trip In-si-de."
His next trip In-si-de. He drops this bombs-hell as if easy pas-sa-ge In and Out we-re a gi-ven.
Rac-hel's and Jen-nie's eyes grow wi-de; they both lo-ok at me. McHa-be do-es, too, and I see that his
lo-ok is a co-ol scru-tiny, an ap-pra-isal of my re-ac-ti-on. He ex-pects me to ask for de-ta-ils, or
may-be even-it's be-en a long ti-me sin-ce I tho-ught in the-se terms, and it's an ef-fort-to be-co-me
angry at him for lying. But I don't know whet-her or not he's lying, and at any ra-te, what do-es it
mat-ter? A few pe-op-le from Out-si-de co-ming in-to the co-lony-how co-uld it af-fect us? The-re
won't be lar-ge im-mig-ra-ti-on, and no emig-ra-ti-on at all.
I say qu-i-etly, "Why are you re-al-ly he-re, Dr. McHa-be?"
"I told you, Mrs. Pratt. To me-asu-re the prog-ress of the di-se-ase." I say not-hing. He adds,
"May-be you'd li-ke to he-ar mo-re abo-ut how it is now Out-si-de." "Not es-pe-ci-al-ly."
"Why not?"
I shrug. "They le-ave us alo-ne."
He we-ighs me with his eyes. Jen-nie says ti-midly, "I'd li-ke to he-ar mo-re abo-ut Out-si-de."
Be-fo-re Rac-hel can add "Me, too," the do-or flings vi-olently open and Ma-mie backs in-to the ro-om,
scre-aming in-to the hall be-hind her.
"And don't ever co-me back! If you think I'd ever let you to-uch me aga-in af-ter scre-wing
that…that…1 ho-pe she's got a di-se-ased twat and you get it on yo-ur-" She se-es McHa-be and
bre-aks off, her who-le body jer-king in ra-ge. A soft ans-wer from the hall, the words unin-tel-li-gib-le
from my cha-ir by the fi-re, ma-kes her gasp and turn even red-der. She slams the do-or, bursts in-to
te-ars, and runs in-to her bed-ro-om, slam-ming that do-or as well.
Rachel stands up. "Let me, ho-ney," I say, but be-fo-re I can ri-se-my arth-ri-tis is much
bet-ter-Rac-hel di-sap-pe-ars in-to her mot-her's ro-om. The kitc-hen rings with em-bar-ras-sed
si-len-ce.
Tom McHa-be ri-ses to le-ave. "Sit down, Doc-tor," I say, ho-ping, I think, that if he re-ma-ins
Ma-mie will rest-ra-in her hyste-rics-may-be-and Rac-hel will emer-ge so-oner from her mot-her's
ro-om.
McHabe lo-oks un-de-ci-ded. Then Jen-nie says, "Yes, ple-ase stay. And wo-uld you tell us -" I see
her awk-ward-ness, her de-si-re to not so-und stu-pid "-abo-ut how pe-op-le do Out-si-de?"
He do-es. Lo-oking at Jen-nie but me-aning me, he talks abo-ut the la-test ver-si-on of mar-ti-al law,

abo-ut the fa-ilu-re of the Na-ti-onal Gu-ard to cont-rol pro-tes-tors aga-inst the So-uth Ame-ri-can war
un-til they ac-tu-al-ly re-ac-hed the ed-ge of the Whi-te Ho-use elect-ro-wi-red zo-ne; abo-ut the
gro-wing po-wer of the Fun-da-men-ta-list un-derg-ro-und that the ot-her un-derg-ro-unds-he uses the
plu-ral-call "the God gang." He tells us abo-ut the in-dust-ri-es lo-sing out ste-adily to Ko-re-an and
Chi-ne-se com-pe-ti-tors, the le-aping unemp-loy-ment ra-te, the eth-nic back-lash, the ci-ti-es in
fla-mes. Mi-ami. New York. Los An-ge-les-the-se had be-en ri-oting for ye-ars. Now it's Port-land, St.
Lo-u-is, At-lan-ta, Pho-enix. Grand Ra-pids bur-ning. It's hard to pic-tu-re.
I say, "As far as I can tell, do-na-ti-ons to our re-po-si-to-ri-es ha-ven't fal-len off."
He lo-oks at me aga-in with that shrewd scru-tiny, we-ig-hing so-met-hing I can't see, then to-uc-hes
the ed-ge of the sto-ve with one bo-ot. The bo-ot, I no-ti-ce, is al-most as old and scar-red as one of
ours. "Ko-re-an-ma-de sto-ve. They ma-ke ne-arly all the do-na-ti-ons now. Pub-lic re-la-ti-ons. Even
a lot of mar-ti-al-law Cong-res-smen had re-la-ti-ves in-ter-red, alt-ho-ugh they won't ad-mit it now.
The Asi-ans cut de-als war-ding off comp-le-te pro-tec-ti-onism, alt-ho-ugh of co-ur-se yo-ur
do-na-ti-ons are only a small part of that. But just abo-ut everyt-hing you get In-si-de is Chink or Splat."
He uses the words ca-su-al-ly, this co-ur-te-o-us yo-ung man gi-ving me the news from such a li-be-ral
slant, and that tells me mo-re abo-ut the Out-si-de than all his bul-le-tins and sum-ma-ri-es.
Jennie says hal-tingly, "I saw… I think it was an Asi-an man. Yes-ter-day."
"Where?" I say sharply. Very few Asi-an Ame-ri-cans cont-ract the di-se-ase; so-met-hing el-se no
one un-ders-tands. The-re are no-ne in our co-lony.
"At the Rim. One of the gu-ards. Two ot-her men we-re kic-king him and yel-ling na-mes at him-we
co-uldn't he-ar too cle-arly over the in-ter-com bo-xes."
"We? You and Rac-hel? What we-re you two do-ing at the Rim?" I say, and he-ard my own to-ne.
The Rim, a wi-de empty strip of land, is elect-ro-mi-ned and barb-wi-red to ke-ep us
com-mu-ni-cab-les In-si-de. The Rim is sur-ro-un-ded by mi-les of de-fo-li-ated and di-sin-fec-ted land,
po-iso-ned by pre-ven-ti-ve che-mi-cals, but even so it's pat-rol-led by un-wil-ling sol-di-ers who
com-mu-ni-ca-te with the In-si-de by in-ter-coms set up every half-mi-le on both si-des of the bar-bed
wi-re. When the co-lony used to ha-ve a fight or a ra-pe or-once, in the early ye-ars-a mur-der, it
hap-pe-ned on the Rim. When the ha-te-ful and the ha-ting ca-me to hurt us be-ca-use be-fo-re the
elec-ro-wi-ring and bar-bed wi-re we we-re easy tar-gets and no po-li-ce wo-uld fol-low them In-si-de,
the sol-di-ers, and so-me-ti-mes our men as well, stop-ped them at the Rim. Our de-ad are bu-ri-ed
ne-ar the Rim. And Rac-hel and Jen-nie, de-ar gods, at the Rim…
"We went to ask the gu-ards over the in-ter-com bo-xes if they knew how to stop ter-mi-tes," Jen-nie
says lo-gi-cal-ly. "After all, the-ir work is to stop things, germs and things. We tho-ught they might be
ab-le to tell us how to stop ter-mi-tes. We tho-ught they might ha-ve spe-ci-al tra-ining in it."
The bed-ro-om do-or opens and Rac-hel co-mes out, her yo-ung fa-ce drawn. McHa-be smi-les at
her, and then his ga-ze re-turns to Jen-nie."I don't think sol-di-ers are tra-ined in stop-ping ter-mi-tes, but
I'll de-fi-ni-tely brim?
On his se-cond vi-sit to me six days la-ter, just be-fo-re the Block dan-ce, Tom McHa-be se-ems
dif-fe-rent. I'd for-got-ten that the-re are pe-op-le who ra-di-ate such energy and pur-po-se that they
se-em to set the very air ting-ling. He stands with his legs bra-ced slightly apart, flan-ked by Rac-hel and
Jen-nie, both dres-sed in the-ir ot-her skirts for the dan-ce. Jen-nie has wo-ven a red rib-bon thro-ugh
her blon-de curls; it glows li-ke a flo-wer. McHa-be to-uc-hes her lightly on the sho-ul-der, and I
re-ali-ze from her ans-we-ring lo-ok what must be hap-pe-ning bet-we-en them. My thro-at tigh-tens.
"I want to be ho-nest with you, Mrs. Pratt. I've tal-ked to Jack Ste-ven-son and Mary Kra-mer, as
well as so-me ot-hers in Blocks C and E, and I've got-ten a fe-el for how you li-ve he-re. A lit-tle bit,
any-way. I'm go-ing to tell Mr. Ste-ven-son and Mrs. Kra-mer what I tell you, but I wan-ted you to be
first."
"Why?" I say, mo-re harshly than I in-tend. Or think I in-tend.
He isn't fa-zed. "Be-ca-use you're one of the ol-dest sur-vi-vors of the di-se-ase. Be-ca-use you had
a strong edu-ca-ti-on Out-si-de. Be-ca-use yo-ur da-ugh-ter's hus-band di-ed of axo-pe-ri-di-ne."

At the sa-me mo-ment that I re-ali-ze what McHa-be is go-ing to say next, I re-ali-ze too that Rac-hel
and Jen-nie ha-ve al-re-ady he-ard it. They lis-ten to him with the slightly open-mo-ut-hed in-ten-sity of
child-ren he-aring a mar-vel-lo-us but fa-mi-li-ar ta-le. But do they un-ders-tand? Rac-hel wasn't
pre-sent when her fat-her fi-nal-ly di-ed, gas-ping for air his lungs co-uldn't use.
McHabe, watc-hing me, says, "The-re's be-en a lot of re-se-arch on the di-se-ase sin-ce tho-se
de-aths, Mrs. Pratt."
"No. The-re hasn't. Too risky, yo-ur go-vern-ment sa-id."
I see that he ca-ught the pro-no-un. "Actu-al ad-mi-nist-ra-ti-on of any cu-res is il-le-gal, yes. To
mi-ni-mi-ze con-tact with com-mu-ni-cab-les." "So how has this 're-se-arch' be-en car-ri-ed on?"
"By doc-tors wil-ling to go In-si-de and not co-me out aga-in. Da-ta is trans-mit-ted out by la-ser. In
co-de."
"What cle-an doc-tor wo-uld be wil-ling to go In-si-de and not co-me out aga-in?"
McHabe smi-les; aga-in I'm struck by that qu-ality of spon-ta-ne-o-us energy. "Oh, you'd be
surp-ri-sed. We had three doc-tors in-si-de the Pen-nsyl-va-nia co-lony. One past re-ti-re-ment age.
Anot-her, an old-style Cat-ho-lic, who de-di-ca-ted his re-se-arch to God. A third no-body co-uld
fi-gu-re out, a do-ur per-sis-tent guy who was a bril-li-ant re-se-arc-her."
Was. "And you."
"No," McHa-be says qu-i-etly. "I go in and out." "What hap-pe-ned to the ot-hers?"
"They're de-ad." He ma-kes a bri-ef abor-ted mo-ve-ment with his right hand and I re-ali-ze that he is,
or was, a smo-ker. How long sin-ce I had re-ac-hed li-ke that for a non-exis-tent ci-ga-ret-te? Ne-arly
two de-ca-des. Ci-ga-ret-tes are not among the things pe-op-le do-na-te; they're too va-lu-ab-le. Yet I
re-cog-ni-ze the mo-ve-ment still. "Two of the three doc-tors ca-ught the di-se-ase. They wor-ked on
them-sel-ves as well as vo-lun-te-ers. Then one day the go-vern-ment in-ter-cep-ted the re-la-yed da-ta
and went in and dest-ro-yed everyt-hing."
"Why?" Jen-nie asks.
"Research on the di-se-ase is il-le-gal. Ever-yo-ne Out-si-de is af-ra-id of a le-ak: a vi-rus so-me-how
get-ting out on a mos-qu-ito, a bird, even as a spo-re." "Not-hing has got-ten out in all the-se ye-ars,"
Rac-hel says.
"No. But the go-vern-ment is af-ra-id that if re-se-arc-hers start spli-cing and in-ter-cut-ting ge-nes, it
co-uld ma-ke vi-ru-ses mo-re vi-ab-le. You don t un-ders-tand the Out-si-de, Rac-hel. Everyt-hing is
il-le-gal. This is the most rep-res-si-ve pe-ri-od in Ame-ri-can his-tory. Ever-yo-ne's af-ra-id."
"You're not," Jen-nie says, so softly I ba-rely he-ar her. McHa-be gi-ves her a smi-le that twists my
he-art.
"Some of us ha-ven't gi-ven up. Re-se-arch go-es on. But it's all un-derg-ro-und, all the-ore-ti-cal.
And we've le-ar-ned a lot. We've le-ar-ned that the vi-rus do-esn't just af-fect the skin. The-re are-"
"Be qu-i-et," I say, be-ca-use I see that he's abo-ut to say so-met-hing im-por-tant. "Be qu-i-et a
mi-nu-te. Let me think."
McHabe wa-its. Jen-nie and Rac-hel lo-ok at me, that glow of sup-pres-sed ex-ci-te-ment on them
both. Even-tu-al-ly I find it. "You want so-met-hing, Dr. McHa-be. All this re-se-arch wants so-met-hing
from us be-si-des pu-re sci-en-ti-fic joy. With things Out-si-de as bad as you say, the-re must be plenty
of di-se-ases Out-si-de you co-uld re-se-arch wit-ho-ut kil-ling yo-ur-self, plenty of ne-ed among yo-ur
own pe-op-le-" he nods, his eyes gle-aming "-but you're he-re. In-si-de. Why? We don't ha-ve any
mo-re new or in-te-res-ting symptoms, we ba-rely sur-vi-ve, the Out-si-de stop-ped ca-ring what
hap-pe-ned to us a long ti-me ago. We ha-ve not-hing. So why are you he-re?"
"You're wrong, Mrs. Pratt. You do ha-ve so-met-hing in-te-res-ting go-ing on he-re. You ha-ve
sur-vi-ved. Yo-ur so-ci-ety has reg-res-sed but not col-lap-sed. You're func-ti-oning un-der
con-di-ti-ons whe-re you sho-uldn't ha-ve."
The sa-me old crap. I ra-ise my eyeb-rows at him. He sta-res in-to the fi-re and says qu-i-etly, "To
say Was-hing-ton is ri-oting says not-hing. You ha-ve to see a twel-ve-ye-ar-old hurl a ho-me-ma-de
bomb, a man sli-ced open from neck to crotch be-ca-use he still has a job to go to and his ne-igh-bo-ur
do-esn't, a three-ye-ar-old left to star-ve be-ca-use so-me-one aban-do-ned her li-ke an un-wan-ted

kit-ten…You don't know. It do-esn't hap-pen In-si-de."
"We're bet-ter than they are," Rac-hel says. I lo-ok at my grandc-hild. She says it simply, wit-ho-ut
self-aggran-di-ze-ment, but with a kind of won-der. In the fi-re-light the thic-ke-ned gray ro-pes of skin
ac-ross her che-ek glow dull ma-ro-on.
McHabe sa-id, "Per-haps you are. I star-ted to say ear-li-er that we've le-ar-ned that the vi-rus
do-esn't af-fect just the skin. It al-ters ne-urot-rans-mit-ter re-cep-tor si-tes in the bra-in as well. It's a
re-la-ti-vely slow trans-for-ma-ti-on, which is why the flurry of re-se-arch in the early ye-ars of the
di-se-ase mis-sed it. But it's re-al, as re-al as the fas-ter si-te-ca-pa-city trans-for-ma-ti-ons bro-ught
abo-ut by, say, co-ca-ine. Are you fol-lo-wing me, Mrs. Pratt?"
I nod. Jen-nie and Rac-hel don't lo-ok lost, alt-ho-ugh they don't know any of this vo-ca-bu-lary, and
I re-cog-ni-ze that McHa-be must ha-ve exp-la-ined all this to them,
"As the di-se-ase prog-res-ses to the bra-in, the re-cep-tors which re-ce-ive ex-ci-tory trans-mit-ters
slowly be-co-me har-der to en-ga-ge, and the re-cep-tors which re-ce-ive in-hi-bi-ting trans-mit-ters
be-co-me easi-er to en-ga-ge."
"You me-an that we be-co-me stu-pi-der."
"Oh, no! In-tel-li-gen-ce is not af-fec-ted at all. The re-sults are emo-ti-onal and be-ha-vi-o-ural, not
in-tel-lec-tu-al. You be-co-me-all of you-cal-mer. Di-sinc-li-ned to ac-ti-on or in-no-va-ti-on. Mildly but
de-fi-ni-tely dep-res-sed."
The fi-re burns down. I pick up the po-ker, bent slightly whe-re so-me-one on-ce tri-ed to use it as a
crow-bar, and po-ke at the log, which is a per-fectly sha-ped mo-ul-ded-pulp synthe-tic stam-ped
"Do-na-ted by We-yer-ha-e-user-Sey-yed." "I don't fe-el dep-res-sed, yo-ung man."
"It's a dep-res-si-on of the ner-vo-us system, but a new kind-wit-ho-ut the ho-pe-les-sness usu-al-ly
as-so-ci-ated with cli-ni-cal dep-res-si-on." "I don't be-li-eve you."
"Really? With all due co-ur-tesy, when was the last ti-me you-or any of the ol-der Block
le-aders-pus-hed for any sig-ni-fi-cant chan-ge in how you do things In-si-de?"
"Sometimes things can-not be const-ruc-ti-vely chan-ged. Only ac-cep-ted. That's not che-mistry, its
re-ality."
"Not Out-si-de," McHa-be says grimly. "Out-si-de they don't chan-ge const-ruc-ti-vely or ac-cept.
They get vi-olent. In-si-de, you've had al-most no vi-olen-ce sin-ce the early ye-ars, even when yo-ur
re-so-ur-ces tigh-te-ned aga-in and aga-in. When was the last ti-me you tas-ted but-ter, Mrs. Pratt, or
smo-ked a ci-ga-ret-te, or had a new pa-ir of je-ans? Do you know what hap-pens Out-si-de when
con-su-mer go-ods be-co-me una-va-ilab-le and the-re are no po-li-ce in a gi-ven area? But In-si-de
you just dist-ri-bu-te wha-te-ver you ha-ve as fa-irly as you can, or ma-ke do wit-ho-ut. No lo-oting, no
ri-oting, no can-ce-ro-us envy. No one Out-si-de knew why. Now we do."
"We ha-ve envy."
"But it do-esn't erupt in-to an-ger."
Each ti-me one of us spe-aks, Jen-nie and Rac-hel turn the-ir he-ads to watch, li-ke rapt spec-ta-tors
at ten-nis. Which ne-it-her of them has ever se-en. Jen-nie's skin glows li-ke pe-arl.
"Our yo-ung pe-op-le aren't vi-olent eit-her, and the di-se-ase hasn't ad-van-ced very far in so-me of
them."
"They le-arn how to be-ha-ve from the-ir el-ders-just li-ke kids everyw-he-re el-se."
"I don't fe-el dep-res-sed."
"Do you fe-el ener-ge-tic?"
"I ha-ve arth-ri-tis."
"That's not what I me-an."
"What do you me-an, Doc-tor?"
Again that rest-less, fur-ti-ve re-ach for a non-exis-tent ci-ga-ret-te. But his vo-ice is qu-i-et. "How
long did it ta-ke you to get aro-und to ap-plying that in-sec-ti-ci-de I got Rac-hel for the ter-mi-tes? She
told me you for-bid her to do it, and I think you we-re right; it's dan-ge-ro-us stuff. How many days went
by be-fo-re you or yo-ur da-ugh-ter spre-ad it aro-und?"
The che-mi-cal is still in its can.

"How much an-ger are you fe-eling now, Mrs. Pratt?" he go-es on. "Be-ca-use I think we
un-ders-tand each ot-her, you and I, and that you gu-ess now why I'm he-re. But you aren't sho-uting or
or-de-ring me out of he-re or even tel-ling me what you think of me. You're lis-te-ning, and you're do-ing
it calmly, and you're ac-cep-ting what I tell you even tho-ugh you know what I want you to -"
The do-or opens and he bre-aks off. Ma-mie flo-un-ces in, fol-lo-wed by Pe-ter. She scowls and
stamps her fo-ot. "Whe-re we-re you, Rac-hel? We've be-en stan-ding out-si-de wa-iting for you all for
ten mi-nu-tes now! The dan-ce has al-re-ady star-ted!"
"A few mo-re mi-nu-tes, Ma-ma. We're tal-king."
"Talking? Abo-ut what? What's go-ing on?"
"Nothing," McHa-be says. "I was just as-king yo-ur mot-her so-me qu-es-ti-ons abo-ut li-fe In-si-de.
I'm sorry we to-ok so long."
"You ne-ver ask me qu-es-ti-ons abo-ut li-fe In-si-de. And be-si-des, I want to dan-ce!"
McHabe says, "If you and Pe-ter want to go ahe-ad, I'll bring Rac-hel and Jen-me.
Mamie chews her bot-tom lip. I sud-denly know that she wants to walk up the stre-et to the dan-ce
bet-we-en Pe-ter and McHa-be, an arm lin-ked with each, the girls tra-iling be-hind. McHa-be me-ets
her eyes ste-adily.
"Well, if that's what you want," she says pet-tishly. "Co-me on, Pe-te!" She clo-ses the do-or hard.
I lo-ok at McHa-be, un-wil-ling to vo-ice the qu-es-ti-on in front of Rac-hel, trus-ting him to know the
ar-gu-ment I want to ma-ke. He do-es. "In cli-ni-cal dep-res-si-on, the-re's al-ways be-en a small
per-cen-ta-ge for whom the il-lness is ma-ni-fes-ted not as pas-si-vity but as ir-ri-ta-bi-lity. It may be the
sa-me. We don't know."
"Gram," Rac-hel says, as if she can't con-ta-in her-self any lon-ger, "he has a cu-re."
"For the skin ma-ni-fes-ta-ti-on only," McHa-be says qu-ickly, and I see that he wo-uldn't ha-ve
cho-sen to blurt it out that way. Not for the ef-fects on the bra-in."
I say, des-pi-te myself, "How can you cu-re one wit-ho-ut the ot-her?"
He runs his hand thro-ugh his ha-ir. Thick, brown ha-ir. I watch Jen-nie watch his hand. "Skin tis-sue
and bra-in tis-sue aren't ali-ke, Mrs. Pratt. The vi-rus re-ac-hes both the skin and the bra-in at the sa-me
ti-me, but the chan-ges to bra-in tis-sue, which is much mo-re comp-lex, ta-ke much lon-ger to de-tect.
And they can't be re-ver-sed-ner-ve tis-sue is non-re-ge-ne-ra-ti-ve. If you cut yo-ur fin-ger-tip, it will
even-tu-al-ly bre-ak down and rep-la-ce the da-ma-ged cells to he-al it-self. Shit, if you're yo-ung
eno-ugh, you can grow an en-ti-re new fin-ger-tip. So-met-hing li-ke that is what we think our cu-re will
sti-mu-la-te the skin to do.
"But if you da-ma-ge yo-ur cor-tex, tho-se cells are go-ne fo-re-ver. And un-less anot-her part of the
bra-in can le-arn to com-pen-sa-te, wha-te-ver be-ha-vi-o-ur tho-se cells go-ver-ned is al-so chan-ged
fo-re-ver."
"Changed in-to dep-res-si-on, you me-an."
"Into calm-ness. In-to rest-ra-int of ac-ti-on…The co-untry des-pe-ra-tely ne-eds rest-ra-int, Mrs.
Pratt."
"And so you want to ta-ke so-me of us Out-si-de, cu-re the skin ro-pes, and let the 'dep-res-si-on
spre-ad: the 'rest-ra-int,' the 'slow-ness to act'…"
"We ha-ve eno-ugh ac-ti-on out the-re. And no one can cont-rol it-it's all the wrong kind. What we
ne-ed now is to slow everyt-hing down a lit-tle-be-fo-re the-re's not-hing left to slow down."
"You'd in-fect a who-le po-pu-la-ti-on-"
"Slowly. Gently. For the-ir own go-od-"
"Is that up to you to de-ci-de?"
"Considering the al-ter-na-ti-ve, yes. Be-ca-use it works. The co-lo-ni-es work, des-pi-te all yo-ur
dep-ri-va-ti-ons. And they work be-ca-use of the di-se-ase!" "Each new ca-se wo-uld ha-ve skin
ro-pes-" "Which we'll then cu-re."
"Does yo-ur cu-re work, Doc-tor? Rac-hel's fat-her di-ed of a cu-re li-ke yo-urs!"
"Not li-ke ours," he says, and I he-ar in his vo-ice the ut-ter con-vic-ti-on of the yo-ung. Of the
ener-ge-tic. Of the Out-si-de. "This is new, and me-di-cal-ly comp-le-tely dif-fe-rent. This is the right

stra-in."
"And you want me to try this new right stra-in as yo-ur gu-inea pig."
There is a mo-ment of elect-ric si-len-ce. Eyes shift: gray, blue, brown. Even be-fo-re Rac-hel ri-ses
from her sto-ol or McHa-be says, "We think the best chan-ces to avo-id scar-ring are with yo-ung
pe-op-le wit-ho-ut he-avy skin ma-ni-fes-ta-ti-ons," I know. Rac-hel puts her arms aro-und me. And
Jen-nie-Jen-nie with the red rib-bon wo-ven in her ha-ir, sit-ting on her bro-ken cha-ir as on a thro-ne,
Jen-nie who ne-ver he-ard of ne-urot-rans-mit-ters or slow vi-ru-ses or risk cal-cu-la-ti-ons-says simply,
"It has to be me," and lo-oks at McHa-be with eyes shi-ning with lo-ve.
I say no. I send McHa-be away and say no. I re-ason with both girls and say no. They lo-ok
un-hap-pily at each ot-her, and I won-der how long it will be be-fo-re they re-ali-ze they can act
wit-ho-ut per-mis-si-on, wit-ho-ut obe-di-en-ce. But they ne-ver ha-ve.
We ar-gue for ne-arly an ho-ur, and then I in-sist they go on to the dan-ce, and that I go with them.
The night is cold. Jen-nie puts on her swe-ater, a he-avy hand-knit-ted gar-ment that co-vers her
sha-pe-les-sly from neck to kne-es. Rac-hel drags on her co-at, a black do-na-ted synthe-tic fra-yed at
cuffs and hem. As we go out the do-or, she stops me with a hand on my arm.
"Gram-why did you say no?"
"Why? Ho-ney, I've be-en tel-ling you for an ho-ur. The risk, the dan-ger.
"Is it that? Or-" I can fe-el her in the dark-ness of the hall, gat-he-ring her-self to-get-her "-or is
it-don't be mad, Gram, ple-ase don't be mad at me-is it be-ca-use the cu-re is a new thing, a chan-ge?
A…dif-fe-rent thing you don't want be-ca-use it's ex-ci-ting? Li-ke Tom sa-id?"
"No, it isn't that," I say, and fe-el her ten-se be-si-de me, and for the first ti-me in her li-fe I don't
know what the ten-sing me-ans.
We go down the stre-et to-wards Block B. The-re's a mo-on and stars, tiny high pin-po-ints of cold
light. Block B is furt-her lit by ke-ro-se-ne lamps and by torc-hes stuck in the gro-und in front of the
pe-eling bar-racks walls that form the che-er-less squ-are. Or do-es it only se-em che-er-less be-ca-use
of what McHa-be sa-id? Co-uld we ha-ve do-ne bet-ter than this blank uti-li-ta-ri-anism, this sub-du-ed
ble-ak-ness-this pe-ace? Be-fo-re to-night, I wo-uldn't ha-ve as-ked.
I stand in the dark-ness at the he-ad of the stre-et, just be-yond the squ-are, with Rac-hel and Jen-nie.
The band plays ac-ross from me, a vi-olin, gu-itar, and trum-pet with one val-ve that ke-eps stic-king.
Pe-op-le bund-led in all the clot-hes they own ring the squ-are, clus-te-ring in the circ-les of light aro-und
the torc-hes, tal-king in qu-i-et vo-ices. Six or se-ven co-up-les dan-ce slowly in the mid-dle of the
bar-ren earth, hol-ding each ot-her lo-osely and shuf-fling to a pla-in-ti-ve ver-si-on of "Stars-hips and
Ro-ses." The song was a hit the ye-ar I got the di-se-ase, and then had a re-vi-val a de-ca-de la-ter, the
ye-ar the first man-ned ex-pe-di-ti-on left for Mars. The ex-pe-di-ti-on was sup-po-sed to set up a
co-lony.
Are they still the-re?
We had writ-ten no new songs.
Peter and Ma-mie circ-le among the ot-her co-up-les. "Stars-hips and Ro-ses" ends and the band
be-gins "Yes-ter-day." A turn brings Ma-mie's fa-ce bri-efly in-to full torch-light: it's clenc-hed and tight,
stre-aked with te-ars.
"You sho-uld sit down, Gram," Rac-hel says. This is the first ti-me she's spo-ken to me sin-ce we left
the bar-racks. Her vo-ice is he-avy but not angry, and the-re is no an-ger in Jen-nie's arm as she sets
down the three-leg-ged sto-ol she car-ri-ed for me. Ne-it-her of them is ever re-al-ly angry.
Under my we-ight the sto-ol sinks une-venly in-to the gro-und. A boy, twel-ve or thir-te-en ye-ars
old, co-mes up to Jen-nie and word-les-sly holds out his hand. They jo-in the dan-cing co-up-les. Jack
Ste-ven-son, much mo-re arth-ri-tic than I, hob-bles to-wards me with his grand-son Hal by his si-de.
"Hello, Sa-rah. Be-en a long ti-me."
"Hello, Jack." Thick di-se-ase rid-ges cross both his che-eks and sna-kes down his no-se. On-ce,
long ago, we we-re at Ya-le to-get-her.
"Hal, go dan-ce with Rac-hel," Jack says. "Gi-ve me that sto-ol first." Hal, obe-di-ent, exc-han-ges

the sto-ol for Rac-hel, and Jack lo-wers him-self to sit be-si-de me. "Big do-ings, Sa-rah."
"So I he-ar."
"McHabe told you? All of it? He sa-id he'd be-en to see you just be-fo-re me."
"He told me." "What do you think?" "I don't know."
"He wants Hal to try the cu-re."
Hal. I hadn't tho-ught. The boy's fa-ce is smo-oth and cle-ar, the only vi-sib-le skin rid-ges on his right
hand. I say, "Jen-nie, too."
Jack nods, ap-pa-rently un-surp-ri-sed. "Hal sa-id no."
"Hal did?"
"You me-an Jen-nie didn't?" He sta-res at me. "She'd even con-si-der so-met-hing as dan-ge-ro-us as
an unt-ri-ed cu-re-not to men-ti-on this al-le-ged pas-sing Out-si-de?" I don't ans-wer. Pe-ter and
Ma-mie dan-ce from be-hind the ot-her co-up-les, di-sap-pe-ar aga-in. The song they dan-ce to is slow,
sad, and old.
"Jack-could we ha-ve do-ne bet-ter he-re? With the co-lony?"
Jack watc-hes the dan-cers. Fi-nal-ly he says, "We don't kill each ot-her. We don't burn things down.
We don't ste-al, or at le-ast not much and not crip-plingly. We don't ho-ard. It se-ems to me we've
do-ne bet-ter than an-yo-ne had ever ho-ped. Inc-lu-ding us." His eyes se-arch the dan-cers for Hal.
"He's the best thing in my li-fe, that boy."
Another ra-re flash of me-mory: Jack de-ba-ting in so-me long-for-got-ten po-li-ti-cal sci-en-ce class
at Ya-le, a yo-ung man on fi-re. He stands bra-ced lightly on the balls of his fe-et, le-aning for-ward li-ke
a figh-ter or a dan-cer, the elect-ric lights bril-li-ant on his glossy black ha-ir. Yo-ung wo-men watch him
with the-ir hands qu-i-et on the-ir open text-bo-oks. He has the pro si-de of the de-ba-ting qu-es-ti-on:
Re-sol-ved: Fo-men-ting first-stri-ke third-world wars is an ef-fec-ti-ve met-hod of de-ter-ring nuc-le-ar
conf-lict among su-per-po-wers.
Abruptly the band stops pla-ying. In the cent-re of the squ-are Pe-ter and Ma-mie sho-ut at each
ot-her.
"-saw the way you to-uc-hed her! You bas-tard, you fa-ith-less prick!"
"For God's sa-ke, Ma-mie, not he-re!"
"Why not he-re? You didn't mind dan-cing with her he-re, to-uc-hing her back he-re, and ass and…
and…" She starts to cry. Pe-op-le lo-ok away, em-bar-ras-sed. A wo-man I don't know steps for-ward
and puts a he-si-tant hand on Ma-mie's sho-ul-der. Ma-mie sha-kes it off, her hands to her fa-ce, and
rus-hes away from the squ-are. Pe-ter stands the-re dumbly a mo-ment be-fo-re sa-ying to no one in
par-ti-cu-lar, "I'm sorry. Ple-ase dan-ce." He walks to-wards the band who be-gin, rag-gedly, to play
"Didn't We Al-most Ha-ve It All." The song is twenty-fi-ve ye-ars old. Jack Ste-ven-son says, "Can I
help,
Sarah? With yo-ur girl?" "How?"
"I don't know," he says, and of co-ur-se he do-esn't. He of-fers not out of use-ful-ness but out of
em-pathy, kno-wing how the ugly lit-tle sce-ne in the torch-light dep-res-ses me. Do we all so easily
un-ders-tand dep-res-si-on?
Rachel dan-ces by with so-me-one I don't know, a still-fa-ced ol-der man. She throws a wor-ri-ed
glan-ce over his sho-ul-der: now Jen-nie is dan-cing with Pe-ter. I can't see Pe-ter's fa-ce. But I see
Jen-nie's. She lo-oks di-rectly at no one, but then she do-esn't ha-ve to. The mes-sa-ge she's sen-ding is
cle-ar: I for-ba-de her to co-me to the dan-ce with McHa-be, but I didn't for-bid her to dan-ce with
Pe-ter and so she is, even tho-ugh she do-esn't want to, even tho-ugh it's cle-ar from her fa-ce that this
tiny act of de-fi-an-ce ter-ri-fi-es her. Pe-ter tigh-tens his arm and she jerks back-ward aga-inst it,
smi-ling hard.
Kara Des-mond and Rob Cot-trell co-me up to me, bloc-king my vi-ew of the dan-cers. They've
be-en he-re as long as I. Ka-ra has an in-fant gre-at-grandc-hild, one of the ra-re ba-bi-es born
al-re-ady dis-fi-gu-red by the di-se-ase. Ka-ra's dress, which she we-ars over je-ans for warmth, is torn
at the hem; her vo-ice is soft. "Sa-rah. It's gre-at to see you out." Rob says not-hing. He's put on we-ight
in the few ye-ars sin-ce I saw him last. In the flic-ke-ring torch-light his jowly fa-ce shi-nes with the

se-re-nity of a di-se-ased Bud-dha.
It's two mo-re dan-ces be-fo-re I re-ali-ze that Jen-nie has di-sap-pe-ared.
I lo-ok aro-und for Rac-hel. She's po-uring su-mac tea for the band. Pe-ter dan-ces by with a
wo-man not we-aring je-ans un-der her dress; the wo-man is shi-ve-ring and smi-ling. So it isn't Pe-ter
that Jen-nie left with…
"Rob, will you walk me ho-me? In ca-se I stumb-le?" The cold is get-ting to my arth-ri-tis.
Rob nods, in-cu-ri-o-us. Ka-ra says, "I'll co-me, too," and we le-ave Jack Ste-ven-son on his sto-ol,
wa-iting for his turn at hot tea. Ka-ra chat-ters hap-pily as we walk along as fast as I can go, which isn't
as fast as I want to go. The mo-on has set. The gro-und is une-ven and the stre-et dark ex-cept for the
stars and fit-ful lights in bar-racks win-dows. Cand-les. Oil lamps. On-ce, a sing-le po-wer-ful glow from
what I gu-ess to be a do-na-ted sto-red-so-lar light, the only one I've se-en in a long ti-me.
Korean, Tom sa-id.
"You're shi-ve-ring," Ka-ra says. "He-re, ta-ke my co-at." I sha-ke my he-ad.
I ma-ke them le-ave me out-si-de our bar-racks and they do, un-qu-es-ti-oning. Qu-i-etly I open the
do-or to our dark kitc-hen. The sto-ve has go-ne out. The do-or to the back bed-ro-om stands
half-open, vo-ices co-ming from the dark-ness. I shi-ver aga-in, and Ka-ra's co-at wo-uldn't ha-ve
hel-ped.
But I am wrong. The vo-ices aren't Jen-nie and Pe-ter.
"-not what I wan-ted to talk abo-ut just now," Ma-mie says.
"But it's what I want to talk abo-ut."
"Is it?" "Yes."
I stand lis-te-ning to the ri-se and fall of the-ir vo-ices, to the pe-tu-lan-ce in Ma-mie's, the eager-ness
in McHa-be's.
"Jennie is yo-ur ward, isn't she?" "Oh, Jen-nie. Yes. For anot-her ye-ar."
"Then she'll lis-ten to you, even if yo-ur mot-her… the de-ci-si-on is yo-urs. And hers."
"I gu-ess so. But I want to think abo-ut it. I ne-ed mo-re in-for-ma-ti-on." "I'll tell you anyt-hing you
ask."
"Will you? Are you mar-ri-ed, Dr. Tho-mas McHa-be?" Si-len-ce. Then his vo-ice, dif-fe-rent. "Don't
do that." "Are you su-re? Are you re-al-ly su-re?" I m su-re.
"Really, re-al-ly su-re? That you want me to stop?"
I cross the kitc-hen, hit-ting my knee aga-inst an un-se-en cha-ir. In the open do-or-way a sky full of
stars mo-ves in-to vi-ew thro-ugh the ter-mi-te ho-le in the wall.
"Ow!"
"I sa-id to stop it, Mrs. Wil-son. Now ple-ase think abo-ut what I sa-id abo-ut Jen-nie. I'll co-me
back to-mor-row mor-ning and you can-"
"You can go stra-ight to hell!" Ma-mie sho-uts. And then, in a dif-fe-rent vo-ice, stran-gely calm, "Is it
be-ca-use I'm di-se-ased? And you're not? And Jen-nie is not?"
"No. I swe-ar it, no. But I didn't co-me he-re for this."
"No," Ma-mie says in that sa-me chill vo-ice, and I re-ali-ze that I ha-ve ne-ver he-ard it from her
be-fo-re, ne-ver, "you ca-me to help us. To bring a cu-re. To bring the Out-si-de. But not for
every-body. Only for the few who aren't too far go-ne, who aren't too ugly-who you can use."
"It isn't li-ke that-"
"A few who you can res-cue. Le-aving all the rest of us he-re to rot, li-ke we did be-fo-re."
"In ti-me, re-se-arch on the-"
"Time! What do you think ti-me mat-ters In-si-de? Ti-me mat-ters shit he-re! Ti-me only mat-ters
when so-me-one li-ke you co-mes in from the Out-si-de, sho-wing off yo-ur he-althy skin and ma-king it
even wor-se than it was be-fo-re with yo-ur new who-le clot-hing and yo-ur wor-king wrist-watch and
yo-ur shiny ha-ir and yo-ur…yo-ur…" She is sob-bing. I step in-to the ro-om.
"All right, Ma-mie. All right."
Neither of them re-act to se-e-ing me. McHa-be just stands the-re un-til I wa-ve him to-wards the
do-or and he go-es, not sa-ying a word. I put my arms aro-und Ma-mie and she le-ans aga-inst my

bre-ast and cri-es. My da-ugh-ter. Even thro-ugh my co-at I fe-et the thick ropy skin of her che-ek
pres-sing aga-inst me, and all I can think of is that I ne-ver no-ti-ced at all that McHa-be we-ars a
wrist-watch.
Late that night, af-ter Ma-mie has fal-len in-to damp ex-ha-us-ted sle-ep and I ha-ve la-in awa-ke
tos-sing for ho-urs, Rac-hel cre-eps in-to our ro-om to say that Jen-nie and Hal Ste-ven-son ha-ve both
be-en inj-ec-ted with an ex-pe-ri-men-tal di-se-ase cu-re by Tom McHa-be. She's cold and tremb-ling,
de-fi-ant in her fe-ar, af-ra-id of all the-ir ter-rib-le de-fi-an-ce. I hold her un-til she, too, sle-eps, and I
re-mem-ber Jack Ste-ven-son as a yo-ung man, clas-sro-om lights glossy on his thick ha-ir, spi-ri-tedly
ar-gu-ing in fa-vo-ur of the sac-ri-fi-ce of one ci-vi-li-za-ti-on for anot-her.
Mamie le-aves the bar-racks early the next mor-ning. Her eye-lids are still swol-len and shiny from last
night's crying. I gu-ess that she's go-ing to hunt up Pe-ter, and I say not-hing. We sit at the tab-le,
Rac-hel and I, eating our oat-me-al, not lo-oking at each ot-her. It's an ef-fort to even lift the spo-on.
Ma-mie is go-ne a long ti-me.
Later, I pic-tu-re it. La-ter, when Jen-nie and Hal and McHa-be ha-ve co-me and go-ne, I can't stop
pic-tu-ring it: Ma-mie wal-king with her swol-len eye-lids down the muddy stre-ets bet-we-en the
bar-racks, ac-ross the un-pa-ved squ-ares with the-ir cor-ner ve-ge-tab-le gar-dens of ric-kety be-an
po-les and the yel-low gre-en tops of car-rots. Past the de-po-si-to-ri-es with the-ir do-na-ted
Chi-ne-se and Japa-ne-se and Ko-re-an wo-ol and wo-od sto-ves and she-ets of al-loys and
un-gu-ar-ded me-di-ci-nes. Past the chic-ken runs and go-at pens. Past Cent-ral Ad-mi-nist-ra-ti-on,
that dusty cin-der-block bu-il-ding whe-re pe-op-le stop-ped ke-eping re-cords may-be a de-ca-de ago
be-ca-use why wo-uld you ne-ed to pro-ve you'd be-en born or had chan-ged bar-racks? Past the last
of the com-mu-nal wells, re-ac-hing de-ep in-to a com-mon and plen-ti-ful wa-ter tab-le. Ma-mie
wal-king, un-til she re-ac-hes the rim, and is stop-ped, and says what she ca-me to say.
They co-me a few ho-urs la-ter, dres-sed in full sank-su-its and ar-med with auto-ma-tic we-apons
that don't lo-ok Ame-ri-can-ma-de. I can see the-ir fa-ces thro-ugh the cle-ar shat-ter-pro-of plas-tic of
the-ir hel-mets. Three of them sta-re frankly at my fa-ce, at Rac-hel’s, at Hal Ste-ven-son's hands. The
ot-her two won t lo-ok di-rectly at any of us, as if vi-ru-ses co-uld be trans-mit-ted over loc-ked ga-zes.
They grab Tom McHa-be from his cha-ir at the kitc-hen tab-le, pul-ling him up so hard he stumb-les,
and throw him aga-inst the wall. They are gent-ler with Rac-hel and Hal. One of them sta-res
cu-ri-o-usly at Jen-nie, fro-zen on the op-po-si-te si-de of the tab-le. They don't let McHa-be ma-ke
any of the pas-si-ona-te exp-la-na-ti-ons he had be-en trying to ma-ke to me. When he tri-es, the
le-ader hits him ac-ross the fa-ce.
Rachel-Rachel-throws her-self at the man. She wraps her strong yo-ung arms and legs aro-und him
from be-hind, scre-aming, "Stop it! Stop it!" The man shrugs her off li-ke a fly. A se-cond sol-di-er
pus-hes her in-to a cha-ir. When he lo-oks at her fa-ce he shud-ders. Rac-hel go-es on yel-ling, so-und
wit-ho-ut words.
Jennie do-esn't even scre-am. She di-ves ac-ross the tab-le and clings to McHa-be's sho-ul-der, and
wha-te-ver is on her fa-ce is hid-den by the fall of her yel-low ha-ir.
"Shut you fuc-king 'doc-tors' down on-ce and for all!" the le-ader yells, over Rac-hel's no-ise. The
words co-me thro-ugh his hel-met as cle-arly as if he we-ren't we-aring one. "Think you can just go on
co-ming In-si-de and Out-si-de and di-se-asing us all?"
"I - "McHa-be says.
"Fuck it!" the le-ader says, and sho-ots him.
McHabe slumps aga-inst the wall. Jen-nie grabs him, des-pe-ra-tely trying to ha-ul him up up-right.
The sol-di-er fi-res aga-in. The bul-let hits Jen-nie's wrist, shat-te-ring the bo-ne. A third shot, and
McHa-be sli-des to the flo-or.
The sol-di-ers le-ave. The-re is lit-tle blo-od, only two small ho-les whe-re the bul-lets went in and
sta-yed in. We didn't know, In-si-de, that they ha-ve guns li-ke that now. We didn't know bul-lets co-uld
do that. We didn't know.

"You did it," Rac-hel says.
"I did it for you," Ma-mie says. "I did!" They stand ac-ross the kitc-hen from each ot-her, Ma-mie
pin-ned aga-inst the do-or she just clo-sed be-hind her when she fi-nal-ly ca-me ho-me, Rac-hel
stan-ding in front of the wall whe-re Tom di-ed. Jen-nie li-es se-da-ted in the bed-ro-om. Hal
Ste-ven-son, his yo-ung fa-ce an-gu-is-hed be-ca-use he had be-en use-less aga-inst fi-ve ar-med
sol-di-ers, had run for the doc-tor who li-ves in Bar-racks J, who had be-en fo-und set-ting the leg of a
go-at.
"You did it. You." Her vo-ice is dull, he-avy. Scre-am, I want to say. Rac-hel, scre-am.
"I did it so you wo-uld be sa-fe!"
"You did it so I wo-uld be trap-ped In-si-de. Li-ke you."
"You ne-ver tho-ught it was a trap!" Ma-mie cri-es. "You we-re the one who was happy he-re!"
"And you ne-ver will be. Ne-ver. Not he-re, not anyp-la-ce el-se."
I clo-se my eyes, to not see the ter-rib-le ma-tu-rity on my Rac-hel's fa-ce. But the next mo-ment
she's a child aga-in, pus-hing past me to the bed-ro-om with a fu-ri-o-us sob, slam-ming the do-or
be-hind her.
I fa-ce Ma-mie. "Why?"
But she do-esn't ans-wer. And I see that it do-esn't mat-ter; I wo-uldn't ha-ve be-li-eved her
any-way. Her mind is not her own. It is dep-res-sed, ill. I ha-ve to be-li-eve that now. She's my
da-ugh-ter, and her mind has be-en af-fec-ted by the ugly ro-pes of skin that dis-fi-gu-re her. She is the
vic-tim of di-se-ase, and not-hing she says can chan-ge anyt-hing at all.
It's al-most mor-ning. Rac-hel stands in the nar-row ais-le bet-we-en the bed and the wall, fol-ding
clot-hes. The bedsp-re-ad still be-ars the imp-rint of Jen-nie's sle-eping sha-pe; Jen-nie her-self was
car-ri-ed by Hal Ste-ven-son to her own bar-racks, whe-re she won't ha-ve to see Ma-mie when she
wa-kes up. On the cru-de shelf be-si-de Rac-hel the oil lamp burns, thro-wing sha-dows on the newly
who-le wall that smells of ter-mi-te ex-ter-mi-na-tor.
She has few eno-ugh clot-hes to pack. A pa-ir of blue tights, old and clum-sily dar-ned; a swe-ater
with pul-led thre-ads; two mo-re pa-irs of socks; her ot-her skirt, the one she wo-re to the Block
dan-ce. Everyt-hing el-se she al-re-ady has on.
"Rachel," I say. She do-esn't ans-wer, but I see what si-len-ce costs her. Even such a small
de-fi-an-ce, even now. Yet she is go-ing. Using McHa-be's con-tacts to go Out-si-de, le-aving to find
the un-derg-ro-und me-di-cal re-se-arch out-fit. If they ha-ve de-ve-lo-ped the next sta-ge of the cu-re,
the one for pe-op-le al-re-ady dis-fi-gu-red, she will ta-ke it. Per-haps even if they ha-ve not. And as
she go-es, she will con-ta-mi-na-te as much as she can with her di-se-ase, dep-res-si-ve and
non-aggres-si-ve. Com-mu-ni-cab-le.
She thinks she has to go. Be-ca-use of Jen-nie, be-ca-use of Ma-mie, be-ca-use of McHa-be. She is
six-te-en ye-ars old, and she be-li-eves-even gro-wing up In-si-de, she be-li-eves this-that she must do
so-met-hing. Even if it is the wrong thing. To do the wrong thing, she has de-ci-ded, is bet-ter than to do
not-hing.
She has no re-al idea of Out-si-de. She has ne-ver watc-hed te-le-vi-si-on, ne-ver sto-od in a bre-ad
li-ne, ne-ver se-en a crack den or a slas-her mo-vie. She can-not de-fi-ne na-palm, or po-li-ti-cal
tor-tu-re, or ne-ut-ron bomb, or gang ra-pe. To her, Ma-mie, with her con-fu-sed and self-jus-tif-ying
fe-ar, rep-re-sents the he-ight of cru-elty and bet-ra-yal; Pe-ter, with his shamb-ling em-bar-ras-sed
lewd-ness, the epi-to-me of dan-ger; the theft of a chic-ken, the last word in cri-mi-na-lity. She has
ne-ver he-ard of Ausch-witz, Cawn-po-re, the In-qu-isi-ti-on, gla-di-ato-ri-al ga-mes, Nat Tur-ner, Pol
Pot, Sta-ling-rad, Ted Bundy, Hi-ros-hi-ma, My Lai, Wo-un-ded Knee, Ba-bi Yar, Blo-ody Sun-day,
Dres-den or Dac-hau. Ra-ised with a kind of men-tal iner-tia, she knows not-hing of the sa-va-ge
iner-tia of dest-ruc-ti-on, that on-ce set in mo-ti-on in a ci-vi-li-za-ti-on is as hard to stop as a di-se-ase.
I don't think she can find the un-derg-ro-und re-se-arc-hers, no mat-ter how much McHa-be told her.
I don't think her pas-sa-ge Out-si-de will spre-ad eno-ugh in-fec-ti-on to ma-ke any dif-fe-ren-ce at all.
I don't think it's pos-sib-le that she can get very far be-fo-re she is pic-ked up and eit-her re-tur-ned

In-si-de or kil-led. She can-not chan-ge the world. It's too old, too ent-renc-hed, too vi-ci-o-us, too
the-re. She will fa-il. The-re is no for-ce stron-ger than dest-ruc-ti-ve iner-tia.
I get my things re-ady to go with her.

XVI - ELIZABETH BEAR - AND THE DEAP BLUE SEA
The end of the world had co-me and go-ne. It tur-ned out not to mat-ter much in the long run.
The ma-il still had to get thro-ugh.
Harrie sig-ned yes-ter-day's pa-per-work, chec-ked the da-tes aga-inst the ca-len-dar,
con-temp-la-ted her sig-na-tu-re for a mo-ment, and cap-ped her pen. She we-ig-hed the me-tal bar-rel
in her hand and met Dis-patch's fa-ded eyes. "What's spe-ci-al abo-ut (his trip?"
He shrug-ged and tur-ned the clip-bo-ard aro-und on the co-un-ter, chec-king each she-et to be
cer-ta-in she'd fil-led them out pro-perly. She didn't bot-her watc-hing. She ne-ver ma-de mis-ta-kes.
"Do-es the-re ha-ve to be so-met-hing spe-ci-al?"
"You don't pay my fe-es un-less it's spe-ci-al, Patch." She grin-ned as he lif-ted an in-su-la-ted ste-el
ca-se on-to the co-un-ter.
"This has to be in Sac-ra-men-to in eight ho-urs," he sa-id.
"What is it?"
"Medical go-ods. Fe-tal stem-cell cul-tu-res. In a cli-ma-te-cont-rol-led unit. They can't get too hot or
too cold, the-re's so-me ar-ca-ne for-mu-la abo-ut how long they can li-ve in this gi-ven qu-an-tity of
growth me-dia, and the cus-to-mer's pa-ying very hand-so-mely to see them in Ca-li-for-nia by
eigh-te-en hund-red ho-urs."
"It's al-most oh ten hund-red now. What's too hot or too cold?" Har-rie hef-ted the ca-se. It was
ligh-ter than it lo-oked; it wo-uld sli-de ef-fort-les-sly in-to the sad-dle-bags on her to-uring bi-ke.
"Any hot-ter than it al-re-ady is," Dis-patch sa-id, mop-ping his brow. "Can you do it?"
"Eight ho-urs? Pho-enix to Sac-ra-men-to?" Har-rie le-aned back to check the sun. "It'll ta-ke me
thro-ugh Ve-gas. The Ca-li-for-nia ro-utes aren't any go-od at that spe-ed sin-ce the Big One."
"I wo-uldn't send any-body el-se. Fas-test way is thro-ugh Re-no."
"There's no ga-so-li-ne from so-mew-he-re this si-de of the dam to To-no-pah. Even my co-uri-er
card won't help me the-re-"
"There's a check-po-int in Bo-ul-der City. They'll fu-el you."
"Military?"
"I did say they we-re pa-ying very well." He shrug-ged, sho-ul-ders al-re-ady gle-aming with swe-at.
It was go-ing to be a hot one. Har-rie gu-es-sed it wo-uld hit a hund-red and twenty in Pho-enix.
At le-ast she was he-aded north.
"I'll do it," she sa-id, and held her hand out for the pac-ka-ge re-ce-ipt. "Any pic-kups in Re-no?"
"You know what they say abo-ut Re-no?"
"Yeah. It's so clo-se to Hell that you can see Sparks." Na-ming the city's lar-gest su-burb.
"Right. You don't want anyt-hing in Re-no. Go stra-ight thro-ugh," Patch sa-id. "Don't stop in Ve-gas,
wha-te-ver you do. The over-pass's co-me down, but that won't af-fect you un-less the-re's deb-ris.
Stay on the 95 thro-ugh to Fal-lon; it'll see you cle-ar."
"Check." She slung the ca-se over her sho-ul-der, pre-ten-ding she didn't see Patch win-ce. "I'll ra-dio
when I hit Sac-ra-men-to-"
"Telegraph," he sa-id. "The crack-le bet-we-en he-re and the-re wo-uld kill yo-ur sig-nal
ot-her-wi-se."
"Check," aga-in, tur-ning to the prop-ped-open do-or. Her pre-war Ka-wa-sa-ki Con-co-urs
cro-uc-hed aga-inst the crumb-ling curb li-ke an enor-mo-us, rest-less cat. Not the pret-ti-est bi-ke
aro-und, but it got you the-re. As-su-ming you didn't ditch the top-he-avy son of a bitch in the par-king
lot.
"Harrie-"

"What?" She pa-used, but didn't turn.
"If you me-et the Bud-dha on the ro-ad, kill him."
She glan-ced be-hind her, strands of ha-ir catc-hing on the strap of the in-su-la-ted ca-se and on the
sho-ul-der lo-ops of her le-at-hers. "What if I me-et the De-vil?"
She let the Con-co-urs gli-de thro-ugh the cur-ves of the long des-cent to Ho-over Dam, a bre-at-her
af-ter the hard stra-ight push from Pho-enix, and con-si-de-red her op-ti-ons. She'd ha-ve to ave-ra-ge
ne-ar eno-ugh a hund-red sixty clicks an ho-ur to ma-ke the run on ti-me. It sho-uld be smo-oth sa-iling;
she'd be surp-ri-sed if she saw anot-her ve-hic-le bet-we-en Bo-ul-der City and To-no-pah.
She'd chec-ked out a bac-kup do-si-me-ter be-fo-re she left Pho-enix, just in ca-se. Both clic-ked
softly as she cros-sed the dam and the po-iso-ned ri-ver, re-as-su-ring her with alert, fri-endly chat-ter.
She co-uldn't pa-use to enj-oy the ex-pan-se of blue on her right si-de or the vi-ew down the
es-carp-ment on the left, but the dam was in pretty go-od sha-pe, all things con-si-de-red.
It was mo-re than you co-uld say for Ve-gas.
Once upon a ti-me-she downs-hif-ted as she hit the ste-ep gra-de up the north si-de of Black
Can-yon, swe-at al-re-ady so-aking her ha-ir-once upon a ti-me a de-li-very li-ke this wo-uld ha-ve
be-en ma-de by airc-raft. The-re we-re pla-ces whe-re it still wo-uld be. Pla-ces whe-re the-re was
mo-ney for fu-el, mo-ney for airst-rip re-pa-irs.
Places whe-re most of the airc-raft we-ren't par-ked in tidy rows, po-iso-ned birds li-ned up be-si-de
po-iso-ned run-ways, hot eno-ugh that you co-uld he-ar the do-si-me-ters clic-king as you dro-ve past.
A run-ner's cont-ract was a hell of a lot che-aper. Even when you char-ged the way Patch char-ged.
Sunlight glin-ted off the Co-lo-ra-do Ri-ver so far be-low, flas-hing red and gold as mir-rors.
Crumb-ling ca-si-no on the right, now, and the can-yon ec-ho-ing the purr of the sle-ek black bi-ke. The
asp-halt was spi-der web-bed but still half-way smo-oth smo-oth eno-ugh for a big bi-ke, any-way. A
big bi-ke cru-ising at a ste-ady ni-nety kph, much too fast if the-re was anyt-hing in the ro-ad.
So-met-hing skit-te-red asi-de as she tho-ught it, a grey blur ins-tantly lost among the red and black blurs
of the re-ce-ding rock walls on eit-her si-de. Big-horn she-ep. No-body'd bot-he-red to tell them to
cle-ar out be-fo-re the wind co-uld ma-ke them sick.
Funny thing was, they se-emed to be thri-ving.
Harrie le-aned in-to the last cur-ve, bra-king in and ac-ce-le-ra-ting out just to fe-el the tug of
g-for-ces, and gun-ned it up the stra-igh-ta-way le-ading to the check-po-int at Bo-ul-der City. A red
light flas-hed on a pe-eling ste-el po-le be-si-de the ro-ad. The Ka-wa-sa-ki whi-ned and buz-zed
bet-we-en her thighs, disp-le-ased to be rest-ra-ined, then gent-led as she eased the throt-tle, mind-ful of
dust.
Houses had be-en knoc-ked down ac-ross the top of the ri-se that ser-ved as host to the gu-ard's
shi-el-ded qu-ar-ters, per-mit-ting an unim-pe-ded vi-ew of Bo-ul-der City stretc-hing out be-low. The
bul-ldo-zer that had do-ne the work slum-ped ne-arby, rus-ting un-der bub-bled pa-int, too
ra-di-o-ac-ti-ve to be ta-ken away. Too ra-di-o-ac-ti-ve even to be mel-ted down for sal-va-ge.
Boulder City had be-en af-flu-ent on-ce. Har-rie co-uld see the husks of trendy bu-si-nes-ses on
eit-her si-de of Ma-in Stre-et: brick and stuc-co bu-il-dings in red and ta-upe, so-me whi-te-was-hed
wo-od fra-mes pe-eling in slow curls, sub-mis-si-ve to the de-sert he-at.
The ga-tes be-yond the check-po-int we-re clo-sed and so we-re the le-ad shut-ters on the gu-ard's
shel-ter. A di-gi-tal sign over the ro-of ga-ve an am-bi-ent ra-di-ati-on re-ading in the mid do-ub-le
di-gits and a tem-pe-ra-tu-re re-ading in the low trip-le di-gits, Fah-ren-he-it. It wo-uld get hot-ter-and
"hot-ter"-as she des-cen-ded in-to Ve-gas.
Harrie drop-ped the si-de stand as the Ka-wa-sa-ki rol-led to a halt, and thum-bed her horn.
The yo-ung man who emer-ged from the shack was surp-ri-singly tidy, gi-ven his re-mo-te duty
sta-ti-on. Cap set re-gu-la-ti-on, bo-ots shiny un-der the dust. He was still set-tling his bre-at-hing fil-ter
as he clim-bed down red me-tal steps and trot-ted over to Har-rie's bi-ke. Har-rie won-de-red who he'd
pis-sed off to draw this duty, or if he was a no-ve-list who had vo-lun-te-ered.
"Runner," she sa-id, her vo-ice ec-ho-ing thro-ugh her hel-met mi-ke. She tap-ped the ID card

vi-sib-le in-si-de the win-do-wed poc-ket on the bre-ast of her le-at-hers, tug-ged her pa-pers from the
po-uch on her tank with a clumsy glo-ved hand and un-fol-ded them in-si-de the-ir trans-pa-rent
car-ri-er. "You're sup-po-sed to gas me up for the run to To-no-pah."
"You ha-ve an in-de-pen-dent fil-ter or just the one in yo-ur hel-met?" All ef-fi-ci-ency as he
pe-ru-sed her pa-pers. "Inde-pen-dent."
"Visor up, ple-ase." He wo-uldn't ask her to ta-ke the hel-met off. The-re was too much dust. She
comp-li-ed, and he chec-ked her eyes and no-se aga-inst the pho-to ID.
"Angharad Crowt-her. This lo-oks in or-der. You're with UPS?"
"Independent cont-rac-tor," Har-rie sa-id. "It's a me-di-cal run."
He tur-ned away, ges-tu-ring her to fol-low, and led her to the pumps. They we-re shro-uded in
plas-tic, one di-esel and one un-le-aded. "Is that a Con-nie?"
"A lit-tle mo-di-fi-ed so she do-esn't buzz so much." Har-rie pet-ted the gas tank with a glo-ved hand.
"Anything I sho-uld know abo-ut bet-we-en he-re and To-no-pah?"
He shrug-ged. "You know the ru-les, I ho-pe."
"Stay on the ro-ad," she sa-id, as he slip-ped the noz-zle in-to the fill. "Don't go in-si-de any
bu-il-dings. Don't go ne-ar any ve-hic-les. Don't stop, don't lo-ok back, and es-pe-ci-al-ly don't turn
aro-und; it's not wi-se to dri-ve thro-ugh yo-ur own dust. If it glows, don't pick it up, and not-hing from
the black zo-ne le-aves."
"I'll te-leg-raph ahe-ad and let To-no-pah know you're co-ming," he sa-id, as the gas pump clic-ked.
"You ever crash that thing?"
"Not in go-ing on ten ye-ars," she sa-id, and didn't bot-her to cross her fin-gers. He han-ded her a
re-ce-ipt; she fumb-led her lac-qu-ered sta-in-less Cross pen out of her zip-pe-red poc-ket and sig-ned
her na-me li-ke she me-ant it. The glo-ves ma-de her sig-na-tu-re in-to an in-comp-re-hen-sib-le scrawl,
but the gu-ard ma-de a show of com-pa-ring it to her ID card and slap-ped her on the sho-ul-der. "Be
ca-re-ful. If you crash out the-re, you're pro-bably on yo-ur own. Gods-pe-ed."
"Thanks for the re-as-su-ran-ce," she sa-id, and grin-ned at him be-fo-re she clo-sed her vi-sor and
split.
Digitized mu-sic rang over her hel-met he-ad-set as I Har-ri-ed duc-ked her he-ad be-hind the
fa-iring, the hot wind tug-ging her sle-eves, trick-ling bet-we-en her glo-ves and her cuffs. The
Ka-wa-sa-ki stretc-hed out un-der her, re-ady for a go-od hard run, and Har-rie itc-hed to gi-ve it one.
One thing you co-uld say abo-ut the Ve-gas black zo-ne: the-re wasn't much traf-fic. Ho-uses-iden-ti-cal
in red ti-le ro-ofs and cre-am stuc-co wal-ls-blur-red past on eit-her si-de, flan-ked by tre-es that the
de-sert had kil-led on-ce pe-op-le we-ren't the-re to pump the wa-ter up to them. She crac-ked a
hund-red and sixty kph in the wind sha-dow of the so-und bar-ri-ers, the tach win-ding up li-ke a watch,
just gli-ding along in sixth as the Ka-wa-sa-ki hit its stri-de. The big bi-ke hand-led li-ke a pig in the
par-king lot, but out on the high-way she ran smo-oth as glass.
She had al-most a hund-red mi-les of ran-ge mo-re than she'd ne-ed to get to To-no-pah, God
wil-ling and the cre-ek didn't ri-se, but she wasn't abo-ut to test that with any si-de trips thro-ugh what
was left of Las Ve-gas. Her do-si-me-ters clic-ked with er-ra-tic che-er, not-hing to worry abo-ut yet,
and Har-rie cla-imed the cent-re la-ne and ed-ged down to one forty as she hit the win-ding patch of
high-way ne-ar the old down-town. The shells of ca-si-nos on the left-hand si-de and god-for-sa-ken
was-te-land and ghet-to on the right ga-ve her back the Ka-wa-sa-ki's well-tu-ned shri-ek; she co-uldn't
wind it any fas-ter with the ro-ads so choppy and the K-Ra-il can-yons so tight.
The sky over-he-ad was flat blue li-ke che-ap tur-qu-o-ise. A pall of dust sho-wed burnt si-en-na, the
in-ver-si-on la-yer trap-ped in-si-de the ring of mo-un-ta-ins that ma-de her ho-ri-zon in fo-ur
di-rec-ti-ons.
The fre-eway ope-ned out on-ce she cle-ared down-town, the over-pass Patch had war-ned her
abo-ut arc-hing up and over, a tang-le of ban-ked cur-ves, the cros-sro-ads at the he-art of the si-lent
city. She bid the ghosts of ho-tels go-od day as the sun hit ze-nith, he-ral-ding pe-ak he-at for anot-her
fo-ur ho-urs or so. Har-rie re-sis-ted the ur-ge to re-ach back and pat her sad-dle-bag to ma-ke su-re

the pre-ci-o-us car-go was sa-fe; she'd ne-ver know if the cli-ma-te cont-rol fa-iled on the trip, and
mo-re-over she co-uldn't risk the dist-rac-ti-on as she wo-und the Ka-wa-sa-ki up to one hund-red
se-venty and duc-ked her hel-met in-to the slipst-re-am off the fa-iring.
Straight shot to the de-ad town cal-led Be-at-ty from he-re, if you min-ded the cat-tle gu-ards along
the ro-ads by the lit-tle for-lorn towns. Stra-ight shot, with the do-si-me-ters clic-king and vin-ta-ge rock
and roll jam-ming in the hel-met spe-akers and the Ka-wa-sa-ki pur-ring, thrus-ting, eager to spring and
run.
There we-re wor-se days to be ali-ve.
She drop-ped it to fo-urth and throt-tled back co-ming up on that over-pass, the big one whe-re the
Pho-enix to Re-no high-way cros-sed the one that used to run LA to Salt La-ke, when the-re was an LA
to spe-ak of. Patch had sa-id over-pass's down, which co-uld me-an un-sa-fe for tran-sit and co-uld
me-an lit-te-ring the fre-eway un-der-ne-ath with blocks of conc-re-te the si-ze of a se-mi, and Har-rie
had no in-te-rest in fin-ding out which it was with no ro-om left to bra-ke. She adj-us-ted the vo-lu-me
on her mu-sic down as the rush of wind aba-ted, and to-ok the op-por-tu-nity to sight-see a bit.
And swo-re softly in-to her air fil-ter, slo-wing furt-her be-fo-re she re-ali-zed she'd let the throt-tle
slip.
Something-no, so-me-one-le-aned aga-inst a shot gun-ned, pa-int-pe-eled sign that might ha-ve
gi-ven a spe-ed li-mit on-ce, when the-re was an-yo-ne to ca-re abo-ut such things.
Her do-si-me-ters clic-ked ag-gres-si-vely as she let the bi-ke roll clo-ser to the ver-ge. She
sho-uldn't atop. But it was a de-ath sen-ten-ce, be-ing alo-ne and on fo-ot out he-re.
Even if the sun we-ren't clim-bing the sky, swe-at rol-ling from un-der Har-ri-es hel-met, ad-he-ring
her le-at-hers to her skin.
She was al-most stop-ped by the ti-me she re-ali-zed she knew him. Knew his och-re skin and his
natty pinst-ri-ped do-ub-le-bre-as-ted su-it and his fe-do-ra, til-ted just so, and the cor-do-van gle-am
of his lo-afers. For one mad mo-ment, she wis-hed she car-ri-ed a gun.
Not that a gun wo-uld help her. Even if she de-ci-ded to swal-low a bul-let her-self.
"Nick." She put the bi-ke in ne-ut-ral, drop-ping her fe-et as it rol-led to a stop. "Fancy me-eting you
in the mid-dle of Hell."
"I got so-me pa-pers for you to sign, Har-rie." He pus-hed his fe-do-ra back over his hol-low
che-eked fa-ce. "You got a pen?"
"You know I do." She un-zip-ped her poc-ket and fis-hed out the Cross. "I wo-uldn't lend a
fo-un-ta-in pen to just any-body."
He nod-ded, le-aning back aga-inst a K-Ra-il so he co-uld kick a knee up and spre-ad his pa-pers
out over it. He ac-cep-ted the pen. "You know yo-ur no-tes abo-ut co-me due."
"Nick-"
"No whi-ning now," he sa-id. "Didn't I hold up my end of the bar-ga-in? Ha-ve you ditc-hed yo-ur
bi-ke sin-ce last we tal-ked?" "No, Nick." Crest-fal-len.
"Had it sto-len? Be-en stran-ded? Mis-sed a ti-me-tab-le?"
"I'm abo-ut to miss one now if you don't hurry up with my pen." She held her hand out
im-pe-ri-o-usly; not ter-ribly con-vin-cing, but the best she co-uld do un-der the cir-cums-tan-ces.
"Mmm-hmmm." He was ta-king his own swe-et ti-me.
Perversely, the know-led-ge set-tled her. "If the debt's due, ha-ve you co-me to col-lect?"
"I've co-me to of-fer you a chan-ce to re-ne-go-ti-ate," he sa-id, and cap-ped the pen and han-ded it
back. "I've got a job for you; co-uld buy you a few mo-re ye-ars if you play yo-ur cards right."
She la-ug-hed in his fa-ce and zip-ped the pen away. "A few mo-re ye-ars?" But he nod-ded, lips
pres-sed thin and se-ri-o-us, and she blin-ked and went se-ri-o-us too. "You me-an it."
"I ne-ver of-fer what I'm not pre-pa-red to gi-ve," he sa-id, and scratc-hed the tip of his no-se with his
thumb-na-il. "What say, oh-three mo-re ye-ars?"
"Three's not very much." The bre-eze shif-ted. Her do-si-me-ters crack-led. "Ten's not very much,
now that I'm lo-oking back on it."
"Goes by qu-ick, don't it?" He shrug-ged. "All right. Se-ven-"

"For what?"
"What do you me-an?" She co-uld ha-ve la-ug-hed aga-in, at the trans-pa-rent and
oh-so-cal-cu-la-ted gu-ile-les-sness in his eyes.
"I me-an, what is it you want me to do for se-ven mo-re ye-ars of pro-tec-ti-on." The bi-ke was
he-avy, but she wasn't abo-ut to kick the si-de stand down. "I'm su-re its bad news for so-me-body."
"It al-ways is." But he tip-ped the brim of his hat down a cen-ti-met-re and ges-tu-red to her
sad-dle-bag, neg-li-gently. "I just want a mo-ment with what you've got the-re in that bag."
"Huh." She glan-ced at her car-go, pur-sing her lips. "That's a stran-ge thing to ask. What wo-uld you
want with a box full of re-se-arch cells?"
He stra-igh-te-ned away from the sign he was hol-ding up and ca-me a step clo-ser. "That's not so
much yo-urs to worry abo-ut, yo-ung lady. Gi-ve it to me, and you get se-ven ye-ars. If you don't-the
no-te's up next we-ek, isn't it?"
"Tuesday." She wo-uld ha-ve spat, but she wasn't abo-ut to lift her hel-met asi-de. "I'm not sca-red of
you, Nick."
"You're not sca-red of much." He smi-led, all smo-oth. "It's part of yo-ur charm."
She tur-ned her he-ad, sta-ring away west ac-ross the sun-so-aked de-sert and the ro-ofs of
aban-do-ned ho-uses, aban-do-ned li-ves. Ne-va-da had al-ways had a way of ma-king ghost towns
out of met-ro-po-li-ses. "What hap-pens if I say no?"
"I was ho-ping you we-ren't go-ing to ask that, swe-et-he-art," he sa-id. He re-ac-hed to lay a hand
on her right hand whe-re it res-ted on the throt-tle. The bi-ke grow-led, a high, hyste-ri-cal so-und, and
Nick yan-ked his hand back. "I see you two ma-de fri-ends."
"We get along all right," Har-rie sa-id, pat-ting the Ka-wa-sa-ki's gas tank. "What hap-pens if I say
no?"
He shrug-ged and fol-ded his arms. "You won't fi-nish yo-ur run." No thre-at in it, no ext-ra dark-ness
in the way the sha-dow of his hat brim fell ac-ross his fa-ce. No me-na-ce in his smi-le. Cold fact, and
she co-uld ta-ke it how she to-ok it.
She wis-hed she had a pi-ece of gum to crack bet-we-en her te-eth. It wo-uld fit her mo-od. She
cros-sed her arms, ba-lan-cing the Ka-wa-sa-ki bet-we-en her thighs. Har-rie li-ked bar-ga-ining.
"That's not the de-al. The de-al's no spills, no cras-hes, no bre-ak-downs, and every run comp-le-te on
ti-me. I sa-id I'd get the-se cells to Sac-ra-men-to in eight ho-urs. You're was-ting my day-light;
so-me-body's li-fe co-uld de-pend on them."
"Somebody's li-fe do-es," Nick ans-we-red, let-ting his lips twist asi-de. "A lot of so-me-bo-di-es,
when it co-mes down to it."
"Break the de-al, Nick-fuck with my ri-de-and you're in bre-ach of cont-ract." "You've got not-hing to
bar-ga-in with."
She la-ug-hed, then, out-right. The Ka-wa-sa-ki pur-red bet-we-en her legs, en-co-ura-ging.
"The-re's al-ways ti-me to mend my ways-"
"Not if you die be-fo-re you ma-ke it to Sac-ra-men-to," he sa-id. "Last chan-ce to re-con-si-der,
Ang-ha-rad, my prin-cess. We can still sha-ke hands and part fri-ends. Or you can fi-nish yo-ur last
ri-de on my terms, and it won't be pretty for you"-the Ka-wa-sa-ki snar-led softly, the tang of bur-ning
oil un-der-ne-ath it-"or yo-ur bi-ke."
"Fuck off," Har-rie sa-id, and kic-ked her fe-et up as she twis-ted the throt-tle and dro-ve stra-ight at
him, just for the she-er stu-pid ple-asu-re of watc-hing him dan-ce out of her way.
Nevada had be-en dying slowly for a long ti-me: perch-lo-ra-te-po-iso-ned gro-und wa-ter, a le-gacy
of World War Two ti-ta-ni-um plants; can-cer ra-tes spi-ked by ex-po-su-re to fal-lo-ut from
abo-veg-ro-und nuc-le-ar tes-ting; crus-hing dro-ught and cli-ma-tic chan-ge; child-ho-od le-uka-emia
clus-ters in ru-ral towns. The exp-lo-si-on of the PEP-CON plant in 1988 might ha-ve be-en
per-ce-ived by a suf-fi-ci-ently ima-gi-na-ti-ve mind as God's shot ac-ross the bow, but the re-al
da-ma-ge didn't oc-cur un-til de-ca-des la-ter, when a tra-in car-rying high-le-vel nuc-le-ar was-te to the
Yuc-ca Mo-un-ta-in sto-ra-ge fa-ci-lity col-li-ded with a fu-el tan-ker stal-led ac-ross the ra-ils.

The re-sul-ting fi-re and ra-di-o-ac-ti-ve con-ta-mi-na-ti-on of the Las Ve-gas Val-ley pro-ved to be
a god-send in dis-gu-ise. When the War ca-me to Nel-lis Air For-ce Ba-se and the nuc-le-ar
mo-un-ta-in, Las Ve-gas was al-re-ady as much a ghost town as Rhyo-li-te or Gold-fi-eld-except
de-ser-ted not be-ca-use the banks col-lap-sed or the gold ran out, but be-ca-use the dust that blew
thro-ugh the stre-ets was hot eno-ugh to drop a spar-row in midf-light, or so pe-op-le sa-id.
Harrie didn't know if the spar-row story was true.
"So." She mut-te-red in-to her hel-met, cro-uc-hed over the Ka-wa-sa-ki's tank as the bi-ke
scre-amed north by north-west, le-aving eerie Las Ve-gas be-hind. "What do you think he's go-ing to
throw at us, girl?"
The bi-ke whi-ned, dig-ging in. Cent-ral city ga-ve way to de-so-la-te su-bur-bia, and the high-way
drop-ped to gro-und le-vel and stra-igh-te-ned out, a nar-row strip of black ref-lec-ting the sum-mer
he-at in mi-ra-ge sil-ver.
The de-sert spraw-led on eit-her si-de, a dun ex-pan-se of scrub and hard-pan nar-ro-wing as the
Ka-wa-sa-ki clim-bed in-to the bro-ad pass bet-we-en two dusty ran-ges of mo-un-ta-ins. Har-ri-es
do-si-me-ters clic-ked ste-adily, co-un-ting mar-gi-nal-ly mo-re rads as she ro-ared by the for-mer
nuc-le-ar tes-ting si-te at Mer-cury at clo-se to two hund-red kph. She throt-tled back as a sad lit-tle
towns-hip-a few dis-car-ded tra-ilers, anot-her mi-li-tary ba-se and a dis-re-gar-ded pri-son-ca-me up.
The-re we-re no pe-dest-ri-ans to worry abo-ut, but the gra-ted me-tal cat-tle gu-ard was not
so-met-hing to hit at spe-ed.
On the far si-de, the-re was not-hing to slow her for fifty mi-les. She cran-ked her mu-sic up and
drop-ped her he-ad be-hind the fa-iring and red-li-ned her tach for Be-at-ty and the far ho-ri-zon.
It got rocky aga-in co-ming up on Be-at-ty. Ci-vi-li-za-ti-on in Ne-va-da hud-dled up to the oases
and springs that lur-ked at the fo-ot of mo-un-ta-ins and in the low parts in val-leys. This had be-en
mi-ning co-untry, mo-un-ta-ins gna-wed away by dyna-mi-te and sharp-to-ot-hed pay-lo-aders. A long
gor-ge on the right si-de of the high-way sho-wed gre-en clots of tre-es; wa-ter ran the-re, ta-in-ted by
the bro-ken dump, and her do-si-me-ters clic-ked as the ro-ad cur-ved ne-ar it. If she wal-ked down
the bank and splas-hed in-to the stre-am bet-we-en the ro-ots of the wil-lows and cot-ton-wo-ods,
she'd walk out glo-wing, and be de-ad by night-fall.
She ro-un-ded the cor-ner and en-te-red the ghost of Be-at-ty.
The prob-lem, she tho-ught, aro-se be-ca-use every lit-tle town in Ne-va-da grew up at the sa-me
pla-ce: a cros-sro-ads, and she half-expec-ted Nick to be wa-iting for her at this one too. The
Ka-wa-sa-ki whi-ned as they rol-led thro-ugh tumb-le-we-ed-clog-ged stre-ets, but they pas-sed
un-der the town's so-le, blindly sta-ring stop-light wit-ho-ut se-e-ing anot-her cre-atu-re. Des-pi-te the
sun li-ke a physi-cal pres-su-re on her le-at-hers, a chill ran spi-dery fin-gers up her spi-ne. She'd rat-her
know whe-re the hell he was, thank you very much. "May-be he to-ok a wrong turn at Rhyo-li-te."
The Ka-wa-sa-ki snar-led, im-pa-ti-ent to be tur-ned lo-ose on the open ro-ad aga-in, but Har-rie
thre-aded it thro-ugh slum-ping cars and aro-und windb-lown deb-ris with fi-nicky ca-re. "No-body's
lo-oking out for us any-mo-re, Con-nie," Har-rie mur-mu-red, and stro-ked the sun-scorc-hed fu-el tank
with her glo-ved left hand. They pas-sed a de-ser-ted gas sta-ti-on, the pumps cro-uc-hed use-less
wit-ho-ut po-wer; the do-si-me-ters chir-ped and warb-led. "I don't want to kick up that dust if I can
help it."
The rams-hack-le one- and two-story bu-il-dings ga-ve way to de-sert and high-way. Har-rie
pa-used, fe-et down on tar-mac mel-ted sticky-soft by the sun, and ma-de su-re the straw of her ca-mel
pack was fi-xed in the hol-der. The ho-ri-zon shim-me-red with he-at, rid-ges of mo-un-ta-ins on eit-her
si-de and dun hard-pan stretc-hing to in-fi-nity. She sig-hed and to-ok a long drink of sta-le wa-ter.
"Here we go," she sa-id, hands nimb-le on the clutch and the throt-tle as she lif-ted her fe-et to the
peg. The Ka-wa-sa-ki rol-led for-ward, gat-he-ring spe-ed. "Not too much furt-her to To-no-pah, and
then we can both get fed."
Nick was gi-ving her ti-me to think abo-ut it, and she drow-ned the wor-ri-es with the De-ad

Ken-nedys, Bo-iled in Le-ad, and the Acid Trip. The ri-de from Be-at-ty to To-no-pah was swift and
une-vent-ful, the flat ro-ad un-win-ding be-ne-ath her whe-els li-ke a spun-out ta-pe me-asu-re, the
ban-ded mo-un-ta-ins craw-ling past on eit-her si-de. The only va-ri-ati-on along the way was for-lorn
Gold-fi-eld, its wind-to-uc-hed stre-ets empty and se-re. It had be-en a town of twenty tho-usand,
aban-do-ned be-fo-re Ve-gas fell to ra-di-ati-on sick-ness, even lon-ger be-fo-re the nu-ke dump
bro-ke open. She pus-hed two hund-red kph most of the way, the ro-ad all hers, not so much as the
glim-mer of sun-light off a dis-tant winds-hi-eld to con-test her ow-ners-hip. The si-len-ce and the empty
ro-ad just ga-ve her mo-re to worry at, and she did, pic-king at her prob-lem li-ke a vul-tu-re pic-king at
a corp-se.
The fo-un-ta-in pen was he-avy in her bre-ast poc-ket as To-no-pah shim-me-red in-to dis-tant
vi-si-bi-lity. Her he-ad swam with the he-at, the hel-met squ-elc-hing over sa-tu-ra-ted ha-ir. She
suc-ked mo-re wa-ter, trying to ra-ti-on; the tem-pe-ra-tu-re was clim-bing to-ward one twenty, and she
wo-uldn't last long wit-ho-ut hydra-ti-on. The Ka-wa-sa-ki co-ug-hed a lit-tle, rol-ling down a slow,
ex-ten-ded inc-li-ne, but the gas ga-uge ga-ve her ne-arly a qu-ar-ter of a tank-and the-re was the
re-ser-ve if she ex-ha-us-ted the ma-in. Still, inst-ru-ments we-ren't al-ways right, and luck wasn't
exactly on her si-de.
Harrie kil-led her mu-sic with a jab of her ton-gue aga-inst the cont-rol pad in-si-de her hel-met. She
drop-ped her left hand from the hand-le-bar and thum-ped the tank. The so-und she got back was
hol-low, but the-re was eno-ugh flu-id in-si-de to he-ar it ref-ract off a mo-ving sur-fa-ce. The small city
ahe-ad was a wel-co-me sight; the-re'd be fresh wa-ter and ga-so-li-ne, and she co-uld ho-se the worst
of the dust off and ta-ke a piss. God damn, you'd think with the swe-at so-aking her le-at-hers to her
body, the-re'd be no ne-ed for that last, but the de-vil was in the de-ta-ils, it tur-ned out.
Harrie'd ne-ver wan-ted to be a boy. But so-me days she re-al-ly wis-hed she had the knack of
pe-e-ing stan-ding up.
She was only abo-ut half a click away when she re-ali-zed that the-re was so-met-hing wrong abo-ut
To-no-pah. Ot-her than the usu-al; her do-si-me-ters re-gis-te-red only backg-ro-und no-ise as she
ca-me up on it, but a harsh re-ek li-ke bur-ning co-al ras-ped the back of her thro-at even thro-ugh the
dust fil-ters, and the we-ird lit-tle town wasn't the we-ird lit-tle town she re-mem-be-red. Rol-ling gre-en
hills ro-se aro-und it on all si-des, thick with sha-dowy, le-af-less tre-es, and it was smo-ke ha-ze that
drif-ted on the still air, not dust. A he-at shim-mer flo-ated over the crac-ked ro-ad, and the bu-il-dings
that crow-ded along-si-de it we-ren't To-no-pah's de-sert-we-at-he-red const-ruc-ti-on but pe-eling
whi-te shing-le si-ded ho-uses, a sto-ref-ront post of-fi-ce, a whi-te church with the ste-ep-le ca-ved in
and half the fa-ca-de drop-ped in-to a smo-king sink-ho-le in the gro-und.
The Ka-wa-sa-ki whi-ned, shi-ve-ring as Har-rie throt-tled back. She sat up-right in the sad-dle,
let-ting the big bi-ke roll. "Whe-re the hell are we?" Her vo-ice re-ver-be-ra-ted. She start-led; she'd
for-got-ten she'd left her mic-rop-ho-ne on.
"Exactly," a fa-mi-li-ar vo-ice sa-id at her left. "Wel-co-me to Cent-ra-lia." Nick wo-re an
open-fa-ced hel-met and strad-dled the back of a Hon-da Gold-wing the co-lo-ur of dri-ed blo-od, if
blo-od had gold dust flec-ked thro-ugh it. The Hon-da his-sed at the Ka-wa-sa-ki, and the Con-nie
grow-led back, wob-bling in eager chal-len-ge. Har-rie rest-ra-ined her bi-ke with gent-ling hands,
gi-ving it a lit-tle mo-re gas to stra-igh-ten it out.
"Centralia?" Har-rie had ne-ver he-ard of it, and she flat-te-red her-self that she'd he-ard of most
pla-ces.
"Pennsylvania." Nick lif-ted his black-glo-ved hand off the clutch and ges-tu-red va-gu-ely aro-und
him-self. "Or Jha-ria, in In-dia. Or may-be the Chi-ne-se pro-vin-ce of Xi-nj-i-ang. Sub-ter-ra-ne-an
co-al fi-res, you know, anth-ra-ci-te bur-ning in eva-cu-ated mi-nes. Who-le towns aban-do-ned,
sulp-hur and brims-to-ne se-eping up thro-ugh vents, the gro-und hot eno-ugh to flash ra-in to ste-am.
Yo-ur ti-res will melt. You'll put that bi-ke in-to a cre-vas-se. Not to men-ti-on the gre-en-ho-use
ga-ses. Lo-vely things." He grin-ned, sho-wing shark's te-eth, fo-ur rows. "Se-cond ti-me as-king,
Ang-ha-rad, my prin-cess."
"Second ti-me sa-ying no." She fi-xed her eyes on the ro-ad. She co-uld see the way the asp-halt

buck-led, now, and the dim glow from the bot-tom of the sink-ho-le un-der-ne-ath the church. "You
re-al-ly are used to pe-op-le do-ing yo-ur bid-ding, aren't you, Nick?"
"They don't usu-al-ly put up much of a fight." He twis-ted the throt-tle whi-le the clutch was
en-ga-ged, co-axing a whi-ning, com-pe-ti-ti-ve co-ugh from his Hon-da.
Harrie ca-ught his shrug si-de-ways but kept her ga-ze tra-ined grimly for-ward. Was that the earth
shi-ve-ring, or was it just the shim-mer of he-at-ha-ze over the ro-ad? The Ka-wa-sa-ki whi-ned. She
pet-ted the clutch to re-as-su-re her-self.
The gro-aning rumb-le that ans-we-red her wasn't the Ka-wa-sa-ki. She tigh-te-ned her kne-es on the
se-at as the gro-und pitc-hed and buc-ked un-der her ti-res, hand clutc-hing the throt-tle to go-ose the
Con-nie for-ward. Bro-ken asp-halt spra-yed from her re-ar ti-re. The ro-ad split and shat-te-red,
va-nis-hing be-hind her. She ha-uled the bi-ke up-right by raw strength and ner-ved her-self to check her
mir-rors; lazy ste-am ro-se from a ga-ping ho-le in the ro-ad.
Nick cru-ised along, un-per-tur-bed. "You su-re* Prin-cess?"
"What was that you sa-id abo-ut Hell, Nick?" She hun-ke-red down and grin-ned at him over her
sho-ul-der, kno-wing he co-uldn't see mo-re than her eyes crink-le thro-ugh the hel-met. It was eno-ugh
to draw an ir-ri-ta-ted gla-re.
He sat back on his ha-unc-hes and tip-ped his to-es up on the fo-ot-pegs, thro-wing both hands up,
re-le-asing throt-tle and clutch, let-ting the Hon-da co-ast away be-hind her. "I sa-id, wel-co-me to it."
The Ka-wa-sa-ki snar-led and whim-pe-red by turns, he-avy and agi-le bet-we-en her legs as she
ga-ve it all the gas she da-red. She'd be-en co-un-ting on the re-fu-el stop he-re, but com-pact
so-uth-wes-tern To-no-pah had be-en rep-la-ced by a shat-te-red sprawl of bu-il-dings, most of them
ob-vi-o-usly eit-her bul-ldo-zed or va-nis-hed in-to pits that gla-red li-ke a wolf's eye ref-lec-ting a flash,
and a gas sta-ti-on wasn't one of the re-ma-ining op-ti-ons. The stre-ets we-re bro-ad, at le-ast, and
de-ser-ted, not so much win-ding as cur-ving gently thro-ugh shal-low swa-les and over hil-locks.
Bro-ad, but not in-tact; the asp-halt rip-pled as if he-aved by mo-les and so-me of the ri-ses and dips hid
fis-su-res and sink-ho-les. Her ti-res scorc-hed; she co-ug-hed in-to her fil-ter, her mi-ke amp-lif-ying it
to a hye-na's bark. The Cross pen in her poc-ket pres-sed her bre-ast over her he-art. She to-ok
com-fort in it, duc-king be-hind the fa-iring to dod-ge the stin-king wind and the cla-wing ske-le-tons of
ung-ro-omed tre-es. She'd sig-ned on the li-ne, af-ter all. And eit-her Nick had to see her and the
Ka-wa-sa-ki sa-fe or she got back what she'd pa-id.
As if Nick abi-ded by cont-racts.
As if he co-uldn't just kill her and get what he wan-ted that way. Ex-cept he co-uldn't ke-ep her, if he
did.
"Damn," she mur-mu-red, to he-ar the ec-ho-es, and hunc-hed over the Ka-wa-sa-ki's tank. The
wind to-re at her le-at-hers. The he-avy bi-ke ca-ught air co-ming over the last ri-se. She had to pee
li-ke she co-uldn't be-li-eve, and the vib-ra-ti-on of the en-gi-ne wasn't hel-ping, but she la-ug-hed out
lo-ud to set the city be-hind.
She got out easi-er than she tho-ught she wo-uld, alt-ho-ugh her ga-uge re-ad empty at the bot-tom of
the hill. She switc-hed to re-ser-ve and swo-re. De-ad tre-es and smo-king stumps rip-pled in-to
no-ne-xis-ten-ce aro-und her, and the lo-ne and le-vel sands stretc-hed to rag-ged mo-un-ta-ins east
and west. Back in Ne-va-da, if she'd ever left it, hard west-bo-und now, stra-ight in-to the gla-re of the
af-ter-no-on sun. Her po-la-ri-zed fa-cep-la-te hel-ped so-mew-hat, may-be not eno-ugh, but the ro-ad
was smo-oth aga-in be-fo-re and be-hind and she co-uld see To-no-pah sit-ting dusty and for-sa-ken in
her re-ar-vi-ew mir-ror, inac-ces-sib-le as a mi-ra-ge, a city at the bot-tom of a well.
Maybe Nick co-uld only to-uch her in the towns. May-be he ne-eded a lit-tle of man's hand on the
wil-der-ness to twist to his own ends, or may-be it amu-sed him. May-be it was whe-re the ro-ads
cros-sed, af-ter all. She didn't think she co-uld ma-ke it back to To-no-pah if she tri-ed, ho-we-ver, so
she pre-ten-ded she didn't see the city be-hind her and cru-ised west, to-ward Hawt-hor-ne, pra-ying
she had eno-ugh gas to ma-ke it but not ex-pec-ting her pra-yers to be ans-we-red by any-body she
par-ti-cu-larly wan-ted to talk to.

The 95 tur-ned north-west aga-in at the de-ser-ted Co-al-da-le junc-ti-on; the-re hadn't be-en a town
the-re sin-ce long be-fo-re the War, or even the di-sas-ter at Ve-gas. Mi-na was go-ne too, its outs-kirts
mar-ked by a pe-eling sign ad-ver-ti-sing an aban-do-ned craw-fish farm, the De-sert Lobs-ter
Fa-ci-lity.
Harries ca-mel bag went dry. She suc-ked at the straw for-lornly one last ti-me and spat it out, let-ting
it sag aga-inst her jaw, damp and tacky. She hun-ke-red down and la-id a long li-ne of smo-king ro-ad
be-hind, cor-ne-ring gently when she had to cor-ner, wor-ri-ed abo-ut her scorc-hed and bru-ised ti-res.
At le-ast the day was co-oling as eve-ning enc-ro-ac-hed, as she prog-res-sed north and ga-ined
ele-va-ti-on. It might be down in-to the do-ub-le di-gits, even, alt-ho-ugh it was hard to tell thro-ugh the
le-at-her. On her left, the Sar-cop-ha-gus Mo-un-ta-ins ro-se bet-we-en her and Ca-li-for-nia.
The na-me didn't amu-se her as much as it usu-al-ly did.
And then they we-re clim-bing. She bre-at-hed a low sigh of re-li-ef and pat-ted the hungry,
grumb-ling Ka-wa-sa-ki on the fu-el tank as the blis-te-ring blue of Wal-ker La-ke ca-me in-to vi-ew,
the dusty lit-tle town of Hawt-hor-ne hud-dled li-ke a crab on the ne-ar sho-re. The-re was not-hing
mo-ving the-re eit-her, and Har-rie che-wed her lip be-hind the fil-ter. Dust had got-ten in-to her hel-met
so-me-how, grit-ting every ti-me she blin-ked; we-eping stre-aks mar-ked her che-eks be-hind the
vi-sor. She ho-ped the dust wasn't the kind that was li-kely to ma-ke her glow, but her do-si-me-ters
had set-tled down to chic-ken li-ke cluc-king, so she might be okay.
The Ka-wa-sa-ki whim-pe-red apo-lo-ge-ti-cal-ly and di-ed as she co-as-ted in-to town.
"Christ," she sa-id, and flinc-hed at the ec-ho of her own amp-li-fi-ed vo-ice. She re-ac-hed to thumb
the mi-ke off, and, on se-cond tho-ught, left it alo-ne. It was too dam-ned qu-i-et out he-re wit-ho-ut the
Ka-wa-sa-ki's com-men-tary. She ton-gu-ed her mu-sic back on, flip-ping se-lec-ti-ons un-til she
set-tled on a tu-ne by Grey Li-ne Out.
She drop-ped her right fo-ot and kic-ked the stand down on the left, then sto-od on the peg and slung
her leg over the sad-dle. She ac-hed with vib-ra-ti-on, her hands stiff claws from clutc-hing the
hand-le-bars. The stretch of musc-le ac-ross her ass and thighs was li-ke the re-min-der of a
two-day-old be-ating but she le-aned in-to the bi-ke, bo-ot so-le slip-ping on grit as she he-aved it in-to
mo-ti-on. She hop-ped on one fo-ot to kick the stand up, win-cing.
It wasn't the ri-ding. It was the stan-ding up, af-ter-ward.
She wal-ked the Ka-wa-sa-ki up the de-ser-ted high-way, bet-we-en the de-ser-ted bu-il-dings, the
pa-ve-ment hot eno-ugh to se-ar her fe-et thro-ugh the bo-ot le-at-her if she sto-od still for too long.
"Go-od girl," she told the Ka-wa-sa-ki, stro-king the for-ward bra-ke hand-le. It le-aned aga-inst her
he-avily, cum-ber-so-me at a wal-king pa-ce, li-ke wal-king a drunk fri-end ho-me. "Got-ta be a gas
sta-ti-on so-mew-he-re."
Of co-ur-se, the-re wo-uldn't be any po-wer to run the pumps, and pro-bably no sa-fe wa-ter, but
she'd fi-gu-re that out when she got the-re. Sun-light glim-me-red off the la-ke; she was fi-ne, she told
her-self, be-ca-use she wasn't too dehyd-ra-ted for her mo-uth to wet at the tho-ught of all that co-ol,
fresh wa-ter.
Except the-re was no tel-ling what kind of po-ison was in that la-ke. The-re was an old na-val ba-se
on its sho-re, and the la-ke it-self had be-en used as a kind of kid-die po-ol for sub-ma-ri-nes. Anyt-hing
at all co-uld be flo-ating aro-und in its wa-ters. Not, she ad-mit-ted, that the-re wasn't a cer-ta-in irony
to ta-king the long vi-ew at a ti-me li-ke this.
She spot-ted a Te-xa-co sta-ti-on, the red and whi-te sign ble-ac-hed pink and ivory, cra-zed by the
re-lent-less de-sert sun. Har-rie co-uldn't re-mem-ber if she was in the Mo-j-ave or the Black Rock
de-sert now, or so-me ot-her de-sert en-ti-rely. They all ran to-get-her. She jum-ped at her own slightly
hyste-ri-cal gig-gle. The pumps we-re off, as she'd an-ti-ci-pa-ted, but she le-aned the Ka-wa-sa-ki up
on its si-de stand any-way, grab-bed the cli-ma-te-cont-rol-led ca-se out of her sad-dle-bag, and went
to find a pla-ce to ta-ke a le-ak.
The le-at-her was hot on her fin-gers when she pul-led her glo-ves off and drop-ped her pants.
"Dam-ned, stu-pid… First thing I do when I get back to ci-vi-li-za-ti-on is buy a set of le-at-hers and a
hel-met in whi-te, dam-mit." She glan-ced at the Ka-wa-sa-ki as she fi-xed her-self, ex-pec-ting a hiss of

ag-re-ement, but the black bi-ke was si-lent. She blin-ked stin-ging eyes and tur-ned away.
There was a gar-den ho-se cur-led on its peg be-hind one of the tan-fa-ced ho-uses hud-dled by the
Te-xa-co sta-ti-on, the up-per si-de ble-ac-hed yel-low on gre-en li-ke the belly of a de-ad sna-ke.
Har-rie wrenc-hed it off the peg one-han-ded. The rub-ber was brit-tle from dry rot; she bro-ke it twi-ce
trying to un-co-il a sec-ti-on, but ma-na-ged to get abo-ut se-ven fe-et cle-an. She pri-ed the fill cap off
the un-derg-ro-und tank with a ti-re iron and yan-ked off her hel-met and air fil-ter to sniff, chec-king
both do-si-me-ters first.
It had, af-ter all, be-en one of tho-se days.
The gas smel-led mo-re or less li-ke ga-so-li-ne, tho-ugh, and it tas-ted li-ke fuc-king ga-so-li-ne too,
when she got a go-od mo-uth-ful of it from suc-king it up her imp-romp-tu sip-hon. Not very go-od
ga-so-li-ne, may-be, but beg-gars and cho-osers. The sip-hon wo-uldn't work as a sip-hon be-ca-use
she co-uldn't get the top end lo-wer than the bot-tom end, but she co-uld suck fu-el up in-to it and
trans-fer it, ho-se-ful by ho-se-ful, in-to the Ka-wa-sa-ki's empty tank, the pre-ci-o-us ca-se le-aning
aga-inst her bo-ot whi-le she did.
Finally, she saw the dark gle-am of flu-id shim-mer thro-ugh the fill ho-le when she pe-ered in-si-de
and tap-ped the si-de of the tank.
She clo-sed the tank and spat and spat, wis-hing she had wa-ter to wash the ga-so-li-ne away. The
la-ke glin-ted, moc-king her, and she re-so-lu-tely tur-ned her back on it and pic-ked up the ca-se.
It was light in her hand. She pa-used with one hand on the flap of the sad-dle-bag, we-ig-hing that
gle-aming sil-ver obj-ect, sta-ring past it at her bo-ots. She suc-ked on her lo-wer lip, tas-ted gas, and
tur-ned her he-ad and spat aga-in. "A few mo-re ye-ars of fre-edom, Con-nie," she sa-id, and stro-ked
the me-tal with a black-glo-ved hand. "You and me. I co-uld drink the wa-ter. It wo-uldn't mat-ter if that
was bad gas I fed you. Not-hing co-uld go wrong.
The Ka-wa-sa-ki was si-lent. Its keys jang-led in Har-rie's hip poc-ket. She to-uc-hed the throt-tle
lightly, drew her hand back, la-id the uno-pe-ned ca-se on the se-at. "What do you say, girl?"
Nothing, of co-ur-se. It was qu-i-es-cent, slum-be-ring, a dre-aming de-mon. She hadn't tur-ned it on.
With both thumbs at on-ce, Har-rie flic-ked up the latc-hes and ope-ned the ca-se.
It was co-ol in-si-de, co-ol eno-ugh that she co-uld fe-el the dif-fe-ren-ce on her fa-ce when she bent
over it. She kept the lid at half-mast, trying to block that co-ol air with her body so it wo-uldn't drift
away. She tip-ped her he-ad to see in-si-de: blue fo-am thre-aded thro-ugh with co-oling ele-ments,
sha-ped to hold the con-tents wit-ho-ut rat-tling. Pa-pers in a plas-tic fol-der, and so-met-hing in se-aled
cul-tu-re pla-tes, cle-ar jel-ly da-ubed with rag-ged pol-ka dots.
There was a sticky no-te tac-ked on the plas-tic fol-der. She re-ac-hed in-to the co-ol ca-se and
flic-ked the sticky no-te out, brin-ging it in-to the light. Patch's handw-ri-ting. She blin-ked.
"Sacramento next, if the-se don't get the-re," it sa-id, thick black de-fi-ni-te li-nes. "Li-ke Fa-us-tus,
we all get one go-od chan-ce to chan-ge our minds." If you me-et the Bud-dha on the ro-ad"I al-ways tho-ught the-re was mo-re to that son of a bitch than met the eye," she sa-id, and clo-sed
the ca-se, and stuf-fed the no-te in-to her poc-ket be-si-de the pen. She jam-med her hel-met back on,
do-ub-le-chec-king the fil-ter that had may-be star-ted le-aking a lit-tle aro-und the ed-ges in
To-no-pah, slung her leg over the Ka-wa-sa-ki's sad-dle, and clo-sed the cho-ke.
It gas-ped dry when she clutc-hed and thum-bed the start but-ton, sha-king bet-we-en her legs li-ke
an asth-ma-tic pony. She ga-ve it a lit-tle throt-tle, then eased up on it li-ke easing up on a vir-gin lo-ver.
Co-axing, ple-ading un-der her bre-ath. Ga-so-li-ne fu-mes from her mo-uth ma-de her eyes te-ar
in-si-de the hel-met; the te-ars or so-met-hing el-se was-hed the grit away. One cylin-der hic-cup-ped.
A se-cond one ca-ught.
She eased the cho-ke as the Ka-wa-sa-ki co-ug-hed and pur-red, shi-ve-ring, re-ady to run.
Both do-si-me-ters kic-ked hard as she rol-led ac-ross the flat, open pla-in to-ward Fal-lon, a
de-adly oasis in its own right. Ap-pa-rently Nick hadn't be-en sa-tis-fi-ed with a le-uka-emia clus-ter
and perch-lo-ra-te and ar-se-nic ta-in-ting the gro-und wa-ter; the tre-es Har-rie saw as she rol-led up
on the start-ling gre-en of the far-ming town we-ren't de-sert cot-ton-wo-ods but to-we-ring gi-ants of

the Euro-pe-an fo-rest, and so-met-hing grey and mas-si-ve, shim-me-ring with lo-vely craw-ling blue
Che-ren-kov ra-di-ati-on, gle-amed be-hind them. The signs she pas-sed we-re in an alp-ha-bet she
didn't un-ders-tand, but she knew the na-me of this pla-ce.
A light ra-in was fal-ling as she pas-sed thro-ugh Cher-nobyl.
It dro-ve down har-der as she tur-ned west on the 50, to-ward Re-no and Sparks and a crack un-der
the ed-ge of the clo-uds that glo-wed a to-xic, sal-low co-lo-ur with eve-ning co-ming on. Her ti-res
skit-te-red on slick, gre-asy asp-halt.
Where the ci-ti-es sho-uld ha-ve be-en, stin-king pi-les of gar-ba-ge cro-uc-hed aga-inst the
yel-lo-wing eve-ning sky, and ne-arly na-ked, star-va-ti-on-slen-der pe-op-le pic-ked the-ir way over
slum-ped rub-bish, cal-ling the na-mes of lo-ved ones bu-ri-ed un-der the ava-lanc-he. Wa-ter slu-iced
down her hel-met, so-aked her sad-dle, plas-te-red her le-at-hers to her body. She wis-hed she da-red
drink the ra-in. It didn't ma-ke her co-ol. It only ma-de her wet.
She didn't turn her he-ad to watch the wretc-hed vic-tims of the gar-ba-ge sli-de. She was one ho-ur
out of Sac-ra-men-to, and in Ma-ni-la of fifty ye-ars ago.
Donner Pass was gre-en and ple-asant, sun-set sta-ining the sky ahe-ad as red as me-at. She was in
plenty of ti-me. It was all down-hill from he-re.
Nick wasn't abo-ut to let her get away wit-ho-ut a fight.
The big one had re-ro-uted the Sac-ra-men-to Ri-ver too, and Har-rie tur-ned back at the ed-ge
be-ca-use the brid-ge was down and the wa-ter was on fi-re. She mo-to-red away, a hund-red me-ters,
two hund-red, un-til the he-at of the bur-ning ri-ver fa-ded aga-inst her back. "What's that?" she as-ked
the slim man in the pinst-ri-ped su-it who wa-ited for her by the ro-ad-si-de.
"Cuyahoga Ri-ver fi-re," he sa-id. "1969. Co-unt yo-ur bles-sings. It co-uld ha-ve be-en Bho-pal."
"Blessings?" She spa-red him a sar-do-nic smi-le, in-vi-sib-le be-hind her hel-met. He til-ted the brim
of his hat with a grey-glo-ved fin-ger. "I sup-po-se you co-uld say that.
What is it re-al-ly?" "Phle-get-hon."
She ra-ised her vi-sor and pe-eked over her sho-ul-der, watc-hing the ri-ver burn. Even he-re, it was
hot eno-ugh that her sod-den le-at-hers ste-amed aga-inst her back. The back of her hand pres-sed her
bre-ast poc-ket. The pa-per from Patch's no-te crink-led; her Cross po-ked her in the tit.
She lo-oked at Nick, and Nick lo-oked at her. "So that's it."
"That's all she wro-te. It's too far to jump."
"I can see that."
"Give me the ca-se and I'll let you go ho-me. I'll gi-ve you the Ka-wa-sa-ki and I'll gi-ve you yo-ur
fre-edom. We'll call it even."
She eyed him, ten-si-on up her right leg, toe res-ting on the gro-und. The gre-at pur-ring bi-ke shif-ted
he-avily bet-we-en her legs, lit-he as a cat, re-ady to turn and spit gra-vel from whir-ring ti-res. "Too far
to jump."
"That's what I sa-id."
Too far to jump. May-be. And may-be if she ga-ve him what was in the ca-se, and do-omed
Sac-ra-men-to li-ke Bho-pal, li-ke Cher-nobyl, li-ke Las Ve-gas…May-be she'd be dam-ning her-self
even if he ga-ve it back to her. And even if she wasn't, she wasn't su-re she and the Ka-wa-sa-ki co-uld
li-ve with that ans-wer.
If he wan-ted to ke-ep her, he had to let her ma-ke the jump, and she co-uld sa-ve Sac-ra-men-to. If
he was wil-ling to lo-se her, she might die on the way over, and Sac-ra-men-to might die with her, but
they wo-uld die free.
Either way, Nick lost. And that was go-od eno-ugh for her.
"Devil ta-ke the hind-most," she sa-id un-der her bre-ath, and to-uc-hed the throt-tle one mo-re ti-me.

XVII - OCTAVIA E. BUTLER - SPEECH SOUNDS

There was tro-ub-le abo-ard the Was-hing-ton Bo-ule-vard bus. Rye had ex-pec-ted tro-ub-le
so-oner or la-ter in her jo-ur-ney. She had put off go-ing un-til lo-ne-li-ness and ho-pe-les-sness dro-ve
her out. She be-li-eved she might ha-ve one gro-up of re-la-ti-ves left ali-ve-a brot-her and his two
child-ren twenty mi-les away in Pa-sa-de-na. That was a day's jo-ur-ney one-way, if she we-re lucky.
The unex-pec-ted ar-ri-val of the bus as she left her Vir-gi-nia Ro-ad ho-me had se-emed to be a pi-ece
of luck-until the tro-ub-le be-gan.
Two yo-ung men we-re in-vol-ved in a di-sag-re-ement of so-me kind, or, mo-re li-kely, a
mi-sun-ders-tan-ding. They sto-od in the ais-le, grun-ting and ges-tu-ring at each ot-her, each in his own
un-cer-ta-in T stan-ce as the bus lurc-hed over the pot-ho-les. The dri-ver se-emed to be put-ting so-me
ef-fort in-to ke-eping them off ba-lan-ce. Still, the-ir ges-tu-res stop-ped just short of con-tact-mock
punc-hes, hand ga-mes of in-ti-mi-da-ti-on to rep-la-ce lost cur-ses.
People watc-hed the pa-ir, then lo-oked at one anot-her and ma-de small an-xi-o-us so-unds. Two
child-ren whim-pe-red.
Rye sat a few fe-et be-hind the dis-pu-tants and ac-ross from the back do-or. She watc-hed the two
ca-re-ful-ly, kno-wing the fight wo-uld be-gin when so-me-one's ner-ve bro-ke or so-me-one's hand
slip-ped or so-me-one ca-me to the end of his li-mi-ted abi-lity to com-mu-ni-ca-te. The-se things
co-uld hap-pen any-ti-me.
One of them hap-pe-ned as the bus hit an es-pe-ci-al-ly lar-ge pot-ho-le and one man, tall, thin, and
sne-ering, was thrown in-to his shor-ter op-po-nent.
Instantly, the shor-ter man dro-ve his left fist in-to the di-sin-teg-ra-ting sne-er. He ham-me-red his
lar-ger op-po-nent as tho-ugh he ne-it-her had nor ne-eded any we-apon ot-her than his left fist. He hit
qu-ickly eno-ugh, hard eno-ugh to bat-ter his op-po-nent down be-fo-re the tal-ler man co-uld re-ga-in
his ba-lan-ce or hit back even on-ce.
People scre-amed or squ-aw-ked in fe-ar. Tho-se ne-arby scramb-led to get out of the way. Three
mo-re yo-ung men ro-ared in ex-ci-te-ment and ges-tu-red wildly. Then, so-me-how, a se-cond
dis-pu-te bro-ke out bet-we-en two of the-se three-pro-bably be-ca-use one inad-ver-tently to-uc-hed
or hit the ot-her.
As the se-cond fight scat-te-red frigh-te-ned pas-sen-gers, a wo-man sho-ok the dri-ver's sho-ul-der
and grun-ted as she ges-tu-red to-ward the figh-ting.
The dri-ver grun-ted back thro-ugh ba-red te-eth. Frigh-te-ned, the wo-man drew away.
Rye, kno-wing the met-hods of bus dri-vers, bra-ced her-self and held on to the cros-sbar of the se-at
in front of her. When the dri-ver hit the bra-kes, she was re-ady and the com-ba-tants we-re not. They
fell over se-ats and on-to scre-aming pas-sen-gers, cre-ating even mo-re con-fu-si-on. At le-ast one
mo-re fight star-ted.
The ins-tant the bus ca-me to a full stop, Rye was on her fe-et, pus-hing the back do-or. At the
se-cond push, it ope-ned and she jum-ped out, hol-ding her pack in one arm. Se-ve-ral ot-her
pas-sen-gers fol-lo-wed, but so-me sta-yed on the bus. Bu-ses we-re so ra-re and ir-re-gu-lar now,
pe-op-le ro-de when they co-uld, no mat-ter what. The-re might not be anot-her bus to-day-or
to-mor-row. Pe-op-le star-ted wal-king, and if they saw a bus they flag-ged it down. Pe-op-le ma-king
in-ter-city trips li-ke Rye's from Los An-ge-les to Pa-sa-de-na ma-de plans to camp out, or ris-ked
se-eking shel-ter with lo-cals who might rob or mur-der them.
The bus did not mo-ve, but Rye mo-ved away from it. She in-ten-ded to wa-it un-til the tro-ub-le was
over and get on aga-in, but if the-re was sho-oting, she wan-ted the pro-tec-ti-on of a tree. Thus, she
was ne-ar the curb when a bat-te-red blue Ford on the ot-her si-de of the stre-et ma-de a U-turn and
pul-led up in front of the bus. Cars we-re ra-re the-se days-as ra-re as a se-ve-re shor-ta-ge of fu-el and
of re-la-ti-vely unim-pa-ired mec-ha-nics co-uld ma-ke them. Cars that still ran we-re as li-kely to be
used as we-apons as they we-re to ser-ve as trans-por-ta-ti-on. Thus, when the dri-ver of the Ford
bec-ko-ned to Rye, she mo-ved away wa-rily. The dri-ver got out-a big man, yo-ung, ne-atly be-ar-ded
with dark, thick ha-ir. He wo-re a long over-co-at and a lo-ok of wa-ri-ness that matc-hed Rye's. She
sto-od se-ve-ral fe-et from him, wa-iting to see what he wo-uld do. He lo-oked at the bus, now roc-king
with the com-bat in-si-de, then at the small clus-ter of pas-sen-gers who had got-ten off. Fi-nal-ly he

lo-oked at Rye aga-in.
She re-tur-ned his ga-ze, very much awa-re of the old forty-fi-ve auto-ma-tic her jac-ket con-ce-aled.
She watc-hed his hands.
He po-in-ted with his left hand to-ward the bus. The dark-tin-ted win-dows pre-ven-ted him from
se-e-ing what was hap-pe-ning in-si-de.
His use of the left hand in-te-res-ted Rye mo-re than his ob-vi-o-us qu-es-ti-on. Left-han-ded
pe-op-le ten-ded to be less im-pa-ired, mo-re re-aso-nab-le and comp-re-hen-ding, less dri-ven by
frust-ra-ti-on, con-fu-si-on, and an-ger.
She imi-ta-ted his ges-tu-re, po-in-ting to-ward the bus with her own left hand, then punc-hing the air
with both fists.
The man to-ok off his co-at re-ve-aling a Los An-ge-les Po-li-ce De-part-ment uni-form comp-le-te
with ba-ton and ser-vi-ce re-vol-ver.
Rye to-ok anot-her step back from him. The-re was no mo-re LAPD, no mo-re any lar-ge
or-ga-ni-za-ti-on, go-vern-men-tal or pri-va-te. The-re we-re ne-igh-bo-ur-ho-od pat-rols and ar-med
in-di-vi-du-als. That was all.
The man to-ok so-met-hing from his co-at poc-ket, then threw the co-at in-to the car. Then he
ges-tu-red Rye back, back to-ward the re-ar of the bus. He had so-met-hing ma-de of plas-tic in his
hand. Rye did not un-ders-tand what he wan-ted un-til he went to the re-ar do-or of the bus and
bec-ko-ned her to stand the-re. She obe-yed ma-inly out of cu-ri-osity. Cop or not, may-be he co-uld
do so-met-hing to stop the stu-pid figh-ting.
He wal-ked aro-und the front of the bus, to the stre-et si-de whe-re the dri-ver's win-dow was open.
The-re, she tho-ught she saw him throw so-met-hing in-to the bus. She was still trying to pe-er thro-ugh
the tin-ted glass when pe-op-le be-gan stumb-ling out the re-ar do-or, cho-king and we-eping. Gas.
Rye ca-ught an old wo-man who wo-uld ha-ve fal-len, lif-ted two lit-tle child-ren down when they
we-re in dan-ger of be-ing knoc-ked down and tramp-led. She co-uld see the be-ar-ded man hel-ping
pe-op-le at the front do-or. She ca-ught a thin old man sho-ved out by one of the com-ba-tants.
Stag-ge-red by the old man's we-ight, she was ba-rely ab-le to get out of the way as the last of the
yo-ung men pus-hed his way out. This one, ble-eding from no-se and mo-uth, stumb-led in-to anot-her,
and they grap-pled blindly, still sob-bing from the gas.
The be-ar-ded man hel-ped the bus dri-ver out thro-ugh the front do-or, tho-ugh the dri-ver did not
se-em to ap-pre-ci-ate his help. For a mo-ment, Rye tho-ught the-re wo-uld be anot-her fight. The
be-ar-ded man step-ped back and watc-hed the dri-ver ges-tu-re thre-ate-ningly, watc-hed him sho-ut
in word-less an-ger.
The be-ar-ded man sto-od still, ma-de no so-und, re-fu-sed to res-pond to cle-arly obs-ce-ne
ges-tu-res. The le-ast im-pa-ired pe-op-le ten-ded to do this-stand back un-less they we-re physi-cal-ly
thre-ate-ned and let tho-se with less cont-rol scre-am and jump aro-und. It was as tho-ugh they felt it
be-ne-ath them to be as to-uchy as the less comp-re-hen-ding. This was an at-ti-tu-de of su-pe-ri-ority,
and that was the way pe-op-le li-ke the bus dri-ver per-ce-ived it. Such "su-pe-ri-ority" was fre-qu-ently
pu-nis-hed by be-atings, even by de-ath. Rye had had clo-se calls of her own. As a re-sult, she ne-ver
went unar-med. And in this world whe-re the only li-kely com-mon lan-gu-age was body lan-gu-age,
be-ing ar-med was of-ten eno-ugh. She had ra-rely had to draw her gun or even disp-lay it.
The be-ar-ded man's re-vol-ver was on cons-tant disp-lay. Ap-pa-rently that was eno-ugh for the bus
dri-ver. The dri-ver spat in dis-gust, gla-red at the be-ar-ded man for a mo-ment lon-ger, then stro-de
back to his gas-fil-led bus. He sta-red at it for a mo-ment, cle-arly wan-ting to get in, but the gas was still
too strong. Of the win-dows, only his tiny dri-ver's win-dow ac-tu-al-ly ope-ned. The front do-or was
open, but the re-ar do-or wo-uld not stay open un-less so-me-one held it. Of co-ur-se, the air
con-di-ti-oning had fa-iled long ago. The bus wo-uld ta-ke so-me ti-me to cle-ar. It was the dri-ver's
pro-perty, his li-ve-li-ho-od. He had pas-ted old ma-ga-zi-ne pic-tu-res of items he wo-uld ac-cept as
fa-re on its si-des. Then he wo-uld use what he col-lec-ted to fe-ed his fa-mily or to tra-de. If his bus did
not run, he did not eat. On the ot-her hand, if the in-si-de of his bus was torn apart by sen-se-less
figh-ting, he wo-uld not eat very well eit-her. He was ap-pa-rently unab-le to per-ce-ive this. All he

co-uld see was that it wo-uld be so-me ti-me be-fo-re he co-uld use his bus aga-in. He sho-ok his fist at
the be-ar-ded man and sho-uted. The-re se-emed to be words in his sho-ut, but Rye co-uld not
un-ders-tand them. She did not know whet-her this was his fa-ult or hers. She had he-ard so lit-tle
co-he-rent hu-man spe-ech for the past three ye-ars, she was no lon-ger cer-ta-in how well she
re-cog-ni-zed it, no lon-ger cer-ta-in of the deg-ree of her own im-pa-ir-ment.
The be-ar-ded man sig-hed. He glan-ced to-ward his car, then bec-ko-ned to Rye. He was re-ady to
le-ave, but he wan-ted so-met-hing from her first. No. No, he wan-ted her to le-ave with him. Risk
get-ting in-to his car when, in spi-te of his uni-form, law and or-der we-re not-hing-not even words any
lon-ger.
She sho-ok her he-ad in a uni-ver-sal-ly un-ders-to-od ne-ga-ti-ve, but the man con-ti-nu-ed to
bec-kon.
She wa-ved him away. He was do-ing what the less im-pa-ired ra-rely did dra-wing po-ten-ti-al-ly
ne-ga-ti-ve at-ten-ti-on to anot-her of his kind. Pe-op-le from the bus had be-gun to lo-ok at her.
One of the men who had be-en figh-ting tap-ped anot-her on the arm, then po-in-ted from the
be-ar-ded man to Rye, and fi-nal-ly held up the first two fin-gers of his right hand as tho-ugh gi-ving
two-thirds of a Boy Sco-ut sa-lu-te. The ges-tu-re was very qu-ick, it’s me-aning ob-vi-o-us even at a
dis-tan-ce. She had be-en gro-uped with the be-ar-ded man. Now what?
The man who had ma-de the ges-tu-re star-ted to-ward her.
She had no idea what he in-ten-ded, but she sto-od her gro-und. The man was half a fo-ot tal-ler than
she was and per-haps ten ye-ars yo-un-ger. She did not ima-gi-ne she co-uld out-run him. Nor did she
ex-pect an-yo-ne to help her if she ne-eded help. The pe-op-le aro-und her we-re all stran-gers.
She ges-tu-red on-ce-a cle-ar in-di-ca-ti-on to the man to stop. She did not in-tend to re-pe-at the
ges-tu-re. For-tu-na-tely, the man obe-yed. He ges-tu-red obs-ce-nely and se-ve-ral ot-her men
la-ug-hed. Loss of ver-bal lan-gu-age had spaw-ned a who-le new set of obs-ce-ne ges-tu-res. The
man, with stark simp-li-city, had ac-cu-sed her of sex with the be-ar-ded man and had sug-ges-ted she
ac-com-mo-da-te the ot-her men pre-sent-be-gin-ning with him.
Rye watc-hed him we-arily. Pe-op-le might very well stand by and watch if he tri-ed to ra-pe her.
They wo-uld al-so stand and watch her sho-ot him. Wo-uld he push things that far?
He did not. Af-ter a se-ri-es of obs-ce-ne ges-tu-res that bro-ught him no clo-ser to her, he tur-ned
con-temp-tu-o-usly and wal-ked away.
And the be-ar-ded man still wa-ited. He had re-mo-ved his ser-vi-ce re-vol-ver, hols-ter and all. He
bec-ko-ned aga-in, both hands empty. No do-ubt his gun was in the car and wit-hin easy re-ach, but his
ta-king it off imp-res-sed her. May-be he was all right. May-be he was just alo-ne. She had be-en alo-ne
her-self for three ye-ars. The il-lness had strip-ped her, kil-ling her child-ren one by one, kil-ling her
hus-band, her sis-ter, her pa-rents
The il-lness, if it was an il-lness, had cut even the li-ving off from one anot-her. As it swept over the
co-untry, pe-op-le hardly had ti-me to lay bla-me on the So-vi-ets (tho-ugh they we-re fal-ling si-lent
along with the rest of the world), on a new vi-rus, a new pol-lu-tant, ra-di-ati-on, di-vi-ne ret-ri-bu-ti-on
The il-lness was stro-ke-swift in the way it cut pe-op-le down and stro-ke li-ke in so-me of its ef-fects.
But it was highly spe-ci-fic. Lan-gu-age was al-ways lost or se-ve-rely im-pa-ired. It was ne-ver
re-ga-ined. Of-ten the-re was al-so pa-raly-sis, in-tel-lec-tu-al im-pa-ir-ment, de-ath.
Rye wal-ked to-ward the be-ar-ded man, ig-no-ring the whist-ling and ap-pla-uding of two of the
yo-ung men and the-ir thumbs-up signs to the be-ar-ded man. If he had smi-led at them or
ack-now-led-ged them in any way, she wo-uld al-most cer-ta-inly ha-ve chan-ged her mind. If she had
let her-self think of the pos-sib-le de-adly con-se-qu-en-ces of get-ting in-to a stran-ger's car, she
wo-uld ha-ve chan-ged her mind. Ins-te-ad, she tho-ught of the man who li-ved ac-ross the stre-et from
her. He ra-rely was-hed sin-ce his bo-ut with the il-lness. And he had got-ten in-to the ha-bit of
uri-na-ting whe-re-ver he hap-pe-ned to be. He had two wo-men al-re-ady-one ten-ding each of his
lar-ge gar-dens. They put up with him in exc-han-ge for his pro-tec-ti-on. He had ma-de it cle-ar that he
wan-ted Rye to be-co-me his third wo-man.
She got in-to the car and the be-ar-ded man shut the do-or. She watc-hed as he wal-ked aro-und to

the dri-ver's do-or-watc-hed for his sa-ke be-ca-use his gun was on the se-at be-si-de her. And the bus
dri-ver and a pa-ir of yo-ung men had co-me a few steps clo-ser. They did not-hing, tho-ugh, un-til the
be-ar-ded man was in the car. Then one of them threw a rock. Ot-hers fol-lo-wed his examp-le, and as
the car dro-ve away, se-ve-ral rocks bo-un-ced off harm-les-sly.
When the bus was so-me dis-tan-ce be-hind them, Rye wi-ped swe-at from her fo-re-he-ad and
lon-ged to re-lax. The bus wo-uld ha-ve ta-ken her mo-re than half-way to Pa-sa-de-na. She wo-uld
ha-ve had only ten mi-les to walk. She won-de-red how far she wo-uld ha-ve to walk now-and
won-de-red if wal-king a long dis-tan-ce wo-uld be her only prob-lem.
At Fi-gu-roa and Was-hing-ton whe-re the bus nor-mal-ly ma-de a left turn, the be-ar-ded man
stop-ped, lo-oked at her, and in-di-ca-ted that she sho-uld cho-ose a di-rec-ti-on. When she di-rec-ted
him left and he ac-tu-al-ly tur-ned left, she be-gan to re-lax. If he was wil-ling to go whe-re she
di-rec-ted, per-haps he was sa-fe.
As they pas-sed blocks of bur-ned, aban-do-ned bu-il-dings, empty lots, and wrec-ked or strip-ped
cars, he slip-ped a gold cha-in over his he-ad and han-ded it to her. The pen-dant at-tac-hed to it was a
smo-oth, glassy, black rock. Ob-si-di-an. His na-me might be Rock or Pe-ter or Black, but she
de-ci-ded to think of him as Ob-si-di-an. Even her so-me-ti-mes use-less me-mory wo-uld re-ta-in a
na-me li-ke Ob-si-di-an.
She han-ded him her own na-me symbol-a pin in the sha-pe of a lar-ge gol-den stalk of whe-at. She
had bo-ught it long be-fo-re the il-lness and the si-len-ce be-gan. Now she wo-re it, thin-king it was as
clo-se as she was li-kely to co-me to Rye. Pe-op-le li-ke Ob-si-di-an who had not known her be-fo-re
pro-bably tho-ught of her as Whe-at. Not that it mat-te-red. She wo-uld ne-ver he-ar her na-me
spo-ken aga-in.
Obsidian han-ded her pin back to her. He ca-ught her hand as she re-ac-hed for it and rub-bed his
thumb over her cal-lu-ses.
He stop-ped at First Stre-et and as-ked which way aga-in. Then, af-ter tur-ning right as she had
in-di-ca-ted, he par-ked ne-ar the Mu-sic Cent-re. The-re, he to-ok a fol-ded pa-per from the
dash-bo-ard and un-fol-ded it. Rye re-cog-ni-zed it as a stre-et map, tho-ugh the wri-ting on it me-ant
not-hing to her. He flat-te-ned the map, to-ok her hand aga-in, and put her in-dex fin-ger on one spot.
He to-uc-hed her, to-uc-hed him-self, po-in-ted to-ward the flo-or. In ef-fect, "We are he-re." She
knew he wan-ted to know whe-re she was go-ing. She wan-ted to tell him, but she sho-ok her he-ad
sadly. She had lost re-ading and wri-ting. That was her most se-ri-o-us im-pa-ir-ment and her most
pa-in-ful. She had ta-ught his-tory at UC-LA. She had do-ne fre-elan-ce wri-ting. Now she co-uld not
even re-ad her own ma-nusc-ripts. She had a ho-use-ful of bo-oks that she co-uld ne-it-her re-ad nor
bring her-self to use as fu-el. And she had a me-mory that wo-uld not bring back to her much of what
she had re-ad be-fo-re.
She sta-red at the map, trying to cal-cu-la-te. She had be-en born in Pa-sa-de-na, had li-ved for
fif-te-en ye-ars in Los An-ge-les. Now she was ne-ar L.A. Ci-vic Cent-re. She knew the re-la-ti-ve
po-si-ti-ons of the two ci-ti-es, knew stre-ets, di-rec-ti-ons, even knew to stay away from fre-eways,
which might be bloc-ked by wrec-ked cars and dest-ro-yed over-pas-ses. She ought to know how to
po-int out Pa-sa-de-na even tho-ugh she co-uld not re-cog-ni-ze the word.
Hesitantly, she pla-ced her hand over a pa-le oran-ge patch in the up-per right cor-ner of the map.
That sho-uld be right. Pa-sa-de-na.
Obsidian lif-ted her hand and lo-oked un-der it, then fol-ded the map and put it back on the
dash-bo-ard. He co-uld re-ad, she re-ali-zed be-la-tedly. He co-uld pro-bably wri-te, too. Ab-ruptly,
she ha-ted him-de-ep, bit-ter hat-red. What did li-te-racy me-an to him-a grown man who pla-yed cops
and rob-bers? But he was li-te-ra-te and she was not. She ne-ver wo-uld be. She felt sick to her
sto-mach with hat-red, frust-ra-ti-on, and je-alo-usy. And only a few inc-hes from her hand was a
lo-aded gun.
She held her-self still, sta-ring at him, al-most se-e-ing his blo-od. But her ra-ge cres-ted and eb-bed
and she did not-hing.
Obsidian re-ac-hed for her hand with he-si-tant fa-mi-li-arity. She lo-oked at him. Her fa-ce had

al-re-ady re-ve-aled too much. No per-son still li-ving in what was left of hu-man so-ci-ety co-uld fa-il to
re-cog-ni-ze that exp-res-si-on, that je-alo-usy.
She clo-sed her eyes we-arily, drew a de-ep bre-ath. She had ex-pe-ri-en-ced lon-ging for the past,
hat-red of the pre-sent, gro-wing ho-pe-les-sness, pur-po-se-les-sness, but she had ne-ver
ex-pe-ri-en-ced such a po-wer-ful ur-ge to kill anot-her per-son. She had left her ho-me, fi-nal-ly,
be-ca-use she had co-me ne-ar to kil-ling her-self. She had fo-und no re-ason to stay ali-ve. Per-haps
that was why she had got-ten in-to Ob-si-di-an's car. She had ne-ver be-fo-re do-ne such a thing.
He to-uc-hed her mo-uth and ma-de chat-ter mo-ti-ons with thumb and fin-gers. Co-uld she spe-ak?
She nod-ded and watc-hed his mil-der envy co-me and go. Now both had ad-mit-ted what it was not
sa-fe to ad-mit, and the-re had be-en no vi-olen-ce. He tap-ped his mo-uth and fo-re-he-ad and sho-ok
his he-ad. He did not spe-ak or comp-re-hend spo-ken lan-gu-age. The il-lness had pla-yed with them,
ta-king away, she sus-pec-ted, what each va-lu-ed most.
She pluc-ked at his sle-eve, won-de-ring why he had de-ci-ded on his own to ke-ep the LAPD ali-ve
with what he had left. He was sa-ne eno-ugh ot-her-wi-se. Why wasn't he at ho-me ra-ising corn,
rab-bits, and child-ren? But she did not know how to ask. Then he put his hand on her thigh and she had
anot-her qu-es-ti-on to de-al with.
She sho-ok her he-ad. Di-se-ase, preg-nancy, help-less, so-li-tary agony…no.
He mas-sa-ged her thigh gently and smi-led in ob-vi-o-us dis-be-li-ef.
No one had to-uc-hed her for three ye-ars. She had not wan-ted an-yo-ne to to-uch her. What kind
of world was this to chan-ce brin-ging a child in-to even if the fat-her we-re wil-ling to stay and help
ra-ise it? It was too bad, tho-ugh. Ob-si-di-an co-uld not know how at-trac-ti-ve he was to her-yo-ung,
pro-bably yo-un-ger than she was, cle-an, as-king for what he wan-ted rat-her than de-man-ding it. But
no-ne of that mat-te-red. What we-re a few mo-ments of ple-asu-re me-asu-red aga-inst a li-fe-ti-me of
con-se-qu-en-ces?
He pul-led her clo-ser to him and for a mo-ment she let her-self enj-oy the clo-se-ness. He smel-led
go-od-ma-le and go-od. She pul-led away re-luc-tantly.
He sig-hed, re-ac-hed to-ward the glo-ve com-part-ment. She stif-fe-ned, not kno-wing what to
ex-pect, but all he to-ok out was a small box. The wri-ting on it me-ant not-hing to her. She did not
un-ders-tand un-til he bro-ke the se-al, ope-ned the box, and to-ok out a con-dom. He lo-oked at her,
and she first lo-oked away in surp-ri-se. Then she gig-gled. She co-uld not re-mem-ber when she had
last gig-gled.
He grin-ned, ges-tu-red to-ward the back-se-at, and she la-ug-hed alo-ud. Even in her te-ens, she
had dis-li-ked back-se-ats of cars. But she lo-oked aro-und at the empty stre-ets and ru-ined
bu-il-dings, then she got out and in-to the back-se-at. He let her put the con-dom on him, then se-emed
surp-ri-sed at her eager-ness.
Sometime la-ter, they sat to-get-her, co-ve-red by his co-at, un-wil-ling to be-co-me clot-hed
ne-ar-stran-gers aga-in just yet. He ma-de rock-the-baby ges-tu-res and lo-oked qu-es-ti-oningly at her.
She swal-lo-wed, sho-ok her he-ad. She did not know how to tell him her child-ren we-re de-ad.
He to-ok her hand and drew a cross in it with his in-dex fin-ger, then ma-de his baby-roc-king
ges-tu-re aga-in.
She nod-ded, held up three fin-gers, then tur-ned away, trying to shut out a sud-den flo-od of
me-mo-ri-es. She had told her-self that the child-ren gro-wing up now we-re to be pi-ti-ed. They wo-uld
run thro-ugh the down-town can-yons with no re-al me-mory of what the bu-il-dings had be-en or even
how they had co-me to be. To-day s child-ren gat-he-red bo-oks as well as wo-od to be bur-ned as
fu-el. They ran thro-ugh the stre-ets cha-sing one anot-her and ho-oting li-ke chim-pan-ze-es. They had
no fu-tu-re. They we-re now all they wo-uld ever be.
He put his hand on her sho-ul-der, and she tur-ned sud-denly, fumb-ling for his small box, then ur-ging
him to ma-ke lo-ve to her aga-in. He co-uld gi-ve her for-get-ful-ness and ple-asu-re. Un-til now,
not-hing had be-en ab-le to do that. Un-til now, every day had bro-ught her clo-ser to the ti-me when
she wo-uld do what she had left ho-me to avo-id do-ing: put-ting her gun in her mo-uth and pul-ling the
trig-ger.

She as-ked Ob-si-di-an if he wo-uld co-me ho-me with her, stay with her.
He lo-oked surp-ri-sed and ple-ased on-ce he un-ders-to-od. But he did not ans-wer at on-ce.
Fi-nal-ly, he sho-ok his he-ad as she had fe-ared he might. He was pro-bably ha-ving too much fun
pla-ying cops and rob-bers and pic-king up wo-men.
She dres-sed in si-lent di-sap-po-int-ment, unab-le to fe-el any an-ger to-ward him. Per-haps he
al-re-ady had a wi-fe and a ho-me. That was li-kely. The il-lness had be-en har-der on men than on
wo-men-had kil-led mo-re men, had left ma-le sur-vi-vors mo-re se-ve-rely im-pa-ired. Men li-ke
Ob-si-di-an we-re ra-re. Wo-men eit-her set-tled for less or sta-yed alo-ne. If they fo-und an
Ob-si-di-an, they did what they co-uld to ke-ep him. Rye sus-pec-ted he had so-me-one yo-un-ger,
pret-ti-er ke-eping him.
He to-uc-hed her whi-le she was strap-ping her gun on and as-ked with a comp-li-ca-ted se-ri-es of
ges-tu-res whet-her it was lo-aded.
She nod-ded grimly. He pat-ted her arm.
She as-ked on-ce mo-re if he wo-uld co-me ho-me with her, this ti-me using a dif-fe-rent se-ri-es of
ges-tu-res. He had se-emed he-si-tant. Per-haps he co-uld be co-ur-ted.
He got out and in-to the front se-at wit-ho-ut res-pon-ding. She to-ok her pla-ce in front aga-in,
watc-hing him. Now he pluc-ked at his uni-form and lo-oked at her. She tho-ught she was be-ing as-ked
so-met-hing but did not know what it was.
He to-ok off his bad-ge, tap-ped it with one fin-ger, then tap-ped his chest. Of co-ur-se.
She to-ok the bad-ge from his hand and pin-ned her whe-at stalk to it. If pla-ying cops and rob-bers
was his only in-sa-nity, let him play. She wo-uld ta-ke him, uni-form and all. It oc-cur-red to her that she
might even-tu-al-ly lo-se him to so-me-one he wo-uld me-et as he had met her. But she wo-uld ha-ve
him for a whi-le. He to-ok the stre-et map down aga-in, tap-ped it, po-in-ted va-gu-ely nort-he-ast
to-ward Pa-sa-de-na, then lo-oked at her.
She shrug-ged, tap-ped his sho-ul-der, then her own, and held up her in-dex and se-cond fin-gers
tight to-get-her, just to be su-re. He gras-ped the two fin-gers and nod-ded. He was with her.
She to-ok the map from him and threw it on-to the dash-bo-ard. She po-in-ted back
so-uth-west-back to-ward ho-me. Now she did not ha-ve to go to Pa-sa-de-na. Now she co-uld go on
ha-ving a brot-her the-re and two nep-hews-three right-han-ded ma-les. Now she did not ha-ve to find
out for cer-ta-in whet-her she was as alo-ne as she fe-ared. Now she was not alo-ne.
Obsidian to-ok Hill Stre-et so-uth, then Was-hing-ton west, and she le-aned back, won-de-ring what
it wo-uld be li-ke to ha-ve so-me-one aga-in. With what she had sca-ven-ged, what she had
pre-ser-ved, and what she grew, the-re was easily eno-ugh fo-od for them. The-re was cer-ta-inly
ro-om eno-ugh in a fo-ur-bed-ro-om ho-use. He co-uld mo-ve his pos-ses-si-ons in. Best of all, the
ani-mal ac-ross the stre-et wo-uld pull back and pos-sibly not for-ce her to kill him.
Obsidian had drawn her clo-ser to him, and she had put her he-ad on his sho-ul-der when sud-denly
he bra-ked hard, al-most thro-wing her off the se-at. Out of the cor-ner of her eye, she saw that
so-me-one had run ac-ross the stre-et in front of the car. One car on the stre-et and so-me-one had to
run in front of it.
Straightening up, Rye saw that the run-ner was a wo-man, fle-e-ing from an old fra-me ho-use to a
bo-ar-ded-up sto-ref-ront. She ran si-lently, but the man who fol-lo-wed her a mo-ment la-ter sho-uted
what so-un-ded li-ke garb-led words as he ran. He had so-met-hing in his hand. Not a gun. A kni-fe,
per-haps.
The wo-man tri-ed a do-or, fo-und it loc-ked, lo-oked aro-und des-pe-ra-tely, fi-nal-ly snatc-hed up
a frag-ment of glass bro-ken from the sto-ref-ront win-dow. With this she tur-ned to fa-ce her pur-su-er.
Rye tho-ught she wo-uld be mo-re li-kely to cut her own hand than to hurt an-yo-ne el-se with the glass.
Obsidian jum-ped from the car, sho-uting. It was the first ti-me Rye had he-ard his vo-ice-de-ep and
ho-ar-se from di-su-se He ma-de the sa-me so-und over and over the way so-me spe-ech-less pe-op-le
did, "Da, da, da!"
Rye got out of the car as Ob-si-di-an ran to-ward the co-up-le. He had drawn his gun. Fe-ar-ful, she
drew her own and re-le-ased the sa-fety. She lo-oked aro-und to see who el-se might be at-trac-ted to

the sce-ne. She saw the man glan-ce at Ob-si-di-an, then sud-denly lun-ge at the wo-man. The wo-man
jab-bed his fa-ce with her glass, but he ca-ught her arm and ma-na-ged to stab her twi-ce be-fo-re
Ob-si-di-an shot him.
The man do-ub-led, then top-pled, clutc-hing his ab-do-men. Ob-si-di-an sho-uted, then ges-tu-red
Rye over to help the wo-man. Rye mo-ved to the wo-man's si-de, re-mem-be-ring that she had lit-tle
mo-re than ban-da-ges and an-ti-sep-tic in her pack. But the wo-man was be-yond help. She had be-en
stab-bed with a long, slen-der bo-ning kni-fe.
She to-uc-hed Ob-si-di-an to let him know the wo-man was de-ad. He had bent to check the
wo-un-ded man who lay still and al-so se-emed de-ad. But as Ob-si-di-an lo-oked aro-und to see what
Rye wan-ted, the man ope-ned his eyes. Fa-ce con-tor-ted, he se-ized Ob-si-di-an's just-hols-te-red
re-vol-ver and fi-red. The bul-let ca-ught Ob-si-di-an in the temp-le and he col-lap-sed.
It hap-pe-ned just that simply, just that fast. An ins-tant la-ter, Rye shot the wo-un-ded man as he was
tur-ning the gun on her.
And Rye was alo-ne-with three corp-ses.
She knelt be-si-de Ob-si-di-an, dry-eyed, frow-ning, trying to un-ders-tand why everyt-hing had
sud-denly chan-ged. Ob-si-di-an was go-ne. He had di-ed and left her-li-ke ever-yo-ne el-se.
Two very small child-ren ca-me out of the ho-use from which the man and wo-man had run-a hoy and
girl per-haps three ye-ars old. Hol-ding hands, they cros-sed the stre-et to-ward Kye. They sta-red at
her, then ed-ged past her and went to the de-ad wo-man. The girl sho-ok the wo-man's arm as tho-ugh
trying to wa-ke her.
This was too much. Rye got up, fe-eling sick to her sto-mach with gri-ef and an-ger. If the child-ren
be-gan to cry, she tho-ught she wo-uld vo-mit.
They we-re on the-ir own, tho-se two kids. They we-re old eno-ugh to sca-ven-ge. She did not ne-ed
any mo-re gri-ef. She did not ne-ed a stran-ger's child-ren who wo-uld grow up to be ha-ir-less chimps.
She went back to the car. She co-uld dri-ve ho-me, at le-ast. She re-mem-be-red how to dri-ve.
The tho-ught that Ob-si-di-an sho-uld be bu-ri-ed oc-cur-red to her be-fo-re she re-ac-hed the car,
and she did vo-mit.
She had fo-und and lost the man so qu-ickly. It was as tho-ugh she had be-en snatc-hed from
com-fort and se-cu-rity and gi-ven a sud-den, inexp-li-cab-le be-ating. Her he-ad wo-uld not cle-ar. She
co-uld not think.
Somehow, she ma-de her-self go back to him, lo-ok at him. She fo-und her-self on her kne-es
be-si-de him with no me-mory of ha-ving knelt. She stro-ked his fa-ce, his be-ard. One of the child-ren
ma-de a no-ise and she lo-oked at them, at the wo-man who was pro-bably the-ir mot-her. The
child-ren lo-oked back at her, ob-vi-o-usly frigh-te-ned. Per-haps it was the-ir fe-ar that re-ac-hed her
fi-nal-ly.
She had be-en abo-ut to dri-ve away and le-ave them. She had al-most do-ne it, al-most left two
tod-dlers to die. Su-rely the-re had be-en eno-ugh dying. She wo-uld ha-ve to ta-ke the child-ren ho-me
with her. She wo-uld not be ab-le to li-ve with any ot-her de-ci-si-on. She lo-oked aro-und for a pla-ce
to bury three bo-di-es. Or two. She won-de-red if the mur-de-rer we-re the child-ren's fat-her. Be-fo-re
the si-len-ce, the po-li-ce had al-ways sa-id so-me of the most dan-ge-ro-us calls they went out on
we-re do-mes-tic dis-tur-ban-ce calls. Ob-si-di-an sho-uld ha-ve known that-not that the know-led-ge
wo-uld ha-ve kept him in the car. It wo-uld not ha-ve held her back eit-her. She co-uld not ha-ve
watc-hed the wo-man mur-de-red and do-ne not-hing.
She drag-ged Ob-si-di-an to-ward the car. She had not-hing to dig with her, and no one to gu-ard for
her whi-le she dug. Bet-ter to ta-ke the bo-di-es with her and bury them next to her hus-band and her
child-ren. Ob-si-di-an wo-uld co-me ho-me with her af-ter all.
When she had got-ten him on-to the flo-or in the back, she re-tur-ned for the wo-man. The lit-tle girl,
thin, dirty, so-lemn, sto-od up and unk-no-wingly ga-ve Rye a gift. As Rye be-gan to drag the wo-man
by her arms, the lit-tle girl scre-amed, "No!"
Rye drop-ped the wo-man and sta-red at the girl.
"No!" the girl re-pe-ated. She ca-me to stand be-si-de the wo-man. "Go away!" she told Rye.

"Don't talk," the lit-tle boy sa-id to her. The-re was no blur-ring or con-fu-sing of so-unds. Both
child-ren had spo-ken and Rye had un-ders-to-od. The boy lo-oked at the de-ad mur-de-rer and
mo-ved furt-her from him. He to-ok the girl's hand. "Be qu-i-et," he whis-pe-red.
Fluent spe-ech! Had the wo-man di-ed be-ca-use she co-uld talk and had ta-ught her child-ren to
talk? Had she be-en kil-led by a hus-band's fes-te-ring an-ger or by a stran-ger's je-alo-us ra-ge?
And the child-ren…they must ha-ve be-en born af-ter the si-len-ce. Had the di-se-ase run its
co-ur-se, then? Or we-re the-se child-ren simply im-mu-ne? Cer-ta-inly they had had ti-me to fall sick
and si-lent. Rye's mind le-aped ahe-ad. What if child-ren of three or fe-wer ye-ars we-re sa-fe and ab-le
to le-arn lan-gu-age? What if all they ne-eded we-re te-ac-hers? Te-ac-hers and pro-tec-tors.
Rye glan-ced at the de-ad mur-de-rer. To her sha-me, she tho-ught she co-uld un-ders-tand so-me of
the pas-si-ons that must ha-ve dri-ven him, who-me-ver he was. An-ger, frust-ra-ti-on, ho-pe-les-sness,
in-sa-ne je-alo-usy…how many mo-re of him we-re the-re-pe-op-le wil-ling to dest-roy what they
co-uld not ha-ve?
Obsidian had be-en the pro-tec-tor, had cho-sen that ro-le for who knew what re-ason. Per-haps
put-ting on an ob-so-le-te uni-form and pat-rol-ling the empty stre-ets had be-en what he did ins-te-ad
of put-ting a gun in-to his mo-uth. And now that the-re was so-met-hing worth pro-tec-ting, he was
go-ne.
She had be-en a te-ac-her. A go-od one. She had be-en a pro-tec-tor, too, tho-ugh only of her-self.
She had kept her-self ali-ve when she had no re-ason to li-ve. If the il-lness let the-se child-ren alo-ne,
she co-uld ke-ep them ali-ve.
Somehow she lif-ted the de-ad wo-man in-to her arms and pla-ced her on the back-se-at of the car.
The child-ren be-gan to cry, but she knelt on the bro-ken pa-ve-ment and whis-pe-red to them, fe-ar-ful
of frigh-te-ning them with the harsh-ness of her long unu-sed vo-ice.
"It's all right," she told them. "You're go-ing with us, too. Co-me on." She lif-ted them both, one in
each arm. They we-re so light. Had they be-en get-ting eno-ugh to eat?
The boy co-ve-red her mo-uth with his hand, but she mo-ved her fa-ce away. "It's all right for me to
talk," she told him. "As long as no one's aro-und, it's all right." She put the boy down on the front se-at of
the car and he mo-ved over wit-ho-ut be-ing told to, to ma-ke ro-om for the girl. When they we-re both
in the car, Rye le-aned aga-inst the win-dow, lo-oking at them, se-e-ing that they we-re less af-ra-id
now, that they watc-hed her with at le-ast as much cu-ri-osity as fe-ar.
"I'm Va-le-rie Rye," she sa-id, sa-vo-uring the words. "It's all right for you to talk to me.

XVIII - CAROL EMSHWILLER - KILLERS
Most pe-op-le left be-ca-use of no wa-ter. I don't know whe-re they fo-und a pla-ce whe-re things
we-re any bet-ter. So-me of us felt sa-fer he-re than anyw-he-re el-se. And even way be-fo-re the war
wo-und down, it was hard to pick up and go so-mep-la-ce. No gas for ci-vi-li-ans. Pretty so-on no gas
at all.
After the bom-bing of our pi-pe-li-ne (one man with a gre-na-de co-uld ha-ve do-ne that), we got
to-get-her and mo-ved the town up hig-her, along a stre-am and put in ditc-hes so that the wa-ter ca-me
past se-ve-ral ho-uses. We ha-ve to carry wa-ter in-to the ho-use in buc-kets and we ha-ve to empty
the sink by hand, back out in-to the yard. At le-ast the wa-ter flows in-to our kitc-hen gar-dens and past
our fru-it tre-es. In warm we-at-her, we bat-he in our ir-ri-ga-ti-on ditch, in col-der we spon-ge off
in-si-de, in ba-sins, but the-re's hardly any cold we-at-her any-mo-re.
There wasn't much mo-ving the town sin-ce most of us we-re go-ne al-re-ady. All the ab-le bo-di-ed
men, of co-ur-se, so it to-ok us wo-men to ma-ke the mo-ve our-sel-ves and wit-ho-ut hor-ses or
mu-les. The enemy sto-le them or kil-led them or ma-imed them just to ma-ke things har-der for us.
No elect-ri-city, tho-ugh so-me of the wo-men think they can ho-ok the dam back up and get so-me.
No-body has bot-he-red to try it yet. In a way no-ne of this bot-hers me as much as you'd think. I
al-ways li-ked wal-king, and we ha-ve ren-de-red fat lamps and cand-les that send out a soft, cozy

glow.
Our ho-use was al-re-ady well abo-ve whe-re the town used to be. Go-od be-ca-use I didn't want to
mo-ve. I want my brot-her to ha-ve our old ho-me to co-me back to. And be-si-des, I co-uldn't mo-ve
Mot-her.
Beyond our back yard the-re used to be the De-part-ment of Wa-ter and Po-wer, af-ter that Fo-rest
Ser-vi-ce land, and then the John Mu-ir wil-der-ness. Now the town has mo-ved abo-ve me, and of
co-ur-se the-re's no DWP or Fo-rest Ser-vi-ce any-mo-re.
Our ho-use has a go-od vi-ew. We al-ways sat on the front steps and lo-oked at the mo-un-ta-ins.
Now that every-body has mo-ved up the mo-un-ta-in si-de, every-body has a go-od vi-ew.
The town be-low is empty The Vons and Kmart are big lo-oted barns. Up he-re the-re's one small
sto-re whe-re we sell each ot-her our pro-du-ce or our se-wing and knit-ting. Es-pe-ci-al-ly socks.
Hard to get socks the-se days. Be-fo-re the war we we-re so was-te-ful no-body dar-ned any-mo-re,
but now we not only darn but re-in-for-ce the he-els and to-es of brand new socks be-fo-re we we-ar
them.
We mo-ved the lit-tle lib-rary up. Ac-tu-al-ly it's got mo-re bo-oks than be-fo-re. We bro-ught all the
bo-oks we co-uld find, ours and tho-se from the pe-op-le who left. We don't ne-ed a lib-ra-ri-an.
Every-body brings them back ho-no-ur system.
We ha-ve a lit-tle hos-pi-tal but no doc-tors, just a co-up-le of el-derly nur-ses who we-re too old to
be rec-ru-ited. They're in the-ir se-ven-ti-es and still go-ing. They've tra-ined new ones. No me-di-ci-nes
tho-ugh. Only what we can get from lo-cal herbs. We went to the Pa-i-ute to find out mo-re. The-re's a
co-up-le of Pa-i-ute nur-ses, who co-me to help out every now and then, tho-ugh they ha-ve the-ir own
nur-sing to do on the re-ser-va-ti-on. (They mo-ved the rez up, too, and they don't call it the
re-ser-va-ti-on any-mo-re.)
It's a wo-man's town now. Full of wo-men's arts and crafts… Qu-ilt ma-kers, swe-ater knit-ters…
And the wo-men do the he-avy work. The-re's a go-od ro-of re-pa-ir gro-up and the-re's car-pen-ters
Lots of wo-men went to war along with the men, but I had to lo-ok af-ter Mot-her. I was ta-king
ca-re of her even be-fo-re my brot-her left. She wasn't exactly sick but she was fat and she drank. Her
legs lo-oked ter-rib-le, full of va-ri-co-si-ti-es. It hurt her to walk so she didn't. When the war ca-me she
got a lit-tle bet-ter be-ca-use of the shor-ta-ges, tho-ugh the-re was still plenty of ho-me-ma-de be-er,
but she co-uldn't walk. Or wo-uldn't. I think her musc-les had all wit-he-red away. Lo-oking af-ter
so-me-body who can't walk se-ems nor-mal to me. I've do-ne it sin-ce I can first re-mem-ber anyt-hing.
Now that Mot-her's go-ne I ha-ve a chan-ce to do so-met-hing use-ful. If I knew the war was still
go-ing on in so-me spe-ci-fic pla-ce, I'd go fight, but it se-ems to be over. May-be. It didn't stop exactly.
I don't know how it en-ded or even if it's en-ded. We don't ha-ve a way to find out, but the-re hasn't
be-en any ac-ti-on that we know of for qu-ite so-me ti-me. Over-he-ad, not-hing fli-es by. Not even
anyt-hing old fas-hi-oned. (Not that we ever had any ac-ti-on to spe-ak of way out he-re. Ex-cept for
the bom-bing of our pi-pe-li-ne and ste-aling our li-ves-tock, no-body ca-red much abo-ut us.)
But that's the way the war was, hardly a be-gin-ning and hardly an end. Wars aren't li-ke they used to
be-with two cle-arly se-pa-ra-ted si-des. The enemy was among us even be-fo-re it star-ted. They
co-uld ne-ver win a re-al old-fas-hi-oned war with us, they we-re we-ak and low tech, but low tech was
go-od eno-ugh as long as the-re we-re lots of them. You ne-ver knew who to trust, and we still don't.
Our si-de put all we co-uld in in-tern-ment camps, prac-ti-cal-ly every-body with black eyes and ha-ir
and oli-ve skin, but you can't get them all. And then the war went on so long we used up all our
re-so-ur-ces, but they still had the-irs-sa-bo-ta-ge do-esn't ever ha-ve to stop. They es-ca-ped from the
camps. Ac-tu-al-ly they just wal-ked away. The gu-ards had al-re-ady wal-ked away, too.
Lots of tho-se men bro-ught the-ir inj-uri-es and cra-zi-ness to our mo-un-ta-ins. Both si-des ca-me
he-re to get away from everyt-hing. They're her-mits. They don't trust any-body. So-me of them are still
figh-ting each ot-her up the-re. It's al-most as bad as ha-ving left-over mi-ne-fi-elds. They're all
da-ma-ged, physi-cal-ly or men-tal-ly. Of co-ur-se most li-kely all of us are, too, and we pro-bably
don't even know it.
My brot-her might be out the-re so-mew-he-re. If he's ali-ve he's got to be he-re. He lo-ves this

pla-ce. He hun-ted and trap-ped and fis-hed. He'd get along fi-ne and I know he'd do anyt-hing to
co-me back.
Most of tho-se men don't co-me down to us even if they're star-ving or cold or sick. Tho-se that do,
co-me to ste-al. They ta-ke our to-ma-to-es and corn and ra-dis-hes.
Other things di-sap-pe-ar, too. Kitc-hen kni-ves, spo-ons, fish-ho-oks and of co-ur-se swe-aters and
wo-ol-len socks, tho-se cra-zi-es li-ve up even hig-her than we do. It do-es still get cold up the-re.
And they are cra-zi-es. And now one of them has be-en kil-ling ot-her men and dum-ping them at the
ed-ge of the vil-la-ge. They've all be-en shot in the back by wo-oden cros-sbow darts. Be-a-uti-ful-ly
car-ved and po-lis-hed. I ho-pe it isn't one of our si-de. Tho-ugh I don't sup-po-se si-des mat-ter
any-mo-re.
Every ti-me this hap-pens, be-fo-re we put them in-to the de-po-si-tory, I go to check if it's my
brot-her. I wo-uldn't want my brot-her in the de-po-si-tory. Ever. But tho-se men are al-ways such a
mess-dirty and be-ar-ded-I won-der, wo-uld I re-cog-ni-ze him? I ke-ep thin-king: How co-uld I not?
But I was only fif-te-en when he left. He was eigh-te-en. He'd be thirty-two now. If he's ali-ve.
We're all a lit-tle edgy even if it's not us get-ting kil-led. And then last night I saw so-me-one lo-oking
in my win-dow. I'd be-en as-le-ep but I he-ard a no-ise and wo-ke up. I saw the sil-ho-u-et-te of a
lumpy hat and a mass of tang-led ha-ir flying out from un-der it, the mo-on-lit sky glo-wing be-hind. I
cal-led out, "Cle-ment!" I didn't me-an to. I was half as-le-ep and in that sta-te I knew it was my
brot-her. Who-ever it was duc-ked down in a hurry and I he-ard the crunch, crunch of so-me-body
run-ning away. Af-ter-wards I got sca-red. I co-uld ha-ve be-en shot as I slept.
The next mor-ning I saw fo-otp-rints and it lo-oked li-ke so-me-body had spent so-me ti-me be-hind
my shed.
I ke-ep ho-ping it's my brot-her, tho-ugh I wo-uldn't want him to be the one kil-ling tho-se po-or men,
but you'd think he wo-uldn't be af-ra-id of co-ming to his own ho-use. Of co-ur-se he do-esn't know
that Mot-her is de-ad. I can un-ders-tand him be-ing af-ra-id of her. They ne-ver got along. When she
was drunk she used to throw things at him. If he got clo-se eno-ugh, she'd grab his arm and twist. Then
he got too strong for her. But he co-uldn't be af-ra-id of me. Co-uld he? I'm the baby sis-ter.
Mother was ni-cer to me. She got wor-ri-ed I'd stay out of re-ach or not help any-mo-re. I co-uld
ha-ve just wal-ked off and left her but un-til she di-ed I didn't think of it. I ac-tu-al-ly didn't. I'd lo-oked
af-ter her for so long I tho-ught that's just the way li-fe is. And I might not ha-ve left, any-way. She was
my mot-her and the-re was no-body el-se to lo-ok af-ter her but me.
If it's my brot-her be-en lo-oking in the win-dow, he must know Mot-her isn't he-re. She ne-ver left
her bed. The ho-use is small and all on one flo-or so he co-uld ha-ve lo-oked in all the win-dows. We
ha-ve three tiny bed-ro-oms, and one kitc-hen/li-ving ro-om com-bi-ned. Mot-her and her big bed to-ok
up wall-to-wall spa-ce in the big-gest bed-ro-om.
I pos-ted Cle-ment's pic-tu-re at the sto-re and the lib-rary, but of co-ur-se it was a pic-tu-re from
long ago. In it he has the usu-al army sha-ved he-ad. I drew a ver-si-on with wild ha-ir. Then I drew
anot-her of him bald with wild ha-ir aro-und the si-des. (Bald-ness runs in our fa-mily.) I drew a
dif-fe-rent kind of be-ard on each of them. I put up both ver-si-ons.
Leo at the sto-re sa-id, "He might not want to talk to you…or any-body."
But I know that al-re-ady.
"I think he's co-me lo-oking in my win-dow."
"Well, the-re you are. He'd a co-me in if he'd wan-ted to."
"You went to war. How co-me you're okay and most all the ot-her men ha-ve go-ne wild?"
"I was lucky. I ne-ver saw re-al hor-ror."
Actually he may not be so okay. Most of us ne-ver mar-ri-ed. We ne-ver had the chan-ce with all the
men go-ne. He co-uld ha-ve mar-ri-ed one of us but he ne-ver did. He li-ves in a messy shed be-hind the
sto-re and he smells, even tho-ugh the ditch pas-ses right by his sto-re. And he's al-ways grumpy. You
ha-ve to get used to him.
"If my brot-her co-mes aro-und, tell him I'm go-ing out to lo-ok for him in all his fa-vo-uri-te spots."

"Even if you find him he won't co-me back."
"So then I'll go af-ter that crazy per-son who's be-en kil-ling tho-se men."
Truth is, I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to li-ve with just me to ca-re abo-ut.
I can go anyw-he-re and do anyt-hing. I ought to find the man who's the kil-ler. I ha-ve not-hing el-se to
do. Who bet-ter to do it than I?
But I might find that man right he-re, hi-ding at the ed-ge of the vil-la-ge-or most li-kely lo-oking in my
win-dow. May-be I can trap him in my ho-use. He must ha-ve be-en lo-oking in for a re-ason.
I pack up and pre-tend to le-ave. I stay out of sight of the vil-la-ge. This is wild rock land-lots of
hi-ding pla-ces. No-body will know I didn't go anyw-he-re. My back-pack is mostly empty. I ha-ve
pep-per. Pep-per is hard to get the-se days so I've sa-ved mi-ne for a we-apon. I ha-ve a small kni-fe in
my bo-ot and a big-ger one at my belt. Stre-ams aren't stoc-ked any-mo-re but the-re's still fish aro-und,
tho-ugh not as many as be-fo-re. I bring a li-ne and ho-oks. I'll use tho-se to-day. I won't go far.
I catch a tro-ut. I ha-ve to ma-ke a fi-re the old-fas-hi-oned way. No mo-re matc-hes. I al-ways
carry a hand-ful of de-ad sa-ge fib-res for tin-der. I co-ok the fish and eat af-ter dark and the
half-mo-on co-mes up, I sne-ak back to our ho-use as if I was one of tho-se cra-zi-es myself.
The do-or is wi-de open. The-re's sand all over the flo-or. Co-uldn't he even shut the do-or? The-se
days we ha-ve sand storms and dust de-vils mo-re of-ten than we use to. Do-esn't who-ever it is know
that? And that's anot-her re-ason to mo-ve hig-her up in-to the tre-es whe-re it's less de-serty.
I smell him be-fo-re I see him. I put my kni-fe up my sle-eve so it'll drop down in-to my hand.
I can he-ar him bre-at-hing. So-unds li-ke sca-red bre-at-hing. A man this frigh-te-ned will be
dan-ge-ro-us.
He's hud-dled in Mot-her's bed-ro-om down bet-we-en the bed and the bed-si-de tab-le. All I see is
his hat, pul-led low so his fa-ce is in sha-dow. I see his ba-re kne-es sho-wing thro-ugh his torn pants. I
ha-ve a bet-ter lo-ok at them than his fa-ce.
Right away I think my brot-her wo-uldn't be in Mot-her's ro-om, he'd be in his own ro-om. Be-si-des,
the ro-om still smells of de-ath and dying. I call, "Cle-ment?" even tho-ugh I know it can't be him.
"Co-me on out."
He gro-ans.
"Are you sick?" He so-unds sick. I sup-po-se that's why he's he-re in the first pla-ce. I wish I'd lit a
lamp first. I was co-un-ting on the mo-on-light, but the-re isn't much shi-ning in he-re. It still co-uld be my
brot-her, un-der all that dirt and wild ha-ir and be-ard, go-ne crazy just li-ke every-body el-se.
"Come out. Co-me to the ma-in ro-om. I'll light a lamp. I'll fix you fo-od."
"No light."
"Why not? The-re's only me. And the-re's no war go-ing on any-mo-re. It's most li-kely over."
"I pled-ged to fight un-til I di-ed." (I sup-po-se my brot-her did, too.)
I fin-ger my kni-fe. "I'm go-ing to go light the lamp."
I de-li-be-ra-tely turn my back. I go to the ma-in ro-om, light the lamp with the spar-ker, ke-eping my
back to the bed-ro-om do-or. I he-ar him co-me in. I turn and get a go-od lo-ok.
Pieced-together hat, long scraggly ha-ir han-ging un-der it. I can't tell if he's a brown man or just
we-at-her-be-aten, sun-bur-ned, and dirty. A full be-ard with grit in it. Eyes as black as the enemy's
al-ways are. Eyeb-rows just as thick as the-irs. He has a bro-ken front to-oth. No-wa-days that's not
unu-su-al. No-body to fix them. He has a gre-enish lo-ok un-der his tan and dark circ-les aro-und his
eyes. If he thinks he isn't sick he do-esn't know much.
"You are the enemy. And you're half-de-ad al-re-ady."
There's a cha-ir right be-si-de him, but he sinks si-de-ways to the flo-or. Ends up flat on our worn
li-no-le-um. If he thinks he's still figh-ting the war, I sho-uld kill him now whi-le I ha-ve the chan-ce. He
lo-oks such a mess and smells so bad I'm al-most re-ady to kill him just for tho-se re-asons alo-ne.
Af-ter Mot-her di-ed I tho-ught I was fi-nis-hed with di-sag-re-e-ab-le mes-ses.
"Hide me. Just for to-night. I'll le-ave in the mor-ning."
"Are you crazy?" I kne-el be-si-de him. "You're the one kil-ling pe-op-le. I sho-uld kill you right now."

He's trying to prop him-self up aga-inst the wall. I don't want to to-uch him but I grab his shirt front to
help him and the rot-ten cloth rips comp-le-tely out.
"You stink so-met-hing aw-ful. And why wo-uld I think you won't kill me? You've be-en kil-ling
every-body el-se."
"I don't ha-ve a we-apon."
"Strip." "What?"
"Take tho-se filthy clot-hes off. I'll burn them. I'll bring you a ba-sin to wash in." (And I'll find out if he
has a we-apon.)
He hasn't the energy to und-ress or wash. I ha-te to to-uch him but I do it. I'm used to it. Mot-her was
a mess as she was dying. (At the end I sprink-led pi-ne ne-ed-les all over but it didn't help much.) I
tho-ught that was the last of that sort of thing I'd ever ha-ve to do. I tho-ught I was free. But, all right,
one mo-re thing. I wash him and dress him in my brot-her's old clot-hes, and…what then? If I kill him,
the town will be gra-te-ful.
At le-ast his body is en-ti-rely dif-fe-rent from Mot-her's, thin and strong and ha-iry. It's a ni-ce
chan-ge. If he wasn't so smelly I'd enj-oy it. Well, I do enj-oy it. He's half as-le-ep thro-ugh it all.
I burn his clot-hes in our lit-tle sto-ve. Af-ter I've was-hed him, I fe-ed him jerky broth with an egg in
it, tho-ugh I ke-ep thin-king: Why was-te my egg on him? He falls as-le-ep right af-ter he's fi-nis-hed the
broth. Sli-des down the wall flat out aga-in, in what se-ems mo-re a fa-int than a sle-ep.
I de-ci-de to sha-ve him and cut his ha-ir. He won't no-ti-ce. If he'd be-en mo-re cons-ci-o-us I'd
ha-ve as-ked him if he wan-ted a mo-us-tac-he or a lit-tle go-atee but I'm glad he isn't. I ha-ve fun with
dif-fe-rent ha-ir-cuts, dif-fe-rent si-de-burns, smal-ler and smal-ler mo-us-tac-hes un-til the-re's no-ne.
Ha-ir, too. I ta-ke off mo-re than I me-ant to, ex-cept what do-es it mat-ter, he's a de-ad man.
Not a very hand-so-me man wha-te-ver way I fi-xed his ha-ir and be-ard, tho-ugh along the way
the-re we-re so-me ni-cer sta-ges-bet-ter than what I en-ded up with. I fi-nish by sha-ving him. Al-so
not a go-od job. I ma-ke nicks. Whe-re I sha-ved his be-ard, his skin is pa-le. His fo-re-he-ad, whe-re
his hat was, is pa-le too. The-re's only a sun-brow-ned strip ac-ross his fa-ce just be-low his eyes. I li-ke
the ma-le-ness of him no mat-ter that he's ugly. I don't mind his bro-ken to-oth. We're all in the sa-me
bo-at as to te-eth.
I fall as-le-ep at the kitc-hen tab-le, right in the mid-dle of thin-king up ways to kill him. Al-so thin-king
abo-ut how we've all chan-ged-how, in the ol-den days, I'd not ever ha-ve be-en thin-king things at all
li-ke that.
In the mor-ning he se-ems so-me bet-ter-well eno-ugh for me to help him stag-ger, first to the
out-ho-use, and then in-to my brot-her's ro-om. He ke-eps fe-eling his fa-ce and ha-ir. I stop at the hall
mir-ror and let him ta-ke a lo-ok. He's shoc-ked. He has a kind of wet cat/pluc-ked chic-ken lo-ok.
I say, "Sorry." I am sor-ry…sor-ry for any-body who gets the-ir ha-ir cut by me. But he sho-uld be
glad I ha-ven’t slit his thro-at.
He sta-res at him-self, but then says, "Thank you." And so sin-ce-rely that I re-ali-ze I've ma-de him
the best dis-gu-ise the-re is. He sa-id, "Hi-de me," and I did. No-body will ta-ke him for one of tho-se
wild men now.
I prop him up on the pil-lows of my brot-her's bed and bring him milk and tea. He lo-oks so much
bet-ter I won-der… If he's not go-ing to die on his own, I'll ha-ve to think what to do with him.
"What's yo-ur na-me?"
He do-esn't ans-wer. He co-uld say anyt-hing. I'd ha-ve be-li-eved him and I'd ha-ve had so-met-hing
to call him by.
"Tell me a na-me. I don't ca-re what." He thinks, then says, "Jal." "Ma-ke it Joe."
I don't trust him. But if he has any sen-se at all he knows I'm the only one can ke-ep him sa-fe.
Tho-ugh no-body has much sen-se any-mo-re.
"Everybody got ti-red of the war a long ti-me ago." I bang my cup down so hard that my tea spills.
"Ha-ven't you no-ti-ced?"
"I swo-re to fight to the de-ath."

"I'll bet you don't even know which si-de is which any-mo-re. If you ever did."
"You're the ones he-ated up the pla-net. It wasn't us. It was you and yo-ur gre-ed."
I ha-ven't be-en so ag-gra-va-ted sin-ce my brot-her was aro-und. "It he-ated up mostly by it-self. It's
do-ne that be-fo-re, you know. Be-si-des, all that's over. Our part in it any-way. Kil-ling cra-zi-es isn't
go-ing to help. You're crazy!" Not the best thing to say to a crazy, but I go on any-way. "All you her-mits
are crazy. You're not-hing but tro-ub-le."
He's ta-king it all in… May-be he is. May-be he just do-esn't ha-ve the energy to ar-gue.
"I'm go-ing out to get us a rab-bit. If you want to ke-ep on ma-king tro-ub-le, don't be he-re when I
co-me back."
I le-ave. He'll be all alo-ne with my butc-her kni-fe and pep-per. And I sup-po-se his cros-sbow isn't
far off. I might as well gi-ve him a chan-ce to show what he is.
I ma-ke the ro-unds of my traps. They're lo-wer down. I've set them aro-und the town. It's a ghost
town. I'm the only one go-es down the-re now and then…usu-al-ly only on a co-ol day. Which hardly
ever hap-pens. To-day it must be well over 110 deg-re-es. Now our who-le val-ley in win-ter is as if
De-ath Val-ley in sum-mer.
What I trap down the-re are rats. We co-ok tho-se up and call them rab-bit, tho-ugh no-body ca-res
any-mo-re what we call them.
I find two big black ones, big as cats. We li-ke tho-se bet-ter than the small brown kind, lots mo-re
me-at on them. (Se-ems as if the rats are get-ting big-ger all the ti-me.) My traps bro-ke the-ir necks. I
don't ha-ve to worry abo-ut kil-ling them. I tie the-ir ta-ils to my belt, then wan-der the town in ho-pes of
fin-ding so-met-hing not al-re-ady sca-ven-ged. I find a qu-ar-ter. I ta-ke it tho-ugh it's worth-less.
May-be a Pa-i-ute might turn it in-to jewel-lery. On pur-po-se I don't climb back up to my ho-use un-til
la-te af-ter-no-on and un-til I drink all the wa-ter I bro-ught.
Before I go in I check aro-und my shed and ho-use for a cros-sbow and darts, and then be-yond,
un-der the bus-hes, but I don't find them.
He's still the-re. As-le-ep. And no we-apons that I can see, but I check the kitc-hen kni-ves. The
lar-gest one, big as a mac-he-te, is go-ne. And he might be pre-ten-ding to be sic-ker than he is.
Enemy or not, I do li-ke a man in the ho-use. I watch him sle-ep. He has such long eye-las-hes. I li-ke
the ha-ir on his knuck-les. Just lo-oking at his hands ma-kes me think how the-re's so few men aro-und.
Ac-tu-al-ly only fo-ur. His fo-re-arms… Ours don't ever lo-ok li-ke that no mat-ter how much we saw
and ham-mer. Even my brot-her's ne-ver lo-oked li-ke that. I li-ke that he al-re-ady ne-eds a sha-ve
aga-in. I even li-ke his bushy eyeb-rows.
But I ha-ve to go cle-an rats.
When I start rat-tling aro-und the kitc-hen sec-ti-on of our ma-in ro-om, he gets up and stag-gers to
the tab-le. Stops at the hall mir-ror aga-in on the way and stu-di-es him-self for a long ti-me. As if he
for-got what he lo-oked li-ke un-der all that ha-ir. He sits, then, and watc-hes me ma-ke two-rat stew
with wild oni-ons and tur-nips. I thic-ken it with acorn flo-ur I tra-ded for with the Pa-i-ute.
It ta-kes a whi-le for the stew to fi-nish up. I ma-ke squ-aw tea and sit ac-ross from him. Be-ing so
clo-se and lo-oking in-to his eyes up-sets me. I ha-ve to get up and turn my back. I pre-tend the stew
ne-eds stir-ring. To hi-de my fe-elings I say, "Whe-re's yo-ur cros-sbow? And whe-re's my kni-fe? I
won't let you ha-ve my stew un-til you tell me." I so-und mo-re angry than I me-ant to. "Under the bed in
the big ro-om. Both of them."
I go check and the-re they are, and se-ve-ral darts. I bring the bow back to the tab-le. It's a
be-a-uti-ful pi-ece of work. Old scraps of me-tal and an old screw, sal-va-ged from so-met-hing, now
shiny and oiled. The wo-od of the bow, car-ved as if a work of art. All kept up with ca-re. I'll bring it to
the town me-eting to show I've fo-und the kil-ler and de-alt with him. But ha-ve I? And they may want a
body.
"I'll not sho-ot any-body. Not now."
"Yeah. But you're still sworn."

"I can fight so-mep-la-ce el-se."
"Oh ye-ah."
After we eat I put what's left over in-to an old be-ar-pro-of can, ta-ke it to the ir-ri-ga-ti-on ditch, and
sink it in wet mud to ke-ep it co-ol.
I don't know if I sho-uld go to bed wit-ho-ut bar-ri-ca-ding my do-or so-me way. I wish I still had our
dog but Mot-her and I ate him long ago. He'd be de-ad by now any-way. It wo-uld be ni-ce to ha-ve
him, tho-ugh. I'd fe-el a lot sa-fer. He was a go-od dog but get-ting old. We tho-ught we'd bet-ter eat
him our-sel-ves be-fo-re so-me-body el-se got to him. That was be-fo-re we we-re eating rats.
Tired as I am, it ta-kes a whi-le for me to get to sle-ep. I ke-ep tel-ling myself, if he's go-ing to sne-ak
in-to my ro-om, I might as well find out abo-ut it. But I put the cha-ir aga-inst the do-or in a way that it'll
fall. At le-ast I'll he-ar if he co-mes in.
Mainly I can't sle-ep be-ca-use, in spi-te of my bet-ter judg-ment, I'm thin-king of ke-eping the man.
Trying to. I li-ke the idea of ha-ving him aro-und even tho-ugh it's scary. I ma-ke plans.
It's lo-gi-cal that so-me-body co-ming in to our new hig-her vil-la-ge wo-uld co-me to my ho-use first.
Per-haps an out-si-der with news from the North. And it's lo-gi-cal that I'd ta-ke him to a town me-eting
to tell the news.
What news, tho-ugh? In the mor-ning (the cha-ir hasn't fal-len), we ma-ke so-me up. Car-son City is
as empty and rat-infes-ted as our town. (It's a go-od bet it re-al-ly is.) I re-mem-ber an airp-la-ne (I
think it was cal-led the gos-sa-mer con-dor) that flew by the pro-pel-ler be-ing pum-ped by a bicyc-le
and do-esn't ne-ed gas. It can't go far or we'd ha-ve se-en it down he-re. Joe can say he's se-en it.
He says, "How abo-ut an epi-de-mic of a new di-se-ase pas-sed on by fle-as? It hasn't re-ac-hed
he-re yet." He says, "How abo-ut, way up in Re-no, they fo-und a cac-he of am-mu-ni-ti-on so they can
cle-an up the-ir old guns and use them aga-in?"
I gi-ve him news abo-ut Cle-ment to tell pe-op-le. I'll say that's anot-her re-ason Joe ca-me to me
first-to gi-ve me news of my brot-her. (I think I ma-de up that news be-ca-use I know my brot-her's
de-ad. Ot-her-wi-se I'd not ha-ve men-ti-oned anyt-hing abo-ut him. I'd ke-ep on thin-king he's out in
our mo-un-ta-ins as one of the cra-zi-es, but I don't think I ever re-al-ly be-li-eved that. I just ho-ped.)
Once he ta-kes my hand and squ-e-ezes it-says how gra-te-ful he is. I ha-ve to get up aga-in, turn my
back. I wash our few dis-hes, slowly. I'm so flus-te-red I hardly know what his hand felt li-ke. Strong
and warm. I know that.
Lots of go-od things hap-pen in tho-se town me-etings. We gi-ve each ot-her our news. We ha-ve all
kinds of hel-ping com-mit-te-es. In so-me ways we ta-ke ca-re of each ot-her mo-re than we did
be-fo-re the war. Pe-op-le used to bring in the-ir de-er and wild she-ep and sha-re the me-at aro-und,
ex-cept the-re's less and less wild ga-me and mo-re and mo-re mo-un-ta-in li-ons. They're eating all the
ga-me and we're not go-od at kil-ling li-ons. I'll bet Joe wo-uld be, with his cros-sbow.
So I bring him to the me-eting. Int-ro-du-ce him. They crowd aro-und and ask qu-es-ti-ons abo-ut all
the-ir fa-vo-uri-te spots, or pla-ces whe-re they used to ha-ve re-la-ti-ves. He's go-od at ma-king stuff
up. Ma-kes me won-der, was he on-ce an of-fi-cer?
Or did he act?
I ad-mi-re him mo-re and mo-re, and I can see all the wo-men do, too. He co-uld ha-ve any one of
us. I'm wor-ri-ed he'll get away from me and I'm the only one knows who he re-al-ly is. Who-ever gets
him in the end will ha-ve to be ca-re-ful.
He's lo-oking pretty go-od, too, hor-rib-le ha-ir-cut and all. My brot-her's blue far-mer shirt sets off
his brown skin. It's too lar-ge for him, but that's the usu-al.
The wo-men ha-ve be-en out at the bird nets and had ma-de a big batch of lit-tle-bird so-up. I was
glad they'd ma-de that ins-te-ad of the ot-her.
There's a Pa-i-ute wo-man who co-mes to our me-etings and re-ports back to the re-ser-va-ti-on.
She's be-a-uti-ful-mo-re than be-a-uti-ful, stran-ge and stri-king. I sho-uld ha-ve known. At his first

vi-ew of her you can see…both of them sta-re and then, qu-ickly, stop lo-oking at each ot-her.
Later he sits drin-king tea with se-ve-ral wo-men inc-lu-ding the Pa-i-ute. They all crowd aro-und but
I saw him push in so that he was next to her. The tab-les are small but now ni-ne cha-irs are wed-ged in
clo-se aro-und the one whe-re he sits. I can't see what's go-ing on, but I do see her sho-ul-der is
to-uc-hing his. And the-ir fa-ces are so clo-se I don't see how they can see anyt-hing of each ot-her.
I sne-ak away and run ho-me. I wish I'd sa-ved his smelly, fal-ling-apart clot-hes. I wish I'd sa-ved
the dirty, tang-led ha-ir I cut off, but I bur-ned that, too. I do find the old hat. That helps them to
be-li-eve me. I bring the cros-sbow. It al-so helps that he tri-es to get away.
They hung Joe up in the de-po-si-tory. I told them not to tell me anyt-hing abo-ut it. I'd rat-her not
know when we get aro-und to using him.

XIX - NEAL BARRETT, JR. - GINNY SWEETHIPS' FLYING CIRCUS
So, wit-ho-ut furt-her adi-eu, he-re she is, gents: Ginny Swe-et-hips. Isn't she all you ever dre-amed
of?
Del dro-ve and Ginny sat.
"They're ta-king the-ir swe-et ti-me," Ginny sa-id, "dam-ned if they're not."
"They're itchy," Del sa-id. "Ever-yo-ne's itchy. Ever-yo-ne's lo-oking to stay ali-ve."
"Huh!" Ginny sho-wed dis-gust. "I su-re don't ca-re for sit-tin' out he-re in the sun. My pri-ce is go-ing
up by the mi-nu-te. You wa-it and see if it do-esn't."
"Don't get gre-edy," Del sa-id.
Ginny cur-led her to-es on the dash. Her legs felt warm in the sun. The stoc-ka-de was a hund-red
yards off. Bar-bed wi-re lo-oped abo-ve the walls. The sign over the ga-te re-ad:
First Church of the Unleaded God & Ace High Refinery
WELCOME
KEEP OUT
The re-fi-nery ne-eded pa-int. It had li-kely be-en sil-ver, but was now dull as pew-ter and black rust.
Ginny le-aned out the win-dow and cal-led to Pos-sum Dark.
"What's hap-pe-ning, fri-end? Tho-se mot-hers de-ad in the-re or what?"
"Thinking," Pos-sum sa-id. "Fi-xing to ma-ke a mo-ve. Con-si-de-ring what to do." Pos-sum Dark sat
atop the van in a ste-no cha-ir bol-ted to the ro-of. Circ-ling the cha-ir was a swi-vel-ring mo-unt
spor-ting fi-ne twin-fif-ti-es black as gre-ase. Pos-sum had a de-ath-vi-ew cle-an aro-und. Ke-eping out
the sun was a red Cin-za-no umb-rel-la fa-ded pink. Pos-sum stu-di-ed the stoc-ka-de and watc-hed
he-at dis-tort the flats. He didn't ca-re for the ef-fect. He was sus-pi-ci-o-us of things less than cut and
dri-ed. Ap-pre-hen-si-ve of il-lu-si-ons of every kind. He scratc-hed his no-se and cur-led his ta-il
aro-und his leg. The ga-te ope-ned up and men star-ted ac-ross the scrub. He te-ased them in his sights.
He pra-yed they'd do so-met-hing silly and grand.
Possum co-un-ted thirty-se-ven men. A few car-ri-ed si-de-arms, openly or con-ce-aled. Pos-sum
spot-ted them all at on-ce. He wasn't too con-cer-ned. This se-emed li-ke an easy-go-ing bunch, mo-re
in-tent on fun than fra-cas. Still, the-re was al-ways the ho-pe that he was wrong.
The men mil-led abo-ut. They wo-re patc-hed de-nim and fa-ded shirts. Pos-sum ma-de them
ner-vo-us. Del co-un-te-red that; his ap-pe-aran-ce set them at ease. The men lo-oked at Del, po-ked
each ot-her and grin-ned. Del was scrawny and bald ex-cept for tufts aro-und the ears. The dusty black
co-at was too big. His neck thrust out of his shirt li-ke a new-born buz-zard lo-oking for me-at. The men

for-got Pos-sum and gat-he-red aro-und, wa-iting to see what Del wo-uld do. Wa-iting for Del to get
aro-und to sho-wing them what they'd co-me to see. The van was pa-in-ted turt-le gre-en. Gold
Bar-num type na-med the ow-ner, and the se-lec-ted vi-ces for sa-le:
Ginny Sweethips' Flying Circus
*** SEX * TACOS * DANGEROUS DRUGS ***
Del put-te-red abo-ut with this and that. He un-hitc-hed the wa-gon from the van and fol-ded out a
handy lit-tle sta-ge. It didn't ta-ke three mi-nu-tes to set up, but he drag-ged it out to ten, then ten on top
of that. The men star-ted to whist-le and clap the-ir hands. Del lo-oked alar-med. They li-ked that. He
stumb-led and they la-ug-hed.
"Hey, mis-ter, you got a girl in the-re or not?" a man cal-led out.
"Better be so-met-hing he-re be-si-des you," anot-her sa-id.
"Gents," Del sa-id, ra-ising his hands for qu-i-et, "Ginny Swe-et-hips her-self will so-on ap-pe-ar on
this sta-ge, and you'll be mo-re than glad you wa-ited. Yo-ur every wish will be ful-fil-led, I pro-mi-se
you that. I'm brin-ging be-a-uty to the was-te-lands, gents. Lust the way you li-ke it, pas-si-on
un-rest-ra-ined. Se-xu-al cri-mes you ne-ver dre-amed!"
"Cut the talk, mis-ter," a man with pe-ach-pit eyes sho-uted to Del. "Show us what you got."
Others jo-ined in, stom-ped the-ir fe-et and whist-led. Del knew he had them. An-ger was what he
wan-ted. Frust-ra-ti-on and de-ni-al. Hat-red wa-iting for swe-et re-le-ase. He wa-ved them off, but
they wo-uldn't stop. He pla-ced one hand on the do-or of the van-and bro-ught them to si-len-ce at
on-ce.
The do-ub-le do-ors ope-ned. A worn red cur-ta-in was re-ve-aled, sten-ci-led with he-arts and
che-rubs. Del ex-ten-ded his hand. He se-emed to se-arch be-hind the cur-ta-in, one eye clo-sed in
con-cent-ra-ti-on. He lo-oked alar-med, gro-ping for so-met-hing he co-uldn't find. Un-cer-ta-in he
re-mem-be-red how to do this trick at all. And then, in a sud-den burst of mo-ti-on, Ginny did a
do-ub-le for-ward flip, and ap-pe-ared li-ke glory on the sta-ge.
The men bro-ke in-to sho-uts of wild aban-don. Ginny led them in a che-er. She was dres-sed for the
oc-ca-si-on. Short whi-te skirt shiny bright, whi-te bo-ots with tas-sels. Whi-te swe-ater with a big red
G sewn on the front.
"Ginny Swe-et-hips, gents," Del an-no-un-ced with a fla-ir, "gi-ving you her own in-terp-re-ta-ti-on of
Bar-ba-ra Je-an, the Che-er-le-ader Next Do-or. In-no-cent as snow, yet a lit-tle bit wic-ked and
wil-ling to le-arn, if Biff the Qu-ar-ter-back will only te-ach her. Now, what do you say to that?"
They whist-led and yel-led and stom-ped. Ginny strut-ted and switc-hed, do-ing long-leg-ged kicks
that left them gas-ping with de-light. Thirty-se-ven pa-irs of eyes sho-wed the-ir ne-eds. Men gu-es-sed
at hid-den parts. Dus-ted off sce-na-ri-os of vi-olen-ce and lo-ve. Then, as qu-ickly as she'd co-me,
Ginny was go-ne. Men thre-ate-ned to storm the sta-ge. Del grin-ned wit-ho-ut con-cern. The cur-ta-in
par-ted and Ginny was back, blond ha-ir rep-la-ced with sa-ucy red, cos-tu-me chan-ged in the blink of
an eye. Del int-ro-du-ced Nur-se No-ra, an an-gel of mercy we-ak as so-up in the hands of Pa-ti-ent
Pe-te. Mo-ments la-ter, ha-ir black as a ra-ven's thro-at, she was Scho-ol-te-ac-her Sally, cold as well
wa-ter, un-til Ste-ve the Bad Stu-dent lo-osed the fury cha-ined wit-hin.
Ginny va-nis-hed aga-in. Ap-pla-use thun-de-red over the flats. Del ur-ged them on, then spre-ad his
hands for qu-i-et.
"Did I lie to you gents? Is she all you ever dre-amed? Is this the lo-ve you've wan-ted all yo-ur li-fe?
Co-uld you ask for swe-eter limbs, for sof-ter flesh? For whi-ter te-eth, for brigh-ter eyes?"
"Yeah, but is she re-al?" a man sho-uted, a man with a bro-ken fa-ce sewn up li-ke a sock. "We're
re-li-gi-o-us pe-op-le he-re. We don't fuck with no mac-hi-nes."
Others ec-ho-ed the qu-es-ti-on with bold sho-uts and sha-king fists.
"Now, I don't bla-me you, sir, at all," Del sa-id. "I've had a few dolly dro-ids myself. A plas-tic
emb-ra-ce at best, I'll grant you that. Not for the li-kes of you, for I can tell you're a man who knows his

wo-men. No, sir, Ginny's re-al as ra-in, and she's yo-urs in the ro-le of yo-ur cho-ice. Se-ven mi-nu-tes
of bliss. It'll se-em li-ke a li-fe-ti-me, gents, I pro-mi-se you that. Yo-ur go-ods gladly re-tur-ned if I'm a
li-ar. And all for only a U.S. gal-lon of gas!"
Howls and gro-ans at that, as Del ex-pec-ted.
"That's a che-at is what it is! Ain't a wo-man worth it!"
"Gas is bet-ter'n gold, and we work damn hard to get it!"
Del sto-od his gro-und. Lo-oked grim and di-sap-po-in-ted. "I'd be the last man ali-ve to try to part
you from yo-ur go-ods," Del sa-id. "It's not my pla-ce to dri-ve a fel-low in-to the arms of swe-et
con-tent, to ma-ke him rest his manly fra-me on gol-den thighs. Not if he thinks this lo-vely girl's not
worth the fee, no sir. I don't do bu-si-ness that way and ne-ver ha-ve."
The men mo-ved clo-ser. Del co-uld smell the-ir dis-con-tent. He re-ad sly tho-ughts abo-ve the-ir
he-ads. The-re was al-ways this mo-ment when it oc-cur-red to them the-re was a way Ginny s de-lights
might be ob-ta-ined for free.
"Give it so-me tho-ught, fri-ends," Del sa-id. "A man's got to do what he's got to do. And whi-le
you're ma-king up yo-ur minds, turn yo-ur eyes to the top of the van for a start-ling and ab-so-lu-tely
free disp-lay of the slic-kest bit of marks-mans-hip you're ever li-kely to see!"
Before Del's words we-re out of his mo-uth and on the way, be-fo-re the men co-uld scar-cely
comp-re-hend, Ginny ap-pe-ared aga-in and tos-sed a do-zen chi-na sa-ucers in the air.
Possum Dark mo-ved in a blur. Tur-ned 140 deg-re-es in his bol-ted ste-no cha-ir and whip-ped his
guns on tar-get, blas-ting sa-ucers to dust. Thun-der rol-led ac-ross the flats. Croc-kery ra-ined on the
men be-low. Pos-sum sto-od and of-fe-red a pink kil-ler grin and a lit-tle bow. The men saw
six-fo-ot-ni-ne and a qu-ar-ter inc-hes of happy mar-su-pi-al fury and awe-so-me spe-ed, of black
aga-te eyes and a sno-ut full of icy var-mint te-eth. Do-ubts we-re swept asi-de. Fifty-ca-lib-re
mad-ness wasn't the ans-wer. Fun to-day was cle-arly not for free.
"Gentlemen, start yo-ur en-gi-nes," Del smi-led. "I'll be right he-re to ta-ke yo-ur fee. Enj-oy a hot
ta-co whi-le you wa-it yo-ur turn at glory. Ha-ve a lo-ok at our disp-lay of fi-ne phar-ma-ce-uti-cal
won-ders and mind-expan-ding drugs."
In mo-ments, men we-re ma-king the-ir way back to the stoc-ka-de. So-on af-ter that, they
re-tur-ned to-ting bat-te-red tins of gas. Del snif-fed each gal-lon, in ca-se so-me buf-fo-on tho-ught
wa-ter wo-uld get him by. Each man re-ce-ived a to-ken and to-ok his pla-ce. Del sold ta-cos and
dan-ge-ro-us drugs, ta-king what he co-uld get in tra-de. Cand-les and Ma-son jars, a rusty kni-fe. Half
a ma-nu-al on full-fi-eld ma-in-te-nan-ce for the Chrysler Mark XX Ur-ban Tank. The drugs we-re
dif-fe-rent co-lo-urs but the sa-me: twel-ve parts ore-ga-no, three parts rab-bit shit, one part
ma-ri-j-u-ana stems. All this un-der Pos-sum's watch-ful eye.
"By God," sa-id the first man out of the van. "She's worth it, I'll tell you that. Ha-ve her do the Nur-se,
you won't reg-ret it!"
"The Scho-ol-te-ac-her's best," sa-id the se-cond man thro-ugh. "I ne-ver se-en the li-ke. I don't
ca-re if she's re-al or she ain't."
"What's in the-se ta-cos?" a cus-to-mer as-ked Del.
"Nobody you know, mis-ter," Del sa-id.
"It's be-en a long day," Ginny sa-id. "I'm po-oped, and that's the truth." She wrink-led up her no-se.
"First thing we hit a town, you ho-se 'er out go-od now, Del. Pla-ce smells li-ke a se-wer or may-be
wor-se."
Del squ-in-ted at the sky and pul-led up un-der the scant sha-de of mes-qu-ite. He step-ped out and
kic-ked the ti-res. Ginny got down, wal-ked aro-und and stretc-hed.
"It's get-ting la-te," Del sa-id. "You want to go on or stop he-re?"
"You fi-gu-re tho-se boys might de-ci-de to get a re-ba-te on this gas?"
"Hope they do," Pos-sum sa-id from atop the van.
"You're a pis-ser," Ginny la-ug-hed, "I'll say that. Hell, let's ke-ep go-ing. I co-uld use a hot bath and
town fo-od. What you fi-gu-re's up the ro-ad?"

"East Bad News," Del sa-id, "if this map's worth anyt-hing at all. Ginny, night dri-ving's no go-od. You
don't know what's wa-iting down the ro-ad."
"I know what's on the ro-of," Ginny sa-id. "Let's do it. I'm itchy all over with bugs and dirt and that tub
ke-eps shi-nin' in my he-ad. You want me to dri-ve a spell, I su-re will."
"Get in," Del grumb-led. "Yo-ur dri-ving's sca-ri-er than anyt-hing I'll me-et."
Morning ar-ri-ved in purp-le sha-dow and me-tal to-nes, cop-per, sil-ver, and gold. From a
dis-tan-ce, East Bad News lo-oked to Ginny li-ke gar-ba-ge strewn ca-re-les-sly over the flats. Clo-ser,
it lo-oked li-ke lar-ger gar-ba-ge. Tin shacks and tents and hap-ha-zard bu-il-dings re-has-hed from
wha-te-ver they we-re be-fo-re. Co-ok-fi-res bur-ned, and the lo-cals wan-de-red abo-ut and yaw-ned
and scratc-hed. Three pla-ces of-fe-red fo-od. Ot-her pla-ces bed and a bath. So-met-hing to lo-ok
for-ward to, at le-ast. She spot-ted the sign down at the far end of town.
MORO'S REPAIRS
Armaments * Machinery * Electronic Shit of All Kinds
"Hold it!" Ginny sa-id. "Pull 'er in right the-re." Del lo-oked alar-med. "What for?"
"Don't get ex-ci-ted. The-re's ge-ar ne-eds ten-ding in back. I just want 'em to ta-ke a lo-ok."
"Didn't men-ti-on it to me," Del sa-id.
Ginny saw the sad and dro-opy eyes, the ti-red wisps of ha-ir stic-king flat to Del's ears. "Del, the-re
wasn't anyt-hing to men-ti-on," she sa-id in a kindly to-ne. "Not-hing you can re-al-ly put yo-ur fin-ger
on, I me-an, okay?"
"Whatever you think," Del sa-id, cle-arly out of sorts.
Ginny sig-hed and got out. Bar-bed wi-re sur-ro-un-ded the yard be-hind the shop. The yard was
ank-le-de-ep in tang-les of ro-pe and cop-per cab-le, rus-ted uni-den-ti-fi-ab-le parts. A bat-te-red
pic-kup hug-ged the wall. Mor-ning he-at cur-led the tin ro-of of the bu-il-ding. Mo-re parts spil-led out
of the do-or. Pos-sum ma-de a funny no-ise, and Ginny saw the Dog step in-to the light. A Shep-herd,
may-be six-fo-ot-two. It sho-wed Pos-sum Dark yel-low eyes. A man ap-pe-ared be-hind the Dog,
wi-ping he-avy gre-ase on his pants. Ba-re to the wa-ist, ha-ir li-ke stuf-fing out of a cha-ir. Fe-atu-res
hard as rock, flint eyes to match. Not bad lo-oking, tho-ught Ginny, if you cle-aned him up go-od.
"Well now," sa-id the man. He glan-ced at the van, re-ad the le-gend on the si-de, to-ok in Ginny from
he-ad to toe. "What can I do for you, lit-tle lady?"
"I'm not re-al lit-tle and don't gu-ess I'm any lady," Ginny sa-id. "Wha-te-ver you're thin-king, don't.
You open for bu-si-ness or just talk?"
The man grin-ned. "My na-me's Mo-ro Ga-in. Ne-ver turn bu-si-ness away if I can help it."
"I ne-ed elect-ric stuff."
"We got it. What's the prob-lem?"
"Huh-unh." Ginny sho-ok her he-ad. "First, I got-ta ask. You do con-fi-den-ti-al work or tell
everyt-hing you know?"
"Secret's my mid-dle na-me," Mo-ro sa-id. "Might cost a lit-tle mo-re, but you got it."
"How much?"
Moro clo-sed one eye. "Now, how do I know that? You got a nuc-le-ar de-vi-ce in the-re, or a
bro-ken watch? Dri-ve it on in and we'll ta-ke a lo-ok." He aimed a gre-asy fin-ger at Pos-sum Dark.
"Le-ave him out-si-de."
"No way."
"No arms in the shop. That's a ru-le."
"He isn't car-rying. Just the guns you see." Ginny smi-led. "You can sha-ke him down if you li-ke. I
wo-uldn't, I don't think."
"He lo-oks im-po-sing, all right."
"I’d say he is."
"What the hell," Mo-ro sa-id, "dri-ve it in."

Dog un-loc-ked the ga-te. Pos-sum clim-bed down and fol-lo-wed with oily eyes.
"Go find us a pla-ce to stay," Ginny sa-id to Del. "Cle-an, if you can find it. All the hot wa-ter in town.
Christ sa-kes, Del, you still sul-king or what?"
"Don't worry abo-ut me," Del sa-id. "Don't con-cern yo-ur-self at all."
"Right." She hop-ped be-hind the whe-el. Mo-ro be-gan kic-king the do-or of his shop. It fi-nal-ly
sprang free, wi-de eno-ugh to ta-ke the van. The supply wa-gon roc-ked along be-hind. Mo-ro lif-ted
the tarp, eyed the thirty-se-ven tins of un-le-aded with gre-at in-te-rest.
"You get lo-usy mi-le-age, or what?" he as-ked Ginny.
Ginny didn't ans-wer. She step-ped out of the van. Light ca-me thro-ugh bro-ken pa-nes of glass. The
skinny win-dows re-min-ded her of a church. Her eyes got used to sha-dow, and she saw that that's
what it was. Pews sat to the si-de, pi-led high with auto parts. A 1997 Olds was jac-ked up be-fo-re the
al-tar.
"Nice pla-ce you got he-re," she sa-id.
"It works for me," Mo-ro told her. "Now what kind of tro-ub-le you got? So-met-hing in the wi-ring?
You sa-id elect-ric stuff."
"I didn't me-an the mo-tor. Back he-re." She led him to the re-ar and ope-ned the do-ors.
"God a'Mighty!" Mo-ro sa-id.
"Smells a lit-tle ra-unchy right now. Can't help that till we ho-se 'er down." Ginny step-ped in-si-de,
lo-oked back, and saw Mo-ro still on the gro-und. "You co-ming up or not?"
"Just thin-king."
"About what?" She'd se-en him watc-hing her mo-ve and didn't re-al-ly ha-ve to ask.
"Well, you know…" Mo-ro shuf-fled his fe-et. "How do you fi-gu-re on pa-ying? For wha-te-ver it is
I got to do."
"Gas. You ta-ke a lo-ok. Tell me how many tins. I say yes or no."
"We co-uld work so-met-hing out."
"We co-uld, huh?"
"Sure." Mo-ro ga-ve her a fo-olish grin. "Why not?"
Ginny didn't blink. "Mis-ter, what kind of girl do you think I am?"
Moro lo-oked puz-zled and in-tent. "I can re-ad go-od, lady, be-li-eve it or not. I fi-gu-red you wasn't
ta-cos or dan-ge-ro-us drugs."
"You fi-gu-red wrong," Ginny sa-id. "Sex is just soft-wa-re to me, and don't you for-get it. I ha-ven't
got all day to watch you mo-onin' over my parts. I got to mo-ve or stand still. When I stand still, you
lo-ok. When I mo-ve, you lo-ok mo-re. Can't fa-ult you for that, I'm abo-ut the pret-ti-est thing you ever
saw. Don't let it get in the way of yo-ur work."
Moro co-uldn't think of much to say. He to-ok a bre-ath and step-ped in-to the van. The-re was a
bed bol-ted flat aga-inst the flo-or. A red cot-ton spre-ad, a worn sa-tin pil-low that sa-id Du-ran-go,
Co-lo-ra-do, and pic-tu-red chip-munks and wa-ter-fal-ls. An end tab-le, a pink-sha-ded lamp with
fla-min-gos on the si-de. Red cur-ta-ins on the walls. Bal-let prints and a na-ked Min-nie Mo-use.
"Somethin el-se," Mo-ro sa-id.
"Back he-re's the prob-lem," Ginny sa-id. She pul-led a cur-ta-in asi-de at the front of the van. The-re
was a plywo-od ca-bi-net, fit-ted with brass screws. Ginny to-ok a key out of her je-ans and ope-ned it
up.
Moro sta-red a mi-nu-te, then la-ug-hed alo-ud. "Sen-sory ta-pes? Well, I'll be a son of a bitch." He
to-ok a new lo-ok at Ginny, a lo-ok Ginny didn't miss. "Ha-ven't se-en a rig li-ke this in ye-ars. Didn't
know the-re we-re any still aro-und."
"I've got three ta-pes," Ginny exp-la-ined. "A bru-net-te, a red-he-ad, and a blond. Fo-und a who-le
cac-he in Ard-mo-re, Ok-la-ho-ma. Had to lo-ok at 'bo-ut three or fo-ur hund-red to find girls that
lo-oked clo-se eno-ugh to me. Ne-arly went nuts 'fo-re it was over. Any-way, I did it. Spli-ced 'em
down to se-ven mi-nu-tes each."
Moro glan-ced back at the bed. "How do you put 'em un-der?"
"Little ne-ed-le co-mes up out the mat-tress. Sticks them in the ass light-nin' fast. They're out li-ke

that. Se-ven-mi-nu-te do-se. He-ad-pi-ece is in the end tab-le the-re. I get it on and off them re-al
qu-ick. Wi-res go un-der the flo-or-bo-ards back he-re to the rig."
"Jesus," Mo-ro sa-id. "They ever catch you at this, you are co-oked, lady." "That's what Pos-sum's
for," Ginny sa-id. "Pos-sum's pretty go-od at what he do-es. Now what's that lo-ok all abo-ut?"
"I wasn't su-re right off if you we-re re-al."
Ginny la-ug-hed alo-ud. "So what do you think now?"
"I think may-be you are."
"Right," Ginny sa-id. "It's Del who's the dro-id, not me. Wimp IX Se-ri-es. Didn't ma-ke a who-le lot.
Not much de-mand. The cus-to-mers think it's me, ne-ver think to lo-ok at him. He's a damn go-od
bar-ker and pretty go-od at ta-cos and drugs. A lit-tle too sen-si-ti-ve, you ask me. Well, no-body's
per-fect, so they say."
"The tro-ub-le you're ha-ving's in the rig?"
"I gu-ess," Ginny sa-id, "be-ats the hell out of me." She bit her lip and wrink-led her brow. Mo-ro
fo-und the ges-tu-res most in-vi-ting. "Slips a lit-tle, I think. May-be I got a short, huh?"
"Maybe." Mo-ro fid-dled with the rig, tes-ting one of the spo-ols with his thumb. "I'll ha-ve to get in
he-re and see."
"It's all yo-urs. I'll be whe-re-ver it is Del's got me sta-ying."
"Ruby John's," Mo-ro sa-id. "Only pla-ce the-re is with a go-od ro-of. I'd li-ke to ta-ke you out to
din-ner."
"Well su-re you wo-uld."
"You got a re-al shitty at-ti-tu-de, fri-end."
"I get a who-le lot of prac-ti-ce," Ginny sa-id.
"And I've got a cer-ta-in amo-unt of pri-de," Mo-ro told her. "I don't in-tend to ask you mo-re than
three or fo-ur ti-mes and that's it."
Ginny nod-ded. Right on the ed-ge of ap-pro-val. "You've got pro-mi-se," she sa-id. "Not a who-le
lot, may-be, but so-me."
"Does that me-an din-ner, or not?"
"Means not. Me-ans if I wan-ted to ha-ve din-ner with so-me guy, you'd may-be fit the bill."
Moro's eyes got hot. "Hell with you, lady. I don't ne-ed the com-pany that bad."
"Fine." Ginny snif-fed the air and wal-ked out. "You ha-ve a ni-ce day."
Moro watc-hed her walk. Watc-hed de-nims mo-uld her legs, stu-di-ed the hydra-ulics of her hips.
Con-si-de-red se-ve-ral un-li-kely acts. Con-si-de-red cle-aning up, se-arc-hing for pro-per clot-hes.
Con-si-de-red fin-ding a bot-tle and watc-hing the ta-pes. A plas-tic emb-ra-ce at best, or so he'd
he-ard, but a lot less has-sle in the end.
Possum Dark watc-hed the van di-sap-pe-ar in-to the shop. He felt une-asy at on-ce. His pla-ce was
on top. Ke-eping Ginny from harm. Sen-ding fe-ral pra-yers for mur-der to ab-sent ge-ne-tic gods. His
eyes hadn't left Dog sin-ce he'd ap-pe-ared. Pri-mal smells, old fe-ars and ne-eds, as-sa-iled his sen-ses.
Dog loc-ked the ga-te and tur-ned aro-und. Didn't co-me clo-ser, just tur-ned.
"I'm Dog Qu-ick," he sa-id, fol-ding ha-iry arms. "I don't much ca-re for Pos-sums."
"I don't much ca-re for Dogs," sa-id Pos-sum Dark. Dog se-emed to un-ders-tand.
"What did you do be-fo-re the War?"
"Worked in a the-me park. Our Wild-li-fe He-ri-ta-ge. That kind of shit. What abo-ut you?"
"Security, what el-se?" Dog ma-de a fa-ce. "Le-ar-ned a lit-tle elect-rics. Pic-ked up a lot mo-re from
Mo-ro Ga-in. I've do-ne wor-se." He nod-ded to-ward the shop. "You li-ke to sho-ot pe-op-le with
that thing?"
"Anytime I get the chan-ce."
"You ever play any cards?"
"Some." Pos-sum Dark sho-wed his te-eth. "I gu-ess I co-uld hand-le myself with a Dog."
"For re-al go-ods?" Dog re-tur-ned the grin.
"New deck, unb-ro-ken se-al, tab-le sta-kes," Pos-sum sa-id.

Moro sho-wed up at Ruby John's Cot Em-po-ri-um clo-se to no-on. Ginny had a se-mip-ri-va-te
stall, co-ve-red by a blan-ket. She'd bat-hed and bra-ided her ha-ir and cut the legs cle-an off her
je-ans. She tug-ged at Mo-ro's he-art.
"It'll be to-mor-row mor-ning," Mo-ro sa-id. "Cost you ten gal-lons of gas."
"Ten gal-lons," Ginny sa-id. "That's ste-alin', and you know it."
"Take it or le-ave it," Mo-ro sa-id. "You got a bad he-ad in that rig. Go-ing to co-me right off, you
don't fix it. You wo-uldn't li-ke that. Yo-ur cus-to-mers wo-uldn't li-ke it any at all."
Ginny ap-pe-ared sub-du-ed but not much. "Fo-ur gal-lons. Tops." "Eight. I got to ma-ke the parts
myself."
"Five."
"Six," Mo-ro sa-id. "Six and I ta-ke you to din-ner."
"Five and a half, and I want to be out of this swe-at-box at dawn. On the ro-ad and go-ne when the
sun starts ba-kin' yo-ur lo-vely town." "Damn, you're fun to ha-ve aro-und."
Ginny smi-led. Swe-et and di-sar-ming, an unex-pec-ted event. "I'm all right. You got to get to know
me."
"Just how do I go abo-ut that?"
"You don't." The smi-le tur-ned so-ber. "I ha-ven't fi-gu-red that one out."
It lo-oked li-ke ra-in to the north. Sun-ri-se was dre-ary. Muddy, less-than-spec-ta-cu-lar yel-lows
and reds. Co-lo-urs thro-ugh a win-dow no one had bot-he-red to wash. Mo-ro had the van bro-ught
out. He sa-id he'd thrown in a lu-be and ho-sed out the back. Fi-ve and a half gal-lons we-re go-ne out
of the wa-gon. Ginny had Del co-unt whi-le Mo-ro watc-hed.
"I'm ho-nest," Mo-ro sa-id, "you don't ha-ve to do that."
"I know," Ginny sa-id, glan-cing cu-ri-o-usly at Dog, who was lo-oking rat-her stran-ge. He se-emed
out of sorts. Sulky and off his fe-ed. Ginny fol-lo-wed his eyes and saw Pos-sum atop the van. Pos-sum
sho-wed a wet Pos-sum grin.
"Where you he-aded now?" Mo-ro as-ked, wan-ting to hold her as long as he co-uld.
"South," Ginny sa-id, sin-ce she was fa-cing that di-rec-ti-on.
"I wo-uldn't," Mo-ro sa-id. "Not re-al fri-endly folks down the-re."
"I'm not picky. Bu-si-ness is bu-si-ness."
"No, sir," Mo-ro sho-ok his he-ad. "Bad bu-si-ness is what it is. You got the Dry He-aves so-uth and
east. Do-om City af-ter that. Stra-ight down and you'll hit the Hac-kers. Might run in-to Fort Pru, bunch
of disg-runt-led in-su-ran-ce agents out on the flats. Stay cle-ar away from them. Isn't worth wha-te-ver
you'll ma-ke."
"You've be-en a big help," Ginny sa-id.
Moro grip-ped her do-or. "You ever lis-ten to an-yo-ne, lady? I'm gi-ving go-od ad-vi-ce."
"Fine," Ginny sa-id, "I'm 'bo-ut as gra-te-ful as I can be."
Moro watc-hed her le-ave. He was con-su-med by her ap-pe-aran-ce. The day se-emed to fo-cus in
her eyes. Not-hing he sa-id ple-ased her in the le-ast. Still, her dis-da-in was fri-endly eno-ugh. The-re
was no ma-li-ce at all that he co-uld see.
There was so-met-hing abo-ut the so-und of Do-om City she didn't li-ke. Ginny told Del to he-ad
so-uth and may-be west. Aro-und no-on, a yel-low ha-ze ap-pe-ared on the rag-ged rim of the world,
li-ke so-me-one rol-ling a che-ap dirty rug ac-ross the flats.
"Sandstorm," Pos-sum cal-led from the ro-of. "Right out of the west. I don't li-ke it at all. I think we
bet-ter turn. Lo-oks li-ke tro-ub-le co-ming fast."
There was not-hing Pos-sum sa-id she co-uldn't see. He had a ha-bit of sa-ying eit-her too lit-tle or
mo-re than eno-ugh. She told him to co-ver his guns and get in-si-de, that the sand wo-uld ta-ke his
hi-de and the-re was not-hing out the-re he ne-eded to kill that wo-uldn't wa-it. Pos-sum Dark sul-ked
but clim-bed down. Hunc-hed in back of the van, he gras-ped air in the sha-pe of grips and trig-ger
gu-ards. Prac-ti-ced ra-ge and win-da-ge in his he-ad.

"I'll bet I can be-at that storm," Del sa-id. "I got this fe-eling I can do it."
"Beat it whe-re?" Ginny sa-id. "We don't know whe-re we are or what's ahe-ad."
"That's true," Del sa-id. "All the mo-re re-ason then to get the-re so-on as we can."
Ginny step-ped out and vi-ewed the world with dis-re-gard. "I got sand in my te-eth and in my to-es,"
she comp-la-ined. "I'll bet that Mo-ro Ga-in knows right whe-re storms'll li-kely be. I'll bet that's what
hap-pe-ned, all right."
"Seemed li-ke a de-cent sort to me," Del sa-id.
"That's what I me-an," Ginny sa-id. "You can't trust a man li-ke that at all."
The storm had se-emed to last a co-up-le of days. Ginny fi-gu-red may-be an ho-ur. The sky lo-oked
bad as cab-ba-ge so-up. The land lo-oked just the way it had. She co-uldn't see the dif-fe-ren-ce
bet-we-en sand re-cently go-ne or newly ar-ri-ved. Del got the van go-ing aga-in. Ginny tho-ught abo-ut
yes-ter-day's bath. East Bad News had its po-ints.
Before they top-ped the first ri-se, Pos-sum Dark be-gan to stomp on the ro-of. "Ve-hic-les to port,"
he cal-led out. "Se-dans and pic-kup trucks. Flat-beds and se-mis. Bu-ses of all kinds."
"What are they do-ing?" Del sa-id.
"Coming right at us, ha-uling tim-ber."
"Doing what?" Ginny ma-de a fa-ce. "Damn it all, Del, will you stop the car? I swe-ar, you're a
dri-ving fo-ol."
Del stop-ped. Ginny clim-bed up with Pos-sum to watch. The ca-ra-van kept a stra-ight li-ne. Cars
and trucks we-ren't exactly ha-uling tim-ber… but they we-re. Each car-ri-ed a sec-ti-on of a wall. Split
logs bo-und to-get-her, shar-pe-ned at the top. The le-ad car tur-ned and the ot-hers fol-lo-wed. The
le-ad car tur-ned aga-in. In a mo-ment, the-re was a wo-oden stoc-ka-de as-semb-led on the flats,
squ-are as if you'd drawn it with a ru-le. A stoc-ka-de and a ga-te. Over the ga-te a wo-oden sign:
FORT PRU
Games of Chance & Amusement
Term * Whole Life * Half Life * Death
"I don't li-ke it," sa-id Pos-sum Dark.
"You don't li-ke anyt-hing's still ali-ve," Ginny sa-id.
"They've got small arms and they're a ner-vo-us-lo-oking bunch."
"They're just horny, Pos-sum. That's the sa-me as ner-vo-us, or clo-se eno-ugh."
Possum pre-ten-ded to un-ders-tand.
"Looks li-ke they're pul-led up for the night," she cal-led to Del. "Let's do so-me bu-si-ness, fri-end.
The over-he-ad don't ever stop."
Five of them ca-me out to the van. They all lo-oked ali-ke. Stringy, dar-ke-ned by the sun. Ba-re to
the wa-ist ex-cept for col-lars and stri-ped ti-es. Each car-ri-ed an at-tac-he ca-se thin as two sli-ces of
bre-ad wit-ho-ut but-ter. Two had pis-tols stuck in the-ir belts. The le-ader car-ri-ed a fi-ne-lo-oking
sa-wed-off Re-ming-ton 12. It hung by a ca-mou gu-itar strap to his wa-ist. Del didn't li-ke him at all. He
had per-fect whi-te te-eth and a bald he-ad. Eyes the co-lo-ur of jel-lyfish mel-ting on the be-ach. He
stu-di-ed the sign on the van and lo-oked at Del.
"You got a who-re in-si-de or not?"
Del lo-oked him stra-ight on. "I'm a lit-tle disp-le-ased at that. It's not the way to talk."
"Hey." The man ga-ve Del a wink. "You don't ha-ve to gi-ve us the pitch. We're show bu-si-ness folk
our-sel-ves."
"Is that right?"
"Wheels of chan-ce and ho-nest cards. Odds I know you'll li-ke. I'm he-ad ac-tu-ary of this bunch.
Na-me's Fred. That ani-mal up the-re has a piss-po-or at-ti-tu-de, fri-end. No re-ason to po-ke that
we-apon down my thro-at. We're fri-endly pe-op-le he-re."

"No re-ason I can see why Pos-sum'd spray this pla-ce with le-ad and di-ar-rhe-tics," Del sa-id.
"Less you can think of so-met-hing I can't."
Fred smi-led at that. The sun ma-de a big gold ball on his he-ad. "I gu-ess we'll try yo-ur girl," he told
Del. "'Co-ur-se we got to see her first. What do you ta-ke in tra-de?"
"Goods as fi-ne as what you're get-ting in re-turn."
"I've got just the thing." The he-ad ac-tu-ary win-ked aga-in. The ges-tu-re was star-ting to ir-ri-ta-te
Del. Fred nod-ded, and a fri-end drew cle-an whi-te pa-per from his ca-se. "This he-re is he-avy bond,"
he told Del, shuf-fling the ed-ges with his thumb. "Fifty per-cent li-nen we-ave, and we got it by the
re-am. Won't find anyt-hing li-ke it. You can mark on it go-od or tra-de it off. Se-venth Mer-ce-nary
Wri-ters ca-me thro-ugh a we-ek ago. Who-le bri-ga-de of mo-un-ted hor-se. Ne-ar cle-aned us out,
but we can spa-re a few re-ams. We got pen-cils too. Mi-ra-do twos and thre-es, uns-har-pe-ned, with
era-sers on the end. When's the last ti-me you saw that? Why, this stuff's go-od as gold. We got stap-les
and le-gal pads. Cla-im forms, ma-im forms, forms of every sort. De-als on whe-els is what we got. And
you got gas un-der wraps in the wa-gon be-hind yo-ur van. I can smell it pla-in from he-re. Fri-end, we
can su-re talk so-me bu-si-ness with you the-re. I got se-ven-te-en rusty-ass guz-zlers run-nin' dry."
A gnat-whis-ker wi-re spar-ked hot in Dels he-ad. He co-uld see it in the un-derw-ri-ter's eyes.
Ga-so-li-ne gre-ed was what it was, and he knew the-se men we-re bent on mo-re than fleshly
ple-asu-re. He knew with and-ro-idi-al dre-ad that when they co-uld, they'd ma-ke the-ir play.
"Well now, the gas is not for tra-de," he sa-id as calmly as he co-uld. "Sex and ta-cos and
dan-ge-ro-us drugs is what we sell."
"No prob-lem," the ac-tu-ary sa-id. "Why, no prob-lem at all. Just an idea, is all it was. You get that
lit-tle gal out he-re and I'll bring in my crew. How's half a re-am a man so-und to you?"
"Just as fa-ir as it can be," Del sa-id, thin-king that half of that wo-uld've be-en fi-ne, kno-wing de-ad
cer-ta-in now that Fred in-ten-ded to ta-ke back wha-te-ver he ga-ve.
"That Mo-ro fel-low was right," Del sa-id. "The-se in-su-ran-ce boys are bad news. Best thing we can
do is ta-ke off and let it go."
"Pooh," sa-id Ginny, "that's just the way men are. They co-me in mad as fo-amin' dogs and go away
li-ke cats lic-king cre-am. That's the na-tu-re of the for-ni-ca-tin' tra-de. You wa-it and see. Be-si-des,
they won't get funny with Pos-sum Dark."
"You wo-uldn't pray for ra-in if you we-re afi-re," Del mut-te-red. "Well, I'm not un-hitc-hing the gas.
I'll set you up a sta-ge over the tarp. You can do yo-ur num-ber the-re."
"Suit yo-ur-self," Ginny sa-id, kis-sing a plas-tic che-ek and sco-oting him out the do-or. "Now get on
out of he-re and let me start get-ting cu-te."
It se-emed to be go-ing well. Che-er-le-ader Bar-ba-ra Je-an awo-ke for-got-ten wet dre-ams, left
the-ir mo-uths as dry as sna-kes. Set them up for Sally the Te-ach and No-ra Nur-se, sec-ret
vi-ola-ti-ons of the so-ul. May-be Ginny was right, Del de-ci-ded. Fa-ced with gir-lie de-lights, a man's
nor-mal-ly shitty out-lo-ok di-sap-pe-ared. When he was do-ne, he didn't want to wreck a thing for an
ho-ur or may-be two. Didn't ca-re abo-ut kil-ling for half a day. Del co-uld only gu-ess at this ma-gic
and how it wor-ked. Da-ta was one thing, swe-et en-co-un-ters so-met-hing el-se.
He ca-ught Pos-sum's eye and felt se-cu-re. Forty-eight men wa-ited the-ir turns. Pos-sum knew the
ca-lib-re of the-ir arms, the length of every bla-de. His black twin-fif-ti-es bles-sed them all.
Fred the ac-tu-ary sid-led up and grin-ned at Del. "We su-re ought to talk abo-ut gas. That's what we
ought to do."
"Look," Del sa-id, "gas isn't for tra-de, I told you that. Go talk to tho-se boys at the re-fi-nery, sa-me
as us."
"Tried to. They got no use for of-fi-ce sup-pli-es."
"That's not my prob-lem," Del sa-id.
"Maybe it is."
Del didn't miss the ra-zor to-nes. "You got so-met-hing to say, just say it." "Half of yo-ur gas. We pay
our way with the girl and don't gi-ve you any tro-ub-le."

"You for-get abo-ut him?"
Fred stu-di-ed Pos-sum Dark. "I can af-ford los-ses bet-ter than you. Lis-ten, I know what you are,
fri-end. I know you're not a man. Had a CPA dro-id just li-ke you To-re the War."
"Maybe we can talk," Del sa-id, trying to fi-gu-re what to do. "Say now, that's what I li-ke to he-ar."
Ginny's fo-urth cus-to-mer stag-ge-red out, wild-eyed and whi-te aro-und the gills. "God-damn, try
the Nur-se," he baw-led to the ot-hers. "Ne-ver had not-hin' li-ke it in my li-fe!"
"Next," Del sa-id, and star-ted stac-king bond pa-per. "Lust is the na-me of the ga-me, gents, what
did I tell you now?" "The girl plas-tic, too?" Fred as-ked.
"Real as you," Del sa-id. "We ma-ke so-me kind of de-al, how do I know you'll ke-ep yo-ur word?"
"Jesus," Fred sa-id, "what do you think I am? You got my Li-fe Un-derw-ri-ter's Oath!"
The next cus-to-mer exp-lo-ded thro-ugh the cur-ta-in, trip-ped and fell on his fa-ce. Pic-ked him-self
up and sho-ok his he-ad. He lo-oked da-ma-ged, ble-eding aro-und the eyes.
"She's a ti-ger," Del an-no-un-ced, won-de-ring what the hell was go-ing on. "'Scu-se me a mi-nu-te,"
he told Fred, and slip-ped in-si-de the van. "Just what are you do-ing in he-re?" he as-ked Ginny.
"Tho-se boys lo-ok li-ke they be-en thro-ugh a thras-her."
"Beats me," Ginny sa-id, half-way bet-we-en No-ra and Bar-ba-ra Je-an. "Last old boy jer-ked
aro-und li-ke a sna-ke ha-ving a fit. Star-ted pul-ling out his ha-ir. So-met-hin' isn't right he-re, Del. It's
got-ta be the ta-pes. I fi-gu-re that Mo-ro fel-low's a che-at."
"We got tro-ub-le in-si-de and out," Del told her. "The he-ad of this bunch wants our gas."
"Well, he su-re can't ha-ve it, by God."
"Ginny, the man's got bug-spit eyes. Says he'll ta-ke his chan-ces with Pos-sum. We bet-ter cle-ar out
whi-le we can."
"Huh-unh." Ginny sho-ok her he-ad. "That'll ri-le 'em for su-re. Gi-ve me a mi-nu-te or two. We've
do-ne a bunch of No-ras and a Sally. I'll switch them all to Bar-ba-ra Je-an and see."
Del slip-ped back out-si-de. It se-emed a du-bi-o-us ans-wer at best. "That's so-me wo-man," sa-id
Fred.
"She's so-met-hing el-se to-day. Yo-ur in-su-ran-ce boys ha-ve got her fi-red." Fred grin-ned at that.
"Gu-ess I bet-ter gi-ve her a try."
"I wo-uldn't," Del sa-id. "Why not?"
"Let her calm down so-me. Might be mo-re than you want to hand-le."
He knew at on-ce this wasn't the thing to say. Fred tur-ned the co-lo-ur of ketc-hup pie. "Why, you
plas-tic pi-ece of shit! I can hand-le any wo-man born… or put to-get-her out of a kit."
"Suit yo-ur-self," Del sa-id, fe-eling the day go-ing down the dra-in. "No char-ge at all."
"Damn right the-re's not." Fred jer-ked the next man out of li-ne. "Get re-ady in the-re, lit-tle lady. 1
am go-ing to hand-le all yo-ur po-licy ne-eds!"
The men che-ered. Pos-sum Dark, who un-ders-to-od at le-ast three-fifths of the tro-ub-le down
be-low, shot Del a qu-es-ti-oning lo-ok. "Got any of tho-se ta-cos?" so-me-one as-ked.
"Not li-kely," Del sa-id.
Del con-si-de-red tur-ning him-self off. And-ro-id su-ici-de se-emed the ans-wer. But in less than
three mi-nu-tes, un-na-tu-ral howls be-gan to co-me from the van. The howls tur-ned to shri-eks. Li-fe
un-derw-ri-ters went ri-gid. Then Fred emer-ged, shat-te-red. He lo-oked li-ke a man who'd kic-ked a
be-ar with bo-ils. His jo-ints ap-pe-ared to bend the wrong way. He lo-oked whom-per-eyed at Del,
da-zed and out-of-synch. Everyt-hing hap-pe-ned then in se-conds thin as wi-re. Del saw Fred find him,
saw the oil-spill eyes catch him cle-an. Saw the sa-wed-off bar-rels match the eyes so fast even elect-ric
fe-et co-uldn't snatch him out of the way in ti-me. Del's arm exp-lo-ded. He let it go and ran for the van.
Pos-sum co-uldn't help. The ac-tu-ary was be-low and too clo-se. The twin-fif-ti-es ope-ned up.
Un-derw-ri-ters fled. Pos-sum stitc-hed the sand and sent them flying rag-ged and de-ad.
Del re-ac-hed the dri-ver's se-at as le-ad pep-pe-red the van. He felt slightly silly. Sit-ting the-re with
one arm, one hand on the whe-el.
"Move over," Ginny sa-id, "that isn't go-ing to work."
I gu-ess not.

Ginny sent them lurc-hing thro-ugh the scrub. "Ne-ver saw anyt-hing li-ke it in my li-fe," she sa-id
alo-ud. "Tur-ned that po-or fel-la on, he star-ted twis-ting out of his socks, bo-nes snap-ping li-ke sticks.
Damn-dest or-gasm I ever saw."
"Something's not wor-king just right."
"Well, I can see that, Del. Jesus, what's that!" Ginny twis-ted the whe-el as a lar-ge part of the de-sert
ro-se stra-ight up in the air. Smo-king sand ra-ined down on the van.
"Rockets," Del sa-id grimly. "That's the re-ason they fi-gu-red that crazy-fin-ge-red Pos-sum was a
snap. Watch whe-re you're go-ing, girl!"
Two fi-ery pil-lars exp-lo-ded ahe-ad. Del le-aned out the win-dow and lo-oked back. Half of Fort
Pru's wall was in pur-su-it. Pos-sum spra-yed everyt-hing in sight, but he co-uldn't spot whe-re the
roc-kets we-re co-ming from. Un-derw-ri-ter as-sa-ult cars split up, ca-me at them from every si-de.
"Trying to flank us," Del sa-id. A roc-ket burst to the right. "Ginny, I'm not re-al su-re what to do."
"How's the stub?"
"Slight elect-ric ting-le. Li-ke a do-or-bell half a mi-le away. Ginny, they get us in a circ-le, we're in
very de-ep shit."
"They hit that gas, we won't ha-ve to worry abo-ut a thing. Oh Lord, now why did I think of that?"
Possum hit a se-mi cle-an on. It ca-me to a stop and di-ed, fell over li-ke a bug. Del co-uld see that
be-ing a truck and a wall all at on-ce had its prob-lems, ba-lan-ce be-ing one.
"Head right at them," he told Ginny, "then ve-er off sharp. They can't turn qu-ick go-ing fast."
"Del!"
Bullets rat-tled the van. So-met-hing he-avy ma-de a no-ise. The van ske-wed to a halt.
Ginny to-ok her hands off the whe-el and lo-oked grim. "It ap-pe-ars they got the ti-res. Del, we're
flat de-ad is what we are. Let's get out of this thing."
And do what? Del won-de-red. Be-arings se-emed to roll abo-ut in his he-ad. He sen-sed a
mal-func-ti-on on the way.
The Fort Pru ve-hic-les shri-eked to a stop. Cra-zed li-fe agents pi-led out and ca-me at them over
the flats, fi-ring small arms and hur-ling sto-nes. A roc-ket burst ne-arby.
Possum's guns sud-denly stop-ped. Ginny gri-ma-ced in dis-gust. "Don't you tell me we're out of
am-mo, Pos-sum Dark. That stuff's plenty hard to get."
Possum star-ted to spe-ak. Del wa-ved his go-od arm to the north. "Hey now, wo-uld you lo-ok at
that!"
Suddenly the-re was con-fu-si-on in the un-derw-ri-ters' ranks. A va-gu-ely fa-mi-li-ar pic-kup had
ap-pe-ared on the ri-se. The dri-ver we-aved thro-ugh traf-fic, hur-ling gre-na-des. They exp-lo-ded in
clus-ters, bright pink bo-uqu-ets. He spot-ted the man with the roc-ket, lying flat atop a bus. Gre-na-des
stop-ped him cold. Un-derw-ri-ters aban-do-ned the fi-eld and ran. Ginny saw a fa-irly pe-cu-li-ar sight.
Six black Har-leys had jo-ined the truck. Chow Dogs with Uzis sna-ked in and out of the ranks, mo-tors
snar-ling and spe-wing hor-se-ta-ils of sand high in the air. They sho-wed no mercy at all, pic-king off
strag-glers as they ran. A few un-derw-ri-ters ma-de it to co-ver. In a mo-ment, it was over. Fort Pru
fled in sec-ti-onal di-sar-ray.
"Well, if that wasn't just in the nick of ti-me," Del sa-id.
"I ha-te Chow Dogs," Pos-sum sa-id. "They got black ton-gu-es, and that's a fact."
"I ho-pe you folks are all right," Mo-ro sa-id. "Well now, fri-end, lo-oks as if you've thrown an arm."
"Nothing re-al se-ri-o-us," Del sa-id.
"I'm gra-te-ful," Ginny sa-id. "Gu-ess I got to tell you that."
Moro was ta-ken by her pe-net-ra-ting charm, her thank-less man-ner. The fetc-hing smud-ge of
gre-ase on her knee. He tho-ught she was cu-te as a pup.
"I felt it was so-met-hing I had to do. Cir-cums-tan-ces be-ing what they are." "And just what
cir-cums-tan-ces are that?" Ginny as-ked.
"That pesky Shep-herd Dog's sor-ta res-pon-sib-le for any tro-ub-le you might've had. Got a lit-tle
pis-sed when that Pos-sum cle-aned him out. Fi-ve-card stud, I think it was. 'Co-ur-se the-re might

ha-ve be-en mar-king and crim-ping of cards, I co-uldn't say."
Ginny blew ha-ir out of her eyes. "Mis-ter, far as I can see, you're not ma-king a lot of sen-se."
"I'm re-al em-bar-ras-sed abo-ut this. That Dog got mad and kin-da scre-wed up yo-ur ge-ar."
"You let a Dog re-pa-ir my stuff?" Ginny sa-id.
"Perfectly go-od tech-ni-ci-an. Ta-ught him mostly myself. Okay if you don't get his dan-der up.
Tho-se Shep-herds are inb-red, so I he-ar. What he did was set yo-ur ta-pes in a lo-op and spe-ed 'em
up. Cus-to-mer'd get, say, twenty-six ti-mes his mo-ney's worth. Works out to a Mach se-ven fuck.
Co-uld ca-use bo-dily harm." "Lord, I ought to sho-ot you in the fo-ot," Ginny sa-id.
"Look," Mo-ro sa-id, "I stand be-hind my work, and I got he-re qu-ick as I co-uld. Bro-ught fri-ends
along to help, and I'm eating the cost of that."
"Damn right," Ginny sa-id. The Chow Dogs sat the-ir Har-leys a ways off and gla-red at Pos-sum.
Pos-sum Dark gla-red back. He sec-retly ad-mi-red the-ir le-at-her ge-ar, the Pu-ri-na crests sewn on
the backs.
"I’ll be ad-ding up costs," Ginny sa-id. "I'm ex-pec-ting full re-pa-irs."
"You'll get it. Of co-ur-se you'll ha-ve to spend so-me ti-me in Bad News. Might ta-ke a lit-tle
whi-le."
She ca-ught his lo-ok and had to la-ugh. "You're a stub-born son of a bitch, I'll gi-ve you that. What'd
you do with that Dog?" "You want ta-co me-at, I'll ma-ke you a de-al."
"Yuck. I gu-ess I'll pass."
Del be-gan to we-ave abo-ut in ro-ughly tra-pe-zo-idal squ-ares. Smo-ke star-ted to curl out of his
stub.
"For Christ's sa-ke, Pos-sum, sit on him or so-met-hing," Ginny sa-id.
"I can fix that," Mo-ro told her.
"You've abo-ut fi-xed eno-ugh, se-ems to me."
"We're go-ing to get along fi-ne. You wa-it and see."
"You think so?" Ginny lo-oked alar-med. "I bet-ter not get used to ha-ving you aro-und."
"It co-uld hap-pen."
"It co-uld just as easy not."
"I'll see abo-ut chan-ging that ti-re," Mo-ro sa-id. "We ought to get Del out of the sun. You think
abo-ut fin-ding so-met-hing ni-ce to we-ar to din-ner. East Bad News is kin-da picky. We got a lot of
pri-de aro-und he-re… "

XX - DALE BAILEY - THE END OF THE WORLD AS
Between 1347 and 1450 AD, bu-bo-nic pla-gue over-ran Euro-pe, kil-ling so-me 75 mil-li-on
pe-op-le. The pla-gue, dub-bed the Black De-ath be-ca-use of the black pus-tu-les that erup-ted on the
skin of the af-flic-ted, was ca-used by a bac-te-ri-um now known as Yer-si-nia pes-tis. The
Euro-pe-ans of the day, lac-king ac-cess to mic-ros-co-pes or know-led-ge of di-se-ase vec-tors,
at-tri-bu-ted the-ir mis-for-tu-ne to an angry God. Fla-gel-lants ro-amed the land, ho-ping to ap-pe-ase
His wrath. "They di-ed by the hund-reds, both day and night," Ag-no-lo di Tu-ra tells us. "I bu-ri-ed my
fi-ve child-ren with my own hands… so many di-ed that all be-li-eved it was the end of the world."
To-day, the po-pu-la-ti-on of Euro-pe is abo-ut 729 mil-li-on.
Evenings, Wyndham li-kes to sit on the porch, drin-king. He li-kes gin, but he'll drink anyt-hing. He's
not par-ti-cu-lar. La-tely, he's be-en watc-hing it get dark-re-al-ly watc-hing it, I me-an, not just sit-ting
the-re-and so far he's conc-lu-ded that the clic-he is wrong. Night do-esn't fall. It's mo-re comp-lex than
that.
Not that he's en-ti-rely con-fi-dent in the ac-cu-racy of his ob-ser-va-ti-ons.
It's high sum-mer just now, and Wyndham of-ten be-gins drin-king at two or three, so by the ti-me the
sun sets, aro-und ni-ne, he's usu-al-ly pretty drunk. Still, it se-ems to him that, if anyt-hing, night ri-ses,

gat-he-ring first in inky po-ols un-der the tre-es, as if it has le-ac-hed up from un-derg-ro-und
re-ser-vo-irs, and then spre-ading, out to-ward the bor-ders of the yard and up to-ward the yet-ligh-ted
sky. It's only to-ward the end that anyt-hing fal-ls-the black-ness of de-ep spa-ce, he sup-po-ses,
unsc-rol-ling from high abo-ve the earth. The two pla-nes of dark-ness me-et so-mew-he-re in the
mid-dle, and that's night for you.
That's his cur-rent the-ory, any-way.
It isn't his porch, in-ci-den-tal-ly, but then it isn't his gin eit-her-except in the sen-se that, in so far as
Wyndham can tell any-way, everyt-hing now be-longs to him.
End-of-the-world sto-ri-es usu-al-ly co-me in one of two va-ri-eti-es.
In the first, the world ends with a na-tu-ral di-sas-ter, eit-her unp-re-ce-den-ted or on an
unp-re-ce-den-ted sca-le. Flo-ods le-ad all ot-her con-ten-ders-God him-self, we're told, is fond of that
one-tho-ugh pla-gu-es ha-ve the-ir ad-vo-ca-tes. A re-ne-wed ice age is al-so po-pu-lar. Dit-to
dro-ught.
In the se-cond va-ri-ety, ir-res-pon-sib-le hu-man be-ings bring it on them-sel-ves. Mad sci-en-tists
and cor-rupt bu-re-a-uc-rats, usu-al-ly. An exc-han-ge of ICBMs is the typi-cal ro-ute, alt-ho-ugh the
sce-na-rio has da-ted in the pre-sent geo-po-li-ti-cal en-vi-ron-ment.
Feel free to mix and match.
Genetically en-gi-ne-ered flu vi-rus, an-yo-ne? Mel-ting po-lar ice caps?
On the day the world en-ded, Wyndham didn't even re-ali-ze it was the end of the world-not right
away, any-way. For him, at that po-int in his li-fe, pretty much every day se-emed li-ke the end of the
world. This was not a con-se-qu-en-ce of a che-mi-cal im-ba-lan-ce, eit-her. It was a con-se-qu-en-ce
of wor-king for UPS, whe-re, on the day the world en-ded Wyndham had be-en emp-lo-yed for
six-te-en ye-ars, first as a lo-ader, then in sor-ting, and fi-nal-ly in the co-ve-ted po-si-ti-on of dri-ver,
the brown uni-form and everyt-hing. By this ti-me the com-pany had go-ne pub-lic and he al-so ow-ned
so-me sha-res. The mo-ney was go-od-very go-od, in fact. Not only that, he li-ked his job.
Still, the be-gin-ning of every god-damn day star-ted off fe-eling li-ke a ca-taclysm. You try get-ting
up at 4:00 AM every mor-ning and see how you fe-el.
This was his ro-uti-ne:
At 4:00 AM, the alarm went off-an old-fas-hi-oned alarm, he wo-und it up every night. (He co-uldn't
to-le-ra-te the ra-dio be-fo-re he drank his cof-fee.) He al-ways tur-ned it off right away, not wan-ting to
wa-ke his wi-fe. He sho-we-red in the spa-re bath-ro-om (aga-in, not wan-ting to wa-ke his wi-fe; her
na-me was Ann), po-ured cof-fee in-to his ther-mos, and ate so-met-hing he pro-bably sho-uldn't-a
ba-gel, a Pop Tart-whi-le he sto-od over the sink. By then, it wo-uld be 4:20, 4:25 if he was run-ning
la-te.
Then he wo-uld do so-met-hing pa-ra-do-xi-cal: He wo-uld go back to his bed-ro-om and wa-ke up
the wi-fe he'd spent the last twenty mi-nu-tes trying not to dis-turb. "Ha-ve a go-od day," Wyndham
al-ways sa-id.
His wi-fe al-ways did the sa-me thing, too. She wo-uld screw her fa-ce in-to her pil-low and smi-le.
"Ummm," she wo-uld say, and it was usu-al-ly such a cozy, lo-ving, early-mor-ning cud-dling kind of
"ummm" that it al-most ma-de get-ting up at 4 in the god-damn mor-ning worth it.
Wyndham he-ard abo-ut the World Tra-de Cent-re-not the end of the world, tho-ugh to Wyndham it
su-re as hell felt that way-from one of his cus-to-mers.
The cus-to-mer-her na-me was Mo-ni-ca-was one of Wyndham's re-gu-lars: a Ho-me Shop-ping
Net-work fi-end, this wo-man. She was big, too. The kind of wo-man of whom pe-op-le say "She has a
ni-ce per-so-na-lity" or "She has such a pretty fa-ce." She did ha-ve a ni-ce per-so-na-lity, too-at le-ast
Wyndham tho-ught she did. So he was con-cer-ned when she ope-ned the do-or in te-ars.
"What's wrong?" he sa-id.
Monica sho-ok her he-ad, at a loss for words. She wa-ved him in-si-de. Wyndham, in vi-ola-ti-on of

abo-ut fifty UPS re-gu-la-ti-ons, step-ped in af-ter her. The ho-use smel-led of sa-usa-ge and flo-ral air
fres-he-ner. The-re was Ho-me Shop-ping Net-work shit everyw-he-re. I me-an, everyw-he-re.
Wyndham hardly no-ti-ced.
His ga-ze was fi-xed on the te-le-vi-si-on. It was sho-wing an air-li-ner flying in-to the World Tra-de
Cent-re. He sto-od the-re and watc-hed it from three or fo-ur dif-fe-rent ang-les be-fo-re he no-ti-ced
the Ho-me Shop-ping Net-work lo-go in the lo-wer right-hand cor-ner of the scre-en.
That was when he conc-lu-ded that it must be the end of the world. He co-uldn't ima-gi-ne the Ho-me
Shop-ping Net-work pre-empting re-gu-larly sche-du-led prog-ram-ming for anyt-hing less.
The Mus-lim ext-re-mists who flew airp-la-nes in-to the World Tra-de Cent-re, in-to the Pen-ta-gon,
and in-to the un-yi-el-ding earth of an ot-her-wi-se un-re-mar-kab-le fi-eld in Pen-nsyl-va-nia, we-re
se-cu-re, we are told, in the know-led-ge of the-ir im-mi-nent trans-la-ti-on in-to pa-ra-di-se.
There we-re ni-ne-te-en of them.
Every one of them had a na-me.
Wyndham's wi-fe was so-met-hing of a re-ader. She li-ked to re-ad in bed. Be-fo-re she went to
sle-ep she al-ways mar-ked her spot using a bo-ok-mark Wyndham had gi-ven her for her birth-day one
ye-ar: It was a card-bo-ard bo-ok-mark with a yarn rib-bon at the top, and a pic-tu-re of a ra-in-bow
arc-hing high over whi-te-cap-ped mo-un-ta-ins. Smi-le, the bo-ok-mark sa-id. God lo-ves you.
Wyndham wasn't much of a re-ader, but if he'd pic-ked up his wi-fe's bo-ok the day the world en-ded
he wo-uld ha-ve fo-und the first few pa-ges in-te-res-ting. In the ope-ning chap-ter, God rap-tu-res all
true Chris-ti-ans to He-aven. This inc-lu-des true
Christians who are dri-ving cars and tra-ins and airp-la-nes, re-sul-ting in un-co-un-ted lost li-ves as
well as sig-ni-fi-cant da-ma-ges to per-so-nal pro-perty. If Wyndham had re-ad the bo-ok, he'd ha-ve
tho-ught of a bum-per stic-ker he so-me-ti-mes saw from high in his UPS truck. War-ning, the bum-per
stic-ker re-ad, In ca-se of Rap-tu-re, this car will he un-man-ned. Whe-ne-ver he saw that bum-per
stic-ker, Wyndham ima-gi-ned cars cras-hing, pla-nes fal-ling from the sky, pa-ti-ents aban-do-ned on
the ope-ra-ting tab-le-pret-ty much the sce-na-rio of his wi-fe's bo-ok, in fact.
Wyndham went to church every Sun-day, but he co-uldn't help won-de-ring what wo-uld hap-pen to
the un-told mil-li-ons of pe-op-le who we-ren't true Chris-ti-ans- whet-her by cho-ice or by the
ge-og-rap-hi-cal flu-ke of ha-ving be-en born in so-me pla-ce li-ke In-do-ne-sia. What if they we-re
cros-sing the stre-et in front of one of tho-se cars, he won-de-red, or wa-te-ring lawns tho-se pla-nes
wo-uld so-on plo-ugh in-to?
But I was sa-ying:
On the day the world en-ded Wyndham didn't un-ders-tand right away what had hap-pe-ned. His
alarm clock went off the way it al-ways did and he went thro-ugh his nor-mal ro-uti-ne. Sho-wer in the
spa-re bath, cof-fee in the ther-mos, bre-ak-fast over the sink (a cho-co-la-te do-nut, this ti-me, and
go-ne a lit-tle sta-le). Then he went back to the bed-ro-om to say go-od-bye to his wi-fe.
"Have a go-od day," he sa-id, as he al-ways sa-id, and, le-aning over, he sho-ok her a lit-tle: not
eno-ugh to re-al-ly wa-ke her, just eno-ugh to get her stir-ring. In six-te-en ye-ars of per-for-ming this
ri-tu-al, mi-nus fe-de-ral ho-li-days and two we-eks of pa-id va-ca-ti-on in the sum-mer, Wyndham had
pretty much mas-te-red it. He co-uld ca-use her to stir wit-ho-ut qu-ite wa-king her up just abo-ut every
ti-me.
So to say he was surp-ri-sed when his wi-fe didn't screw her fa-ce in-to her pil-low and smi-le is
so-met-hing of an un-ders-ta-te-ment. He was shoc-ked, ac-tu-al-ly. And the-re was an ad-di-ti-onal
con-si-de-ra-ti-on: She hadn't sa-id "Ummm," eit-her. Not the usu-al lu-xu-ri-o-us, warm-mor-ning-bed
kind of "ummm," and not the inf-re-qu-ent but still fa-mi-li-ar stuffy, I-ha-ve-a-cold-and-my-he-ad-aches
kind of "ummm," eit-her.
No "ummm" at all.
The air-con-di-ti-oning cycled off. For the first ti-me Wyndham no-ti-ced a stran-ge smell-a fa-int,

or-ga-nic funk, li-ke spo-iled milk, or un-was-hed fe-et.
Standing the-re in the dark, Wyndham be-gan to ha-ve a very bad fe-eling. It was a dif-fe-rent kind of
bad fe-eling than the one he'd had in Mo-ni-ca's li-ving ro-om watc-hing air-li-ners plun-ge aga-in and
aga-in in-to the World Tra-de Cent-re. That had be-en a po-wer-ful but lar-gely im-per-so-nal bad
fe-eling-I say "lar-gely im-per-so-nal" be-ca-use Wyndham had a third co-usin who wor-ked at Can-tor
Fitz-ge-rald. (The co-usin's na-me was Chris; Wyndham had to lo-ok it up in his ad-dress bo-ok every
ye-ar when he sent out cards ce-leb-ra-ting the birth of his per-so-nal sa-vo-ir.) The bad fe-eling he
be-gan to ha-ve when his wi-fe fa-iled to say "ummm," on the ot-her hand, was po-wer-ful and
per-so-nal.
Concerned, Wyndham re-ac-hed down and to-uc-hed his wi-fe's fa-ce. It was li-ke to-uc-hing a
wo-man ma-de of wax, li-fe-less and co-ol, and it was at that mo-ment-that mo-ment pre-ci-sely-that
Wyndham re-ali-zed the world had co-me to an end.
Everything af-ter that was just de-ta-ils.
Beyond the mad sci-en-tists and cor-rupt bu-re-a-uc-rats, cha-rac-ters in end-of-the-world sto-ri-es
typi-cal-ly co-me in one of three va-ri-eti-es.
The first is the rug-ged in-di-vi-du-alist. You know the type: self-re-li-ant, ico-noc-las-tic lo-ners who
know how to use fi-re-arms and de-li-ver ba-bi-es. By story's end, they're well on the-ir way to
Re-Estab-lis-hing Wes-tern Ci-vi-li-za-ti-on, tho-ugh they're usu-al-ly smart eno-ugh not to re-turn to the
Bad Old Ways.
The se-cond va-ri-ety is the post-apo-calyp-tic ban-dit. The-se cha-rac-ters of-ten co-me in gangs,
and they fa-ce off aga-inst the rug-ged sur-vi-vor types. If you hap-pen to pre-fer ci-ne-ma-tic
in-car-na-ti-ons of the end-of-the-world ta-le, you can usu-al-ly re-cog-ni-ze them by the-ir penc-hant
for bon-da-ge ge-ar, pun-ked-out ha-ir-cuts, and cus-to-mi-zed ve-hic-les. Un-li-ke the rug-ged
sur-vi-vors, the post-apo-calyp-tic ban-dits emb-ra-ce the Bad Old Ways-tho-ugh they're not
disp-le-ased by the ex-pan-ded op-por-tu-ni-ti-es to ra-pe and pil-la-ge.
The third type of cha-rac-ter-also pretty com-mon, tho-ugh a go-od de-al less so than the ot-her
two-is the world-we-ary sop-his-ti-ca-te. Li-ke Wyndham, such cha-rac-ters drink too much; un-li-ke
Wyndham, they suf-fer badly from en-nui. Wyndham suf-fers too, of co-ur-se, but wha-te-ver he
suf-fers from, you can bet it's not en-nui.
We we-re dis-cus-sing de-ta-ils, tho-ugh:
Wyndham did the things pe-op-le do when they dis-co-ver a lo-ved one de-ad. He pic-ked up the
pho-ne and di-al-led 9-1 -1. The-re se-emed to be so-met-hing wrong with the li-ne, ho-we-ver; no one
pic-ked up on the ot-her end. Wyndham to-ok a de-ep bre-ath, went in-to the kitc-hen, and tri-ed the
ex-ten-si-on. On-ce aga-in he had no suc-cess.
The re-ason, of co-ur-se, was that, this be-ing the end of the world, all the pe-op-le who we-re
sup-po-sed to ans-wer the pho-nes we-re de-ad. Ima-gi-ne them be-ing swept away by a ti-dal wa-ve if
that helps-which is exactly what hap-pe-ned to mo-re than 3000 pe-op-le du-ring a storm in Pa-kis-tan
in 1960. (Not that this is li-te-ral-ly what hap-pe-ned to the ope-ra-tors who wo-uld ha-ve ta-ken
Wyndham's 9-1-1 call, you un-ders-tand; but mo-re abo-ut what re-al-ly hap-pe-ned to them la-ter-the
im-por-tant thing is that one mo-ment they had be-en ali-ve; the next they we-re de-ad. Li-ke
Wyndham's wi-fe.)
Wyndham ga-ve up on the pho-ne.
He went back in-to the bed-ro-om. He per-for-med a fumb-ling ver-si-on of mo-uth-to-mo-uth
re-sus-ci-ta-ti-on on his wi-fe for fif-te-en mi-nu-tes or so, and then he ga-ve that up, too. He wal-ked
in-to his da-ugh-ter's bed-ro-om (she was twel-ve and her na-me was El-len). He fo-und her lying on her
back, her mo-uth slightly aga-pe. He re-ac-hed down to sha-ke her-he was go-ing to tell her that
so-met-hing ter-rib-le had hap-pe-ned; that her mot-her had di-ed-but he fo-und that so-met-hing
ter-rib-le had hap-pe-ned to her as well. The sa-me ter-rib-le thing, in fact.
Wyndham pa-nic-ked.

He ra-ced out-si-de, whe-re the first hint of red had be-gun to ble-ed up over the ho-ri-zon. His
ne-igh-bo-ur’s auto-ma-tic ir-ri-ga-ti-on system was on, the he-ads whic-ke-ring in the si-len-ce, and as
he sprin-ted ac-ross the lawn, Wyndham felt the spray, li-ke a co-ol hand aga-inst his fa-ce. Then,
chil-led, he was stan-ding on his ne-igh-bo-ur’s sto-op. Ham-me-ring the do-or with both fists.
Scre-aming.
After a ti-me-he didn't know how long-a dre-ad-ful calm set-tled over him. The-re was no so-und but
the so-und of the sprink-lers, thro-wing glit-te-ring arcs of spray in-to the ha-lo of the stre-et light on the
cor-ner.
He had a vi-si-on, then. It was as clo-se as he had ever co-me to a mo-ment of ge-nu-ine
pres-ci-en-ce. In the vi-si-on, he saw the su-bur-ban ho-uses stretc-hing away in si-len-ce be-fo-re him.
He saw the si-lent bed-ro-oms. In them, cur-led be-ne-ath the she-ets, he saw a le-gi-on of sle-epers,
al-so si-lent, who wo-uld ne-ver aga-in wa-ke up.
Wyndham swal-lo-wed.
Then he did so-met-hing he co-uld not ha-ve ima-gi-ned do-ing even twenty mi-nu-tes ago. He bent
over, fis-hed the key from its hi-ding pla-ce bet-we-en the bricks, and let him-self in-si-de his
ne-igh-bo-ur’s ho-use.
The ne-igh-bo-ur’s cat slip-ped past him, me-wing qu-eru-lo-usly. Wyndham had al-re-ady re-ac-hed
down to ret-ri-eve it when he no-ti-ced the smell-that unp-le-asant, fa-intly or-ga-nic funk. Not spo-iled
milk, eit-her. And not fe-et. So-met-hing wor-se: so-iled di-apers, or a clog-ged to-ilet.
Wyndham stra-igh-te-ned, the cat for-got-ten.
"Herm?" he cal-led. "Ro-bin?"
No ans-wer.
Inside, Wyndham pic-ked up the pho-ne, and di-al-led 9-1 -1. He lis-te-ned to it ring for a long ti-me;
then, wit-ho-ut bot-he-ring to turn it off, Wyndham drop-ped the pho-ne to the flo-or. He ma-de his way
thro-ugh the si-lent ho-use, snap-ping on lights. At the do-or to the mas-ter bed-ro-om, he he-si-ta-ted.
The do-or-it was un-mis-ta-kab-le now, a ming-led stench of uri-ne and fa-eces, of all the body's
musc-les re-la-xing at on-ce-was stron-ger he-re. When he spo-ke aga-in, whis-pe-ring re-al-ly"Herm? Ro-bin?"
-he no lon-ger ex-pec-ted an ans-wer.
Wyndham tur-ned on the light. Ro-bin and Herm we-re sha-pes in the bed, un-mo-ving. Step-ping
clo-ser, Wyndham sta-red down at them. A fle-eting se-ri-es of ima-ges cas-ca-ded thro-ugh his mind,
ima-ges of Herm and Ro-bin wor-king the grill at the ne-igh-bo-ur-ho-od block party or put-te-ring in
the-ir ve-ge-tab-le gar-den. They'd had a knack for to-ma-to-es, Ro-bin and Herm. Wyndham's wi-fe
had al-ways lo-ved the-ir to-ma-to-es.
Something ca-ught in Wyndham's thro-at. He went away for a whi-le then. The world just gre-yed out
on him.
When he ca-me back, Wyndham fo-und him-self in the li-ving ro-om, stan-ding in front of Ro-bin and
Herm's te-le-vi-si-on. He tur-ned it on and cycled thro-ugh the chan-nels, but the-re was not-hing on.
Li-te-ral-ly not-hing. Snow, that's all. Se-venty-fi-ve chan-nels of snow. The end of the world had
al-ways be-en te-le-vi-sed in Wyndham's ex-pe-ri-en-ce. The fact that it wasn't be-ing te-le-vi-sed now
sug-ges-ted that it re-al-ly was the end of the world.
This is not to sug-gest that te-le-vi-si-on va-li-da-tes hu-man ex-pe-ri-en-ce-of the end of the world
or in-de-ed of anyt-hing el-se, for that mat-ter.
You co-uld ask the pe-op-le of Pom-pe-ii, if most of them hadn't di-ed in a vol-ca-no erup-ti-on in 79
AD, ne-arly two mil-len-nia be-fo-re te-le-vi-si-on. When Ve-su-vi-us erup-ted, sen-ding la-va
thun-de-ring down the mo-un-ta-in-si-de at fo-ur mi-les a mi-nu-te, so-me 16,000 pe-op-le pe-ris-hed.
By so-me fre-akish ge-olo-gi-cal qu-irk, so-me of them-the-ir shells, any-way-we-re pre-ser-ved,
fro-zen in-si-de casts of vol-ca-nic ash. The-ir arms outst-retc-hed in ple-as for mercy, the-ir fa-ces
fro-zen in hor-ror.
For a fee, you can vi-sit them to-day.

Here's one of my fa-vo-uri-te end-of-the-world sce-na-ri-os by the way: Car-ni-vo-ro-us plants.
Wyndham got in his car and went lo-oking for as-sis-tan-ce-a func-ti-oning te-lep-ho-ne or
te-le-vi-si-on, a help-ful pas-ser-by. He fo-und ins-te-ad mo-re non-func-ti-oning te-lep-ho-nes and
te-le-vi-si-ons. And, of co-ur-se, mo-re non-func-ti-oning pe-op-le: lots of tho-se, tho-ugh he had to
lo-ok har-der for them than you might ha-ve ex-pec-ted. They we-ren't scat-te-red in the stre-ets, or
de-ad at the whe-els of the-ir cars in a mas-si-ve traf-fic jam-tho-ugh Wyndham sup-po-sed that might
ha-ve be-en the ca-se so-mew-he-re in Euro-pe, whe-re the ca-tast-rop-he-wha-te-ver it was-had
fal-len squ-are in the mid-dle of the mor-ning rush.
Here, ho-we-ver, it se-emed to ha-ve ca-ught most folks at ho-me in bed; as a re-sult, the ro-ads
we-re mo-re than usu-al-ly pas-sab-le.
At a loss-numb, re-al-ly-Wyndham dro-ve to work. He might ha-ve be-en in shock by then. He'd
got-ten ac-cus-to-med to the smell, any-way, and the corp-ses of the night shift-men and wo-men he'd
known for six-te-en ye-ars, in so-me ca-ses-didn't sha-ke him as much. What did sha-ke him was the
sight of all the pac-ka-ges in the sor-ting area: He was struck sud-denly by the fact that no-ne of them
wo-uld ever be de-li-ve-red. So Wyndham lo-aded his truck and went out on his ro-ute. He wasn't su-re
why he did it-may-be be-ca-use he'd ren-ted a mo-vie on-ce in which a post-apo-calyp-tic drif-ter
sca-ven-ges a US Pos-tal uni-form and ma-na-ges to Re-Estab-lish Wes-tern Ci-vi-li-za-ti-on (but not
the Bad Old Ways) by as-su-ming the post-man's ap-po-in-ted ro-unds. The fu-ti-lity of Wyndham's
own ef-forts qu-ickly be-ca-me evi-dent, ho-we-ver.
He ga-ve it up when he fo-und that even Mo-ni-ca-or, as he mo-re of-ten tho-ught of her, the Ho-me
Shop-ping Net-work Lady-was no lon-ger in the bu-si-ness of re-ce-iving pac-ka-ges. Wyndham
fo-und her fa-ce down on the kitc-hen flo-or, clutc-hing a shat-te-red cof-fee mug in one hand. In de-ath
she had ne-it-her a pretty fa-ce nor a ni-ce per-so-na-lity. She did ha-ve that sa-me ri-pe unp-le-asant
do-or, ho-we-ver. In spi-te of it, Wyndham sto-od lo-oking down at her for the lon-gest ti-me. He
co-uldn't se-em to lo-ok away.
When he fi-nal-ly did lo-ok away, Wyndham went back to the li-ving ro-om whe-re he had on-ce
watc-hed ne-arly 3000 pe-op-le die, and ope-ned her pac-ka-ge him-self. When it ca-me to UPS
ru-les, the Ho-me Shop-ping Net-work Lady's li-ving ro-om was tur-ning out to be so-met-hing of a
post-apo-calyp-tic zo-ne in its own right.
Wyndham to-re the ma-iling ta-pe off and drop-ped it on the flo-or. He ope-ned the box. In-si-de,
wrap-ped sa-fely in three la-yers of bub-ble wrap, he fo-und a por-ce-la-in sta-tue of El-vis Pres-ley.
Elvis Pres-ley, the King of Rock 'n' Roll, di-ed August 16, 1977, whi-le sit-ting on the to-ilet. An
autopsy re-ve-aled that he had in-ges-ted an imp-res-si-ve cock-ta-il of presc-rip-ti-on drugs-inclu-ding
co-de-ine, et-hi-na-ma-te, met-ha-qu-alo-ne, and va-ri-o-us bar-bi-tu-ra-tes. Doc-tors al-so fo-und
tra-ce ele-ments of Va-li-um, De-me-rol, and ot-her phar-ma-ce-uti-cals in his ve-ins.
For a ti-me, Wyndham com-for-ted him-self with the il-lu-si-on that the end of the world had be-en a
lo-cal phe-no-me-non. He sat in his truck out-si-de the Ho-me Shop-ping Net-work Lady's ho-use and
awa-ited res-cue-the so-und of si-rens or ap-pro-ac-hing chop-pers, wha-te-ver. He fell as-le-ep
crad-ling the por-ce-la-in sta-tue of El-vis. He wo-ke up at dawn, stiff from sle-eping in the truck, to find
a stray dog no-sing aro-und out-si-de.
Clearly res-cue wo-uld not be forth-co-ming.
Wyndham cha-sed off the dog and pla-ced El-vis gently on the si-de-walk. Then he dro-ve off,
he-ading out of the city. Pe-ri-odi-cal-ly, he stop-ped, each ti-me con-fir-ming what he had al-re-ady
known the mi-nu-te he to-uc-hed his de-ad wi-fe's fa-ce: The end of the world was upon him. He fo-und
not-hing but non-func-ti-oning te-lep-ho-nes, non-func-ti-oning te-le-vi-si-ons, and non-func-ti-oning
pe-op-le. Along the way he lis-te-ned to a lot of non-func-ti-oning ra-dio sta-ti-ons.
You, li-ke Wyndham, may be cu-ri-o-us abo-ut the ca-tast-rop-he that has be-fal-len ever-yo-ne in

the world aro-und him. You may even be won-de-ring why Wyndham has sur-vi-ved.
End-of-the-world ta-les typi-cal-ly ma-ke a big de-al abo-ut such things, but Wyndham's cu-ri-osity
will ne-ver be sa-tis-fi-ed. Un-for-tu-na-tely, ne-it-her will yo-urs. Shit hap-pens.
It's the end of the world af-ter all.
The di-no-sa-urs ne-ver dis-co-ve-red what ca-used the-ir ex-tinc-ti-on, eit-her.
At this wri-ting, ho-we-ver, most sci-en-tists ag-ree that the di-no-sa-urs met the-ir fa-te when an
as-te-ro-id ni-ne mi-les wi-de plo-ug-hed in-to the Earth just so-uth of the Yu-ca-tan Pe-nin-su-la,
trig-ge-ring gi-gan-tic tsu-na-mis, hur-ri-ca-ne-for-ce winds, world-wi-de fo-rest fi-res, and a flurry of
vol-ca-nic ac-ti-vity. The cra-ter is still the-re, it's 120 mi-les wi-de and mo-re than a mi-le de-ep-but the
di-no-sa-urs, along with 75% of the ot-her spe-ci-es then ali-ve, are go-ne. Many of them di-ed in the
im-pact, va-po-ri-zed in the exp-lo-si-on. Tho-se that sur-vi-ved the ini-ti-al ca-taclysm wo-uld ha-ve
pe-ris-hed so-on af-ter as acid ra-in po-iso-ned the world's wa-ter and dust obs-cu-red the sun,
plun-ging the pla-net in-to a ye-ars-long win-ter.
For what it's worth, this im-pact was me-rely the most dra-ma-tic in a long se-ri-es of mass
ex-tinc-ti-ons; they oc-cur in the fos-sil re-cord at ro-ughly 30-mil-li-on-ye-ar in-ter-vals. So-me
sci-en-tists ha-ve lin-ked the-se in-ter-vals to the so-lar system's pe-ri-odic jo-ur-ney thro-ugh the
ga-lac-tic pla-ne, which dis-lod-ges mil-li-ons of co-mets from the Oort clo-ud be-yond Plu-to, ra-ining
them down on Earth. This the-ory, still con-tes-ted, is cal-led the Shi-va Hypot-he-sis in ho-no-ur of the
Hin-du god of dest-ruc-ti-on.
The in-ha-bi-tants of Lis-bon wo-uld ha-ve ap-pre-ci-ated the al-lu-si-on on No-vem-ber 1, 1755,
when the city was struck by an earth-qu-ake me-asu-ring 8.5 on the Rich-ter Sca-le. The tre-mor
le-vel-led mo-re than 12,000 ho-mes and ig-ni-ted a fi-re that bur-ned for six days.
More than 60,000 pe-op-le pe-ris-hed.
This event ins-pi-red Vol-ta-ire to wri-te Can-di-de, in which Dr. Pang-loss ad-vi-ses us that this is
the best of all pos-sib-le worlds.
Wyndham co-uld ha-ve fil-led the gas tank in his truck. The-re we-re gas sta-ti-ons at just abo-ut
every exit along the high-way, and they se-emed to be func-ti-oning well eno-ugh. He didn't bot-her,
tho-ugh.
When the truck ran out of gas, he just pul-led to the si-de of the ro-ad, hop-ped down, and struck off
ac-ross the fi-elds. When it star-ted get-ting dark-this was be-fo-re he had la-unc-hed him-self on the
study of just how it is night fal-ls-he to-ok shel-ter in the ne-arest ho-use.
It was a ni-ce pla-ce, a two-story brick ho-use set well back from the co-untry ro-ad he was by then
wal-king on. It had so-me big tre-es in the front yard. In the back, a sha-ded lawn slo-ped down to the
kind of wo-ods you see in mo-vi-es, but not of-ten in re-al li-fe: enor-mo-us, old tre-es with ge-ne-ro-us,
le-af-car-pe-ted ave-nu-es. It was the kind of pla-ce his wi-fe wo-uld ha-ve lo-ved, and he reg-ret-ted
ha-ving to bre-ak a win-dow to get in-si-de. But the-re it was: It was the end of the world and he had to
ha-ve a pla-ce to sle-ep. What el-se co-uld he do?
Wyndham hadn't plan-ned to stay the-re, but when he wo-ke up the next mor-ning he co-uldn't think
of anyw-he-re to go. He fo-und two non-func-ti-onal old pe-op-le in one ups-ta-irs bed-ro-om and he
tri-ed to do for them what he had not be-en ab-le to do for his wi-fe and da-ugh-ter: Using a spa-de
from the ga-ra-ge, he star-ted dig-ging a gra-ve in the front yard. Af-ter an ho-ur or so, his hands be-gan
to blis-ter and crack. His musc-les-soft from sit-ting be-hind the whe-el of a UPS truck for all tho-se
ye-ars-re-bel-led.
He res-ted for a whi-le, and then he lo-aded the old pe-op-le in-to the car he fo-und par-ked in the
ga-ra-ge-a sla-te-blue Vol-vo sta-ti-on wa-gon with 37,312 mi-les on the odo-me-ter. He dro-ve them
a mi-le or two down the ro-ad, pul-led over, and la-id them out, si-de-by-si-de in a gro-ve of be-ech
tre-es. He tri-ed to say so-me words over them be-fo-re he left-his wi-fe wo-uld ha-ve wan-ted him

to-but he co-uldn't think of anyt-hing ap-prop-ri-ate so he fi-nal-ly ga-ve it up and went back to the
ho-use.
It wo-uldn't ha-ve ma-de much dif-fe-ren-ce: Tho-ugh Wyndham didn't know it, the old pe-op-le
we-re lap-sed Jews. Ac-cor-ding to the fa-ith Wyndham sha-red with his wi-fe, they we-re do-omed to
burn in hell for all eter-nity any-way. Both of them we-re first-ge-ne-ra-ti-on im-mig-rants; most of the-ir
fa-mi-li-es had al-re-ady be-en bur-ned up in ovens at Dac-hau and Buc-hen-wald. Bur-ning wo-uldn't
ha-ve be-en anyt-hing new for them.
Speaking of fi-res, the Tri-ang-le Shirt Wa-ist Fac-tory in New York City bur-ned on March 25,
1911. One hund-red and forty-six pe-op-le di-ed. Many of them might ha-ve sur-vi-ved, but the
fac-tory's ow-ners had loc-ked the exits to pre-vent theft.
Rome bur-ned, too. It is sa-id that Ne-ro fid-dled.
Back at the ho-use, Wyndham was-hed up and ma-de him-self a drink from the li-qu-or ca-bi-net he
fo-und in the kitc-hen. He'd ne-ver be-en much of a drin-ker be-fo-re the world en-ded, but he didn't
see any re-ason not to gi-ve it a try now. His ex-pe-ri-ment pro-ved such a suc-cess that he be-gan
sit-ting out on the porch nights, drin-king gin and watc-hing the sky. One night he tho-ught he saw a
pla-ne, lights blin-king as it ar-ced high over-he-ad. La-ter, so-ber, he conc-lu-ded that it must ha-ve
be-en a sa-tel-li-te, still whip-ping aro-und the pla-net, be-aming down te-le-metry to empty lis-te-ning
sta-ti-ons and aban-do-ned com-mand posts.
A day or two la-ter the po-wer went out. And a few days af-ter that, Wyndham ran out of li-qu-or.
Using the Vol-vo, he set off in se-arch of a town. Cha-rac-ters in end-of-the-world sto-ri-es com-monly
dri-ve ve-hic-les of two types: The jaded sop-his-ti-ca-tes tend to dri-ve so-uped up sports cars, of-ten
ra-cing them along the Aust-ra-li-an co-ast li-ne be-ca-use what el-se do they ha-ve to li-ve for;
ever-yo-ne el-se dri-ves rug-ged SUVs. Sin-ce the 1991 Per-si-an Gulf War-in which so-me 23,000
pe-op-le di-ed, most of them Ira-qi consc-ripts kil-led by Ame-ri-can smart bombs-mi-li-tary-style
Hum-ve-es ha-ve be-en es-pe-ci-al-ly co-ve-ted. Wyndham, ho-we-ver, fo-und the Vol-vo en-ti-rely
ade-qu-ate to his ne-eds.
No one shot at him.
He was not as-sa-ul-ted by a ro-ving pack of fe-ral dogs.
He fo-und a town af-ter only fif-te-en mi-nu-tes on the ro-ad. He didn't see any evi-den-ce of
lo-oting. Every-body was too de-ad to lo-ot; that's the way it is at the end of the world.
On the way, Wyndham pas-sed a spor-ting go-ods sto-re whe-re he did not stop to stock up on
we-apons or sur-vi-val equ-ip-ment. He pas-sed nu-me-ro-us aban-do-ned ve-hic-les, but he did not
stop to sip-hon off so-me gas. He did stop at the li-qu-or sto-re, whe-re he smas-hed a win-dow with a
rock and hel-ped him-self to se-ve-ral ca-ses of gin, whis-key, and vod-ka. He al-so stop-ped at the
gro-cery sto-re, whe-re he fo-und the re-eking bo-di-es of the night crew spraw-led out be-si-de carts
of sup-pli-es that wo-uld ne-ver ma-ke it on-to the shel-ves. Hol-ding a hand-kerc-hi-ef over his no-se,
Wyndham lo-aded up on to-nic wa-ter and a va-ri-ety of ot-her mi-xers. He al-so got so-me can-ned
go-ods, tho-ugh he didn't fe-el any im-pe-ra-ti-ve to stock up be-yond his im-me-di-ate ne-eds. He
ig-no-red the bot-tled wa-ter.
In the bo-ok sec-ti-on, he did pick up a bar-ten-der's gu-ide.
Some end-of-the-world sto-ri-es pre-sent us with two post-apo-calyp-se sur-vi-vors, one ma-le and
one fe-ma-le. The-se two sur-vi-vors ta-ke it upon them-sel-ves to Re-Po-pu-la-te the Earth, part of
the-ir lar-ger ef-fort to Re-Estab-lish Wes-tern Ci-vi-li-za-ti-on wit-ho-ut the Bad Old Ways. The-ir
na-mes are al-ways art-ful-ly with-held un-til the end of the story, at which po-int they are in-va-ri-ably
re-ve-aled to be Adam and Eve.
The truth is, al-most all end-of-the-world sto-ri-es are at so-me le-vel Adam-and-Eve sto-ri-es. That
may be why they enj-oy such po-pu-la-rity. In the in-te-rests of to-tal disc-lo-su-re, I will ad-mit that in
fal-low pe-ri-ods of my own se-xu-al li-fe-and, alas, the-se pe-ri-ods ha-ve be-en mo-re fre-qu-ent than

I'd ca-re to ad-mit-I've of-ten fo-und Adam-and-Eve post-ho-lo-ca-ust fan-ta-si-es stran-gely
com-for-ting. Be-ing the only man ali-ve sig-ni-fi-cantly re-du-ces the po-ten-ti-al for re-j-ec-ti-on in my
vi-ew. And it cuts per-for-man-ce an-xi-ety prac-ti-cal-ly to not-hing.
There's a wo-man in this story, too. Don't get yo-ur ho-pes up.
By this ti-me, Wyndham has be-en li-ving in the brick ho-use for al-most two we-eks. He sle-eps in
the old co-up-le's bed-ro-om, and he sle-eps pretty well, but may-be that's the gin. So-me mor-nings he
wa-kes up di-so-ri-en-ted, won-de-ring whe-re his wi-fe is and how he ca-me to be in a stran-ge pla-ce.
Ot-her mor-nings he wa-kes up fe-eling li-ke he dre-amed everyt-hing el-se and this has al-ways be-en
his bed-ro-om.
One day, tho-ugh, he wa-kes up early, to gray pre-dawn light. So-me-one is mo-ving aro-und
downs-ta-irs. Wyndham's cu-ri-o-us, but he's not af-ra-id. He do-esn't wish he'd stop-ped at the
spor-ting go-ods sto-re and got-ten a gun. Wyndham has ne-ver shot a gun in his li-fe. If he did sho-ot
so-me-one-even a post-apo-calyp-tic punk with can-ni-ba-lism on his mind-he'd pro-bably ha-ve a
bre-ak-down.
Wyndham do-esn't try to dis-gu-ise his pre-sen-ce as he go-es downs-ta-irs. The-re's a wo-man in
the li-ving ro-om. She's not bad lo-oking, this wo-man blon-de in a was-hed-out kind of way, trim, and
yo-ung, twenty-fi-ve, thirty at the most. She do-esn't lo-ok ext-re-mely cle-an, and she do-esn't smell
much bet-ter, but hygi-ene hasn't be-en up-per-most on Wyndham's mind la-tely, eit-her. Who is he to
jud-ge?
"I was lo-oking for a pla-ce to sle-ep," the wo-man says.
"There's a spa-re bed-ro-om ups-ta-irs," Wyndham tells her.
The next mor-ning-it's re-al-ly al-most no-on, but Wyndham has got-ten in-to the ha-bit of sle-eping
la-te-they eat bre-ak-fast to-get-her: a Pop Tart for the wo-man, a bowl of dry Che-eri-os for
Wyndham.
They com-pa-re no-tes, but we don't ne-ed to get in-to that. It's the end of the world and the wo-man
do-esn't know how it hap-pe-ned any mo-re than Wyndham do-es or you do or any-body ever do-es.
She do-es most of the tal-king, tho-ugh. Wyndham's ne-ver be-en much of a tal-ker, even at the best of
ti-mes.
He do-esn't ask her to stay. He do-esn't ask her to le-ave.
He do-esn't ask her much of anyt-hing.
That's how it go-es all day.
Sometimes the who-le sex thing ca-uses the end of the world.
In fact, if you'll per-mit me to re-fe-ren-ce Adam and Eve just one mo-re ti-me, sex and de-ath ha-ve
be-en con-nec-ted to the end of the world ever sin-ce-well, the be-gin-ning of the world. Eve, des-pi-te
war-nings to the cont-rary, eats of the fru-it of the Tree of Know-led-ge of Go-od and Evil and re-ali-zes
she's na-ked-that is, a se-xu-al be-ing. Then she int-ro-du-ces Adam to the idea by gi-ving him a bi-te of
the fru-it.
God pu-nis-hes Adam and Eve for the-ir transg-res-si-on by kic-king them out of Pa-ra-di-se and
int-ro-du-cing de-ath in-to the world. And the-re you ha-ve it: the first apo-calyp-se, Eros and
Tha-na-tos all ti-ed up in one ne-at lit-tle bund-le, and it's all Eve's fa-ult.
No won-der fe-mi-nists don't li-ke that story. It's a pretty cor-ro-si-ve vi-ew of fe-ma-le se-xu-ality
when you think abo-ut it.
Coincidentally, per-haps, one of my fa-vo-uri-te end-of-the-world sto-ri-es in-vol-ves so-me
ast-ro-na-uts who fall in-to a ti-me warp; when they get out they le-arn that all the men are de-ad. The
wo-men ha-ve do-ne pretty well for them-sel-ves in the me-an-ti-me. They no lon-ger ne-ed men to
rep-ro-du-ce and they've set up a so-ci-ety that se-ems to work okay wit-ho-ut men-bet-ter in fact than
our messy two-sex so-ci-eti-es ever ha-ve.
But do the men stay out of it?

They do not. They're men, af-ter all, and they're dri-ven by the-ir ne-ed for se-xu-al do-mi-nan-ce. It's
ge-ne-ti-cal-ly en-co-ded so to spe-ak, and it's not long be-fo-re they're trying to turn this Eden in-to
anot-her fal-len world. It's sex that do-es it, vi-olent ma-le sex-ra-pe, ac-tu-al-ly. In ot-her words, sex
that's mo-re abo-ut the vi-olen-ce than the sex.
And cer-ta-inly not-hing to do with lo-ve.
Which, when you think abo-ut it, is a pretty cor-ro-si-ve vi-ew of ma-le se-xu-ality. The mo-re things
chan-ge the mo-re they stay the sa-me, I gu-ess.
Wyndham, tho-ugh.
Wyndham he-ads out on the porch aro-und three. He's got so-me to-nic. He's got so-me gin. It's what
he do-es now. He do-esn't know whe-re the wo-man is, do-esn't ha-ve strong fe-elings on the is-sue
eit-her way.
He's be-en sit-ting the-re for ho-urs when she jo-ins him. Wyndham do-esn't know what ti-me it is,
but the air has that hazy un-der-wa-ter qu-ality that co-mes aro-und twi-light. Dark-ness is star-ting to
po-ol un-der the tre-es, the cric-kets are tu-ning up, and it's so pe-ace-ful that for a mo-ment Wyndham
can al-most for-get that it's the end of the world.
Then the scre-en do-or claps shut be-hind the wo-man. Wyndham can tell right away that she's do-ne
so-met-hing to her-self, tho-ugh he co-uldn't tell you for su-re what it is: that ma-gic wo-men do, he
gu-es-ses. His wi-fe used to do it, too. She al-ways lo-oked go-od to him, but so-me-ti-mes she
lo-oked just flat-out ama-zing. So-me pow-der, a lit-tle blush. Lips-tick. You know.
And he ap-pre-ci-ates the ef-fort. He do-es. He's flat-te-red even. She's an at-trac-ti-ve wo-man.
In-tel-li-gent, too.
The truth is, tho-ugh, he's just not in-te-res-ted.
She sits be-si-de him, and all the ti-me she's tal-king. And tho-ugh she do-esn't say it in so many
words, what she's tal-king abo-ut is Re-Po-pu-la-ting the World and Re-estab-lis-hing Wes-tern
Ci-vi-li-za-ti-on. She's tal-king abo-ut Duty. She's tal-king abo-ut it be-ca-use that's what you're
sup-po-sed to talk abo-ut at ti-mes li-ke this. But un-der-ne-ath that is sex. And un-der-ne-ath that, way
down, is lo-ne-li-ness-and he has so-me sympathy for that, Wyndham do-es. Af-ter a whi-le, she
to-uc-hes Wyndham, but he's got not-hing. He might as well be de-ad down the-re.
"What's wrong with you?" she says.
Wyndham do-esn't know how to ans-wer her. He do-esn't know how to tell her that the end of the
world isn't abo-ut any of that stuff. The end of the world is abo-ut so-met-hing el-se, he do-esn't ha-ve a
word for it.
So, any-way, Wyndham's wi-fe.
She has anot-her bo-ok on her night stand, too. She do-esn't re-ad it every night, only on Sun-days.
But the we-ek be-fo-re the end of the world the story she was re-ading was the story of Job.
You know the story, right?
It go-es li-ke this: God and Sa-tan-the Ad-ver-sary, any-way; that's pro-bably the bet-ter
trans-la-ti-on-ma-ke a wa-ger. They want to see just how much shit God's most fa-ith-ful ser-vant will
eat be-fo-re he re-no-un-ces his fa-ith. The ser-vant's na-me is Job. So they ma-ke the wa-ger, and God
starts fe-eding Job shit. Ta-kes his ric-hes, ta-kes his cat-tle, ta-kes his he-alth. Dep-ri-ves him of his
fri-ends. On and on. Fi-nal-ly-and this is the part that al-ways got to Wyndham-God ta-kes Job's
child-ren.
Let me cla-rify: In this con-text "ta-kes" sho-uld be re-ad as "kills."
You with me on this? Li-ke Kra-ka-toa, a vol-ca-nic is-land that used to exist bet-we-en Java and
Su-mat-ra. On August 27, 1883, Kra-ka-toa exp-lo-ded, spe-wing ash fifty mi-les in-to the sky and
vo-mi-ting up fi-ve cu-bic mi-les of rock. The con-cus-si-on was he-ard 3000 mi-les away. It cre-ated
tsu-na-mis to-we-ring 120 fe-et in the air. Ima-gi-ne all that wa-ter cras-hing down on the flimsy
vil-la-ges that li-ned the sho-res of Java and Su-mat-ra.
Thirty tho-usand pe-op-le di-ed.

Every sing-le one of them had a na-me.
Job's kids. De-ad. Just li-ke 30,000 na-me-less Java-ne-se.
As for Job? He ke-eps sho-vel-ling down the shit. He will not re-no-un-ce God. He ke-eps the fa-ith.
And he's re-war-ded: God gi-ves him back his ric-hes, his cat-tle. God res-to-res his he-alth, and sends
him fri-ends. God rep-la-ces his kids. Pay at-ten-ti-on: Word cho-ice is im-por-tant in an
end-of-the-world story.
I sa-id "rep-la-ces," not "res-to-res."
The ot-her kids? They stay de-ad, go-ne, non-func-ti-oning, era-sed fo-re-ver from the Earth, just
li-ke the di-no-sa-urs and the 12 mil-li-on un-de-si-rab-les in-ci-ne-ra-ted by the Na-zis and the
500,000 sla-ugh-te-red in Rwan-da and the 1.7 mil-li-on mur-de-red in Cam-bo-dia and the 60 mil-li-on
im-mo-la-ted in the Mid-dle Pas-sa-ge.
That merry pranks-ter God.
That jokes-ter.
That's what the end of the world is abo-ut, Wyndham wants to say. The rest is just de-ta-ils.
By this po-int the wo-man (You want her to ha-ve a na-me? She de-ser-ves one, don't you think?)
has star-ted to we-ep softly. Wyndham gets to his fe-et and go-es in-to the dark kitc-hen for anot-her
glass. Then he co-mes back out to the porch and ma-kes a gin and to-nic. He sits be-si-de her and
pres-ses the co-ol glass upon her. It's all he knows to do.
"Here," he says. "Drink this. It'll help."

XXI - DAVID GRIGGA - SONG BEFORE SUNSET
It to-ok him three we-eks to find the sled-ge-ham-mer. He was hun-ting rats among the bro-ken
conc-re-te and rus-ted me-tal of an an-ci-ent su-per-mar-ket. The sun was be-gin-ning to des-cend over
the jag-ged ho-ri-zons of the city, cas-ting sha-dows li-ke gi-ant gra-ves-to-nes on-to the ne-arer
bu-il-dings. An ed-ge of black-ness had be-gun to cre-ep ac-ross the rub-ble that was all that
re-ma-ined of the sto-re.
He pic-ked his way ca-re-ful-ly from one pi-ece of conc-re-te to anot-her, skir-ting the twis-ted
me-tal, lo-oking for a ho-le or a co-ver that might ma-ke a su-itab-le nest for a bro-od of rats, he-re and
the-re using his stick to turn over a lo-ose chunk in the va-in ho-pe of fin-ding a can of fo-od
un-dis-co-ve-red af-ter ye-ars of lo-oting. At his wa-ist hung three lar-ge rats, the-ir he-ads squ-as-hed
and blo-ody from his stick. Rats we-re still fat and slow eno-ugh the-se days to be ca-ught by surp-ri-se
with a blow to the he-ad, which was for-tu-na-te, for his eye and his skill with the slings-hot he car-ri-ed
we-re not as they had on-ce be-en. He res-ted a whi-le, snif-fing at the cold wind. The-re wo-uld be a
frost to-night, and his bo-nes knew fe-ar of the cold. He was get-ting old.
He was sixty-fi-ve, and the ye-ars had star-ved him. The flesh of his yo-uth had lo-ose-ned and
sag-ged, le-aving his fra-me thinly dra-ped and his eyes sta-ring from his bony he-ad li-ke so-me
cu-ri-o-us troll.
He was sixty-fi-ve, and his ha-ir, gray many ye-ars ago, now ra-ised a whi-te ha-lo abo-ut his
le-at-her-col-la-red fa-ce. That he had sur-vi-ved so long was a won-der to him, for his ear-li-er ye-ars
had not pre-pa-red him for this pre-sent world. But so-me-how he had le-ar-ned to fight and kill and run
and all el-se that had be-en ne-ces-sary in the long ye-ars sin-ce the city had di-ed.
The days now, ho-we-ver, we-re not so fo-ul and des-pe-ra-te as they had on-ce be-en. Now it was
sel-dom that he fe-ared he wo-uld star-ve to de-ath. But in the bad days, li-ke many ot-hers, he had
eaten hu-man flesh.
His na-me was Par-nell and he had go-ne on li-ving. The sun was sin-king fast, and he tur-ned abo-ut
to go back be-fo-re the dark co-uld over-ta-ke him. It was as he tur-ned that he ca-ught the dull shi-ne
of me-tal in the cor-ner of his eye. He pe-ered mo-re clo-sely, put out his hand and he-aved a

sled-ge-ham-mer up from the rub-ble. He swung its mass ex-pe-ri-men-tal-ly, we-ig-hed it in his hands,
and felt its mo-ve-ment. Af-ter a mo-ment he was for-ced to put it down aga-in, as his arms be-gan to
tremb-le with unac-cus-to-med stra-in. But no mat-ter: gi-ven eno-ugh ti-me, he knew this was the to-ol
to re-ali-ze the ho-pe he had be-en hug-ging to him-self for three we-eks. He ti-ed the ham-mer
awk-wardly to his belt and be-gan to hurry ho-me, fle-e-ing the sha-dow of the city.
It was al-most dark when he re-ac-hed his ho-me, a we-at-her-sta-ined sto-ne ho-use hed-ged
aro-und with the tang-led jung-le of an overg-rown gar-den. In-si-de, he ca-re-ful-ly lit each of the
smoky cand-les in the li-ving ro-om, cal-ling up a can-ce-ro-us light that spre-ad re-lent-les-sly in-to the
cor-ners. His do-or was loc-ked and bar-red, and at last he sat in pe-ace be-fo-re the wo-od wor-med
pi-ano in the ma-in ro-om. He sig-hed a lit-tle as his fin-gers tap-ped at the yel-lo-wed and split-ting
keys, and felt an ac-cus-to-med sor-row as the frac-tu-red no-tes as-cen-ded. This pi-ano had per-haps
be-en a go-od le-ar-ner's inst-ru-ment in its day, but ti-me had not be-en kind to it. Even if he had not
fe-ared at-trac-ting the at-ten-ti-on of the dwel-lers in the dark out-si-de, the ef-fort of pla-ying was
mo-re agony than ple-asu-re.
Music had on-ce be-en his li-fe. Now his gre-atest aim was only to qu-i-et the rumb-ling of his belly.
Then he re-mem-be-red-his eyes drif-ted to the ham-mer he had fo-und in the rub-ble that day-and his
ho-pe ca-me ali-ve aga-in, as it had we-eks ago.
But the-re was no ti-me to dayd-re-am, no ti-me for ho-ping. The-re was ti-me be-fo-re he slept only
to cle-an and skin the rats he had ca-ught. To-mor-row he was to go tra-ding with the Tumb-le-down
Wo-man.
The Tumb-le-down Wo-man and her ma-te li-ved in the midst of a hund-red dec-re-pit trams in an
old de-pot. Why they cho-se to li-ve the-re was a puz-zle no-ne who tra-ded with her had ever
ma-na-ged to sol-ve. He-re she sta-yed, and he-re she tra-ded. Her sto-re co-un-ter was a so-li-tary
tram left on the ra-ils a few me-ters out-si-de the de-pot, its pa-int pe-eling away but still be-aring
pat-he-tic ad-ver-ti-se-ments of a lost age. Whi-le the out-si-de of the tram of-fe-red far-away
ho-li-days and bet-ter de-odo-rants, the Tumb-le-down Wo-man in-si-de tra-ded gar-ba-ge as the
lu-xu-ri-es of a world which had di-ed. In-si-de, ar-ra-yed along the wo-oden se-ats or hung from the
ce-iling we-re tin cans with ma-kes-hift hand-grips, gre-asy ho-me-ma-de cand-les, racks of sus-pect
ve-ge-tab-les grown no one knew whe-re, rows of de-ad rats, cats, rab-bits and the oc-ca-si-onal dog,
plas-tic spo-ons, bot-tles, co-ats of rat skin and all sorts of items sal-va-ged from the deb-ris of
oft-lo-oted shops.
The Tumb-le-down Wo-man was old, and she was black, and she was ugly, and she cack-led when
she saw Par-nell ap-pro-ac-hing slowly in the chill mor-ning. She had sur-vi-ved bet-ter than many men
thro-ugh the cri-sis, by be-ing mo-re ruth-less and mo-re cru-el than they had ever ma-na-ged to be to
her in the ye-ars be-fo-re. She rub-bed her hands to-get-her with a dry, dry so-und, and gre-eted
Par-nell with a fa-ded le-er.
"Two rats, Tumb-le-down Wo-man, fresh kil-led yes-ter-day," he ope-ned wit-ho-ut he-si-ta-ti-on.
"I gi-ve you so-met-hing go-od for them, Mr. Pi-ano Pla-yer" she sa-id. "Then that will be the first
ti-me ever. What?"
"A ge-nu-ine di-amond ring, twenty-fo-ur-ca-rat gold, see!" And she held the flas-hing gem to the sun.
Parnell didn't bot-her to smi-le at her ta-unt. "Gi-ve me fo-od, and be do-ne with yo-ur moc-king."
She sne-ered, and of-fe-red him a cab-ba-ge and two car-rots. Nod-ding, he han-ded her the
skin-ned corp-ses, lod-ged the fo-od in his bag, and tur-ned to go. But he was car-rying the
sled-ge-ham-mer at his si-de, and she stop-ped him with a yell. "Hey, pi-ano pla-yer man, that ham-mer!
I gi-ve you go-od fur co-at for it! Ge-nu-ine rab-bit!"
He tur-ned and saw that she was not moc-king him this ti-me. "When I've fi-nis-hed with it, may-be.
Then we’ll see."
His reply se-emed to ma-ke her ple-ased, for she grin-ned and yel-led aga-in: "Hey, pi-ano man, you
he-ar the news abo-ut Ol' Man Ed-monds? Them Van-dal-men co-me an' kill him, burn down that
bo-ok pla-ce Ol' Man Ed-monds li-ve in!"
Parnell gas-ped in shock. "The Lib-rary? They burnt the Lib-rary down?"

"That's right!"
"My God!" He sto-od, si-lent and be-wil-de-red for a long mi-nu-te as the Tumb-le-down Wo-man
grin-ned at him. Then, unab-le to spe-ak furt-her in his an-ger, he clam-ped his hands to-get-her in bit-ter
frust-ra-ti-on and wal-ked off.
The sled-ge-ham-mer was an awk-ward thing to carry. Slip-ped in-to his belt with the me-tal he-ad at
his wa-ist, the wo-oden hand-le be-at at his legs as he wal-ked. If he car-ri-ed it in his arms, his musc-les
pro-tes-ted af-ter no mo-re than a few mi-nu-tes, and he was for-ced to rest. He was get-ting old, and
he knew it. The sli-de to de-ath was be-gin-ning to ste-epen and he was not, he tho-ught, very far from
its end.
In slow, we-ary sta-ges he wal-ked the dis-tan-ce in-to the he-art of the corp-se that was the city:
Long ago its pul-se had stop-ped. He wal-ked past the rusty hulks of cars and along the dust-fil-led
tram-tracks, thro-ugh stre-ets of shat-te-red bu-il-dings stan-ding in rows li-ke jag-ged re-efs. Long ago
the lungs of the city had ex-pi-red the-ir last bre-ath; the tall chim-neys we-re fal-len, cas-ting scat-te-red
bricks ac-ross the ro-ad be-fo-re him.
He ca-me at last to the cent-re and fa-ced aga-in the strongly bar-red and se-aled do-ors of the old
City Hall, half bu-ri-ed in the rub-ble of its long-crumb-led ent-ran-ce-way.
Even if he had be-en ab-le to bre-ak open the bars of the do-or, he wo-uld ha-ve ne-eded to cle-ar
away the rub-ble to al-low the do-ors to open. Such was be-yond him.
But at the si-de of the bu-il-ding, the ske-le-ton of a truck lay cra-zily aga-inst the wall, mo-un-ted on
the pa-ve-ment and nuz-zled fa-ce to fa-ce with a tree that now ma-de a le-afy wil-der-ness of the cab.
Parnell clim-bed on-to the truck and ca-re-ful-ly as-cen-ded un-til he perc-hed with lit-tle com-fort on
a branch of the tree, clo-se to a bar-red win-dow. Three we-eks ago he had cle-aned away the gri-me
on the glass to see the dusty cor-ri-dors in-si-de. On the far wall of the cor-ri-dor was a di-rec-ti-on
sign, fa-ded and yel-lo-wed, but still be-aring the words: CON-CERT HALL.
Once aga-in, lo-oking at that dim sign, he was fil-led to overf-lo-wing with me-mo-ri-es of con-certs
he had gi-ven. His hands fol-lo-wed a me-mory of the-ir own on the keys, the mu-sic spi-ral-led and,
af-ter, the al-most in-vi-sib-le audi-en-ce in the dar-ke-ned hall ap-pla-uded aga-in and aga-in…
His me-mo-ri-es va-nis-hed as he swung the sled-ge-ham-mer from his sho-ul-der, jar-ring it in-to the
bars of the win-dow. Dust sho-we-red and ce-ment crumb-led. The task lo-oked easi-er than he had at
first tho-ught, which was for-tu-na-te, for the one stro-ke had we-ake-ned him ter-ribly. He swung
aga-in, and the bars mo-ved and bent. So-me-how, he fo-und the strength for anot-her swing, and the
bars buck-led and ca-me lo-ose and smas-hed thro-ugh the glass in-to the cor-ri-dor be-yond.
Triumph ca-me to him in a clo-ud of we-ak-ness, le-aving him gas-ping and his arms we-ak and
tremb-ling. He sat for a long mo-ment on the branch, ga-ining strength and ho-pe to ven-tu-re wit-hin.
At last he swung his legs over the ed-ge and drop-ped on-to the cor-ri-dor flo-or. Glass crack-led.
He re-ac-hed in-to his bag and bro-ught out a small cand-le and so-me pre-ci-o-us matc-hes. The box
of usab-le matc-hes had cost him ten rat skins at the Tumb-le-down Wo-man's tram two we-eks ago.
He lit the cand-le and yel-low light flo-oded in-to the dusty cor-ri-dor.
He wal-ked along it, ma-king fo-otp-rints in the vir-gin dust. A me-mory flo-ated back to him of
te-le-casts of mo-on exp-lo-rers, pla-cing fo-otp-rint af-ter fo-otp-rint in age-old lu-nar dust, and he
smi-led a grim smi-le.
Eventually he ca-me to a set of do-ub-le do-ors, bar-red and pad-loc-ked. He-re he was for-ced to
rest aga-in be-fo-re he co-uld smash the lock with his ham-mer, and step in-to the spa-ce-li-ke
black-ness be-yond.
After his eyes had adj-us-ted to the light of the cand-le, dim-med by the open spa-ce, he saw row
upon row of on-ce plush se-ats. So-mew-he-re a rat scur-ri-ed, and abo-ve he co-uld he-ar the soft
rust-le and squ-e-aks of what might be a bro-od of bats on the high ce-iling.
The ais-le stretc-hed be-fo-re him, slo-ping slightly down-wards. Par-nell wal-ked for-ward slowly,
kic-king up dust. In the dark im-men-sity of the hall, his cand-le was just a spark, il-lu-mi-na-ting only a
tight circ-le aro-und him and fil-te-ring thro-ugh puffs of dust stir-red by his pas-sa-ge.
On the sta-ge, me-tal gle-amed back ima-ges of the cand-le fla-me from scat-te-red cor-ners.

Aro-und him we-re the mu-sic stands and mu-sic she-ets of a full orc-hest-ra, fil-med with ye-ars of
dust. He-re was a half-ope-ned inst-ru-ment ca-se, and in it the still-shi-ning brass of a French horn,
aban-do-ned by so-me long-go-ne per-for-mer in for-got-ten has-te. And shro-uded in whi-te, top-ped
by a tar-nis-hed can-de-lab-ra, sto-od the grand pi-ano.
Parnell's he-art be-gan a he-avi-er, mo-re ra-pid be-at as he brus-hed dust from the she-et co-ve-ring
the pi-ano. With an an-xi-o-us hand he lit the can-de-lab-ra with his own me-ag-re cand-le, and lif-ted it
high as the light swel-led ac-ross the sta-ge. He co-uld see ot-her inst-ru-ments now, long lost by the-ir
pla-yers: he-re a vi-olin, the-re an oboe, cast asi-de by a ti-me that had ma-de the-ir pos-ses-si-on
unim-por-tant.
Placing the light on the flo-or, he ca-re-ful-ly eased the she-et from the pi-ano. Yel-low light dan-ced
on the black sur-fa-ce of po-lis-hed wo-od and spark-led in the brass.
For a long, long ti-me his aged hands co-uld do no mo-re than ca-ress the inst-ru-ment with a
gro-wing af-fec-ti-on. Fi-nal-ly, he sat on the pi-ano sto-ol, re-ali-zing per-haps for the first ti-me how
ti-red he was. The key, he saw with re-li-ef, was still in the lock. No do-ubt he co-uld ha-ve for-ced it,
but it wo-uld ha-ve bro-ken his he-art to ha-ve da-ma-ged that per-fect form.
Turning the key in the lock, he lif-ted the co-ver and ran his hand softly over the whi-te and black of
the pi-ano keys. He sat back, and with a self-cons-ci-o-usly wry ges-tu-re, flip-ped his rag-ged co-at
away from his se-at and tur-ned to fa-ce the hall.
A full ho-use to-night, Mr. Par-nell. All of Lon-don qu-e-u-es to he-ar you. The ra-dio sta-ti-ons are
pa-ying for-tu-nes to bro-ad-cast yo-ur con-cert. The audi-en-ce is qu-i-et, ex-pec-tant. Can you he-ar
them bre-at-he, out the-re? Not a co-ugh, not a sne-eze, not a mut-ter as they wa-it, hus-hed, to he-ar
the first no-tes drop from yo-ur fin-ger-tips. The mu-sic tremb-les in yo-ur hands, wa-iting to
be-gin-now!
Discords shat-te-red the empty hall, and the bats, dis-tur-bed, flew in a twit-te-ring crowd abo-ve the
de-ser-ted, rot-ting se-ats. Par-nell let out his bre-ath in a pa-in-ful sigh.
The inst-ru-ment wo-uld ha-ve to be pa-ins-ta-kingly re-tu-ned, no-te by no-te. His go-al had yet to
be re-ac-hed. But now, at last, he co-uld re-ach out and to-uch it. Now, one by one, he be-gan to
re-ali-ze the dif-fi-cul-ti-es that re-ma-ined. He felt his hun-ger and saw the cand-les bur-ning fast. He
co-uld pro-bably find pitch pi-pes in the hall, but he wo-uld ne-ed so-me kind of to-ol to tigh-ten the
strings of the pi-ano. And he wo-uld ha-ve to sup-port him-self so-me-how whi-le he spent his ti-me in
he-re and was unab-le to hunt or fo-ra-ge. He wo-uld ha-ve to go back to the Tumb-le-down Wo-man,
and see what she wo-uld of-fer him in tra-de for the sled-ge-ham-mer. It was no fur co-at he wo-uld be
get-ting, he knew.
Outside aga-in, he ope-ned his bag and to-ok out the fo-od he had bro-ught with him. He sat on the
truck eating pi-eces of ro-as-ted rat and raw cab-ba-ge, pon-de-ring whet-her the-re was so-me way he
co-uld net and kill so-me of the bro-od of bats wit-hin the hall. No do-ubt they wo-uld ma-ke cu-ri-o-us
eating, and per-haps the-ir le-at-hery wings might ha-ve a use. But all the-se sche-mes we-re
imp-rac-ti-cal, and he dis-mis-sed them.
In the dis-tan-ce, over the bro-ken bu-il-dings, a thin tra-il of black smo-ke was ri-sing le-isu-rely
to-ward the sky. The day had be-co-me bright and clo-ud-less, and the smo-ke was a sme-ar aga-inst
the blue. Puz-zled, Par-nell won-de-red what was bur-ning. The tra-il was too con-ta-ined to be a
fo-rest fi-re. Un-less so-me bu-il-ding had spon-ta-ne-o-usly ig-ni-ted, af-ter all the-se ye-ars, it had to
be the work of men. Unab-le to ar-ri-ve at any mo-re sa-tis-fac-tory a conc-lu-si-on, he tur-ned away,
thrus-ting the qu-es-ti-on from his mind.
After bund-ling away the rem-nants of the fo-od, he lo-osely rep-la-ced the bars of the win-dow to
ma-ke his entry less ob-vi-o-us to any pas-sing wan-de-rer. He-aving up the sled-ge-ham-mer, he
be-gan the long walk away from his he-art's de-si-re.
The Tumb-le-down Wo-man had tur-ned so-ur in the la-te af-ter-no-on, li-ke a fat black to-ad
bas-king in the last rays of the sun. She sat on the run-ning-bo-ard of the tram; gre-eted Par-nell with
lit-tle ent-hu-si-asm. Her wit-he-red hus-band now sat atop the tram and gla-red me-na-cingly at the
ho-ri-zon, an an-ci-ent shot-gun be-ne-ath his arm, ig-no-ring his wi-fe and Par-nell equ-al-ly.

Parnell sat and bic-ke-red with the wo-man for ne-arly an ho-ur.
She wo-uld still of-fer him the fur co-at, but he wan-ted an adj-us-tab-le wrench, cand-les, matc-hes,
and fo-od in exc-han-ge for the sled-ge-ham-mer, and the-se we-re ex-pen-si-ve items. In the end,
Par-nell ga-ve in and ac-cep-ted her fi-nal of-fer, which was everyt-hing he wan-ted ex-cept the fo-od.
The Tumb-le-down Wo-man hung the sled-ge-ham-mer in a pro-mi-nent po-si-ti-on wit-hin the tram
and ga-ve him the items he wan-ted. She tur-ned and lo-oked at him with a bit-ter eye. "You crazy,
pi-ano pla-yer man, you know that?"
Parnell, le-aning we-arily in the do-or-way of the tram, crad-ling his cand-les, was mo-ved to ag-ree
with her. "I sup-po-se you're right."
"Sure I'm right!" she ans-we-red, nod-ding her he-ad vi-go-ro-usly. "You a crazy co-ot."
"Must be crazy to co-me and tra-de with you," he sa-id, but the wo-man just gla-red at him. Then he
re-mem-be-red: "The-re was a lot of smo-ke in the so-uth this mor-ning. Do you know what it was?"
The Tumb-le-down Wo-man grin-ned and win-ked at him. "Su-re I know. Didn’t' I tell you this
mor-ning abo-ut them Van-dal-men? Them Van-dal-men co-ming all over this town now. Last we-ek
burn down Ol' Man Ed-monds and his bo-oks. Now it's that pic-tu-re pla-ce. Su-re crazy, them
Van-dal-men." And she put-te-red aro-und the tram, ar-ran-ging and re-ar-ran-ging her go-ods.
Parnell's he-art sank a lit-tle mo-re. "The Art Gal-lery?"
"'Yeah, that's what I he-ar. Lim-pin' Jack, he be-en so-uth this mor-ning, he told me. Them
Van-dal-men don't li-ke them bo-oks or them pic-tu-res, no way."
Parnell's an-ger war-med wit-hin him, only to turn in-to bit-ter frust-ra-ti-on for the lack of an obj-ect.
Most of the things he tre-asu-red had be-en dest-ro-yed du-ring the cri-sis. Now tho-se that we-re left
we-re go-ing the sa-me way, in sen-se-less dest-ruc-ti-on.
"What do they do it for?" he pro-tes-ted, sit-ting down in an empty se-at to stop him-self sha-king.
"What po-int is the-re in what they do?"
"Who ca-res?" sa-id the wo-man. "Can't eat them bo-oks, can't ke-ep warm in them pic-tu-res. Them
Van-dal-men crazy to burn them, su-re, but who ca-res?"
"All right," sa-id Par-nell, "all right." The ans-wers he felt wit-hin him wo-uld me-an not-hing to the
Tumb-le-down Wo-man. All he co-uld do was smot-her his loss and sor-row, hi-de it away. He
clenc-hed his jaws and we-arily pic-ked up his tra-des, pla-ced them in his bag and step-ped out of the
tram. The Tumb-le-down Wo-man watc-hed him go with a ti-red dis-gust. Her hus-band sat abo-ve,
gla-ring, gla-ring, at the dar-ke-ning ho-ri-zon, his gun be-ne-ath his arm.
Parnell spent the mor-ning of the next day hun-ting rats aga-in in the rows of ti-me-shat-te-red ho-uses
that still sto-od in uni-form li-nes to the west of the city. Af-ter a few ho-urs of va-in se-arch he was
lucky and fo-und a rab-bit war-ren rid-dling the soft earth in an overg-rown and enc-lo-sed back yard.
He ca-ught two surp-ri-sed rab-bits be-fo-re the ot-hers ran for sa-fety. He spent the rest of the
mor-ning cle-aning and ro-as-ting the rab-bits and sal-ting the-ir skins. In the af-ter-no-on he was aga-in
wit-hin the dark hall, be-gin-ning the long task of tu-ning each string of the pi-ano to a per-fect pitch. Had
he be-en a pro-fes-si-onal tu-ner, he wo-uld ha-ve be-en ab-le to pro-ce-ed with gre-ater spe-ed, but
he was for-ced to go at a frust-ra-ting cre-ep, ma-king tri-al-and-error de-ci-si-ons as he lis-te-ned to
each string, he-aring it in re-la-ti-on to the ot-hers he had tu-ned, lis-te-ning to the pitch pi-pes, then
tigh-te-ning the string aga-in with his rusty wrench.
He me-asu-red ti-me by the ra-te at which the smoky cand-les bur-ned, and left aga-in be-fo-re
dark-ness fell.
Days pas-sed in this way, un-til he co-uld hardly trust his he-aring and had to le-ave off for ho-urs at a
ti-me be-fo-re he co-uld re-su-me.
Every ti-me he emer-ged from the hall to eat or to let his eyes and ears re-pa-ir, the-re was smo-ke
so-mew-he-re on the ho-ri-zon. The-re ca-me a day when he was fi-nis-hed; when he had tes-ted the
pi-ano with sca-les and simp-le exer-ci-ses and was su-re the tu-ning was per-fect. He knew then that he
was af-ra-id to be-gin, af-ra-id to sit down and play a re-al pi-ece of mu-sic on the pi-ano. His hands still
re-mem-be-red his fa-vo-uri-te pi-eces but the-re was a hol-low fe-ar in his he-art that he wo-uld

fumb-le and dis-tort the mu-sic in so-me way. He had kept his hands strong, and his fin-gers lim-ber by
figh-ting the aged mons-ter of a pi-ano in his ho-use for all the-se ye-ars, but he co-uld not tell whet-her
or not he still re-ta-ined his skill. It had be-en a long ti-me.
Parnell ma-de his way out-si-de the hall and sat, des-pon-dent and tremb-ling, on the rusty,
overg-rown truck. It was early af-ter-no-on and, for the first ti-me in days, the-re was no smo-ke to be
se-en in the sky. He ate the last of the rab-bit and re-ali-zed he wo-uld ha-ve to go hun-ting the
fol-lo-wing day. He la-ug-hed at him-self for an old fo-ol, gul-ped wa-ter from his bot-tle, lit his cand-le,
and hur-ri-ed back in-si-de the hall, tra-iled by clo-uds of dust.
On the sta-ge he had cle-ared the mu-sic stands to one si-de, le-aving the grand pi-ano alo-ne and
unc-lut-te-red. Now he dus-ted the po-lis-hed sur-fa-ce one mo-re ti-me, buf-fed the brass let-te-ring,
ra-ised the lid, lit the can-de-lab-ra, and sat be-fo-re the key-bo-ard. The bats twit-te-red
tu-mul-tu-o-us ap-pla-use. He bo-wed his he-ad slightly to-ward the moth-eaten vel-vet of the empty
se-ats, and be-gan to play.
He be-gan with ii Be-et-ho-ven Pi-ano So-na-ta, Opus 109. It flo-wed; it swel-led; it po-ured from
the strings of that mag-ni-fi-cent pi-ano as his hands mo-ved and fell, re-mem-be-ring what his bra-in
was un-su-re of. And he knew, lis-te-ning, that he had not lost his skill, that so-me-how it had be-en kept
so-mew-he-re sa-fe wit-hin him, sle-eping thro-ugh the ye-ars of tor-ment. He wo-ve a web of mu-sic,
cast mo-ti-on and light and har-mony in-to the dark-ness, wrap-ped him-self wit-hin its so-und, and
pla-yed on. And as he pla-yed, he wept.
The pi-ece en-ded; he be-gan anot-her. And anot-her. Be-et-ho-ven, Mo-zart and Cho-pin we-re
re-sur-rec-ted. The mu-sic ex-pan-ded thro-ugh the ho-urs, a tor-rent of joy, of sor-row, and of
ye-ar-ning. He was blind and in-sen-sa-te and de-af to all but his mu-sic, in-su-la-ted from the out-si-de
world by the cast-le of so-und he was bu-il-ding aro-und him-self.
At last Par-nell stop-ped, his hands throb-bing and ac-hing, and ra-ised his eyes abo-ve the le-vel of
the pi-ano.
Standing be-fo-re him was a Van-dal. In his arms he crad-led the sled-ge-ham-mer Par-nell had
tra-ded to the Tumb-le-down Wo-man. The-re was blo-od on its he-ad.
The Van-dal sto-od and re-gar-ded him con-temp-tu-o-usly, all the ti-me stro-king, stro-king, the
shaft of the ham-mer he car-ri-ed. He was dres-sed in ro-ughly cu-red le-at-her and rus-ted me-tal.
Aro-und his neck he wo-re a do-zen me-tal neck-la-ces and cha-ins that dang-led on his ba-re and
ha-iry chest-cros-ses and swas-ti-kas, pe-ace symbols and fis-hes clin-king gently aga-inst each ot-her.
He was dirty, his ha-ir was gre-asy and awry, and on his fo-re-he-ad was bur-ned a V-sha-ped scar. He
stank.
Parnell was unab-le to spe-ak. Fe-ar had ma-de sto-ne of him and his he-art flop-ped aro-und
in-si-de him li-ke a gro-un-ded fish.
The Van-dal ut-te-red a ho-ar-se gig-gle, enj-oying the shock on Par-nell's fa-ce. "Hey, old man, you
play re-al pretty! Tell me now, Mu-sic Man, how well do you sing?"
Parnell's vo-ice was a rust-le in his thro-at: "I can't."
The Van-dal sho-ok his he-ad in mock sor-row. "That's too bad, Mu-sic Man. But I tell you, you're
gon-na sing re-al go-od when I'm fi-nis-hed with you. Re-al go-od and lo-ud." He shif-ted the
sled-ge-ham-mer to bring out a long kni-fe. It cast fi-ery gle-ams abo-ut the sta-ge as its ed-ge ca-ught
the cand-le-light.
Parnell felt as tho-ugh he was abo-ut to be sick but, in-sa-nely, his old an-ger grew in him even in the
fa-ce of his fe-ar. "Why?" he as-ked, his vo-ice tremb-ling. "Why do you want to kill me? What harm am
I do-ing you?"
The eyes of the Van-dal nar-ro-wed in con-cent-ra-ti-on and fi-er-ce hu-mo-ur. "Why? Why not?"
And the kni-fe flas-hed yel-low at Par-nell's eyes.
"All that you do… dest-ro-ying all the be-a-uti-ful things, the bo-oks, the pic-tu-res…" Par-nell was
be-co-ming ex-ci-ted in spi-te of his fe-ar: "Tho-se things are all we ha-ve left of our he-ri-ta-ge, our
cul-tu-re; of ci-vi-li-za-ti-on, of Man's gre-at-ness, don't you see? You're no mo-re than bar-ba-ri-ans,
kil-ling and bur-ning…" He stop-ped as the Van-dal wa-ved the kni-fe to-ward him, his fa-ce lo-sing its

mirth.
"You're pretty with yo-ur mu-sic and pretty with yo-ur words, but you talk a lot of shit. You know
what you’re pretty cul-tu-re ga-ve us? Ga-ve us dirt and figh-ting and eating each ot-her, man. You're
ni-ce and old, pretty man; you we-re old when the mur-de-ring and the hun-ger star-ted. Me and mi-ne,
we we-re just kids then. You know how it was for us? We had to run and hi-de so as not to be fo-od for
grown-ups; we had to eat dirt and scum to li-ve, man. That's what yo-ur pretty he-ri-ta-ge was for us,
pretty man, so don't bul-lshit me abo-ut how gre-at Man was, ca-use he ain't."
The Van-dal was le-aning over Par-nell, bre-at-hing his fo-ul bre-ath hard in-to the old man's fa-ce.
Par-nell grew si-lent as the Van-dal drew back and gla-red. "And you sit-ting he-re in the dark pla-ying
that ni-ce mu-sic-all you wish is that it was back the way it was! Well, me and mi-ne are ma-king su-re
that it ain't ne-ver back that way aga-in. Now you tell me, man, what go-od did that mu-sic, that
cul-tu-re, ever do, hey?"
Parnell's tho-ughts we-re tumb-ling. At last he sa-id simply: "It ga-ve pe-op-le ple-asu-re, that's all."
The Van-dal re-ga-ined his sne-er. "Okay, Mu-sic Man, kil-ling you is gon-na gi-ve me lots of
ple-asu-re. But first, man, it's gon-na gi-ve me re-al kicks to smash up this pretty mu-sic thing in front of
you just so you can enj-oy it too. How abo-ut that?" And, tur-ning, the Van-dal hef-ted the
sled-ge-ham-mer and ra-ised it high abo-ve the strings of the grand pi-ano.
Something snap-ped wit-hin Par-nell.
He le-apt up and gras-ped at the Van-dal's arms. Surp-ri-sed, he let the ham-mer drop. Par-nell
cla-wed at his fa-ce. The Van-dal swung out a ha-iry fist, catc-hing Par-nell a jar-ring blow on the jaw
and al-most stri-king him to the gro-und, but Par-nell's hands we-re abo-ut the Van-dal's thro-at.
Par-nell's hands we-re the only part of him that was not we-ak and tremb-ling-hands ma-de iron-firm by
de-ca-des of exer-ci-se on the key-bo-ard-and his thumbs we-re dig-ging in-to the Van-dal's
wind-pi-pe. The yo-uth be-gan to cho-ke, and tri-ed va-inly to te-ar Par-nell's hands away, but the
gnar-led fin-gers we-re loc-ked in a mur-de-ro-us grip; they tigh-te-ned with hyste-ri-cal energy. For a
se-emingly end-less mo-ment the two hung to-get-her in a bi-zar-re emb-ra-ce. Then the Van-dal
crump-led to the sta-ge, with Par-nell on top of him, throt-tling the li-fe from him, un-til the Van-dal was
de-ad.
Parnell let out a cho-king cry and retc-hed vi-olently over the ed-ge of the sta-ge. He cro-uc-hed on
his kne-es for so-me ti-me, trans-for-med by re-ac-ti-on and hor-ror in-to a mind-less ani-mal.
Even-tu-al-ly he tur-ned aro-und and sta-red with stran-ge emo-ti-on at the body of the Van-dal.
Out-si-de the hall, very fa-intly, he co-uld he-ar the yells and sho-uts of the rest of the pack of new
bar-ba-ri-ans as they bur-ned and lo-oted. In-si-de, the-re was only the qu-i-et of de-ath and the soft
twit-te-ring of the bats.
He craw-led to-ward the pi-ano whe-re the sled-ge-ham-mer lay. He sto-od, using the ham-mer as a
prop for his tremb-ling legs, then to-ok it in-to his arms.
With one an-gu-is-hed swing, he bro-ught the sled-ge-ham-mer cras-hing down in-to the pi-ano
strings.
The shock jar-red his who-le body. The strings snap-ped with vi-olent twangs and wo-od
splin-te-red, fil-ling the air with jag-ged so-und. The can-de-lab-ra, top-pling, plun-ged to the flo-or and
went out, spil-ling dark-ness thro-ug-ho-ut the hall.
The si-len-ce se-emed to last for a long ti-me.

"He was not as-sa-ul-ted by a ro-ving pack of fe-ral dogs."
Dale Ba-iley, "The End of the World As We Know It"
After three days and nights on the run du-ring which they slept in thirty, sixty, and ni-nety-mi-nu-te
snatc-hes, in the backs of lar-ge cars and SUVs, in a ho-tel lobby, in a spor-ting go-ods sto-re at one
end of a mall, they ma-na-ged to pull ahe-ad of the Pack who had be-en too clo-se from the start and
drawn clo-ser than that, des-pi-te Way-ne's traps, all of which we-re cle-ver and a few in-ge-ni-o-us
and the le-ast of which thin-ned the Pack by two or three, un-til Way-ne suc-ce-eded in lu-ring them
on-to the walk-way bet-we-en the fo-od co-urt and the mall's front ent-ran-ce, whe-re he de-to-na-ted
so-met-hing that not only drop-ped the flo-or out from be-ne-ath the Pack, but bro-ught the ro-of down,
too, ra-ining shards of glass li-ke so many eco-nomy si-zed gu-il-lo-ti-nes, Jac-kie had wan-ted to stay
and fi-nish the sur-vi-vors, but Way-ne had dec-la-red it was still too dan-ge-ro-us and ha-uled her out
the do-or.
Cross the Brid-ge, too con-ges-ted with cars for them to ta-ke the Je-ep Che-ro-kee Way-ne had
na-vi-ga-ted up the surp-ri-singly empty stretch of Ro-ute 9 bet-we-en the mall and the Mid-Hud-son
Brid-ge, which had ma-de them de-ba-te the pros and cons of con-ti-nu-ing north along this si-de of the
Hud-son un-til they re-ac-hed the next brid-ge, which might be cle-ar or might not (for on-ce, Way-ne
co-uldn't ma-ke up his mind), un-til Jac-kie in-sis-ted they might as well cross he-re as cross anyw-he-re:
the-re wo-uld be plenty of cars on the ot-her si-de, and if they didn't do so-met-hing, they we-re go-ing
to squ-an-der the-ir le-ad and fa-ce the Pack on the-ir terms (which, asi-de from that first, ter-rib-le
int-ro-duc-ti-on, they'd suc-ce-eded in avo-iding)-so they aban-do-ned the Je-ep, sho-ul-de-red the
back-packs, he-avy as ever (so much for ha-ving res-ted), and (the Brid-ge shif-ting un-der-fo-ot in the
wind that hum-med thro-ugh its cab-les li-ke a cho-ir war-ming up) wo-und the-ir way thro-ugh a
laby-rinth of ve-hic-les jam-med, it se-emed, in-to every pos-sib-le con-fi-gu-ra-ti-on, the-ir in-te-ri-ors
cho-ked with the over-si-zed, thick-stem-med purp-le flo-wers Jac-kie and Way-ne had fo-und in-si-de
the vast ma-j-ority of ve-hic-les they'd en-co-un-te-red thus far, wo-und aro-und ste-ering whe-els,
ge-ars-hifts, and pe-dals (the win-dows tal-ced with vi-olet pol-len), which ma-de ope-ra-ting the cars a
prob-lem they had ne-it-her to-ols nor ti-me to sol-ve-the-re was a pic-kup who-se cab was empty, but
it was bo-xed aga-inst the ra-iling by a trio of smal-ler cars, as if they'd bro-ught it to bay the-re.
Set up camp on the ot-her sho-re, on a led-ge over lo-oking the spot whe-re the Brid-ge slot-ted in-to
the ste-ep hills on the wes-tern sho-re of the Hud-son-Way-ne had no-ti-ced the shelf of rock as they
fol-lo-wed the ro-ad up and to the right, past anot-her clus-ter of cars full of purp-le flo-wers, po-in-ting
it out to Jac-kie, when they re-ac-hed a pla-ce whe-re the led-ge was ac-ces-sib-le from the ro-ad, up a
ste-ep path bloc-ked by a ga-te Way-ne was cer-ta-in he co-uld open, he had ste-ered them to-wards it
(even tho-ugh Jac-kie's legs tremb-led at the pros-pect of mo-re and har-der clim-bing), ur-ging her on,
mur-mu-ring en-co-ura-ge-ments, pra-ise, un-til they had ga-ined the top of the path and Way-ne had
sprung the lock on the ga-te, let them thro-ugh, and snap-ped the lock clo-sed aga-in be-hind
them-Jac-kie had fol-lo-wed him as he pic-ked his way ac-ross the rocks lit-te-ring the shelf; no mo-re
than fif-te-en fe-et at its wi-dest, she gu-es-sti-ma-ted; the Brid-ge re-tur-ning to vi-ew, and then
Way-ne had held up his hand as if he we-re so-me kind of na-ti-ve gu-ide sig-na-ling the rest of the
sa-fa-ri and sa-id that this wo-uld do and we-re pre-pa-ring an am-bush.
Wayne star-ting back along the led-ge al-most as so-on as they'd shuc-ked the-ir back-packs, ta-king
with him only the bulky black can-vas bag that Jac-kie tho-ught of so-me-ti-mes as his bag of tricks and
so-me-ti-mes as his uti-lity belt, and one of the pis-tols, le-aving the ot-her guns with her: the rif-le
who-se na-me she co-uldn't re-mem-ber but which Way-ne had be-en very ex-ci-ted to find in the
spor-ting go-ods sto-re, and the two re-ma-ining pis-tols, one of which had co-me from Way-ne's
fat-her's sa-fe, the ot-her from an empty po-li-ce cru-iser-"You don't ha-ve to co-ver me," he'd sa-id,
"but pay at-ten-ti-on," and she had, sit-ting with her bag prop-ped aga-inst the back-packs, the rif-le
res-ting aga-inst the do-me of her belly, as Way-ne ret-ra-ced the-ir ro-ute down the hill to the Brid-ge

and then out on-to it, to set up so-me trap that had oc-cur-red to him, may-be two if the-re we-re ti-me,
till he was lost to vi-ew, obs-cu-red by the le-an of the hill op-po-si-te her.
Jacqueline Ma-rie Di-Sal-vo: twenty ye-ars old; fi-ve fo-ot six, tall as her (most li-kely de-ad) fat-her;
she didn't know how many po-unds any-mo-re, sin-ce step-ping on sca-les hadn't be-en at the top of her
list of pri-ori-ti-es for so-me ti-me, now; her ha-ir dark brown, long eno-ugh not to lo-ok short; her eyes
brown, as well; her fe-atu-res ca-re-ful-ly pro-por-ti-oned, (once, her [de-ad] fat-her had desc-ri-bed
them to her as prim, which she hadn't be-en su-re how to ta-ke); her skin less tan-ned than she wo-uld
ha-ve ex-pec-ted, con-si-de-ring all the ti-me they'd spent out-do-ors this past month: much of it at night,
true, and the-re had be-en al-most a so-lid we-ek of ra-in in the mid-dle of it, but still; we-aring an
ext-ra-lar-ge men's whi-te cot-ton t-shirt, gray swe-at-pants, whi-te cot-ton ath-le-tic socks, and
knock-off Bir-kens-tocks that we-re com-for-tab-le but gro-wing too tight: aga-in, shoe shop-ping not a
pri-ority when you we-re run-ning (or wad-dling, in her ca-se) for yo-ur li-fe-fi-ve we-eks ago, she had
be-en thirty-fi-ve days less preg-nant, six and a half ins-te-ad of ne-arly eight months "along" (her [most
li-kely de-ad] doc-tor's fa-vo-ri-te eup-he-mism for preg-nancy, as if car-rying a child we-re an exo-tic
va-ca-ti-on): a dif-fe-ren-ce that me-ant, prac-ti-cal-ly spe-aking, a smal-ler sto-mach, smal-ler bre-asts,
smal-ler everyt-hing; smal-ler her, who didn't ti-re qu-ite so qu-ickly; who didn't fe-el so out of bre-ath
all the ti-me; who didn't sle-ep well but bet-ter than la-tely, when com-fort had ta-ken the last tra-in out;
who didn't ne-ed to stop to pee all the ti-me, whi-le Way-ne sto-od gu-ard, his gun out, his eyes
swe-eping wha-te-ver lands-ca-pe they we-re in for the ine-vi-tab-le (re)appe-aran-ce of the Pack sat
wa-iting for Way-ne.
Wayne Ant-hony Mil-ler: twenty ye-ars old, two days yo-un-ger than Jac-kie, in fact: she born on the
third of July, he the fifth; six fo-ot three; may-be one hund-red and se-venty po-unds, not yet grown out
of ado-les-cent gang-li-ness (his [most li-kely de-ad] mot-her's term, which he'd over-he-ard her use at a
New Ye-ar's party and which he'd con-fes-sed to Jac-kie left him fe-eling bet-ra-yed in so-me
fun-da-men-tal way); his hands and fe-et lar-ge, hung from long, skinny arms and legs that at-tac-hed to
a long, skinny tor-so; his ha-ir grown long, a light brown that had be-en blond un-til his te-ens, fra-ming a
bro-ad, squ-are fa-ce with a small no-se, nar-row eyes, and ge-ne-ro-us mo-uth; he was we-aring the
sa-me pa-ir of je-ans that had se-en him thro-ugh the last month, and which we-re lit-tle wor-se for
we-ar (what an ad cam-pa-ign: "Le-vi's: We'll Get You Thro-ugh the End of Ci-vi-li-za-ti-on: Ra-ted

the-re; his As-so-ci-ates Deg-ree in Li-be-ral Arts from Dutc-hess Co-unty Com-mu-nity Col-le-ge
comp-le-ted the pre-vi-o-us se-mes-ter; his fu-tu-re, which re-vol-ved aro-und dre-ams of wri-ting one
of the Bat-man tit-les, still, as he li-ked to put it, a work-in-prog-ress (this back when the fu-tu-re had
ex-ten-ded furt-her for-ward than the next twel-ve ho-urs, and be-en so-mew-hat mo-re comp-lex, yet
al-so so-mew-hat simp-ler, than trying to lo-ca-te fo-od and de-fen-sib-le shel-ter).
The Sun Was Hot ro-as-ting was a bet-ter word for it; alt-ho-ugh the-re was a subs-tan-ti-al bre-eze
blo-wing up from the ri-ver-Jac-kie sup-po-sed that the ex-po-sed rock aro-und her, a gra-yish, sharp
stuff that she sho-uld ha-ve be-en ab-le to na-me but who-se iden-tity ap-pa-rently lay in that part of her
me-mory mar-ked "No Lon-ger Use-ful," amp-li-fi-ed the he-at, which wasn't comp-le-tely
op-pres-si-ve (so-on, it wo-uld be, she wo-uld be pan-ting li-ke a dog with it, most li-kely fe-el the ur-ge
to strip down to her un-der-we-ar, but for the mo-ment it ra-di-ated thro-ugh her ple-asantly).
Later, the bet-ter part of two ho-urs; what had he be-en do-ing out the-re?
Wayne re-tur-ned wa-ving to her as he wal-ked off the Brid-ge; she wa-ved back long eno-ugh to
pick up so-me ro-pe dig-ging it out of his back-pack, a hefty co-il that lo-oked li-ke so-met-hing a
mo-un-ta-in clim-ber might use and that he had be-en happy to find in a hard-wa-re sto-re two we-eks
ago, which Jac-kie hadn't un-ders-to-od, sin-ce the ro-pe lo-oked pretty he-avy and she didn't see the
po-int in eit-her of them ta-king on any mo-re we-ight than was ab-so-lu-tely ne-ces-sary-alre-ady,

Way-ne was car-rying mo-re than his fa-ir sha-re to com-pen-sa-te for her; she didn't want him
ex-ha-us-ting him-self be-ca-use of an ina-bi-lity to pass on everyt-hing that might pro-ve use-ful
so-me-day-she hadn't sa-id anyt-hing out lo-ud, tho-ugh, and the ad-di-ti-on of the ro-pe se-emed to
ha-ve ma-de no sig-ni-fi-cant dif-fe-ren-ce to him and re-turn to the Brid-ge whe-re he strung the ro-pe
ac-ross the ro-ad, run-ning it back and forth and back and forth bet-we-en a pa-ir of the Brid-ge's
sup-port cab-les, we-aving a kind of imp-ro-vi-sed web that Jac-kie tho-ught wo-uld slow down the
we-akest mem-bers of the Pack for abo-ut half a se-cond, and that the le-ader and its (hers? his?)
com-pa-ni-ons wo-uld be thro-ugh in no ti-me at all.
When he was do-ne with his fi-nal trap which didn't lo-ok any mo-re imp-res-si-ve on-ce it was
fi-nis-hed than it had when Jac-kie had re-ali-zed what it was; alt-ho-ugh the-re was mo-re of it than she
had ex-pec-ted, a do-zen, may-be fif-te-en strands that Way-ne had la-ye-red ac-cor-ding to a de-sign
she co-uldn't dis-cern, so that so-me strands ran a fo-ot or mo-re be-hind the ot-hers-she hadn't exactly
do-zed whi-le he'd const-ruc-ted it: she'd kept her eyes open thro-ug-ho-ut the pro-cess, but her mind
had wan-de-red, as it had so of-ten in the last day and a half, to the baby, which had go-ne from what
she re-fer-red to as its da-ily ca-list-he-nics to comp-le-te stil-lness, not mo-ving at all that she co-uld
fe-el (and, at this sta-ge, she co-uld fe-el a lot) for ro-ughly thirty-six ho-urs, now, which might ha-ve
be-en en-ti-rely nor-mal for all she knew: the-re was a rat-her dra-ma-tic lack of obs-tet-ri-ci-ans in
the-se parts (ha ha) and whi-le Way-ne knew a surp-ri-sing amo-unt abo-ut all sorts of things, his
ex-per-ti-se ten-ded to-wards the ult-ra-vi-olent and not so much the who-le mi-rac-le-of-li-fe end of
the spect-rum-the best he co-uld do was he-ar her con-cerns, shrug, and tell her not to worry abo-ut it,
ad-vi-ce she'd al-re-ady gi-ven her-self and that was gro-wing im-pos-sib-le to fol-low-she co-uld fe-el
pa-nic gat-he-ring in-si-de her, co-ales-cing in-to a storm that wo-uld wash her away in a tor-rent of
te-ars and scre-aming, be-ca-use the child in-si-de her was de-ad, she was car-rying a de-ad baby-all
right, to be ho-nest, her mind hadn't wan-de-red so much as go-ne di-rectly to her an-xi-ety and
watc-hed it gro-wing-the po-int was, she wasn't su-re if Way-ne had rig-ged his web with any of the
exp-lo-si-ves (pro-per and imp-ro-vi-sed) that stuf-fed his bag of tricks, or if he had ot-her plans for his
over-si-zed Cat's Crad-le.
He ca-me back and a go-od thing, too, be-ca-use the sun had dip-ped be-hind the hill to her back,
and tho-ugh the sky over-he-ad was still blue, it was that dar-ker blue that wo-uld spend the next
co-up-le of ho-urs sha-ding ste-adily dar-ker, in-to that in-di-go that a month of lo-oking up at the night
sky had shown her was the ac-tu-al co-lor aga-inst which the stars sho-ne, and whi-le the Pack had
mo-re than pro-ved the-ir abi-lity to ap-pe-ar at any ti-me of day, the-re was no do-ub-ting they
pre-fer-red to mo-ve af-ter the sun was down, and alt-ho-ugh Jac-kie had tra-ined with the pis-tols, had
ope-ned up on one of the Pack at ter-rif-yingly clo-se ran-ge (it had scam-pe-red off, un-hurt), she'd had
a sing-le les-son with the rif-le (who-se na-me was on the tip of her mind) with it un-lo-aded, and had no
fa-ith in her abi-lity to get off mo-re than a sing-le shot, if that, which was not sa-ying anyt-hing abo-ut
her abi-lity to kill or even hit her tar-get, so when Way-ne ti-ed the fi-nal knot in his ro-pe bar-ri-er and
star-ted up the ro-ad, re-li-ef suf-fu-sed her, and bu-ilt a fi-re using wo-od he col-lec-ted from the tre-es
along the path up to the led-ge, a he-avy arm-lo-ad that he ar-ran-ged in-to a lar-ger fi-re than she
wo-uld ha-ve tho-ught wi-se, an al-most inexp-li-cab-le lap-se of Way-ne's part-unless he wan-ted to be
vi-sib-le; if so, it was a new stra-tegy for him: his pre-vi-o-us traps had de-pen-ded on mis-di-rec-ti-on,
on le-ading the Pack in-to thin-king the two of them we-re so-mep-la-ce they we-re sa-fely away from,
which had be-co-me inc-re-asingly dif-fi-cult as the Pack adap-ted to Way-ne's tac-tics-frankly, Jac-kie
had be-en shoc-ked that the mall trap had suc-ce-eded as well as it had, be-ca-use it had be-en so
ob-vi-o-us, as ob-vi-o-us as any of his early ef-forts, so much so that the Pack must ha-ve as-su-med (if
you co-uld apply such a word to them; tho-ugh they evi-dently had so-me pro-cess of cog-ni-ti-on) it
co-uldn't pos-sibly be a set-up, and so had wal-ked right in-to the mid-dle of it-strictly spe-aking, the-re
was no ne-ed for a fi-re, not yet, he-at po-ured up from the led-ge and wo-uld do so well in-to the night,
whi-le the Brid-ge's lights, a row of fla-me-sha-ped bulbs tra-cing the arc of each of the sus-pen-si-on
cab-les, had blin-ked on as the day-light eb-bed (one of tho-se in-ter-mit-tent events that in-de-xed the

ran-dom sta-tus of what she al-re-ady was re-fer-ring to her-self as the Old World's mac-hi-ne-ri-es),
the-ir bright glow tra-ver-sing the spect-rum from blue to red and back down to blue aga-in, the-ir light
suf-fi-ci-ent for Jac-kie to re-ad her bat-te-red copy of What to Ex-pect When You re Ex-pec-ting if
she wan-ted to (she didn't; she felt va-gu-ely gu-ilty abo-ut it, but she was too ti-red [and-tell the
truth-afra-id of what the bo-ok might tell her abo-ut the baby's stil-lness])-when you ca-me right down to
it, the fi-re was a be-acon and a go-ad, Way-ne's way of thum-bing his no-se at wha-te-ver mem-bers
of the Pack might ha-ve sur-vi-ved the mall and gu-iding them ac-ross the Brid-ge-as she rec-li-ned
aga-inst her back-pack and ac-cep-ted the pe-anut but-ter ba-gel Way-ne pas-sed her, Jac-kie
tho-ught, This re-al-ly is it, our last stand; af-ter fo-ur we-eks, we're ma-king our stand.
They ate din-ner in si-len-ce, the way they did prac-ti-cal-ly everyt-hing in si-len-ce, the last we-ek or
so-for-merly, Way-ne had be-en a tal-ker of epic pro-por-ti-ons, the kind of per-son you don't start a
con-ver-sa-ti-on with un-less you've got, say, three days to spa-re, which Jac-kie had fo-und mostly
char-ming, be-ca-use a lot of what he had to say was funny and in-te-res-ting, and if she rol-led her eyes,
it was only when he star-ted tal-king abo-ut wha-te-ver co-mic bo-ok he was cur-rently in-fa-tu-ated
with, which he co-uld and wo-uld do in mic-ros-co-pic, mind-num-bing de-ta-il-co-mics ne-ver had
in-te-res-ted her, the sec-ret exp-lo-its of men pla-ying dress-up in what was es-sen-ti-al-ly a
con-se-qu-en-ce-free are-na just hadn't ap-pe-aled; alt-ho-ugh the length and depth of desc-rip-ti-on
and analy-sis Way-ne la-vis-hed on them promp-ted her to se-cond-gu-ess her-self on-ce in a whi-le;
now, she wis-hed she had re-ad so-me of the tit-les Way-ne had rhap-so-di-zed abo-ut (The Dark
Knight Re-turns and Bat-man: Ye-ar One [but not The Dark Knight Stri-kes Aga-in, that was so much
overp-ri-ced crap] and The Sand-man and Johnny the Ho-mi-ci-dal Ma-ni-ac [who-se tit-le she wis-hed
she fo-und fun-ni-er]) or at le-ast pa-id bet-ter at-ten-ti-on to his lec-tu-res on them, be-ca-use they
might ha-ve hel-ped her un-ders-tand what had hap-pe-ned to Way-ne in the last month, sin-ce the
bot-tom had drop-ped out of the world, the le-ast ma-ni-fes-ta-ti-on of which was the drying up of the
tor-rent of words that po-ured from his mo-uth, and the most dra-ma-tic examp-le of which was…was
crazy, then cle-aned the guns one at a ti-me, Way-ne strip-ping each of the pis-tols in turn whi-le Jac-kie
tra-ined the rif-le on the ro-pe bar-ri-er, then the rif-le as Jac-kie aimed the po-li-ce-man's
auto-ma-tic-she co-uld ha-ve bro-ken each of the we-apons down, cle-aned and gre-ased them,
her-self: Way-ne had in-sis-ted she le-arn in ca-se anyt-hing hap-pe-ned to him (which was a joke: did
he re-al-ly ima-gi-ne that, at this sta-ge, big and awk-ward as she was, she'd get anyw-he-re wit-ho-ut
him? it was al-most funny: the hu-gely preg-nant wo-man, a smo-king gun in eit-her hand, figh-ting off the
Pack), but the thick smell of the gre-ase na-use-ated her, so she sto-od (rec-li-ned, ac-tu-al-ly) gu-ard
and let Way-ne do things the way he not-so-sec-retly wan-ted to and set-tled down for the night to wa-it
and sle-ep, him ta-king the first watch, her the se-cond-after she'd un-rol-led her sle-eping bag and used
her fe-et to push off her san-dals, she lo-oked at Way-ne, sit-ting on the ot-her si-de of the fi-re (to
which he'd ad-ded even mo-re wo-od, ke-eping it hot and bright), and as-ked, "When will they be
he-re?" to which Way-ne ans-we-red, "Hard to tell. If we're lucky, la-te mor-ning, early af-ter-no-on,"
which surp-ri-sed her: am-bush or not, last stand or not, she wo-uld ha-ve ex-pec-ted that, if the Pack
hadn't put in an ap-pe-aran-ce by first light, may-be a lit-tle la-ter, the two of them wo-uld aban-don
the-ir po-si-ti-on, which, for all its ad-van-ta-ges in terms of he-ight ("Cont-rol the high gro-und": how
of-ten had Way-ne re-pe-ated that?) was a de-ad-end: if the Pack ma-de it thro-ugh wha-te-ver
Way-ne had pre-pa-red for them on the Brid-ge, not to men-ti-on his imp-ro-vi-sed web, and sur-ged
up the ro-ad till they re-ac-hed the path to the led-ge, she and Way-ne wo-uld be trap-ped (vi-ola-ting
anot-her of his mant-ras, "Always ha-ve a way out"); bet-ter, she tho-ught, to ke-ep the-ir op-ti-ons
open and ret-re-at, trust Way-ne's in-ge-nu-ity to thin the Pack furt-her-all of which she sa-id to him, and
no-ne of which ma-de a dif-fe-ren-ce: "This is our best chan-ce," he sa-id, and whi-le she ar-gu-ed,
ap-pe-aling to her mant-ra, "He who fights and runs away, li-ves to fight anot-her day," Way-ne was
un-mo-vab-le, and any-way her eye-lids we-re sli-ding down, so she aban-do-ned her ar-gu-ment un-til
day-light and slid in-to her sle-eping bag.
Jackie's sle-ep was light, tro-ub-led be-ca-use sle-eping so-undly was im-pos-sib-le at this sta-ge of
preg-nancy; not on a rock shelf in a sle-eping bag, at le-ast; and be-ca-use her dre-ams we-re vi-vid and

dis-tur-bing; no surp-ri-se, so What to Ex-pect as-su-red her: preg-nant wo-men we-re su-bj-ect to all
kinds of an-xi-ety dre-ams, a ten-dency com-po-un-ded on her part by the last month's events, the long
strug-gle to ke-ep on the mo-ve and ahe-ad of the Pack, which had gi-ven her un-cons-ci-o-us a who-le
new vo-ca-bu-lary of une-ase and ter-rorShe was on that stretch of Ro-ute 9 whe-re all the cars; two, three do-zen; had co-me to a halt pretty
much si-mul-ta-ne-o-usly, with the ex-cep-ti-on of a black SUV that had crump-led the trunk of the red
se-dan in front of it-she and Way-ne pe-ering thro-ugh the cars' win-dows at the-ir in-te-ri-ors, every
one crow-ded by purp-le flo-wers, anyw-he-re from one to fo-ur per ve-hic-le, stalks thick and twis-ting
as sna-kes, blos-soms the si-ze of sunf-lo-wers, a kind of plant she'd ne-ver se-en, and whi-le she was
no ex-pert, bo-tany was a hob-by-each flo-wer an ac-cu-mu-la-ti-on of over-lap-ping pe-tals, va-gu-ely
ro-se-li-ke ex-cept that each pe-tal was fo-ur to six inc-hes long, ed-ges rag-ged, al-most ser-ra-ted,
and a uni-form eg-gplant hue; the flo-wers' cen-ters obs-cu-red by clus-ters of clo-sed pe-tals that
sug-ges-ted mo-uths pur-sed for a kiss, an ef-fect she fo-und suf-fi-ci-ently un-set-tling to drop her eyes
to the stems, pars-ley-gre-en, wo-ody, co-ve-red in co-ar-se ha-irs, fan-sha-ped le-aves tiny, al-most
ves-ti-gi-al-Jac-kie had stu-di-ed the plants, lo-oped aro-und ste-ering whe-els, ge-ars-hifts,
he-ad-rests, do-or hand-les, pe-dals, one anot-her, thro-ugh win-dows dus-ted with vi-olet pol-len, each
car a se-pa-ra-te ter-ra-ri-um, thin-king that no-ne of this ma-de any sen-se: the-re was no way for this
si-ze of plant to sur-vi-ve in this kind of en-vi-ron-ment, dep-ri-ved, as far as she co-uld see, of fo-od
and wa-ter-be-fo-re Way-ne co-uld stop her, she had grab-bed the do-or hand-le of the car she was
stan-ding next to so she co-uld open it and ta-ke a cut-ting from the flo-wer who-se blos-som pres-sed
aga-inst the win-dow li-ke a child's fa-ce pe-ering out; but the stem held the do-or clo-sed with
surp-ri-sing for-ce, so that the best she co-uld ma-na-ge was ope-ning the do-or a crack, not eno-ugh to
re-ach the plant, just suf-fi-ci-ent for a small clo-ud of pol-len to puff out-then Way-ne was the-re,
pul-ling her back from the car on-to the sho-ul-der, tho-ugh not be-fo-re she'd in-ha-led so-me of the
pol-len, fil-ling her no-se with the ast-rin-gent smell of la-ven-der, which lin-ge-red for the rest of the day
des-pi-te the fit of vi-olent sne-ezing it pre-ci-pi-ta-ted-she had be-en an-no-yed at Way-ne, not only for
be-ing so pat-ro-ni-zing, but for re-min-ding her that the-re wasn't much po-int in her ta-king a
cut-ting-what was she go-ing to do with it? she co-uld put it un-der a mic-ros-co-pe if they co-uld find
one, and then what? she was a col-le-ge juni-or ma-j-oring in Bi-ology and mi-no-ring in Psych: abo-ut
the best she'd be ab-le to do if she co-uld study a sli-de of a purp-le flo-wer wo-uld be to iden-tify it as a
plant-it wasn't as if she'd be ab-le to of-fer any in-sight in-to the-ir si-tu-ati-on-she had stal-ked away
from him as best she co-uld, and ans-we-red his re-gu-lar qu-es-ti-ons of how she was fe-eling with the
sa-me mo-nosyl-lab-le, "Fi-ne," which was pretty much true, ex-cept for the la-ven-der smell (but that
night she'd had dre-ams in which she was dri-ving and her skin, which was inc-re-dibly itchy, so much so
that she was fin-ding it dif-fi-cult to con-cent-ra-te on the ro-ad, be-gan to crumb-le be-ne-ath her

Way-ne wo-uld ra-ce back to his un-der-si-zed car and ta-ke away wha-te-ver ca-tast-rop-he
at-ten-ded him, un-til she he-ard Glenn's slur-red in-sis-ten-ce that he was co-ming, for Christ's sa-ke,
ke-ep yo-ur shirt on, so she cros-sed to the do-or, which Way-ne had not stop-ped po-un-ding on, fully
in-ten-ding to tell him to le-ave, wha-te-ver it was, it wasn't the-ir prob-lem (ama-zing to think that she
co-uld so comp-le-tely turn her back on Way-ne, whom she'd desc-ri-bed as her best guy fri-end; af-ter
Glenn, of co-ur-se; for ye-ars), but the ins-tant she tur-ned the lock, the do-or le-apt open and Way-ne
was in-si-de the ho-use, sho-uting that she had to le-ave, now, the-re was no ti-me-Jac-kie re-gis-te-red
his smell, first, a he-avy blend of cop-per and al-ka-li: blo-od and fe-ar, she re-ali-zed as she to-ok in his
clot-hes, plas-te-red and clot-ted with blo-od and ot-her things (was that a pi-ece of bo-ne? that pink
clump-)-This was al-re-ady bad, and fi-nal-ly his words re-sol-ved them-sel-ves in-to sen-se and she
pla-ced her hand on his arm, win-cing at the blo-od still fresh to the to-uch (what had hap-pe-ned to
him?), tel-ling him to re-lax, calm down, it was all right; but no-ne of her re-as-su-ran-ces re-ac-hed him,
he kept in-sis-ting they had to go and grab-bed her by the arm, which was when Glenn fo-und the top of
the sta-irs and who knew what he saw? the guy he'd ne-ver stop-ped wor-rying abo-ut, the so-ur-ce of
his an-xi-eti-es abo-ut the-ir re-la-ti-ons-hip, co-me to carry Jac-kie away at last-she sho-uld ha-ve
an-ti-ci-pa-ted what ca-me next, but des-pi-te his mac-ho pos-tu-ring, Glenn al-ways had se-emed to

her fun-da-men-tal-ly gent-le, pe-ace-ful; still, the-re was not-hing li-ke a qu-art of gin-and-to-nic to put
you in to-uch with yo-ur in-ner li-ne-bac-ker, which he pro-ved by bar-re-ling ac-ross the ro-om,
catc-hing Way-ne aro-und the mid-dle, and slam-ming him in-to the wall with suf-fi-ci-ent for-ce to drop
them both to the flo-or-Way-ne kept hold of Jac-kie as long as he co-uld, tumb-ling her back-wards
on-to the co-uch-now Glenn was co-ve-red in go-re, too, and ra-ising his fist to pum-mel Way-ne, who
ma-na-ged to wed-ge a leg bet-we-en the two of them and kick Glenn off him, al-most to the top of the
sta-irs-Jac-kie, her hands pres-sed over her sto-mach, was sho-uting for the two of them to stop it, this
was ri-di-cu-lo-us, but Way-ne hadn't li-ked Glenn any mo-re than Glenn had him; je-alo-us, she knew,
alt-ho-ugh she'd do-ne her best to ig-no-re the re-asons fu-eling that je-alo-usy-the two of them rus-hed
to-get-her and went down in a tang-le of arms and legs, grun-ting and cur-sing each ot-her, and Jac-kie
tho-ught, Gre-at: watch Mom and Dad co-me ho-me, now-then the pic-tu-re win-dow exp-lo-ded
in-wards and a mas-si-ve, snar-ling sha-pe was stan-ding in the li-ving ro-om, sha-king glass off it-self

fo-ur fe-et at the sho-ul-der, with a hump that arc-hed its back anot-her fo-ot over that, its he-ad big as a
Thanks-gi-ving tur-key, its fe-et the si-ze of di-ner pla-tes; and to think si-mul-ta-ne-o-usly, What's a
hye-na do-ing in ups-ta-te New York? and This is no hye-na-be-fo-re it po-un-ced on Glenn, who
had pa-used, arm up-ra-ised, when the win-dow blew in-the thing ca-ught his ex-ten-ded arm in its blunt
jaws and to-re it off at the sho-ul-der: the crack and snap of bo-ne and rip of si-new com-bi-ning with
the jet of blo-od and the scre-am from Glenn's thro-at and the growl from the thing's, a bass ro-ar with
the shri-ek of a vi-olin on top of it-the thing held Glenn's arm dang-ling from its mo-uth li-ke a puppy with
a chew toy, then tos-sed the arm to one si-de with a flick of its he-ad and lun-ged at him, whi-le Way-ne
scramb-led out of the way, his fa-ce blank with ter-ror, and Jac-kie jo-ined her scre-am to Glenn's as the
thing bul-led him back aga-inst the wall and se-ized his he-ad bet-we-en its te-eth, his vo-ice clim-bing
re-gis-ters she wo-uldn't ha-ve tho-ught pos-sib-le, su-rely his vo-cal cords wo-uld ha-ve to gi-ve

a pop and crunch li-ke an egg sur-ren-de-ring to the pres-su-re of a hand; and Glenn's scre-am
stop-ped; alt-ho-ugh Jac-kie's con-ti-nu-ed, po-uring out her hor-ror at what she was watc-hing at the
top of her lungs-even when Way-ne fo-und his fe-et, stumb-led ac-ross the li-ving ro-om to her, right
past whe-re the thing was busy fe-eding, al-most slip-ped on a lar-ge pi-ece of glass, to-ok her hand,
and star-ted pul-ling her to the front do-or, which was still open, only to stop as a new so-und flo-oded
the air, a high-pitc-hed ca-cop-hony li-ke an orc-hest-ra out of tu-ne, and dark sha-pes (who knew how
many? twenty? thirty? mo-re?) gal-lo-ped up the ro-ad, al-most to the end of her dri-ve-way-Way-ne's

from the front do-or, ac-ross the li-ving ro-om (the thing grow-ling and snap-ping at them, and, Oh My

tur-ning her ho-use in-to a bomb, which had re-du-ced the Pack's ranks by at mi-ni-mum a half, may-be
sixty per-cent, to the pre-vi-o-us day, when he'd lu-red one of the Pack's out-ri-ders in-to the walk-in
fre-ezer at a McDo-nald's and trap-ped it the-re-it was just, the-re was an ele-ment of the
per-for-ma-ti-ve to Way-ne's ac-ti-ons, as if he we-re se-e-ing him-self do-ing wha-te-ver he was
do-ing in the pa-nels of a co-mic, il-lust-ra-ted by one of his fa-vo-ri-te ar-tists-the last we-ek and a
half's events had da-ma-ged Way-ne in ways you didn't ne-ed a deg-ree in Psych to no-ti-ce (altho-ugh
you wo-uld ne-ed a post-doc to plumb the-ir depths)-she might be over-re-ac-ting to the chan-ges he'd

but she was un-com-for-tably cer-ta-in Way-ne had de-ve-lo-ped a split in his per-so-na-lity, pos-sibly
a ro-ugh re-or-ga-ni-za-ti-on of his psyche that al-lo-wed him ac-cess to are-as of his self pre-vi-o-usly
ro-ad-bloc-ked by norms of upb-rin-ging, so-ci-ety, and re-li-gi-on, pos-sibly an en-ti-rely se-pa-ra-te

might be the re-ason for her imp-res-si-on that, uni-ma-gi-nab-le psychic tra-uma and con-ti-nu-ing

the ed-ge of the ro-om's sink, for the blo-od, and had him hold the flash-light with his free hand-he wasn't
happy abo-ut ha-ving to put down the guns, but in the ab-sen-ce of any bet-ter so-ur-ce of light (the-re
was no skylight in this ro-om) the-re was no ot-her op-ti-on; he set-tled for ba-lan-cing the pis-tols on
the op-po-si-te si-de of the sink and inst-ruc-ting her to duck if anyt-hing ca-me thro-ugh the do-or,
which she as-su-red him wo-uld not be a prob-lem-she rin-sed the scab on his arm with sa-li-ne, to
mo-is-ten and lo-osen it, and went to work with the scal-pel and pro-be, fla-king away the crus-ted
blo-od, easing the scal-pel un-der mo-re stub-born patc-hes and le-ve-ring them off, Way-ne gas-ping
as they to-re away; on-ce the wo-und was ex-po-sed, she used half a bot-tle of sa-li-ne to ir-ri-ga-te it,
was-hing out as-sor-ted pi-eces of deb-ris in the pro-cess, and had Way-ne bring the flash-light in
clo-se, so that she co-uld study the cut, tes-ting it as gently as she co-uld with the pro-be, which ma-de
the light qu-iver, aban-do-ning the pro-be for a pa-ir of ne-ed-ling twe-ezers she used to pop a poc-ket
of pus and lift a pi-ece of so-met-hing out of it (which she tho-ught was a frag-ment of one of the Pack's
te-eth, and which she wo-uld ha-ve lo-ved the chan-ce to exa-mi-ne in gre-ater de-ta-il, but which she
didn't men-ti-on to Way-ne, sin-ce he'd only re-mind her that she was a Bi-ology stu-dent, not a
world-re-now-ned sci-en-tist who might be ab-le to le-arn so-met-hing help-ful from the samp-le), af-ter
which she rin-sed the pus out, sur-ve-yed the arm one mo-re ti-me, was sa-tis-fi-ed, squ-e-ezed a
he-avy stre-am of an-ti-bi-otic cre-am over the wo-und, and be-gan ban-da-ging it-Jac-kie had do-ne
her best not to lo-ok at Way-ne's fa-ce as she was wor-king, not wan-ting her fo-cus to be
comp-ro-mi-sed by the pa-in she knew she'd find twis-ting its fe-atu-res, but with his arm cle-aned and
ten-ded to the best of her abi-lity, not to men-ti-on eno-ugh drugs to knock out any lin-ge-ring
in-fec-ti-on, she re-la-xed and glan-ced at him, smi-ling-to le-ap back with a shri-ek at what she saw:
Way-ne's fa-ce go-ne from the mo-uth up, shro-uded in he-avy oily black-ness, as if so-me-one had
dum-ped a can of black pa-int over his he-ad; ex-cept that, ins-te-ad of run-ning down his skin, this was
sta-ying in pla-ce-Jac-kie back-pe-da-led out of the ro-om, in-to the hall, col-li-ding with one of the
walls, Way-ne fol-lo-wing, sa-ying, "What? What is it?" po-in-ting the flash-light at her, then up and
down the hall, then back to her, the gla-re daz-zling, re-du-cing him to a sil-ho-u-et-te; des-pi-te which,
she co-uld see so-met-hing be-hind and abo-ve him, a clo-ud of black-ness, bil-lo-wing out li-ke a ca-pe
or a pa-ir of wings-she held one hand over her sto-mach, the ot-her over her eyes as Way-ne fi-nal-ly
lo-we-red the flash-light be-am to the gro-und, still as-king what it was, what was wrong, and when she
ris-ked a lo-ok at his fa-ce, it was cle-ar of wha-te-ver she'd wit-nes-sed (if it had be-en the-re to be-gin
with), nor was the-re anyt-hing be-hind him-she drop-ped her hands, wa-ving his con-ti-nu-ing
qu-es-ti-ons away with, "Sor-ry-I just fre-aked out," a res-pon-se she knew didn't sa-tisfy him but that
he was wil-ling to let stand in the in-te-rest of ma-in-ta-ining the-ir le-ad on the Pack-so far as she co-uld
tell, he didn't sus-pect she'd se-en what she had-wha-te-ver it was-].
In the early mor-ning, three thirty, Way-ne wo-ke her for the se-cond watch which Jac-kie spent

sit-ting clo-se to the fi-re, di-ed to a he-ap of em-bers, wrap-ped in her sle-eping bag, be-ca-use the
night had tur-ned col-der than she'd ex-pec-ted, col-der than any re-cently (fo-re-cast of an early
win-ter?), the rif-le who-se na-me she had me-ant to ask Way-ne, to sa-tisfy her cu-ri-osity, on the
gro-und be-si-de her; alt-ho-ugh every fif-te-en mi-nu-tes or so she'd pick it up and swe-ep the end of
the Brid-ge with the te-les-co-pic sight, Way-ne's ro-pe trap jum-ping in-to fo-cus, but all she saw we-re
the co-up-le of cars be-yond the trap on the Brid-ge, who-se lights con-ti-nu-ed the-ir climb up and
down the spect-rum, blue to red to blue aga-in-she chec-ked
Wayne, too: as-le-ep, so far as she co-uld tell, in his sle-eping bag-her dre-aming still clin-ging to her,
Jac-kie fo-und her-self, not for the first ti-me, trying to ima-gi-ne what had hap-pe-ned to him,
spe-cu-la-ting on the tec-to-nic shifts in his psychic ge-og-raphy-he had re-fu-sed to nar-ra-te what had
ta-ken pla-ce be-fo-re he fled to her ho-use, who-se blo-od and go-re had be-en spat-te-red over him,
but she knew that his mot-her sta-yed at ho-me, and chan-ces we-re go-od that his fat-her and
yo-un-ger sis-ter wo-uld ha-ve be-en the-re with her; sin-ce he wo-uldn't ans-wer her qu-es-ti-ons
abo-ut any of them, it se-emed li-kely that they we-re de-ad, that the Pack had burst in on Way-ne and
his fa-mily and torn them to pi-eces in front of him-which beg-ged the qu-es-ti-on, How had he
es-ca-ped? (not to men-ti-on, Whe-re had the Pack co-me from in the first pla-ce?)-she sus-pec-ted the
ans-wer was so-me va-ri-ety of chan-ce, dumb luck: may-be the Pack had co-me in thro-ugh the back
of Way-ne's ho-use, al-lo-wing him to run out the front do-or; may-be he'd fal-len down the ba-se-ment
sta-irs and be-en ab-le to sne-ak out the ga-ra-ge; it was pos-sib-le his fat-her or mot-her had cre-ated
a di-ver-si-on, sac-ri-fi-ced them-sel-ves to al-low him to re-ach his car-that kind of tra-uma,
com-bi-ned with anot-her clo-se brush with the Pack in the form of the one that had kil-led Glenn, must
ha-ve ina-ugu-ra-ted so-me com-pen-sa-tory pro-cess, jury-rig-ged the freshly frac-tu-red frag-ments of
his mind in-to an ar-ran-ge-ment that wo-uld let him sur-vi-ve; and yes, she was awa-re that she was
desc-ri-bing the un-plot of any num-ber of su-per-he-ro-es' ori-gins, the gri-evo-us psychic wo-und that
gi-ves ri-se to the cos-tu-med al-ter-ego, both ans-wer to and con-ti-nu-ing symptom of the tra-uma, but
per-haps Way-ne had re-ac-hed for that temp-la-te to ke-ep what was left of his cons-ci-o-us-ness from
flying off in all di-rec-ti-ons-how she wis-hed she'd ta-ken that class in Ab-nor-mal Psych this past
se-mes-ter, ins-te-ad of put-ting it off for a fu-tu-re that hadn't co-me; alt-ho-ugh, wo-uld anyt-hing she
wo-uld ha-ve co-ve-red in an un-derg-ra-du-ate class ha-ve equ-ip-ped her for this? and, mo-re to the
po-int, what was she lo-oking for? to un-ders-tand Way-ne, or to try to cu-re him, which wo-uld
con-sist of what, exactly? re-tur-ning him to the calm, tal-ka-ti-ve guy she'd known half a mil-li-on ye-ars

alt-ho-ugh she men-ti-oned ne-it-her na-me to him), who ap-pa-rently re-mem-be-red every trick and

wha-te-ver the oily sha-dow that had mas-ked his fa-ce, stretc-hed be-hind him li-ke a clo-ak, was,
be-ca-use ho-we-ver much she'd do-ne her best to con-vin-ce her-self that she'd un-der-go-ne so-me

tho-ught might ha-ve be-en drawn out from whe-re-ver it hid by his pa-in, by the stress of ha-ving to
hold the flash-light on the wo-und Jac-kie had re-ope-ned and pic-ked thro-ugh-in the two and a half
we-eks sin-ce, she'd kept on the lo-oko-ut for it, but the clo-sest she'd co-me to se-e-ing it aga-in had
be-en last we-ek, when she'd awa-ke-ned from yet anot-her dre-am of Glenn's dying scre-am to see
Way-ne le-aning aga-inst the wall op-po-si-te her, an enor-mo-us sha-dow spraw-ling be-hind him-she'd
sat up, he-art jol-ting, only to dis-co-ver it was a trick of the light (she tho-ught)-so far, Way-ne hadn't
shown the sligh-test sign that he knew that she knew; alt-ho-ugh, how co-uld she be su-re? and she
won-de-red if he we-re even awa-re of the dark-ness sha-do-wing him-it was funny: you wo-uld ha-ve
tho-ught that he-re, now, in the co-untry of fun-da-men-tal things, she wo-uld ha-ve be-en ab-le to turn
to Way-ne and ask him what was go-ing on, and he wo-uld be ab-le to ans-wer her as di-rectly, but no,

she co-uldn't risk ali-ena-ting him, ma-king him fe-el she'd dis-co-ve-red a sec-ret he wis-hed to ke-ep
con-ce-aled, be-ca-use what wo-uld she do if he aban-do-ned her?-it was li-ke when she'd le-ar-ned
de-fi-ni-tely that she was preg-nant, a pa-le blue plus con-fir-ming what her sto-mach had be-en tel-ling
her for we-eks: you wo-uld ha-ve ex-pec-ted the gra-vity of the si-tu-ati-on to ha-ve com-pel-led her
and Glenn, her and her pa-rents, to talk abo-ut what mat-te-red, but the op-po-si-te had be-en the
ca-se: Glenn hadn't be-en ab-le to bring him-self to say anyt-hing, as if he we-re af-ra-id that put-ting
words to the-ir si-tu-ati-on wo-uld be an ir-ret-ri-evab-le ad-mis-si-on on his part, and so had
ret-re-ated be-hind va-gue as-su-ran-ces and trying to ha-ve sex even mo-re, sin-ce the-re was no

com-mu-ni-ca-ti-on al-most ex-po-nen-ti-al-ly mo-re im-pos-sib-le-all Jac-kie co-uld say with any

Way-ne had di-ver-ted them-sel-ves by in-ven-ting exp-la-na-ti-ons for what had be-fal-len the world,
the mo-re fan-ci-ful, the bet-ter: God had de-ci-ded that the apo-calyp-se pro-po-sed in Re-ve-la-ti-on
wasn't suf-fi-ci-ently au co-urant and so had pil-la-ged pa-per-back thril-lers for so-met-hing with mo-re

of Earths, each of them ra-di-cal-ly dif-fe-rent, and everyt-hing had be-co-me tang-led (Way-ne had
co-ined the term "qu-an-tum rup-tu-re" for this sce-na-rio); the col-lec-ti-ve un-cons-ci-o-us, the
Spi-ri-tus Mun-di, had burst, dis-gor-ging night-ma-res by the sco-re-at one po-int, ex-ci-ted by what
had felt li-ke the re-sur-gen-ce of the old Way-ne, the one with whom she co-uld talk abo-ut anyt-hing,
Jac-kie had tri-ed to ver-ba-li-ze the fe-eling that had re-fu-sed to aban-don her sin-ce the
ca-tast-rop-hes had be-gun: that so-me-how all of this was con-tin-gent, no-ne of the chan-ges that had
con-tor-ted the world per-ma-nent, not yet-the best she co-uld ma-na-ge to exp-la-in the sen-sa-ti-on
was to com-pa-re it to the way she'd felt af-ter her best girlf-ri-end, Ela-ine Brown, had be-en kil-led by
a drunk dri-ver on her way ho-me from her job at Dun-kin' Do-nuts the ye-ar be-fo-re: for abo-ut a day

af-ter her pa-rents had sat her down at the kitc-hen tab-le to tell her, Jac-kie had be-en ab-so-lu-tely
con-vin-ced that Ela-ine's de-ath was not yet set in sto-ne, that the-re was so-me way for her to chan-ge
things, if only she co-uld fi-gu-re out what it was-she'd be-en in shock, yes, but it was as if that blow to
her system had bro-ught her tem-po-ra-rily clo-ser to the mac-hi-nery of the world, al-lo-wed her to
fe-el the pe-eling away of this co-ur-se of events from ot-her pos-si-bi-li-ti-es-the sen-sa-ti-on she had
now was dif-fe-rent mostly in terms of mag-ni-tu-de and du-ra-ti-on: when Ela-ine had be-en kil-led, it
had be-en li-ke stan-ding next to a small mo-tor, a mo-torcyc-le, say, for twenty-fo-ur ho-urs or so; this
was li-ke stan-ding be-si-de ra-il-ro-ad tracks whi-le a three-engi-ne fre-ight tra-in rumb-led past, night
and day, for we-eks-Way-ne had na-med the fe-eling "qu-an-tum di-ver-gen-ce," (an aw-ful lot of
qu-an-ta flying aro-und that day), which so-un-ded imp-res-si-ve but didn't re-al-ly me-an what he

con-ver-sa-ti-on had mo-ved on to ot-her to-pics, to the baby, and how much lon-ger till Jac-kie was
due, and what we-re they go-ing to do when she was re-ady to gi-ve birth?-at the ti-me, she'd ho-ped
they'd be ab-le to use the fa-ci-li-ti-es at Vas-sar Hos-pi-tal, at which, at the ra-te they we-re go-ing, she
pro-j-ec-ted they'd ar-ri-ve aro-und the ti-me the baby was abo-ut to co-me, and if the Pack had be-en
de-fe-ated, kil-led by then, the-re wo-uld be no re-ason they co-uldn't set up camp in it; the-re was a lot
to be sa-id for sta-ying in a hos-pi-tal-but they had fled up Ro-ute 9 fas-ter than she'd an-ti-ci-pa-ted;

hand rub-bing her sto-mach in bro-ad circ-les, as if it we-re a lamp and she sum-mo-ning the ge-nie; Be
all right, she told the baby, be all right-fun-ny, how much you co-uld want so-met-hing that

in-to kicks and jabs and using her blad-der as a per-so-nal tram-po-li-ne-the emo-ti-on that had grown
up in res-pon-se to her preg-nancy had be-en dif-fe-rent than what she'd ex-pec-ted: the-re had be-en
no-ne of the tre-acly sen-ti-men-ta-lity she'd be-en su-re wo-uld ooze thro-ugh her; ins-te-ad, what had
spro-uted in her had be-en mo-re ba-sic, pri-mi-ti-ve, even, a de-ep con-nec-ti-on to the child pus-hing
out her belly, as if she co-uld fe-el the um-bi-li-cus tying them to-get-her-the emo-ti-on had be-en

Just be-fo-re dawn, the sky fil-ling with light, in-di-go pa-ling to dark blue, the fa-in-test stars fa-ding
out, The Pack Ca-me, the-ir ar-ri-val he-ral-ded by the blat of a car alarm, which, she re-ali-zed,
Way-ne must ha-ve rig-ged for exactly this pur-po-se-in an ins-tant, she had hef-ted the rif-le to her
che-ek and one of the Pack le-apt in-to fo-cus; she mo-ved the gun back and forth and saw two be-hind
that one, and one mo-re brin-ging up the re-ar, the fo-ur of them abo-ut ten fe-et be-hind the ro-pe
bar-ri-er, ma-king the-ir way slowly, pla-cing each pla-te-si-zed fo-ot with ca-re, stop-ping to sniff the
ro-ad in front of them, pa-using to study the Brid-ge's sup-port cab-les-the-re was eno-ugh ti-me for
Jac-kie to ve-rify her ini-ti-al co-unt a se-cond, a third ti-me, and on-ce she was cer-ta-in that the fo-ur
things she saw we-re the Pack, that was it, the-re we-re no ot-hers pad-ding along be-hind them, her

he-art lif-ted with a fi-er-ce joy and she tho-ught, Fo-ur, the-re are fo-ur of them; we can do this;
Way-ne was right; we can be free of them, fi-nal-ly-they we-re in ro-ugh sha-pe, the-se fo-ur; it
lo-oked as if they'd pul-led them-sel-ves from the wrec-ka-ge of the trap at the mall: the-ir hi-des we-re
de-co-ra-ted with cuts, slas-hes, burns; patc-hes of ha-ir had be-en torn and scra-ped away; flaps of
skin hung down li-ke stre-amers; the one she'd fo-cu-sed on first ap-pe-ared to ha-ve so-met-hing
wrong with its left eye, which was crus-ted with dark blo-od, whi-le the one brin-ging up the re-ar was
tra-iling its left back leg be-hind it-that they had sur-vi-ved ma-de them the fit-test, yes, thank you, Mr.
Dar-win, but watc-hing the-ir ca-uti-o-us ad-van-ce, Jac-kie was re-min-ded of her grand-mot-her's
dog, a po-od-le that had be-en old when she was a child and had grown ste-adily mo-re gray, mo-re
in-firm, mo-re tremb-ling and ten-ta-ti-ve each ye-ar, and if her he-art wasn't mo-ved to pity; the last
fo-ur we-eks had in-su-red the im-pos-si-bi-lity of that; the as-so-ci-ati-on tem-pe-red her joy-It's ti-me
to end this, she tho-ught, and tur-ned to wa-ke Way-ne, who was (of co-ur-se) al-re-ady up and
jam-ming pis-tols in-to his je-ans, slip-ping the strap of his bag-of-tricks over his he-ad, his fa-ce still-he
cro-uc-hed be-si-de her, hol-ding a third pis-tol out to her: "In ca-se one of them ma-kes it past me," he
sa-id as she to-ok it, chec-ked the sa-fety, and set it on the rock be-si-de her-he re-ac-hed for her
back-pack, drag-ged it aro-und for her to le-an on: "Ta-ke the one to the re-ar," he sa-id, "and any
ot-hers that try to es-ca-pe," and be-fo-re she co-uld ans-wer, he was run-ning away from her, he-ading
back along the led-ge-hol-ding the rif-le aloft with her right hand, Jac-kie eased her-self up and down,
un-til she was lying aga-inst the back-pack, then bro-ught the rif-le in-to po-si-ti-on, fit-ting the stock
aga-inst her sho-ul-der, anc-ho-ring it aga-inst the me-at to ta-ke the kick, which Way-ne had as-su-red
her wasn't that bad-she lo-oked thro-ugh the sight and the-re we-re the Pack, stop-ped in the-ir tracks,
the-ir hack-les ra-ised; she co-uld he-ar them, a de-ep bass no-te li-ke a vi-ol who-se strings we-re
fra-yed out of true, and she cur-led her fin-ger aro-und the trig-ger, re-ady for them to pa-nic and flee,
re-min-ding her-self to squ-e-eze, not pull, and won-de-ring if she wo-uld be ab-le to hit, let alo-ne stop,
any of them-Way-ne was run-ning down the ro-ad to-ward the Brid-ge, his hands empty, and when the
Pack saw him, the no-te they we-re hol-ding ro-se to a rag-ged shri-ek, drow-ning out wha-te-ver
Way-ne was sho-uting at them; ta-un-ting them, no do-ubt, ur-ging them on (and a part of her
won-de-red why that sho-uld work, why ani-mals wo-uld res-pond to in-sult, and she won-de-red if
they we-ren't ani-mals, but wasn't su-re what such a qu-es-ti-on imp-li-ed, be-ca-use she co-uldn't
ima-gi-ne mac-hi-nes be-ing bot-he-red by Way-ne's pro-vo-ca-ti-ons, which left what? pe-op-le?
which was ri-di-cu-lo-us).
It was over qu-ickly, or so Jac-kie wo-uld think af-ter-wards-whi-le everyt-hing was ta-king pla-ce, it
se-emed to oc-cur with ago-ni-zing slow-ness, al-most a se-ri-es of tab-le-a-ux that shif-ted with each
chan-ge in the Brid-ge's lights, vi-olet, and Way-ne was in mid-run, his mo-uth open, his hands out to
eit-her si-de of him, the le-ader of the Pack's jaws tigh-te-ning in-to a snarl that was stran-gely clo-se to
a grin, the ot-hers step-ping for-ward, blue, and Way-ne was stop-ped, no mo-re than twenty fe-et from
the ro-pe bar-ri-er, which, se-en aga-inst the Pack dra-wing clo-ser to it, se-emed fan-ci-ful, a child's
ap-pro-xi-ma-ti-on of a mo-re subs-tan-ti-al ar-ran-ge-ment, gre-en, and the le-ader was cro-uc-hing to
jump, Way-ne's hands we-re still empty, the re-ar mem-ber of the Pack had ce-ased mo-ving for-ward
and ap-pe-ared to be con-si-de-ring ret-re-at; Jac-kie had its shor-te-ned he-ad in the cros-sha-irs,
yel-low, and the le-ader was in the air, Way-ne's hands we-re full of the pis-tols he was po-in-ting not at
the thing han-ging sus-pen-ded be-fo-re him, but the pa-ir be-hind it; the re-ar-gu-ard had tur-ned to
bolt, jer-king its he-ad out of the tar-get, sho-wing Jac-kie its neck, oran-ge, and the le-ader had struck
the web and be-en ca-ught in it, the ro-pes sag-ging but hol-ding it up; the ends of Way-ne's pis-tols
we-re fla-ring whi-te as he emp-ti-ed them in-to the mid-dle two mem-bers of the Pack, which lurc-hed
for-ward even as he blew the-ir he-ads to pi-eces; the re-ma-ining thing was in the pro-cess of swin-ging
it-self aro-und to flee, ex-po-sing the back of its he-ad to Jac-kie's aim and she squ-e-ezed the trig-ger,
the rif-le flas-hing and crac-king and slam-ming back in-to her sho-ul-der, al-most te-aring it-self out of
her hands, red, and she was strug-gling the sight back to her fa-ce, trying to find the last mem-ber of the
Pack be-fo-re it was too far away, ho-ping for one mo-re shot, may-be she co-uld wo-und it, crip-ple it
and Way-ne co-uld fi-nish it, but she co-uldn't see it, it was go-ne, and she swept the sight back and

forth and the-re it was, its legs spla-yed out, the front of its he-ad go-ne, shat-te-red, and for a mo-ment
she was so happy she wan-ted to sho-ut out lo-ud, and then she tho-ught of Way-ne and se-arc-hed for
him, her fin-ger ho-ve-ring over the trig-ger, oran-ge, aga-in, and she saw that Way-ne had aban-do-ned
the pis-tols, cast them to eit-her si-de, and was wal-king to-wards the last mem-ber of the Pack, which
had not suc-ce-eded in di-sen-tang-ling it-self from Way-ne's ro-pe trap and which twis-ted and
writ-hed, bi-ting the air in its frust-ra-ti-on; she tho-ught, What the hell? and aimed for the thing's chest;
but yel-low, and so-met-hing was wrong, the sight was dark; she drew back from it, blin-ked, and
lo-oked thro-ugh it, aga-in, gre-en, and she saw that Way-ne was we-aring a ca-pe, that he was tra-iled
by a length of black-ness that bil-lo-wed be-hind and to eit-her si-de of him, ac-ross which the gre-en
light rip-pled and shim-me-red, blue, and Way-ne was stan-ding in front of the thing, his he-ad co-ve-red
by the sa-me black-ness, ex-cept for his mo-uth, which was sa-ying so-met-hing to the thing that
scramb-led to get at him, and Jac-kie sho-uld ha-ve be-en ab-le to re-ad his lips; she had al-ways be-en
go-od at that; but she co-uldn't be-li-eve what she was se-e-ing; vi-olet, and Way-ne had re-ac-hed out
arms co-ated in black, se-ized the last mem-ber of the Pack's jaws, and torn its he-ad apart, the thing
con-vul-sing as blo-od as dark as wha-te-ver it was ensh-ro-uded Way-ne gey-se-red from its
neck-wit-ho-ut thin-king, Jac-kie cen-te-red the cros-sha-irs on Way-ne's chest, on the dark-ness that
she co-uld swe-ar was un-du-la-ting ac-ross it, that, God help her, was twitc-hing to-wards the blo-od
mis-ting the air, and ti-me be-ca-me a ro-om she co-uld walk aro-und in, sor-ting out the mul-ti-tu-de of
vo-ices scre-aming in her he-ad: one of them sho-uting, "What the fuck!" and anot-her, "What are you
do-ing?" and a third, "How are you go-ing to sur-vi-ve wit-ho-ut him?" a fo-urth, "You owe him," and a
fifth, "What is he?"-her fin-ger light on the trig-ger; if she we-re go-ing to do this, it had to be now; in
anot-her se-cond, Way-ne wo-uld no-ti-ce what she was do-ing-then the lights went out on the Brid-ge,
plun-ging her vi-ew in-to sha-dow, and the baby cho-se that mo-ment to kick, hard, a blow that ma-de
her say, "Oof." and re-le-ase the trig-ger, and then wha-te-ver Way-ne had set up on the Brid-ge
de-to-na-ted in a burst of light and so-und, a bril-li-ant whi-te CRUMP that had her duc-king be-hind
the back-pack, hands over her he-ad, the rif-le drop-ped, for-got-ten-the air aro-und her con-vul-sed
with the for-ce of it; the rock be-hind her shud-de-red as the sur-fa-ce of the Brid-ge fell away to the
ri-ver be-low, sup-port wi-res snap-ping li-ke over-tigh-te-ned gu-itar strings, shreds of me-tal, shards
of pa-ve-ment, a ste-ering whe-el ra-ining aro-und her as the Brid-ge gro-aned-Jac-kie ris-ked a glan-ce
and saw it sag-ging in-wards, its back bro-ken, the for-ces it had ba-lan-ced un-le-as-hed upon it-the
sus-pen-si-on cab-les tremb-led, the to-wers le-aned to-wards each ot-her and she was su-re the
en-ti-re struc-tu-re was go-ing to twist it-self asun-der-the baby kic-ked aga-in, a one-two
com-bi-na-ti-on, and she to-ok what shel-ter she co-uld be-hind the back-pack, whi-le the led-ge
con-ti-nu-ed to vib-ra-te and the mo-an of tho-usands of tons of me-tal pro-tes-ting its end ec-ho-ed off
the hills abo-ve her, ma-king the baby squ-irm, and she co-ve-red her sto-mach with her hands, cur-ling
aro-und it as best she co-uld, sa-ying it was all right, everyt-hing was all right, and af-ter, Jac-kie set out
north past anot-her trio of cars of-fe-ring the-ir flo-ral in-ha-bi-tants the sa-me vi-ew day in, day out, she
was ac-com-pa-ni-ed by Way-ne, who had re-ap-pe-ared whi-le the Brid-ge was not do-ne
comp-la-ining (tho-ugh it didn't fall: its to-wers can-ted cra-zily; its cab-les we-re too ta-ut at the ends
and too slack in the mid-dle; and the-re was no way it was pas-sab-le; but it still jo-ined one sho-re to
the ot-her), and who was free of his black, what wo-uld you call it? cos-tu-me?-she set-tled for
ac-com-pa-ni-ment, awk-ward but ac-cu-ra-te-in res-pon-se to her qu-es-ti-on, he ans-we-red that
yes, that was the end of them, but they had bet-ter get a mo-ve on: Kings-ton was a long way off, and
who knew what this si-de of the Hud-son wo-uld be li-ke?-If he knew that Jac-kie had held him in her
sights, crad-ling his li-fe as she crad-led the li-fe of the baby who hadn't stop-ped re-min-ding her of its
pre-sen-ce the-se last ho-urs, (which me-ant that [may-be] she co-uld re-lax abo-ut it), or if he
sus-pec-ted the qu-es-ti-ons that ba-lan-ced at the very li-mit of her ton-gue, thre-ate-ning to burst forth
with the sligh-test pro-vo-ca-ti-on, or if he gu-es-sed that she wal-ked with one hand jam-med in-to the
swe-at jac-ket she'd tug-ged on be-ca-use she'd hid-den the third pis-tol the-re, tel-ling him it must ha-ve

By night-fall, they had tra-ve-led far.
