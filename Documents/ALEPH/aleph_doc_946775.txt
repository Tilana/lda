Management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) is a review of Zargon Energy Trust’s 2005 financial results and should be 
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the years ended December 31, 
2005 and 2004. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted 
accounting principles (“GAAP”). All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. All references to “Zargon” or 
the “Trust” refer to Zargon Energy Trust and all references to the “Company” refer to Zargon Oil & Gas Ltd.
In the MD&A, reserves and production are commonly stated in barrels of oil equivalent (boe) on the basis that six thousand 
cubic feet of natural gas is equivalent to one barrel of oil (boe). Boes may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A 
boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalent conversion 
method primarily applicable to the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalent at the wellhead.
The following are descriptions of non-GAAP measures used in this MD&A:
•
•
•
•
•
The MD&A contains the term “cash flow from operations” (“cash flow”), which should not be considered an alternative 
to, or more meaningful than, “cash flow from operating activities” as determined in accordance with Canadian GAAP 
as an indicator of the Trust’s financial performance. This term does not have any standardized meaning as prescribed 
by GAAP and therefore, the Trust’s determination of cash flow from operations may not be comparable to that reported 
by other trusts. The reconciliation between net earnings and cash flow from operations can be found in the consolidated 
statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements. The Trust evaluates its performance based on net 
earnings  and  cash  flow  from  operations.  The  Trust  considers  cash  flow  from  operations  to  be  a  key  measure  as  it 
demonstrates  the  Trust’s  ability  to  generate  the  cash  necessary  to  pay  distributions,  repay  debt  and  to  fund  future 
capital investment. It is also used by research analysts to value and compare oil and gas trusts, and it is frequently 
included in published research when providing investment recommendations. Cash flow from operations per unit is 
calculated using the diluted weighted average number of units for the period.
Payout ratio equals distributions as a percentage of cash flow for the period. Payout ratio is a useful measure used by 
management to analyze the Trust’s efficiency and sustainability.
The Trust also uses the term “debt net of working capital”. Debt net of working capital as presented does not have any 
standardized  meaning  prescribed  by  Canadian  GAAP  and  may  not  be  comparable  with  the  calculation  of  similar 
measures for other entities. Debt net of working capital as used by the Trust is calculated as bank debt and any working 
capital deficit excluding the current portion of unrealized risk management assets or liabilities.
Operating netbacks equal total petroleum and natural gas revenue per boe less realized risk management losses per 
boe, royalties per boe, and production costs per boe. Operating netbacks are a useful measure to compare the Trust’s 
operations with those of its peers.
Cash flow netbacks per boe are calculated as operating netbacks less general and administrative expenses per boe, 
interest and financing charges per boe, and capital and current income taxes per boe. Cash flow netbacks are a useful 
measure to compare the Trust’s operations with those of its peers.
References to “production volumes” or “production” in this MD&A refer to sales volumes.
Forward-Looking Statements: This document contains statements that are forward-looking, such as those relating to results 
of operations and financial condition, capital spending, financing sources, commodity prices, costs of production and the 
magnitude of oil and natural gas reserves. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and 
uncertainties  that  could  significantly  affect  anticipated  results  in  the  future  and,  accordingly,  actual  results  may  differ 
materially from those predicted. The forward-looking statements contained in this MD&A are as of March 13, 2006 and are 
subject to change after this date. Readers are cautioned that the assumptions used in the preparation of such information, 
although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should 
not be placed on forward-looking statements. Zargon disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
This MD&A has been prepared as of March 13, 2006.

On  July  15,  2004,  approval  was  given  by  the  shareholders  to  a  resolution  in  favour  of  a  Plan  of 
Arrangement  (the  “Arrangement”)  reorganizing  Zargon  Oil  &  Gas  Ltd.  (the  “Company”)  into 
Zargon  Energy  Trust  (the  “Trust”  or  “Zargon”).  The  Arrangement  received  court  approval  and 
also became effective on July 15, 2004. The Arrangement resulted in shareholders of the Company 
receiving  either  one  trust  unit  or  one  exchangeable  share  for  each  common  share  held.  The 
unitholders  of  the  Trust  are  entitled  to  receive  cash  distributions  paid  by  the  Trust.  Holders  of 
exchangeable  shares  are  not  eligible  to  receive  distributions,  but  rather,  on  each  payment  of  a 
distribution,  the  number  of  trust  units  into  which  each  exchangeable  share  is  exchangeable  is 
increased on a cumulative basis in respect of the distribution. The exchangeable shares are traded 
on the Toronto Stock Exchange and can be converted, at the option of the holder, into trust units 
at any time. On July 15, 2014, all the remaining outstanding exchangeable shares will be redeemed 
into  trust  units  unless  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  elect  to  extend  the  redemption 
period.  In  certain  circumstances,  the  Company  has  the  right  to  require  redemption  of  the 
exchangeable  shares  prior  to  July  15,  2014.  Upon  completion  of  the  Arrangement,  14.87  million 
trust  units  and  3.66  million  exchangeable  shares  were  issued.  The  Trust  is  an  unincorporated 
open-end  investment  trust  governed  by  the  laws  of  the  Province  of  Alberta.  On  September  15, 
2004, Zargon commenced cash distributions, relating to August 2004, of $0.14 per trust unit.
The reorganization of the Company into a Trust has been accounted for using the continuity of 
interest  method.  Accordingly,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  years  ended 
December 31, 2005 and 2004 reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as 
if the Trust had always carried on the business of the Company. All comparative figures referred to 
in the consolidated financial statements and this MD&A are the previous consolidated results of 
the Company.
C A S H   D I S T R I BU T I O N S
Cash distributions to unitholders are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and can fluctuate 
depending on cash flow. The Trust currently targets a payout ratio of approximately 50 percent of 
the  cash  flows  attributed  to  unitholders.  The  Trust’s  capital  program  is  financed  from  available 
cash flow and additional drawdowns on the bank facility if required. The key drivers of Zargon’s 
cash flow are commodity prices and production. Since the Trust’s production is relatively evenly 
weighted between natural gas (2005 – 56 percent) and oil and liquids (2005 – 44 percent), both 
commodity prices have a significant effect on its cash flow. In the event that oil and natural gas 
prices are higher than anticipated and a cash surplus develops, the surplus may be used to increase 
distributions, reduce debt, and/or increase the capital program. In the event that oil and natural 
gas  prices  and/or  production  are  lower  than  expected,  the  Trust  may  decrease  distributions, 
increase debt or decrease the capital program. Zargon regularly reviews its distribution policy in 
the context of the current commodity price environment and production levels.
Distributions remained constant throughout the first seven months of 2005 at $0.14 per unit per 
month  and  had  been  at  that  level  since  the  Trust’s  inception  in  July  2004.  On  August  11,  2005, 
Zargon announced its monthly distribution rate would be increased to $0.16 per unit, representing 
a  $0.02  per  unit  increase.  Furthermore,  on  November  14,  2005  Zargon  announced  its  monthly 
distribution rate would be increased an additional $0.02 per unit to $0.18 per unit. Other than a 
supplemental distribution (over-and-above the monthly distribution) declared in December 2005 
of $0.50 per unit, distributions have been maintained at the $0.18 per unit level since that date.

Cash distributions to unitholders declared for 2005 totalled $37.44 million, resulting in a payout 
ratio for the year of 44 percent of cash flow from operations or 51 percent on a per diluted trust 
unit basis.
For  Canadian  income  tax  purposes,  the  2005  cash  distributions  are  100  percent  taxable  income 
to unitholders.

The  combination  of  high  crude  oil  prices,  natural  gas  prices,  and  stable  production  volumes 
enabled Zargon to achieve record revenues and cash flow from operations in 2005, showing gains 
of 31 percent and 33 percent, respectively, over the prior year. The annual revenue gain came from 
a combination of factors, including a 26 percent increase in oil and liquids prices, an eight percent 
increase in oil and liquids production, and a 32 percent increase in natural gas prices which more 
than  offset  the  three  percent  decline  in  natural  gas  production.  Net  earnings  for  the  year  were 
$35.37 million, a 71 percent increase from 2004. Earnings for 2005 were primarily enhanced by 
record  cash  flows  from  operations  of  $84.97  million,  an  increase  of  $21.22  million  from  2004, 
while  2004  earnings  were  negatively  impacted  by  a  significant  one-time  charge  of  $2.17  million 
related to the accelerated vesting of stock options as a result of the July 15, 2004 Arrangement.
Net capital expenditures for 2005 totalled $54.68 million with $52.26 million allocated to field-
related  activities.  Compared  to  the  prior  year,  the  2005  capital  program  showed  a  three  percent 
decline in overall net expenditures and an 18 percent increase in field-related expenditures. Net 
property acquisitions of $1.23 million were lower in 2005 when compared to the 2004 net property 
acquisitions of $11.81 million which primarily consisted of a portfolio of oil properties in Weyburn 
and  Elswick,  Saskatchewan  of  the  Williston  Basin.  The  2005  capital  expenditures  were 
complemented with the corporate acquisition of a small private Saskatchewan oil and gas company 
for  consideration  of  $1.19  million.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005,  Zargon  spent  $3.65 
million to maintain an undeveloped land base of 367,000 net acres (2004 – 376,000 net acres); shot 
or acquired seismic at a cost of $3.47 million; drilled, equipped and tied-in wells for $45.14 million 
and  made  net  property  acquisitions  of  $1.23  million.  Cash  distributions  to  unitholders  totalled 
$37.44 million during the year (2004 – $10.70 million). All of these activities were funded by the 
high  cash  flows  received  throughout  the  year  plus  an  increase  in  debt  net  of  working  capital 
(excluding the unrealized risk management liability) of $4.12 million.

Zargon derives its revenue from the production and sale of petroleum (oil, natural gas liquids) 
and  natural  gas.  Petroleum  and  natural  gas  revenue,  exclusive  of  risk  management  losses, 
increased 31 percent to $162.72 million in 2005 from $123.97 million in 2004 primarily due to 
higher prices and a slight increase in production. Compared to the prior year, the allocation of 
production revenue in 2005 was essentially unchanged with 47 percent of the revenues coming 
from the sale of oil and liquids (46 percent in 2004) and 53 percent coming from the sale of 
natural gas (54 percent in 2004). Production volumes on a barrel of oil equivalent basis in 2005 
increased one percent to 8,342 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the prior year amounts of 
8,222 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Specifically, in 2005 natural gas production decreased 
three percent and oil and liquids production increased eight percent over 2004 levels. Production 
increases in oil and liquids resulted from mid-2004 Williston Basin property acquisitions and 
field  exploitation  programs.  Natural  gas  production  declines  resulted  primarily  from 
production losses at a significant well in the West Central Alberta core area in mid-2005. The 
average  price  of  oil  and  liquids  received  by  Zargon  rose  to  $57.15  per  barrel  in  2005,  up  26 
percent from 2004. The average field price of natural gas was $8.41 per thousand cubic feet in 
2005, a 32 percent increase over $6.37 per thousand cubic feet in 2004.

Zargon’s field oil and natural gas liquids prices are adjusted at the point of sale for transportation 
charges  and  oil  quality  differentials  from  an  Edmonton  light  sweet  crude  price  that  varies  with 
world  commodity  prices.  In  2005,  Zargon’s  average  oil  and  liquids  field  price,  exclusive  of  risk 
management losses, rose 26 percent to $57.15 per barrel from $45.37 per barrel in 2004 and $36.66 
per barrel in 2003. The field price differential for Zargon’s average blended 30 degree API crude 
stream was $11.57 per barrel less than the 2005 Edmonton reference crude price, which compares 
to  the  2004  differential  of  $7.17  per  barrel  and  the  2003  differential  of  $6.48  per  barrel.  As  the 
quality and weight of Zargon’s crude stream have remained relatively consistent for several years, 
the  movements  in  the  Zargon’s  price  differential  is  derived  from  the  North  American  refinery 
supply and demand factors for light and medium crudes.

The average field natural gas price, exclusive of risk management losses, for 2005 increased to 
$8.41 per thousand cubic feet which is 32 percent higher than the 2004 average of $6.37 per 
thousand cubic feet, and also 33 percent higher than the 2003 average of $6.33 per thousand 
cubic feet. Historically, Zargon’s field prices have shown a small discount to the benchmark 
AECO  average  daily  price  ($0.36  per  thousand  cubic  feet  in  2005),  due  to  a  lower  heating 
content for Zargon’s natural gas and due to legacy aggregator and other contracts which are 
partially based on monthly index prices that tend to lag the AECO average daily index price in 
upward trending markets. Zargon is also committed to various fixed price physical contracts 
which are treated as part of natural gas production revenue and natural gas pricing. In 2005, 
the physical contracts created a gain of $0.18 million (2004 – $0.25 million), equivalent to an 
increase of $0.02 per thousand cubic feet, unchanged from 2004.

Similar to the prior year, approximately 23 percent of Zargon’s 2005 natural gas production was 
sold  under  aggregator  contracts  pursuant  to  long  term  contracts.  The  remainder  of  Zargon’s 
natural gas production was sold by spot sale contracts and Alberta index prices were received.
R I S K   M A NAG E M E N T   AC T I V I T I E S
Zargon’s commodity price risk management policy uses forward sales, puts and costless collars for  
20 to 35 percent of oil and natural gas working interest production in order to partially offset the 
effects  of  large  price  fluctuations.  As  both  Canadian  oil  and  natural  gas  field  prices  are  closely 
correlated to US dollar denominated markets, Zargon will also place US/Cdn currency exchange 
risk management transactions when considered prudent. Because our risk management strategy is 
protective in nature and is designed to guard the Trust against extreme effects on cash flow from 
sudden falls in prices and revenues, upward price spikes tend to produce overall losses. Financial 
risk  management  contracts  in  place  as  at  December  31,  2004,  were  designated  as  hedges  for 
accounting  purposes  and  the  Trust  continues  to  monitor  these  contracts  in  determining  the 
continuation of hedge effectiveness. For these contracts, realized gains and losses are recorded in 
the statement of earnings as the contracts settle and no unrealized gain or loss is recognized.
For  2005,  the  total  realized  risk  management  loss  was  $7.75  million  compared  to  a  loss  of  $4.57 
million in 2004 and a loss of $2.88 million in 2003. Of the 2005 loss, $5.17 million (equivalent to a 
reduction  of  $3.83  per  barrel)  is  related  to  oil  risk  management  transactions  and  $2.58  million 
(equivalent  to  a  reduction  of  $0.25  per  thousand  cubic  feet)  was  related  to  natural  gas  risk 
management  transactions.  Oil  swaps  and  collars  are  settled  against  the  NYMEX  pricing  index, 
whereas natural gas swaps, collars, and puts are settled against the AECO pricing index. In 2005, 
NYMEX WTI crude oil prices increased throughout the year, peaking in the month of September. 
AECO daily natural gas prices also trended upwards during the year and became volatile towards 
year end. For financial risk management contracts entered into after December 31, 2004, the Trust 
does consider these contracts to be an effective hedge on an economic basis but has decided not to 
designate  these  contracts  as  hedges  for  accounting  purposes  and  accordingly,  for  outstanding 
contracts not designated as hedges, an unrealized gain or loss is recorded based on the fair value 
(mark-to-market) of the contracts at the period end. The unrealized losses as at December 31, 2005 
were  $3.76  million  (2004  –  nil).  These  instruments  have  been  recorded  as  a  liability  in  the 
consolidated  balance  sheet.  Gains  or  losses  on  fixed  price  physical  contracts  are  included  in 
petroleum and natural gas revenue in the statement of earnings.

Royalties  include  payments  made  to  the  Crown,  freehold  owners  and  third  parties.  Reported 
royalties also include credits received through the Alberta Royalty Credit (ARC) program, the cost 
of the Saskatchewan Resource Surcharge (SRC) and the cost of North Dakota state taxes. During 
2005, total royalties were $37.32 million, an increase of 33 percent from $28.05 million in 2004. 
Royalties as a percentage of gross revenue were 22.9 percent in 2005 compared to 22.6 percent in 
2004 and 22.1 percent in 2003. On a commodity basis, oil royalties averaged 22.5 percent in 2005, 
a  small  increase  from  the  previous  year’s  average  of  21.5  percent.  Natural  gas  royalties  averaged 
23.3 percent, relatively unchanged from the prior year.

During 2005, 61 percent of the total royalties were paid to provincial and state governments, with 
the remainder paid to freehold owners and other third parties. Royalties payable to the Province of 
Alberta  on  qualifying  properties  are  reduced  through  the  ARC  program.  Zargon  earned  the 
maximum $0.50 million ARC rebate in 2005, which is the same amount received in both 2004 and 
2003. The SRC charges were $1.03 million in 2005, up from $0.64 million in the prior year and 
$0.53 million in 2003 trending the increase in Saskatchewan oil revenues. North Dakota state taxes 
increased to $1.82 million in 2005 from $1.25 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased 
prices for oil, as well as increased production in the state.
P R O D U C T I O N   E X P E N S E S
Zargon’s production expenses increased 11 percent to $24.04 million in 2005, from $21.69 million 
in 2004. On a unit of production basis, production expenses increased nine percent to $7.89 per 
barrel of oil equivalent from $7.21 in 2004 ($6.33 in 2003).
Natural  gas  production  expenses  in  2005  rose  13  percent  to  $0.95  per  thousand  cubic  feet  from 
$0.84 per thousand cubic feet in 2004. The primary reasons for the increases are due to increased 
gas gathering charges, increased rentals for compression equipment, increased water disposal and 
water hauling, all part of the industry-wide trend towards higher operating costs.
Oil production expenses also rose in 2005 to $10.64 per barrel, an increase of three percent from 
$10.30  per  barrel  in  2004.  With  the  strong  oil  prices  during  the  year,  there  is  an  industry-wide 
trend to higher operating costs, particularly for chemicals, propane and equipment repairs.
Due to the high levels of industry activity caused by the high commodity price environment, there is 
increasing upward pressure on per unit operating costs. In 2003, Zargon was able to deliver a cost 
improvement on a per unit of production basis over the prior year through the disposition of smaller, 
higher cost properties. In 2005 and 2004, Zargon’s costs increased substantially due in general to the 
effect of industry-wide higher cost trends. For 2006, Zargon expects the trend of increasing costs to 
persist as the current high demand for industry services is expected to continue.
O P E R AT I N G   N E T BAC K S
The average oil and liquids price received after realized risk management losses in 2005 of $53.32 
per  barrel  was  26  percent  higher  than  the  $42.17  per  barrel  received  in  2004,  while  the  average 
natural  gas  price  received  after  realized  risk  management  losses  in  2005  of  $8.16  per  thousand 
cubic  feet  was  29  percent  above  the  $6.32  per  thousand  cubic  feet  received  in  2004.  Operating 
netbacks increased commensurately. Oil and natural gas liquids netbacks rose 35 percent to $29.80 
per barrel from $22.10 per barrel in 2004. Natural gas netbacks increased 32 percent to $5.25 per 
thousand cubic feet from $3.98 per thousand cubic feet in 2004. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, 
2005 operating netbacks rose 33 percent to $30.75 from $23.15 in 2004.

percent to $1.99 per barrel of oil equivalent, compared to $1.45 per barrel in 2004 and $1.30 per 
barrel in 2003. In 2005, as was the case in 2004, the increased general and administrative costs on 
a per unit of production basis were due to increased staff costs, performance-based compensation 
costs,  increased  regulatory  reporting  requirements  and  the  additional  legal  and  other  outside 
advisory costs of operating as a trust.

Zargon’s borrowings are through its syndicated bank credit facility. Interest and financing charges 
were $0.79 million compared to $0.44 million in 2004. An increase in the average debt level is the 
primary reason for the increase in interest and financing charges. Zargon’s effective interest and 
financing charge rate was 4.3 percent on an average bank debt of $18.17 million in 2005, compared 
to 4.9 percent on an average bank debt of $8.88 million in 2004 and 4.5 percent on an average bank 
debt  of  $17.19  million  in  2003.  At  year  end  2005,  Zargon’s  bank  debt,  net  of  working  capital 
(excluding  unrealized  risk  management  liability),  totalled  $27.49  million,  up  18  percent  from 
$23.37 million at December 31, 2004.

During 2005, Zargon incurred $1.80 million of current income taxes compared to $1.11 million in 
2004. Of the total, $0.90 million is due to current taxes incurred in the United States compared to 
$0.61 million in 2004. Provided that oil prices remain high, a similar level of United States current 
income  taxes  is  predicted  in  2006.  The  remaining  current  tax  amounts  relate  to  federal  and 
provincial capital taxes, which were $0.90 million in 2005 compared to $0.50 million in 2004. Tax 
pools as at December 31, 2005 were approximately $90 million which represents an increase from 
the  comparable  $79  million  of  tax  pools  available  to  Zargon  at  the  end  of  2004.  The  Trust  is  a

Historically high oil prices and the continued strength of natural gas prices in 2005 resulted 
in higher revenue netbacks and operating netbacks. On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, revenue 
of $53.44 in 2005 was 30 percent higher than the prior year and operating netbacks as well as 
cash  flow  netbacks  increased  33  percent  and  32  percent  over  the  prior  year  to  $30.75  and

In  2005,  production  volumes  held  steady,  but  increases  of  26  percent  in  oil  and  natural  gas 
liquids prices and 32 percent in natural gas prices, produced a 33 percent gain in cash flow 
from operations to $84.97 million, compared to $63.75 million in 2004 and $54.35 million in 
2003. The corresponding cash flow per diluted unit was $4.51 in 2005, a 33 percent gain from 
$3.40 per diluted unit in 2004, and compares to $2.96 in 2003. The diluted per unit statistics 
reflected a one percent increase in the weighted average outstanding units to 18.85 million in 
2005, and a two percent increase in the average weighted number of outstanding units to 18.72 
million in 2004 from 18.37 million in 2003.

In  2005,  Zargon’s  depletion  and  depreciation  provision  increased  37  percent  to  $37.48  million, 
compared  to  $27.41  million  in  2004  and  $19.66  million  in  2003.  The  higher  charges  reflect  an 
increase  of  one  percent  in  production  volumes  and  a  35  percent  increase  in  the  charge  on  a  per 
barrel of oil equivalent basis. This large increase in the per barrel of oil equivalent depletion and 
depreciation expense is primarily due to the increase in the property and equipment balance from 
the conversion of exchangeable shares due to the application of EIC-151. The effect of EIC-151 on 
depletion and depreciation expense results in an increase of $5.08 million or $1.67 per barrel of oil 
equivalent.  Additionally,  the  write-off  of  2.4  billion  cubic  feet  of  proved  reserves  related  to  the 
production  loss  at  a  significant  well  in  the  West  Central  Alberta  core  area  also  factors  into  the 
increase.  The  2004  increase  from  2003  resulted  from  a  December  31,  2003  year-over-year  14 
percent reduction in the Trust’s proved reserves as calculated pursuant to the implementation of 
the National Instrument 51-101 standards of reserve disclosure policy.
Depletion and depreciation charges calculated on a unit of production method are based on total 
proved reserves with a conversion of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas being equivalent to one 
barrel of oil. The 2005 depletion calculation includes $6.88 million of future capital expenditures 
to  develop  the  Trust’s  reserves,  but  excludes  $14.72  million  of  unproven  properties  relating  to 
undeveloped land.
Zargon’s  depletion  and  depreciation,  on  a  barrel  of  oil  equivalent  basis,  increased  35  percent  in 
2005  to  $12.31  from  $9.11  in  2004  and  $7.23  in  2003.  Depletion  and  depreciation  rates  will  be 
subject  to  continuing  upward  pressure  as  industry  finding  and  development  costs  increase  to 
reflect the new economics of the recent trends to substantially higher commodity prices.

over the next 30 years with the majority of the costs being incurred after 2012. The estimated net 
present  value  of  the  total  asset  retirement  obligation  is  $15.86  million  as  at  December  31,  2005, 
based on a total future liability of $62.54 million.

Unit-based compensation was $0.90 million in 2005 or $2.78 million lower than the $3.68 million 
expense  in  2004.  Of  the  2004  amount,  $2.17  million  was  related  to  a  one-time  charge  for  the 
accelerated vesting of stock options related to the July 15, 2004 Arrangement. The remainder was 
primarily  the  expense  for  the  trust  unit  rights  incentive  plan,  which  in  2004  were  originally 
calculated using the intrinsic value method. In response to an emphasis by securities regulators 
that fair value methodologies be used, new measurement techniques have been developed in 
2005  utilizing  a  fair  value  option-pricing  model  for  such  unit  rights  grants.  Zargon  has 
reassessed  the  previous  unit  rights  grants  under  this  fair  value  model  and  there  is  no 
significant impact on amounts previously recorded as 2004 unit-based compensation expense. 
Zargon will continue to use fair value methodologies, where possible, for future unit rights 
grants. These non-cash expenses will be recurring charges in future years if Zargon continues 
to grant employee and director trust unit rights.
The trust unit rights incentive plan allows the Trust to issue rights to acquire trust units to 
directors, officers, employees and service providers. The Trust is authorized to issue up to 1.82 
million unit rights; however, the number of trust units reserved for issuance upon exercise of 
the rights shall not exceed 10 percent of the aggregate number of issued and outstanding trust 
units of the Trust. The plan allows for the holder of rights to either exercise the right based on 
the  original  grant  price  or  on  the  original  grant  price  reduced  by  a  portion  of  the  future 
distributions. Unit right grant prices are set at the market price for the trust units on the date 
the unit rights are issued. Trust unit rights granted under the plan generally vest over a three-
year period and expire approximately five years from the grant date.

Zargon’s 2005 future tax expense decreased 95 percent to $0.47 million when compared to the 
respective expenses for 2004 and 2003 of $9.64 million and $9.19 million. The effective future 
tax  rate  in  2005  (the  first  full  year  in  the  trust  structure)  was  1.1  percent  and  is  no  longer 
comparable  to  the  2004  future  tax  rate  of  29.0  percent  and  the  2003  rate  of  27.1  percent. 
Effectively,  Zargon’s  future  tax  obligations  are  reduced  as  distributions  are  made  from  the 
Trust,  and  consequently  it  is  anticipated  that  Zargon’s  effective  2006  future  tax  rate  will 
continue to be at considerably lower levels than the future tax rates booked prior to Zargon’s 
conversion into a trust.
N E T   E A R N I N G S
Zargon’s 2005 net earnings were $35.37 million, a $14.74 million increase from $20.63 million 
in 2004. The 2003 net earnings were $24.36 million. The very strong 2005 increase was due 
primarily to the $21.23 million increase in cash flow from operations as previously described. 
On a per diluted unit basis, 2005 net earnings were $2.19 compared to $1.20 in 2004 and $1.33 
in 2003.
On a barrel of oil equivalent basis, the 2005 earnings before non-controlling interest were $13.58 
compared to $7.48 in 2004 and $8.97 in 2003.

Reflecting primarily the reduction in future income taxes, the 2005 net earnings were 42 percent 
of  cash  flow  from  operations.  The  2004  net  earnings  represented  32  percent  of  cash  flow  from 
operations compared to 45 percent of cash flow in 2003.

Net capital expenditures in 2005 of $54.68 million decreased three percent from $56.27 million in 
2004. The decrease in capital expenditures was a result of a decline in Zargon’s 2005 net property 
acquisition program to $1.23 million from the prior year’s $11.81 million purchase of producing 
Saskatchewan  oil  properties  in  the  Williston  Basin  core  area.  In  2005,  Zargon  completed  an 
expanded drilling program of 60 gross (53.5 net) wells and drilling and completion expenditures 
climbed commensurately by 24 percent to $33.36 million. Of the total 2005 net capital expenditures, 
$15.77 million was expended on West Central Alberta, $19.07 million on Alberta Plains and $19.84 
million on Williston Basin properties.

Zargon's financing philosophy and three sources of funding are as follows:
•
Internally generated cash flow provides the basic level of funding for the Trust’s annual capital 
expenditures program and for distributions to unitholders.
•   Debt  may  be  utilized  for  acquisitions  or  to  expand  capital  programs  when  it  is  deemed 
appropriate.  The  Trust  has  an  $80  million  syndicated  committed  credit  facility.  As  at 
December 31, 2005, $69.66 million or 87 percent of this facility is unutilized. The Trust has 
followed and intends to maintain a conservative debt policy.
•   New  equity,  if  available  and  if  on  favourable  terms,  can  be  utilized  for  acquisitions  or  to
expand capital programs.
In  2005,  the  summation  of  the  cash  outflows  pertaining  to  the  net  capital  expenditure  program 
($54.68  million)  and  the  cash  distributions  to  unitholders  ($37.44  million)  exceeded  by  $3.28

It  is  anticipated  that  Zargon’s  2006  capital  budget  and  cash  distributions  to  unitholders  will  be 
financed  through  the  Trust’s  cash  flow  from  operations.  Cash  flow  is  partially  influenced  by 
factors that the Trust cannot control, such as commodity prices, the US/Canadian dollar exchange 
rates and interest rates. Zargon’s 2006 estimated sensitivity to moderate fluctuations in these key 
business parameters is shown in the accompanying table.

On  September  30,  2005,  a  Canadian  subsidiary  and  a  US  subsidiary  of  the  Trust  entered  into 
syndicated  committed  credit  facilities  with  a  borrowing  base  of  $80  million,  which  replaces  its 
former demand facility of $50 million. These facilities consist of a $60 million tranche available to 
the Canadian borrower and a US $15 million tranche available to the US borrower. A $150 million 
demand debenture on the assets of the subsidiaries of the Trust has been provided as security for 
these facilities. These facilities are fully revolving for a 364 day period with the provision for an 
annual  extension  at  the  option  of  the  lenders  and  upon  notice  from  the  Company.  Should  the 
facilities not be renewed, they convert to one year non-revolving term facilities at the end of the 
revolving  364  day  period.  Repayment  would  not  be  required  until  the  end  of  the  non-revolving 
term,  and  as  such,  in  accordance  with  Canadian  GAAP,  the  revolving  credit  facility  has  been 
classified  as  long  term  debt  as  opposed  to  the  previous  facility  which  was  treated  as  a  current 
liability. At December 31, 2005, bank debt was $10.34 million, a decrease of 27 percent from the 
prior year end bank indebtedness amount of $14.23 million.
Zargon’s debt net of working capital (excluding the unrealized risk management liability) of $27.49 
million at December 31, 2005 was equivalent to 32 percent of the 2005 cash flow from operations 
of $84.97 million. At December 31, 2004, the debt net of working capital (excluding the unrealized 
risk management liability) was $23.37 million, equivalent to 37 percent of the 2004 cash flow from 
operations of $63.75 million.

At March  13,  2006,  Zargon  had  16.461  million  trust  units  and  2.345  million  exchangeable 
shares outstanding. Assuming full conversion of exchangeable shares at the effective exchange 
ratio of 1.12640, there would be 19.101 million trust units outstanding at this date. Pursuant 
to  the  trust  unit  rights  incentive  plan,  there  are  currently  an  additional  0.986  million  trust 
unit incentive rights issued and outstanding.
During 2005, 13.18 million Zargon trust units traded on The Toronto Stock Exchange with a 
high trading price of $34.99 per unit, a low of $20.75 per unit and a closing price of $31.75 per 
unit. The 2005 trading statistics show a 26 percent year-over-year decrease in trading volume, 
and a 33 percent increase in the closing stock price. Zargon’s market capitalization (including 
the market value of exchangeable shares) at year end 2005 was approximately $603 million, 
compared to approximately $444 million at the end of 2004.

In  calendar  2005,  approximately  87  percent  (2004  –  88  percent)  of  Zargon’s  combined 
petroleum and natural gas revenue came from Western Canadian (Alberta, Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba) properties, with the remaining 13 percent (2004 – 12 percent) of revenues generated 
in the United States (North Dakota and Montana).

Chairman of the Board, $0.04 million for vehicle leasing costs to a company associated with a 
member of the Board of Directors and $0.12 million for legal fees to a law firm associated with 
a member of the Board of Directors. All amounts were based on normal commercial terms 
and conditions.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect 
the  financial  results  of  the  Trust.  Zargon’s  management  reviews  its  estimates  regularly,  but  new 
information  and  changed  circumstances  may  result  in  actual  results  or  changes  to  estimated 
amounts that differ materially from current estimates. The critical estimates are discussed below:
P E T R O L E U M   A N D   NAT U R A L   G A S   R E S E RV E S
All of Zargon’s petroleum and natural gas reserves are evaluated and reported on by independent 
petroleum  engineering  consultants  in  accordance  with  Canadian  Securities  Administrators’ 
National  Instrument  51-101  (“NI  51-101”).  The  estimation  of  reserves  is  a  subjective  process. 
Forecasts are based on engineering data, projected future rates of production, commodity prices 
and  the  timing  of  future  expenditures,  all  of  which  are  subject  to  numerous  uncertainties  and 
various  interpretations.  The  Trust  expects  that  its  estimates  of  reserves  will  change  to  reflect 
updated information. Reserve estimates can be revised upward or downward based on the results 
of future drilling, testing, production levels, and changes in costs and commodity prices.
F U L L   C O S T   AC C O U N T I N G
Zargon  follows  the  full  cost  method  of  accounting  for  petroleum  and  natural  gas  operations  as 
outlined in Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) accounting guideline “Oil and 
Gas  Accounting  –  Full  Cost”  (AcG-16).  Under  this  accounting  method,  all  costs  related  to  the 
exploration for and development of petroleum and natural gas reserves are capitalized. Capitalized 
costs, as well as the estimated future expenditures to develop proved reserves, are depleted using 
the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves.
In applying the full cost method, Zargon calculates a ceiling test on a quarterly basis to ensure that 
the net carrying value of petroleum and natural gas assets do not exceed the estimated undiscounted 
future net cash flows from production of proved reserves. Accordingly, the Trust must base this 
calculation of future net cash flows on estimated forecasted sales prices, costs and regulations in 
effect at the period end. AcG-16 limits the carrying value of petroleum and natural gas properties 
to their fair value. The fair value is equal to estimated future cash flows from proved and probable 
reserves using future price forecasts and costs discounted at a risk-free rate.
A S S E T   R E T I R E M E N T   O B L I G AT I O N S
Effective January 1, 2004, Zargon adopted CICA Section 3110, “Asset Retirement Obligations”, which 
requires  liability  recognition  for  retirement  obligations  associated  with  the  Trust’s  property,  plant 
and  equipment.  Under  this  policy,  the  Trust  is  required  to  provide  for  future  removal  and  site 
restoration costs. The Trust must estimate these costs in accordance with existing laws, contracts or 
other  policies  and  must  also  estimate  a  credit  adjusted  risk-free  rate  and  inflation  rate  in  this 
calculation. These estimated costs are charged to earnings and the appropriate liability account over 
the expected life of the asset. When the future removal and site restoration costs cannot be reasonably 
determined,  a  contingent  liability  may  exist.  Contingent  liabilities  are  charged  to  earnings  when 
management is able to determine the amount and the likelihood of the future obligation.

The  determination  of  the  Trust’s  income  and  other  tax  liabilities  requires  interpretation  of 
complex laws and regulations. All tax filings are subject to audit and potential reassessment after 
the lapse of considerable time. Accordingly, the actual income tax liability may differ significantly 
from that estimated and recorded by management.

During 2005, the following new or amended standards and guidelines were issued:
E XC HA N G E A B L E   S E C U R I T I E S   I S S U E D   B Y   S U B S I D IA R I E S   O F   I N C O M E   T RU S T S
On  January  19,  2005,  the  CICA  issued  revised  draft  EIC-151  “Exchangeable  Securities  Issued  by 
Subsidiaries of Income Trusts” which states that exchangeable securities issued by a subsidiary of 
an Income Trust should be reflected as either non-controlling interest or debt on the consolidated 
balance sheet unless they meet certain criteria. The exchangeable shares issued by Zargon Oil & 
Gas Ltd., a corporate subsidiary of the Trust, are publicly traded and have an expiry term, which 
could be extended at the option of the Board of Directors. Therefore, these securities are considered, 
by EIC-151, to be transferable to third parties and to have an indefinite life. EIC-151 states that if 
these  criteria  are  met,  the  exchangeable  shares  should  be  reflected  as  non-controlling  interest. 
Previously, the exchangeable shares were reflected as a component of unitholders’ equity.
For the 2004 year end, the Trust retroactively restated prior periods back to the Plan of Arrangement 
dated  July  15,  2004.  As  a  result  of  this  change  in  accounting  policy,  the  Trust  has  increased  its 
unitholders’ equity and non-controlling interest for 2005 by $24.44 million (2004 – $10.15 million) 
on the Trust’s consolidated balance sheet. Consolidated net earnings for 2005 have been reduced 
for net earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest of $5.99 million (2004 – $1.87 million). 
In  accordance  with  EIC-151  and  given  the  circumstances  in  Zargon’s  case,  each  redemption  is 
accounted for as a step-purchase, which for 2005 additionally resulted in an increase in property 
and equipment of $24.93 million (2004 – $11.28 million), an increase in accumulated depletion 
and depreciation by $5.08 million (2004 – nil), and an increase in future income tax liability of 
$6.48 million (2004 – $3.00 million). Cash flow was not impacted by this change.
The cumulative impact to date of the application of EIC-151 has been to increase gross property 
and  equipment  by  $36.21  million,  unitholders’  equity  and  non-controlling  interest  by  $34.59 
million,  future  income  tax  liability  by  $9.48  million  and  an  allocation  of  net  earnings  to 
exchangeable shareholders’ of $7.86 million.

On  January  27,  2005,  the  Accounting  Standard’s  Board  (AcSB)  issued  CICA  Handbook  section 
3855  “Financial  Instruments  –  Recognition  and  Measurement”,  CICA  Handbook  section  3861 
“Financial  Instruments  –  Disclosure  and  Presentation”,  CICA  Handbook  section  1530 
“Comprehensive Income” and CICA handbook section 3865 “Hedges” that deal with the recognition 
and  measurement  of  financial  instruments  and  comprehensive  income.  The  new  standards  are 
intended  to  harmonize  Canadian  standards  with  United  States  and  International  accounting 
standards  and  are  effective  for  annual  and  interim  periods  in  fiscal  years  beginning  on  or  after 
October 1, 2006.  These new standards will impact the  Trust in future periods and the resulting 
impact will be assessed at that time.

In the quarter ending March 31, 2006, Zargon will adopt Section 3831 “Non-Monetary Transactions” 
issued by the CICA in June 2005. Under the new standard, a commercial substance test replaces the 
culmination  of  earnings  test  as  the  criteria  for  fair  value  measurement.  In  addition,  fair  value 
measurement  is  clarified.  The  Trust  does  not  expect  application  of  this  new  standard  to  have  a 
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

On  November  23,  2005,  the  federal  government  of  Canada  announced  a  reduction  in  personal 
income taxes on dividends and an end to the consultation process initiated on September 8, 2005 
to review the tax treatment of income trusts and flow-through entities. The government did not 
announce any changes to the tax treatment of income trusts and flow-through entities.
The Trust’s management believes that the announcement reflects the overwhelming consensus of 
submissions received during the consultation process to reduce personal income tax on corporate 
dividends to correct the long-standing problem of double taxation of dividends at the federal level. 
The decision reduces the uncertainty surrounding income trust taxation and assists in balancing 
tax treatment between corporations and trusts.

The Trust has established procedures and internal control systems to ensure timely and accurate 
preparation  of  financial,  internal  management  and  other  reports.  Disclosure  controls  and 
procedures  are  in  place  to  ensure  all  ongoing  statutory  reporting  requirements  are  met  and 
material information is disclosed on a timely basis. The President and Chief Executive Officer and 
the Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, individually, sign certifications that the 
financial  statements  together  with  the  other  financial  information  included  in  the  regulatory 
filings fairly present in all material respects the financial conditions, results of operation, and cash 
flows as of the dates and for the periods represented.
Our  management,  including  our  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Vice  President, 
Finance  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  have  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  Trust’s  disclosure 
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, 
the  President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Vice  President,  Finance  and  Chief  Financial 
Officer, have concluded that the Trust’s disclosure controls are effective as of the end of the period 
covered by this annual report, in all material respects, after considering the Canadian Securities

Zargon’s  external  business  risks  arise  from  the  uncertainty  of  oil  and  natural  gas  pricing,  the 
uncertainty  of  interest  and  exchange  rates,  environmental  and  safety  issues,  and  financial  and 
liquidity  considerations.  Additional  risk  arises  from  the  production  performance  of  existing 
properties (including natural decline), the changes in tax, royalty and other regulatory standards 
and uncertain results from capital expenditure programs.
Oil  and  natural  gas  prices  may  fluctuate  widely  in  response  to  many  factors  such  as  global  and 
North American supply and demand, economic conditions, weather conditions, political stability, 
the  supply  and  price  of  imported  oil  and  liquefied  natural  gas,  production  and  storage  levels  of 
North American natural gas, and government regulations. Zargon attempts to minimize pricing 
and currency exchange uncertainty with a risk management program that encompasses a variety 
of  financial  instruments.  These  include  forward  sales  of  oil  and  natural  gas  production  (either 
through financial derivative transactions such as swaps or by physical contracts), put options on 
both oil and natural gas, costless collars (in which some potential high price gain is given up in 
return for potential low price support) and US dollar currency risk management transactions in 
different forms for up to 35 percent of its oil and natural gas production volumes. In general, the 
Trust  seeks  to  use  strategies  that  allow  minimum  price  expectations  to  be  met  in  order  that 
distributions and capital programs can be funded. This strategy is designed mainly to protect the 
Trust  against  periods  of  unusually  low  commodity  prices  and  by  its  nature  is  likely  to  produce 
significant risk management losses when prices are unusually high.
Environmental  and  safety  risks  are  mitigated  through  compliance  with  provincial  and  federal 
environmental  and  safety  regulations,  by  maintaining  adequate  insurance,  and  by  adopting 
appropriate emergency response and employee safety procedures.
The Trust is subject to a broad range of laws and regulatory requirements. Changes in government 
regulations, including reporting requirements, income tax laws, operating practices, environmental 
protection  requirements  and  royalty  rates  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  Zargon.  Although 
Zargon has no control over these regulatory risks, the Trust actively monitors changes, participates 
in  industry  organizations  and,  when  required,  engages  the  assistance  of  third-party  experts  to 
assess the impact of such changes in the Trust’s financial and operating results.
Financial and liquidity risks are reduced by limiting debt financing to conservative self-imposed 
debt  to  cash  flow  guidelines.  Zargon  maintains  a  low  cash  distribution  to  cash  flow  from 
operations ratio to ensure adequate funding is available for capital programs to sustain per unit 
production and reserves. Access to capital markets, if required for additional financing by either 
debt  or  equity  issuances,  is  dependent  upon  maintaining  strong  performance  and  relationships 
with investors. A substantial portion of the Trust’s accounts receivable are with companies in the 
oil  and  gas  industry  and  are  subject  to  normal  industry  credit  risks.  Management  regularly 
monitors  the  ageing  of  receivable  balances  to  mitigate  this  risk.  With  respect  to  financial 
instruments utilized for risk management purposes, the Trust partially mitigates associated credit 
risk by limiting transactions to counterparties with investment grade credit ratings.
Zargon actively manages the risks of its capital programs and reserves by concentrating drilling 
and  subsequent  development  activities  in  areas  where  it  has  demonstrated  proven  technical 
capabilities  and  understanding.  Zargon’s  capital  budget  is  managed  to  limit  exposure  so  that 
significant capital is not risked on any one project or concept.
O U T L O O K
As a sustainable trust, Zargon is committed to maintaining reserves, production and distributions 
per unit in the context of distributing approximately 50 percent of its cash flow from operations to 
unitholders. For calendar 2006, Zargon has budgeted $45 million of capital expenditures allocated 
to  natural  gas  exploration  and  oil  exploitation  and  is  projecting  an  average  production  rate  of 
approximately 8,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This amount does not include any allocation 
for opportunistic corporate or property acquisitions which, if available, would be funded by bank 
debt or equity issues.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, Zargon’s petroleum and natural gas revenues of $50.26 million 
were  18  percent  higher  than  the  previous  quarter’s  revenues.  Production  for  the  2005  fourth 
quarter of 8,651 barrels of oil equivalent per day exceeded the fourth quarter guidance of 8,500 
barrels of oil equivalent per day by two percent and was eight percent higher than the 2005 third 
quarter’s production of 8,036 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Compared to the previous quarter, 
oil production increased 13 percent to 4,030 barrels per day as two successful higher rate Williston 
Basin  horizontal  wells  were  drilled  and  placed  on  production.  Fourth  quarter  natural  gas 
production increased four percent over the previous quarter to 27.73 million cubic feet per day as 
recently  drilled  West  Central  Alberta  and  Alberta  Plains  natural  gas  wells  were  tied-in  to  help 
offset the previous quarter’s production losses at a significant well in the West Central Alberta core 
area.  Average  prices  received  during  the  fourth  quarter,  before  risk  management  losses,  were 
$57.58 per barrel for oil and liquids and $11.34 per thousand cubic feet for natural gas, a 13 percent 
reduction  and  a  34  percent  increase  respectively,  compared  to  the  2005  third  quarter  prices. 
Reflecting market and seasonal trends, Zargon’s field price differential for its blended 30 degree 
API crude oil stream increased to a $13.59 per barrel discount to the Edmonton reference crude oil 
price, a 24 percent increase from Zargon’s average differential of $10.92 per barrel for the first nine 
months of 2005.

Cash flow from operations was $26.62 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 22 percent or 
$4.77 million over the prior quarter. A comparative analysis of the primary factors that caused this 
quarter-over-quarter increase are as follows:
•
•
•
Realized  risk  management  losses  increased  by  $0.50  million  to  $3.12  million,  a  19  percent 
increase over the prior quarter’s $2.62 million of risk management losses. The primary reason 
for  the  increase  in  the  fourth  quarter  related  to  losses  on  natural  gas  risk  management 
contracts due to the high natural gas prices received throughout the quarter.
Royalties  for  the  fourth  quarter  were  $11.59  million,  an  increase  of  $1.81  million  from  the 
prior  quarter.  The  average  royalty  rate  for  the  quarter  held  relatively  steady  at  23.1  percent 
from 23.0 percent from the third quarter.
Production  expenses  held  steady  at  $6.10  million  for  the  quarter,  a  $0.19  million  or  three 
percent  decrease  from  the  third  quarter  of  2005.  On  a  per  barrel  of  oil  equivalent  basis, 
production  expenses  decreased  10  percent  to  $7.67  in  the  fourth  quarter  2005  compared  to 
$8.52 in the prior quarter. The quarterly improvement in per unit costs reflected the impact 
of the addition of higher-rate lower-cost wells that were responsible for the Trust’s eight percent 
quarter-over-quarter production gain.
•  General  and  administrative  expenses  increased  in  the  fourth  quarter  by  $0.49  million  over  
the third quarter of 2005. This is a 32 percent increase compared to the prior quarter and is 
primarily  due  to  amounts  recorded  for  year  end  performance-based  compensation  for 
employees.
•
•
Interest  and  financing  charges  in  the  fourth  quarter  were  $0.23  million,  an  increase  of  35 
percent or $0.06 million from the prior quarter. This increase is primarily due to additional 
costs  related  to  the  Trust’s  new  syndicated  committed  credit  facility  which  was  closed  and 
available  on  September  30,  2005.  The  average  debt  level  for  the  fourth  quarter  declined 
slightly to $16.40 million compared to $17.63 million in the third quarter of 2005.
Capital and current income taxes increased by $0.36 million from the third quarter of 2005. 
The increase was due to increases in Canadian capital taxes and an increase in United States 
current income taxes incurred as a result of strengthening United States operations.
Net  earnings  for  the  quarter  increased  $11.16  million  to  $17.45  million,  a  177  percent  increase 
compared to the third quarter 2005 net earnings of $6.30 million. Net earnings track the cash flow 
from  operations  for  the  respective  periods  modified  by  non-cash  charges,  which  included  the 
following for the fourth quarter of 2005:
•
•
Unit-based  compensation  expense  increased  by  $0.06  million  during  the  fourth  quarter  of 
2005 to $0.24 million, a 32 percent increase over the third quarter. The increase is a result of 
additional unit rights grants in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Depletion and depreciation expense increased by $1.04 million to $10.36 million in the fourth 
quarter. The additional expense resulted from the use of an updated depletion and depreciation 
rate of $13.02 per barrel of oil equivalent, compared to the prior quarter’s $12.61 per barrel of 
oil equivalent charge. The increased per unit charges are calculated on the basis of the recently 
completed  2005  year  end  reserve  appraisal  prepared  by  independent  engineers  that  reflects 
Zargon’s and the ongoing industry’s trend to higher finding and development costs, which are 
commensurate with the new economics of this current era of substantially higher commodity 
prices. Furthermore, 2005 depletion and depreciation rates continue to increase quarterly as a

result  of  ongoing  increases  in  the  property  and  equipment  balance  from  the  conversion  of 
exchangeable  shares  due  to  the  application  of  EIC-151.  Additionally,  the  2005  third  quarter 
write-off of proved reserves of 2.4 billion cubic feet related to the production loss at a significant 
well in the West Central Alberta core area also factors into the fourth quarter increase.
Unrealized risk management losses in the third quarter of $5.30 million reverted to gains in 
the  2005  fourth  quarter  of  $4.89  million.  These  unrealized  gains  and  losses  result  from 
“marking-to-market”  risk  management  contracts  at  each  period  end.  During  the  fourth 
quarter,  unrealized  risk  management  gains  were  primarily  driven  by  weaker  commodity 
pricing at the December 31, 2005 marking-to-market date when compared to the third quarter 
September 30, 2005 marking-to-market date. In particular, lower year end futures natural gas 
pricing resulted in gains of $3.27 million, and moderately lower year end futures oil pricing 
resulted in gains of $1.62 million.
Future  income  tax  expense  was  $0.33  million  during  the  quarter,  compared  to  a  future 
income tax recovery of $0.23 million from the third quarter of 2005. As cash distributions are 
made from the Trust, future tax expenses decline. During the fourth quarter, in addition to 
regular monthly distributions, a supplemental cash distribution was declared to unitholders. 
Future income taxes increased in the 2005 fourth quarter despite increased cash distributions 
due  to  the  significant  increase  of  earnings  before  taxes  to  $21.20  million  from  the  third 
quarter earnings before taxes of $7.36 million.
•  Non-controlling interest related to exchangeable shares increased to $2.81 million in the 2005 
fourth  quarter,  from  $1.05  million  in  the  third  quarter.  This  was  due  to  an  increase  in  net 
earnings before non-controlling interest in the fourth quarter.
Net  capital  expenditures  were  $19.12  million  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2005,  a  37  percent 
increase  from  the  prior  quarter  amount  of  $13.91  million.  During  the  fourth  quarter,  Zargon 
completed a record field capital program focused on more expensive activities in the West Central 
Alberta and Williston Basin core areas. The fourth quarter capital expenditures were complemented 
with the corporate acquisition of a small private Saskatchewan oil and gas company for consideration 
of $1.19 million. During the fourth quarter of 2005, 15.3 net wells were drilled, compared to 16.2 
net wells in the third quarter of 2005.
On  November  14,  2005,  Zargon  announced  its  monthly  distribution  rate  would  be  increased  an 
additional  $0.02  per  unit  to  $0.18  per  unit  commencing  with  the  November  distribution.  A
supplemental  distribution  (over-and-above  the  monthly  distribution)  was  declared  in  December 
2005 of $0.50 per unit, raising the distribution per unit to $1.02 for the fourth quarter from $0.46 in 
the prior quarter. Cash distributions to unitholders declared for the quarter totalled $16.66 million, 
resulting in a quarterly payout ratio of 63 percent of cash flow or 73 percent on a per diluted trust 
unit basis. The upward spike in the fourth quarter was a result of the December 2005 supplemental 
distribution which represented a semi-annual adjustment pursuant to Zargon’s strategy of distributing 
approximately 50 percent of the Trust’s cash flows attributed to the unitholder.
