Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
 
NOTE A – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
We are a geographically diversified oil and gas services company, focused on completion fluids
and associated products and services, water management, frac flowback, production well testing,
offshore rig cooling, compression services and equipment, and selected offshore services
including well plugging and abandonment, decommissioning, and diving. We also have a limited
domestic oil and gas production business. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and are
composed of five reporting segments organized into four divisions – Fluids, Production Testing,
Compression, and Offshore. Unless the context requires otherwise, when we refer to “we,” “us,”
and “our,” we are describing TETRA Technologies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.
 
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries.
Our interests in oil and gas properties are proportionately consolidated. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The information furnished
reflects all normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to
provide a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. Operating results for the period
ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2016.
We consolidate the financial statements of CSI Compressco LP and its subsidiaries ("CCLP") as
part of our Compression Division, as we determined that CCLP is a variable interest entity and
we are the primary beneficiary. We control the financial interests of CCLP and have the ability to
direct the activities of CCLP that most significantly impact its economic performance through our
ownership of its general partner. The share of CCLP net assets and earnings that is not owned
by us is presented as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. Our cash
flows from our investment in CCLP are limited to the quarterly distributions we receive and the
amounts collected for services we perform on behalf of CCLP, as TETRA's capital structure and
CCLP's capital structure are separate, as we have no cross default provisions, cross
collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees with CCLP's debt, nor does CCLP with TETRA's
debt.
 
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements required to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and do not include all information and
footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
These financial statements should be read in connection with the financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2015, and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
which we filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016.
Certain previously reported financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current
year period’s presentation. The impact of such reclassifications was not significant to the prior
year period’s overall presentation. These reclassifications include the presentation of deferred
financing costs in accordance with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15 as further discussed below and the allocation of deferred
financing costs from Other Expense, net to Interest Expense, net. See Note B - Long-Term Debt
and Other Borrowings for further discussion and presentation.
Throughout 2015 and continuing into 2016, low oil and natural gas commodity prices lowered the
capital expenditure and operating plans of many of our customers, creating uncertainty regarding
the expected demand for many of our products and services and the resulting cash flows from
operating activities for the foreseeable future. In addition, the availability of new borrowings in
current capital markets is more limited and costly. Accordingly, we and CCLP have implemented
and continue to implement measures designed to lower our respective cost structures, improve
our respective operating cash flows, and improve liquidity and strengthen our respective balance
sheets. These measures include headcount reductions and wage reductions. We and CCLP also
continue to negotiate with our suppliers and service providers to reduce costs. We and CCLP
continue to critically review all capital expenditure activities and are deferring a significant portion
of our respective growth and maintenance capital expenditure plans until they may be justified in
the future by expected activity levels. We and CCLP believe the steps taken have enhanced our
respective capital structures and operating cash flows and additional steps may be taken to
enhance our respective operating cash flows in the future.

During the three month period ended June 30, 2016, and pursuant to tender offers (the “Tender
Offers”) to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding Series 2010-A Senior Notes, Series
2010-B Senior Notes, and Series 2013 Senior Notes (together the "Tender Offer Senior Notes"),
we purchased Tender Offer Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million
representing the total outstanding principal amount of the Tender Offer Senior Notes. In June
2016, upon the closing of our previously announced offering for the issuance of shares of our
common stock, we issued 11.5 million shares of our common stock and used the proceeds to
repay the remaining balance outstanding under our Senior Secured Notes. (For further
discussion of this common stock offering, see Note F - Equity.) In addition, in July 2016, we
amended certain provisions of the agreement governing our bank revolving credit facility (as
amended, the "Credit Agreement") as well as certain provisions of our 11% Senior Notes due
November 5, 2022 (the "11% Senior Notes") whereby, among other modifications, certain
financial covenants under the Credit Agreement and 11% Senior Notes were amended. (For
further discussion of the Tender Offers and the amendments to these debt agreements, see Note
B - Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings.) As a result of these steps taken, and financial
forecasts based on current market conditions as of August 9, 2016, we believe that despite the
current industry environment and activity levels, we will have adequate liquidity to fund our
operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with our amended debt covenants
through June 30, 2017.
In May 2016, CCLP amended certain provisions of the agreement governing its bank revolving
credit facility (as amended, the "CCLP Credit Agreement") by, among other things, favorably
amending certain financial covenants. In August 2016, CCLP received $49.8 million of net
proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, from the private placement (the "Private
Placement") of its Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the "CCLP Preferred Units") and the net
proceeds will be used to pay additional offering expenses and reduce outstanding indebtedness
of CCLP under the CCLP Credit Agreement or the CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes. We purchased a
portion of the CCLP Preferred Units for $10.0 million. (For further discussion of the issuance of
CCLP Preferred Units, see Note C - CCLP Series A Convertible Preferred Units.) As a result of
these steps taken, and financial forecasts based on current market conditions as of August 9,
2016, CCLP believes that despite the current industry environment and activity levels, it will have
adequate liquidity to fund its operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with its
amended debt covenants through June 30, 2017.
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, and
impairments during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and
such differences could be material.
Cash Equivalents
 
We consider all highly liquid cash investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.
 
Restricted Cash
 
Restricted cash is classified as a current asset when it is expected to be repaid or settled in the
next twelve month period. Restricted cash reported on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2016
consists primarily of escrowed cash associated with our July 2011 purchase of a heavy lift derrick
barge. The escrowed cash is expected to be released to the sellers in early 2017.
 
Inventories
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Except for work in progress inventory
discussed below, cost is determined using the weighted average method. Components of
inventories as of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, are as follows:

Total inventories $ 124,315

 37,379
 23,312
 $ 117,009
Finished goods inventories include newly manufactured clear brine fluids as well as used brines
that are repurchased from certain customers for recycling. Recycled brines are recorded at cost,
using the weighted average method. Work in progress inventory consists primarily of new
compressor packages located in the CCLP fabrication facility in Midland, Texas. The cost of work
in process is determined using the specific identification method. During the six month period
ended June 30, 2016, $11.2 million of CCLP work in progress inventory was transferred to
Property, Plant and Equipment. We write down the value of inventory by an amount equal to the
difference between its cost and its market value.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses
acquired in purchase transactions. We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or
whenever indicators of impairment are present. We perform the annual test of goodwill
impairment following the fourth quarter of each year. The assessment for goodwill impairment
begins with a qualitative assessment of whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of
each reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This qualitative assessment requires the
evaluation, based on the weight of evidence, of the significance of all identified events and
circumstances for each reporting unit. During 2015, and continuing into 2016, global oil and
natural gas commodity prices, particularly crude oil, were significantly reduced. These low
commodity prices have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on industry
drilling and capital expenditure activity, which affects the demand for a portion of our products
and services. Due to the decrease in the price of our common stock and the price per common
unit of CCLP during the first three months of 2016, our and CCLP's market capitalizations as of
March 31, 2016, were below their respective recorded net book values, including goodwill. In
addition, the continuing low oil and natural gas commodity price environment resulted in a further
negative impact on demand for the products and services for each of our reporting units. As a
result of these factors, we determined that it was “more likely than not” that the fair values of
certain of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values as of March 31, 2016.
When the qualitative analysis indicates that it is “more likely than not” that a reporting unit’s fair
value is less than its carrying value, the resulting goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step
accounting test performed on a reporting unit basis. The first step of the impairment test is to
compare the estimated fair value with the recorded net book value (including goodwill) of our
business. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book
value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value, then a second step
must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required, if any. In this second step, the
estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition
of the reporting unit. Business combination accounting rules are followed to determine a
hypothetical purchase price allocation to the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. The residual
amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared to
the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written down to
the hypothetical amount, if lower. The application of this second step under goodwill impairment
testing may also result in impairments of other long-lived assets, including identified intangible
assets. See Impairment of Long-Lived Assets section below for a discussion of other asset
impairments that were identified as part of the testing of goodwill as of March 31, 2016.
Because quoted market prices for our reporting units other than Compression are not available,
our management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting
units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available
information to make these fair value determinations, including the present value of expected
future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets. The
resultant fair values calculated for the reporting units are then compared to observable metrics for
other companies in our industry or to mergers and acquisitions in our industry to determine
whether those valuations, in our judgment, appear reasonable.
8
The accounting principles regarding goodwill acknowledge that the observed market prices of
individual trades of a company’s stock (and thus its computed market capitalization) may not be
representative of the fair value of the company as a whole. Substantial value may arise from the
ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another entity.
Consequently, measuring the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that operate
together in a controlled entity is different from measuring the fair value of a single share of that
entity’s common stock. Therefore, once the fair value of the reporting units was determined, we
also added a control premium to the calculations. This control premium is judgmental and is
based on observed mergers and acquisitions in our industry.
Goodwill Impairment as of March 31, 2016. As part of our internal annual business outlook for
each of our reporting units that we performed during the fourth quarter of 2015, we considered
changes in the global economic environment that affected our stock price and market
capitalization. As part of the first step of goodwill impairment testing as of March 31, 2016, we
updated our annual assessment of the future cash flows for each of our reporting units, applying
expected long-term growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values that we consider
reasonable for each reporting unit. We calculated a present value of the respective cash flows for
each of the reporting units to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach, and
then used the market approach to corroborate these values.
During the first three months of 2016, low oil and natural gas commodity prices resulted in
decreased demand for many of the products and services of each of our reporting units.
However, based on updated assumptions as of March 31, 2016, we determined that the fair value
of our Fluids Division was significantly in excess of its carrying value, which includes $6.6 million
of goodwill. Our Offshore Services and Maritech Divisions had no remaining goodwill as of
March 31, 2016. With regard to our Compression Division, demand for low-horsepower wellhead
compression services and for sales of compressor equipment decreased significantly and is
expected to continue to be decreased for the foreseeable future. In addition, the price per
common unit of CCLP as of March 31, 2016 decreased compared to December 31, 2015.
Accordingly, the fair value, including the market capitalization for CCLP, for the Compression
reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016, despite impairments
recorded as of December 31, 2015. For our Production Testing Division, demand for production
testing services decreased in each of the market areas in which we operate, resulting in
decreased estimated future cash flows. As a result, the fair value of the Production Testing
reporting unit was also less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016, despite impairments
recorded as of December 31, 2015. After making the hypothetical purchase price adjustments as
part of the second step of the goodwill impairment test, there was $0.0 million residual purchase
price to be allocated to the goodwill of both the Compression and Production Testing reporting
units. Based on this analysis, we concluded that full impairments of the $92.4 million of recorded
goodwill for Compression and $13.9 million of recorded goodwill for Production Testing were
required. Accordingly, during the three month period ended March 31, 2016, $106.2 million was
charged to Goodwill Impairment expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations.
As of June 30, 2016, we determined that there was no additional impairment of goodwill, as the
fair value of our Fluids Division remains in excess of its carrying value. The carrying amounts of
goodwill for the Fluids, Production Testing, Compression, and Offshore Services reporting units
are net of $23.8 million, $111.8 million, $231.8 million, and $27.2 million, respectively, of
accumulated impairment losses. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

Impairments of Long-Lived Assets
Impairments of long-lived assets, including identified intangible assets, are determined
periodically when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, the
determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future
undiscounted operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their remaining
estimated useful lives. If these undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the
related asset, an impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.
Fair value of intangible assets is generally determined using the discounted present value of
future cash flows. Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair
value less estimated selling costs.
During the first six months of 2016, primarily as a result of continuing decreased demand due to
current market conditions, our Compression, Production Testing, and Fluids segments recorded
$7.9 million, $2.8 million, and $0.3 million, respectively, of impairments associated with certain
identified intangible assets. These amounts were charged to Impairments of Long-Lived Assets
expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

Foreign Currency Translation
 
We have designated the euro, the British pound, the Norwegian krone, the Canadian dollar, the
Brazilian real, the Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso, respectively, as the functional currency
for our operations in Finland and Sweden, the United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, Brazil,
Argentina, and certain of our operations in Mexico. The U.S. dollar is the designated functional
currency for all of our other foreign operations. The cumulative
10
translation effects of translating the applicable accounts from the functional currencies into the
U.S. dollar at current exchange rates are included as a separate component of equity. Foreign
currency exchange gains and (losses) are included in Other Expense and totaled $0.4 million
and $0.7 million during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and $(0.7) million
and $(1.4) million during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively.
Income Taxes
Our consolidated provision for income taxes during the first six months of 2015 and 2016 is
primarily attributable to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes. Our
consolidated effective tax rates for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 of
negative 6.4% and negative 0.2%, respectively, were primarily the result of losses generated in
entities for which no related tax benefit has been recorded. The losses generated by these
entities do not result in tax benefits due to offsetting valuation allowances being recorded against
the related net deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax
assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Included in our deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits
that are available to offset future income tax liabilities in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign
jurisdictions. Further, the effective tax rate is negatively impacted by the nondeductible portion of
our goodwill impairments recorded during the three month period ended March 31, 2016.
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
Fair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date” within an
entity’s principal market, if any. The principal market is the market in which the reporting entity
would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the greatest volume and level of activity,
regardless of whether it is the market in which the entity will ultimately transact for a particular
asset or liability or if a different market is potentially more advantageous. Accordingly, this exit
price concept may result in a fair value that may differ from the transaction price or market price of
the asset or liability.
 
Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the fair value hierarchy
prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value measurements
should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs,
where possible. Observable inputs are developed based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs may be needed to measure fair value in
situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement
date and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which
could include the reporting entity’s own judgments about the assumptions market participants
would utilize in pricing the asset or liability.
 
We utilize fair value measurements to account for certain items and account balances within our
consolidated financial statements. Fair value measurements are utilized in the allocation of
purchase consideration for acquisition transactions to the assets and liabilities acquired,
including intangible assets and goodwill (a level 3 fair value measurement). In addition, we
utilize fair value measurements in the initial recording of our decommissioning and other asset
retirement obligations. Fair value measurements may also be utilized on a nonrecurring basis,
such as for the impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill (a level 3 fair value
measurement). The fair value of certain of our financial instruments, which include cash,
restricted cash, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt pursuant to our
bank credit agreements, approximate their carrying amounts. The aggregate fair values of our
long-term 11% Senior Notes and Tender Offer Senior Notes at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, were approximately $117.7 million and $229.8 million, respectively, compared to carrying
amounts of $125.0 million and $275.0 million, respectively, as current interest rates on those
dates were different than the stated interest rates on these notes . The fair values of the publicly
traded CCLP Senior Notes (as herein defined) at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, were
approximately $287.9 million and $259.9 million (a level 2 fair value measurement) compared to
a face amount of $350.0 million (see Note C - Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings, for further
discussion), as current rates on those dates were different from the stated interest rates on the
CCLP Senior Notes. We calculated the fair values of our 11% Senior Notes and Tender Offer
Senior Notes as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, internally, using current market
conditions and average cost of debt (a level 2 fair value measurement).
We also utilize fair value measurements on a recurring basis in the accounting for our foreign
currency forward sale derivative contracts. For these fair value measurements, we utilize the
quoted value as determined by
11
our counterparty financial institution (a level 2 fair value measurement). A summary of these fair
value measurements as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is as follows:

During the first quarter of 2016, in connection with the review of goodwill impairment of our
Compression and Production Testing Divisions, these segments recorded total impairment
charges of $117.1 million, reflecting the decreased fair value for certain assets. For further
discussion, see "Goodwill" and "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" section above. The fair values
used in these impairment calculations were estimated based on a variety of measurements,
including current replacement cost and discounted estimated future cash flows, all of which are
based on significant unobservable inputs (a level 3 fair value measurement) in accordance with
the fair value hierarchy. A summary of these nonrecurring fair value measurements as of June 30,

New Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards
Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 supersedes
the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605,
Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is

that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, under either full or modified
retrospective adoption. We are currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to our
consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)" to clarify
the guidance on principal versus agent considerations. This ASU does not change the effective
date or adoption method under ASU 2014-09 which is noted above.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing" to clarify the guidance on identifying
performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. This ASU does not change
the effective date or adoption method under ASU 2014-09, which is noted above.
Additionally in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients". This ASU
addresses and amends several aspects of ASU 2014-09, but does not change the core principle
of the guidance. This ASU does not change the effective date or adoption method under ASU
2014-09 which is noted above.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements -
Going Concern.” The ASU provides guidance on management's responsibility to evaluate
whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and in
certain circumstances to provide related footnote disclosures. The ASU is effective for annual
periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early
adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact
on our consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, “Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-
30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.”  The ASU requires entities that have
historically presented debt financing costs as an asset to present those costs as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. This presentation will result in the
debt issuance costs being presented the same way debt discounts have historically been
handled. The ASU does not change the recognition, measurement, or subsequent measurement
guidance for debt issuance costs. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
December
13
15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods and is to be applied retrospectively. As
a result of the retrospective adoption of this guidance during the quarter, deferred financing costs
of $10.6 million and $13.5 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are
netted against the carrying values of the Senior Notes of TETRA and CCLP.
Additionally, in accordance with ASU No. 2015-15, "Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-
30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-
of-Credit Arrangements", issued in August 2015, we elected to present the deferred financing
costs associated with the bank credit facilities of $5.8 million and $6.7 million at June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, as netted against the outstanding amount of the bank
credit facilities of TETRA and CCLP.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory”
(Topic 330), which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring entities to
measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventory measured
using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory methods. The ASU requires entities to
compare the cost of inventory to one measure - net realizable value. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of
completion, disposal and transportation. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, and is to be applied
prospectively with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases" (Topic 842) to increase
comparability and transparency among different organizations. Organizations are required to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information
about the leasing arrangements and cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, under a
modified retrospective adoption with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the
potential effects of these changes to our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" as part of a simplification
initiative. The update addresses and simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based
payment transactions. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted, and is to be
applied using either modified retrospective, retrospective, or prospective transition method based
on which amendment is being applied. We are currently assessing the potential effects of these
changes to our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." ASU 2016-13 amends the
impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred
loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses. ASU 2016-13 also
applies to employee benefit plan accounting, with an effective date of the first quarter of fiscal
year 2022. We are currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to our consolidated
financial statements and employee benefit plans accounting.

As a result of the retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03 during the three months ended March
31, 2016, deferred financing costs of $16.4 million and $20.2 million at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, were reclassified out of long-term other assets and are netted
against the carrying values of the bank credit facilities and Senior Notes of TETRA and CCLP. In
addition, $1.0 million and $2.1 million of expense for the amortization of deferred financing costs
for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and $1.0 million
15
and $1.8 million for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively, were
reclassified from Other Expense, net to Interest Expense, net in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
As of June 30, 2016, TETRA (excluding CCLP) had an outstanding balance on its Credit
Agreement of $102.7 million, and had $8.1 million in letters of credit and guarantees against the
revolving credit facility, leaving a net availability of $114.2 million. As of June 30, 2016, CCLP
had a balance outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement of $236.0 million, had $2.1 million
letters of credit and performance bonds outstanding, leaving a net availability under the CCLP
Credit Agreement of $101.9 million. Availability under each of the TETRA Credit Agreement and
the CCLP Credit Agreement is subject to compliance with the respective financial covenants and
other provisions in the respective credit agreements that may limit borrowings thereunder.
As described below, we and CCLP are in compliance with all covenants of our respective credit
agreements and senior note agreements as of June 30, 2016. Based on our financial projections
and including the impact of cost reduction efforts and expected activity levels on future estimated
operating cash flows, we anticipate that, despite the current industry environment and activity
levels, we will have sufficient operating cash flows to maintain compliance with the financial
covenants under our amended debt agreements through June 30, 2017. With regard to CCLP,
considering financial forecasts based on current market conditions as of August 9, 2016, and as
a result of the impact of recent cost reduction efforts, the May 2016 amendment of certain
financial covenants under the CCLP Credit Agreement, and the August 2016 receipt of $49.8
million of net proceeds from the Private Placement of the CCLP Preferred Units (including $10.0
million of proceeds received from us related to our purchase of a portion of the CCLP Preferred
Units), CCLP believes that it will have adequate liquidity to fund its operations and debt
obligations and maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our amended debt
agreements through June 30, 2017.
    
Our Long-Term Debt
Our Credit Agreement. On July 1, 2016, we entered into an amendment (the "Fourth
Amendment") of our Credit Agreement that replaced and modified certain financial covenants in
the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, the interest charge coverage ratio
covenant was deleted and replaced with a fixed charge coverage ratio. The fixed charge
coverage ratio compares (a) EBITDA (as adjusted and defined in the Credit Agreement) less (1)
cash income tax expense, (2) non-financed capital expenditures, and (3) cash dividends and
distributions to (b) interest expense plus (1) scheduled principal payments and (2) stock
purchases. The Fourth Amendment provides that the fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less
than 1.25 to 1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant was
amended and may not exceed (a) 4.00 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the
period from and including June 30, 2016 through and including March 31, 2018, (b) 3.75 to 1 at
the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including June 30, 2018 through
and including December 31, 2018, and (c) 3.5 to 1 at the end of each of the fiscal quarters
thereafter. In addition, subsequent to the Fourth Amendment, borrowings will bear interest at the
British Bankers Association LIBOR rate plus 2.25% to 4.00%, or an alternate base rate plus
0.00% to 1.00%, in each case depending on one of our financial ratios, and the commitment fee
on unused portions of the facility will range from 0.35% to 0.75%. The Fourth Amendment also
resulted in additional modifications, including a requirement that all obligations under the Credit
Agreement and the guarantees of such obligations be secured by first-lien security interests in
substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries (limited, in the case of foreign
subsidiaries, to 66% of the voting stock or equity interests of first-tier foreign subsidiaries). Such
security interests are for the benefit of the lenders of the Credit Agreement as well as the holder
of our 11% Senior Notes. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, bank fees and other financing
costs of $0.8 million were incurred, including $0.1 million that were charged to general and
administrative expense during the three month period ended June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.27 to 1 (compared to 4.00 to 1 maximum
as required under the Credit Agreement) and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.32 to 1
(compared to a 1.25 to 1 minimum required under the Credit Agreement).
Our Senior Notes. In May 2016, we purchased for cash the Tender Offer Senior Notes, in the
aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, pursuant to
previously announced Tender Offers. The consideration paid for the Tender Offer Senior Notes
was a cash amount equal to $100,000 per $100,000 principal amount of the Tender Offer Senior
Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) prior to the expiration time of each Tender
Offer, and validly accepted for purchase by us. The purchase of the Tender Offer Senior Notes
was funded by borrowings under our Credit Agreement. In connection with the repayment of the
16
Tender Offer Senior Notes, approximately $0.4 million of remaining unamortized deferred finance
costs were charged to other expense during the three month period ended June 30, 2016.
In June 2016, and following the issuance of 11.5 million shares of our common stock, we utilized
a portion of the $60.4 million of net proceeds to repay the remaining $30.0 million outstanding
under our Senior Secured Notes. The remaining proceeds were used to pay offering related
expenses and reduce the amount of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement. In
connection with the repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, $1.1 million of remaining
unamortized deferred finance costs were charged to other expense during the three month period
ended June 30, 2016.
On July 1, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (the
"Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement") with GSO Tetra Holdings LP ("GSO"), to
amend and replace the previous Note Purchase Agreement relating to our $125.0 million
aggregate principal amount of 11% Senior Notes due November 5, 2022 (the "11% Senior
Notes"). The Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement amends certain financial
covenants, including replacing the interest coverage ratio covenant in the previous Note
Purchase Agreement with a minimum permitted fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of any
fiscal quarter of 1.1 to 1. Additionally, the maximum permitted ratio of consolidated funded
indebtedness at the end of any fiscal quarter to a defined measure of earnings increased from
3.50 to 1 to (a) 4.50 to 1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period commencing
July 1, 2016 and ending on March 31, 2018, (b) 4.25 to1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending
during the period commencing on June 30, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018 and (c) 4.00
to 1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending thereafter. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated
11% Senior Note Agreement, the 11% Senior Notes are now secured by first-lien security
interests in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries. See the above
discussion of the Fourth Amendment to our Credit Agreement for a description of these security
interests. The 11% Senior Notes are now pari passu in right of payment to all borrowings under
the Credit Agreement and rank at least pari passu in right of payment with all other outstanding
indebtedness. The Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement contains customary
covenants that limit our ability to, among other things; incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness; incur or create liens; merge or consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets;
engage in a different business; enter into transactions with affiliates; and make certain payments
as set forth in the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement. Pursuant to the
Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement, lender fees and other financing costs of
$1.2 million were incurred, including $0.2 million that were charged to general and administrative
expense during the three month period ended June 30, 2016.
The Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement contains customary default provisions,
as well as the following cross-default provision. An event of default will occur if we (i) fail to make
any payment when due beyond any applicable grace period under any indebtedness of at least
$20.0 million, (ii) default in the performance of any obligation under the Amended and Restated
11% Senior Note Agreement or collateral documents and such default is not remedied within the
applicable cure period, (iii) default in the performance of or compliance with any term of any
indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of at least $20.0 million or of any
mortgage, indenture or other agreement relating to such indebtedness or any other condition
exists, and as a result of such default or condition such indebtedness is accelerated and
declared due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates for
payment, (iv) we become obligated to purchase or repay indebtedness before its regular maturity
or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment in an aggregate outstanding principal amount
of at least $20.0 million or one or more persons have the right to require us to purchase or repay
such indebtedness or (v) with certain exceptions, the security interest in the collateral ceases to
be in full force and effect. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default
under the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement, the 11% Senior Notes may
become immediately due and payable, either automatically or by declaration of holders of more
than 50% in principal amount of the 11% Senior Notes at the time outstanding.
CCLP Long-Term Debt
CCLP Credit Agreement. On May 25, 2016, CCLP entered into an amendment (the "CCLP Third
Amendment") to the CCLP Credit Agreement that, among other things, modified certain financial
covenants in the CCLP Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the CCLP Third Amendment, the
consolidated total leverage ratio may not exceed (a) 5.50 to 1 as of June 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2016; (b) 5.75 to 1 as of December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and
September 30, 2017; (c) 5.50 to 1 as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018; (d) 5.25 to 1 as
of June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018, and (e) 5.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2018 and
thereafter. In addition, the consolidated secured leverage ratio was reduced from 4.00 to 1 to 3.50
to 1. The consolidated total leverage ratio and the consolidated secured leverage ratio, as both
are calculated under the CCLP Credit
17
Agreement, will exclude the long-term liability for the CCLP Preferred Units, among other items,
in the determination of total indebtedness. In addition, the CCLP Third Amendment provided for
other changes related to the CCLP Credit Agreement including (i) reducing the maximum
aggregate lender commitments from $400.0 million to $340.0 million; (ii) increasing the
applicable margin by 0.25% with a range between 2.00% and 3.00% per annum for LIBOR-
based loans and 1.00% to 2.00% per annum for base-rate loans, based on the applicable
consolidated total leverage ratio; (iii) imposed a requirement that CCLP use designated
consolidated cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of $35.0 million to prepay the loans;
(iv) imposed a requirement to deliver on an annual basis, and at such other times as may be
required, an appraisal of CCLP's compressor equipment; (v) increased the amount of equipment
and real property that may be disposed of in any four consecutive fiscal quarters from $5.0 million
to $20.0 million; (vi) allows the prepayment or purchase of indebtedness with proceeds from the
issuances of equity securities or in exchange for the issuances of equity securities; and (vii)
reduced the amount of CCLP's permitted capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business
during each fiscal year from $150.0 million to an amount generally ranging from $25.0 million in
2016 to $75.0 million in 2019. Pursuant to the CCLP Third Amendment, bank fees and financing
costs of $0.7 million were incurred and charged to Other Expense during the three month period
ended June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016, CCLP's consolidated total leverage ratio was 5.04 to 1 (compared to 5.50 to 1
maximum as required under the CCLP Credit Agreement) and its interest coverage ratio was
3.81 to 1 (compared to a 3.0 to 1 minimum required under the CCLP Credit Agreement).
CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes
On August 8, 2016, in connection with the closing of the Private Placement, CCLP entered into a
Note Repurchase Agreement (the “CCLP Note Repurchase Agreement”) with Hudson Bay Fund
LP pursuant to which CCLP agreed to repurchase up to $20.0 million of its CCLP 7.25% Senior
Notes due August 15, 2022 (the “CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes”). At any time and up to four times in
the aggregate during the period beginning on September 12, 2016 and ending on October 12,
2016, Hudson Bay Fund LP may deliver a written notice to CCLP indicating the applicable
closing date (the “CCLP Note Repurchase Closing Date”) and the principal amount of CCLP
7.25% Senior Notes to be purchased by CCLP. The repurchase of the CCLP 7.25% Senior
Notes by CCLP is conditioned on it receiving proceeds from the sale of additional equity
securities of CCLP, including, without limitation, additional CCLP Preferred Units or Series A
Parity Securities (as defined in the Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement) between
August 8, 2016 and October 12, 2016. Additionally, the repurchase price on any CCLP Note
Repurchase Closing Date shall not be greater than the proceeds then received by CCLP from
the sale of equity described in the preceding sentence. For further discussion of the CCLP
Preferred Units, see Note C - CCLP Series A Convertible Preferred Units.
NOTE C – CCLP SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED UNITS
On August 8, 2016, CCLP entered into a Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (the
“CCLP Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement”) with certain purchasers (collectively, the
“Purchasers”) to issue and sell in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) an aggregate of
4,374,454 of CSI Compressco LP Series A Convertible Preferred Units representing limited
partner interests in CCLP (the “CCLP Preferred Units”) for a cash purchase price of $11.43 per
CCLP Preferred Unit (the “Issue Price”), resulting in total net proceeds to CCLP, after deducting
certain offering expenses, of $49.8 million. We purchased 874,891 of the CCLP Preferred Units
at the Issue Price, aggregating $10.0 million. The CCLP Preferred Units, net of the units we
purchased, will be classified as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The net
proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to pay additional offering expenses and
reduce outstanding CCLP indebtedness under the CCLP Credit Agreement or the CCLP 7.25%
Senior Notes.
Pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, in connection with the closing, CSI Compressco GP
Inc (our wholly owned subsidiary) executed a Second Amended and Restated Agreement of
Limited Partnership of CCLP (the “Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement”) to,
among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the CCLP Preferred
Units. The CCLP Preferred Units are a new class of equity security that will rank senior to all
classes or series of equity securities of CCLP with respect to distribution rights and rights upon
liquidation. We and the other holders of CCLP Preferred Units (each, a “CCLP Preferred
Unitholder”) will receive quarterly distributions, which will be paid in kind in additional CCLP
Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of 11.00% of the Issue Price ($1.2573 per unit
annualized), subject to certain adjustments. The rights of the CCLP Preferred Units include
certain anti-dilution adjustments, including adjustments for economic dilution resulting from the
issuance of common units in the future below a set price.
18
A ratable portion of the CCLP Preferred Units will be converted each month over a period of thirty
months beginning in the seventh calendar month following the closing (each, a “Conversion
Date”), subject to certain provisions of the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement
that may delay or accelerate all or a portion of such monthly conversions. On each Conversion
Date, the CCLP Preferred Units will convert into common units representing limited partner
interests in CCLP in an amount equal to, with respect to each CCLP Preferred Unitholder, the
number of CCLP Preferred Units held by such CCLP Preferred Unitholder divided by the number
of Conversion Dates remaining, subject to adjustment described in the Amended and Restated
CCLP Partnership Agreement, with the conversion price determined by a the trading prices of the
common units over the previous month, among other factors, and as otherwise impacted by the
existence of certain conditions related to the common units. CCLP may, at its option, pay cash, or
a combination of cash and common units, to the CCLP Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing
common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the
Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement and the CCLP Credit Agreement.
In addition, each Purchaser may convert its CCLP Preferred Units, generally on a one-for-one
basis and subject to adjustment for certain splits, combinations, reclassifications or other similar
transactions and certain anti-dilution adjustments, in whole or in part, at any time following May
31, 2017 so long as any conversion is not for less than $250,000 or such lesser amount, if such
conversion relates to all of such Purchaser’s remaining CCLP Preferred Units. CCLP has the
right to be reimbursed for any cash distributions paid with respect to common units issued in any
such optional conversion until March 31, 2018. The CCLP Preferred Units will vote on an as-
converted basis with the common units and will have certain other rights to vote as a class with
respect to any amendment to the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement that
would affect any rights, preferences or privileges of the CCLP Preferred Units, as more fully
described in the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement.
In addition, the CCLP Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement includes certain provisions regarding
change of control, transfer of CCLP Preferred Units, indemnities, and other matters described in
detail in the CCLP Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement. In connection with the closing, CCLP
agreed to pay a transaction fee of $1.2 million to its financial advisor for this transaction. The
CCLP Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and
covenants of CCLP and the Purchasers.
On August 8, 2016, in connection with the closing, CCLP entered into a Registration Rights
Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Purchasers relating to the registered
resale of the common units issuable upon conversion of the CCLP Preferred Units, including any
CCLP Preferred Units issued in kind pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated CCLP
Partnership Agreement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, CCLP is required to file
or cause to be filed a registration statement for such registered resale at its expense no later than
90 days after the closing and is required to cause the registration statement to become effective
no later than 180 days after the closing, subject to certain liquidated damages set forth in the
Registration Rights Agreement if such obligations are not met.
CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes Purchase Agreement. On August 8, 2016, in connection with the
closing of the Private Placement for CCLP Preferred Units, CCLP entered into a CCLP Note
Repurchase Agreement pursuant to which it agreed to repurchase up to $20.0 million of its
7.25% Senior Notes. For further discussion of this CCLP Note Repurchase Agreement, see Note
B - Long-Term Debt.
NOTE D – DECOMMISSIONING AND OTHER ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
The large majority of our asset retirement obligations consists of the remaining future well
abandonment and decommissioning costs for offshore oil and gas properties and platforms
owned by our Maritech subsidiary, including the decommissioning and debris removal costs
associated with its remaining offshore platforms previously destroyed by hurricanes. The amount
of decommissioning liabilities recorded by Maritech is reduced by amounts allocable to joint
interest owners in these properties and platforms.
We also operate facilities in various U.S. and foreign locations that are used in the manufacture,
storage, and sale of our products, inventories, and equipment. These facilities are a combination
of owned and leased assets. The values of our asset retirement obligations for these non-
Maritech properties were $9.5 million and $9.1 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. We are required to take certain actions in connection with the retirement of
these assets. We have reviewed our obligations in this regard in detail and estimated the cost of
these actions. The original estimates are the fair values that have been recorded for retiring
19
these long-lived assets. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the
carrying amount of these long-lived assets. The costs for non-oil and gas assets are depreciated
on a straight-line basis over the life of the assets.
The changes in the values of our asset retirement obligations during the three and six month
period ended June 30, 2016, are as follows:
Beginning balance for the period, as
reported

)
We review the adequacy of our asset retirement obligation liabilities whenever indicators suggest
that the estimated cash flows underlying the liabilities have changed. For our Maritech segment,
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the oil and gas industry
environment and other factors and may result in additional liabilities and charges to earnings to
be recorded.
Asset retirement obligations are recorded in accordance with FASB ASC 410, Asset Retirement
and Environmental Obligations, whereby the estimated fair value of a liability for asset retirement
obligations be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and in which a reasonable estimate
can be made. Such estimates are based on relevant assumptions that we believe are
reasonable. The cost estimates for our Maritech asset retirement obligations are considered
reasonable estimates consistent with current market conditions, and we believe reflect the
amount of work legally obligated to be performed in accordance with Bureau of Safety and
Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") standards, as revised from time to time.
NOTE E – MARKET RISKS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS
 
We are exposed to financial and market risks that affect our businesses. We have concentrations
of credit risk as a result of trade receivables owed to us by companies in the energy industry. We
have currency exchange rate risk exposure related to transactions denominated in foreign
currencies as well as to investments in certain of our international operations. As a result of our
variable rate bank credit facilities, including the variable rate credit facility of CCLP, we face
market risk exposure related to changes in applicable interest rates. Our financial risk
management activities may at times involve, among other measures, the use of derivative
financial instruments, such as swap and collar agreements, to hedge the impact of market price
risk exposures.
Derivative Contracts
Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts. We and CCLP enter into 30-day foreign currency forward
derivative contracts as part of a program designed to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk
exposure on selected transactions of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2016, we and
CCLP had the following foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding relating to portions of
our foreign operations:

Under this program, we and CCLP may enter into similar derivative contracts from time to time.
Although contracts pursuant to this program will serve as an economic hedge of the cash flow of
our currency exchange risk exposure, they are not formally designated as hedge contracts or
qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, any change in the fair value of these
derivative instruments during a period will be included in the determination of earnings for that
period.
The fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments are based on quoted market values as
reported to us by our counterparty (a level 2 fair value measurement). The fair values of our and
CCLP's foreign currency derivative instruments as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are

None of the foreign currency derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features
that would require us to post assets or collateral for contracts that are classified as liabilities.
During the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $1.1 million and
$1.2 million of net losses, respectively, reflected in other income (expense) associated with our
foreign currency derivative program. During the three and six month periods ended June 30,
2015, we recognized $0.2 million and $(0.3) million, of net losses and gains, respectively,
reflected in other income (expense) associated with this program.

Issuance of Common Stock. On June 21, 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of
11.5 million shares of our common stock, which included 1.5 million shares of common stock
pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a price to the
public of $5.50 per share ($5.2525 per share net of underwriting discounts). We utilized the net
offering proceeds of $60.4 million to repay the remaining balance outstanding of our Senior
Secured Notes, to reduce the balance outstanding under our Credit Agreement, to pay offering
related discounts and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. The offering was made
pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
March 23, 2016.
22
Issuance of CCLP Preferred Units. In August 2016, CCLP received $49.8 million of net proceeds,
after deducting certain offering expenses, from the Private Placement of the CCLP Preferred
Units. (For further discussion of the issuance of CCLP Preferred Units, see Note C - CCLP
Series A Convertible Preferred Units.)
NOTE G – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Litigation
 
We are named defendants in several lawsuits and respondents in certain governmental
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits or other
proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it
reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits or other proceedings in excess of
any amounts accrued has been incurred that is expected to have a material adverse impact on
our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
 
Environmental
 
One of our subsidiaries, TETRA Micronutrients, Inc. ("TMI"), previously owned and operated a
production facility located in Fairbury, Nebraska. TMI is subject to an Administrative Order on
Consent issued to American Microtrace, Inc. (n/k/a/ TETRA Micronutrients, Inc.) in the
proceeding styled In the Matter of American Microtrace Corporation, EPA I.D. No.
NED00610550, Respondent, Docket No. VII-98-H-0016, dated September 25, 1998 (the
"Consent Order"), with regard to the Fairbury facility. TMI is liable for ongoing environmental
monitoring at the Fairbury facility under the Consent Order; however, the current owner of the
Fairbury facility is responsible for costs associated with the closure of that facility. While the
outcome cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it reasonably
possible that a loss in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred or is expected to have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Other Contingencies
During 2011, in connection with the sale of a significant majority of Maritech’s oil and gas
producing properties, the buyers of the properties assumed the associated decommissioning
liabilities pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements. For those oil and gas properties
Maritech previously operated, the buyers of the properties assumed the financial responsibilities
associated with the properties' operations, including abandonment and decommissioning, and
generally became the successor operator. Some buyers of these Maritech properties
subsequently sold certain of these properties to other buyers who also assumed these financial
responsibilities associated with the properties' operations, and these buyers also typically
became the successor operator of the properties. To the extent that a buyer of these properties
fails to perform the abandonment and decommissioning work required, the previous owner,
including Maritech, may be required to perform the abandonment and decommissioning
obligation. A significant portion of the decommissioning liabilities that were assumed by the
buyers of the Maritech properties in 2011 remains unperformed and we believe the amounts of
these remaining liabilities are significant. We monitor the financial condition of the buyers of
these properties from Maritech, and if current oil and natural gas pricing levels continue, we
expect that one or more of these buyers may be unable to perform the decommissioning work
required on the properties acquired from Maritech.
    
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, continued low oil and natural gas prices have
resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for all oil and gas producing companies, including
those companies that bought Maritech properties in the past. Certain of these oil and gas
producing companies that bought Maritech properties are currently experiencing severe financial
difficulties. With regard to certain of these properties, Maritech has security in the form of bonds or
cash escrows intended to secure the buyers' obligations to perform the decommissioning work.
One company that bought, and subsequently sold, Maritech properties filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Maritech and its legal counsel continue to monitor the
status of these companies. As of June 30, 2016, we do not consider the likelihood of Maritech
becoming liable for decommissioning liabilities on sold properties to be probable.
Maritech has encountered situations where previously plugged and abandoned wells on its
properties have later exhibited a buildup of pressure, which is evidenced by gas bubbles coming
from the plugged well head. We refer to this situation as “wells under pressure” and this can
either be discovered when performing additional work at the property or by notification from a
third party. Wells under pressure require Maritech to return to the site to perform additional plug
and abandonment procedures that were not originally anticipated and included in the estimate of
the asset retirement obligation for such property. Remediation work at previously abandoned well
sites
23
is particularly costly, due to the lack of a platform from which to base these activities. Maritech is
the last operator of record for its plugged wells, and bears the risk of additional future work
required as a result of wells becoming pressurized in the future.
NOTE H – INDUSTRY SEGMENTS
 
We manage our operations through five reporting segments organized into four divisions: Fluids,
Production Testing, Compression, and Offshore.
 
Our Fluids Division manufactures and markets clear brine fluids, additives, and associated
products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling, completion, and workover
operations in the United States and in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, the
Middle East, and Africa. The division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products
manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third-party suppliers to a variety of
markets outside the energy industry. The Fluids Division also provides domestic onshore oil and
gas operators with comprehensive water management services.
 
Our Production Testing Division provides frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig
cooling, and other associated services in many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the
United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as in basins in certain regions in South America,
Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.
The Compression Division is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas
and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression
Division's equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor
packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield pump systems designed and
fabricated at the division's facilities. The Compression Division's aftermarket services business
provides compressor package reconfiguration and maintenance services as well as providing
compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The
Compression Division provides its services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil
exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating
throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of
foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, and Argentina.
 
Our Offshore Division consists of two operating segments: Offshore Services and Maritech. The
Offshore Services segment provides (1) downhole and subsea services such as well plugging
and abandonment and workover services, (2) decommissioning and certain construction services
utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas
production platforms and pipelines, and (3) conventional and saturation diving services.
 
The Maritech segment is a limited oil and gas production operation. During 2011 and the first
quarter of 2012, Maritech sold substantially all of its oil and gas producing property interests.
Maritech’s operations consist primarily of the ongoing abandonment and decommissioning
associated with its remaining offshore wells and production platforms. Maritech intends to
acquire a portion of these services from the Offshore Services segment.
 
We generally evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to our segments based on
profit or loss from their operations before income taxes and nonrecurring charges, return on
investment, and other criteria. Transfers between segments and geographic areas are priced at
the estimated fair value of the products or services as negotiated between the operating units.
“Corporate overhead” includes corporate general and administrative expenses, corporate
depreciation and amortization, interest income and expense, and other income and expense.
Summarized financial information concerning the business segments is as follows:

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be
read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes included in this Quarterly Report. In addition, the following discussion and analysis also
should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 4, 2016. This discussion includes forward-
looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties.
Business Overview
In response to the continuing current oil and gas industry environment and the diminished
demand for many of our products and services, we and our CSI Compressco LP subsidiary
("CCLP") have taken several steps to reduce costs and preserve liquidity. Our consolidated
results of operations during the three months ended June 30, 2016 continue to reflect the
challenges experienced by each of our businesses and they also reflect the aggressive
reductions in operating and administrative costs we and CCLP have made through headcount
reductions, salary reductions, work week reductions, suspension of matching contribution under
the 401(k) retirement plan, and other cost reduction efforts designed to partially mitigate the
impact of decreased revenues. We also continue to negotiate with our suppliers and service
providers to reduce costs in the current environment. Growth and maintenance capital
expenditure levels continue to be significantly reduced for each of our businesses, as we are
conserving cash in the current environment until such reductions are no longer justified by
expected future activity levels. Significant steps have been taken to strengthen our consolidated
balance sheet, maximize liquidity, and enhance our compliance with debt financial covenants.
These efforts included (i) entering into amendments to our revolving bank credit facility, our Note
Purchase Agreement dated November 5, 2015, and the revolving bank credit facility for CCLP;
(ii) tender offers to retire $100 million principal amount of certain of our outstanding senior notes;
(iii) our issuance of common equity for proceeds used to retire indebtedness; and (iv) the
issuance by CCLP of preferred units for proceeds used to retire CCLP indebtedness. Following
these transactions, our earliest scheduled maturity of long-term debt is in September 2019 and
CCLP's earliest scheduled maturity of long-term debt is in August 2019. We and CCLP believe
that each of the cost reduction and capital structuring measures taken enhances our respective
abilities to continue to remain fiscally responsible for the uncertain duration of the current
operating environment, and position each of us to capitalize on growth opportunities as industry
conditions improve. We and CCLP will, as applicable, consider certain additional debt and/or
equity financing transactions with a view of generating additional cash to reduce the amounts of
our outstanding borrowings under our respective credit agreements, repay or refinance additional
amounts of our 11% Senior Notes due November 5, 2022 (the "11% Senior Notes"), and
generate additional liquidity.
Our consolidated results of operations during the three months ended June 30, 2016 continue to
reflect the challenges experienced by each of our businesses in the current oil and gas services
environment. Decreased demand for most of our products and services reflects the industry-wide
reduction in drilling and completion activity which has resulted in decreased revenues for each of
our segments during the current year period compared to the corresponding prior year period.
The 44.5% decrease in consolidated revenues during the current year quarter compared to the
prior year quarter reflects both the decrease in activity and the competitive pricing pressures
experienced by the majority of our businesses in each of their operating regions. Consolidated
gross profit decreased 76.7%, despite cost reduction measures taken by each of our businesses,
largely due to the benefit during the prior year period from a customer project associated with a
completion fluids technology that was introduced during 2015. The impact from decreased
consolidated cash provided from operating activities during the current year period compared to
the prior year period was more than offset by decreased capital expenditure activity for these
periods. We continue to consider additional cost reductions as well as maintaining our efforts to
manage working capital, particularly in the collection of customer receivables. We also continue
to monitor the evolving financial condition of many of our customers during this current downturn,
balancing the benefits of generating operating cash flows with the risk of exposing our
businesses to additional credit risk exposure.
We do not analyze or manage our capital structure on a consolidated basis, as there are no cross
default provisions, cross collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees between CCLP's long-
term debt and TETRA's long-term debt. Approximately $569.2 million of our consolidated debt
balance is owed by CCLP, and is to be serviced by CCLP's existing cash balances and cash
provided by CCLP's operations (less its capital expenditures) and is secured by the assets of
CCLP.
The following table provides condensed consolidating balance sheet information reflecting our
net assets and CCLP's net assets that service and secure our and CCLP's respective capital
structures.

TETRA’s debt is serviced by its existing cash balances and cash provided from operating
activities (excluding CCLP) and the distributions received from CCLP in excess of cash capital
expenditures (excluding CCLP). During the six months ended June 30, 2016, consolidated cash
provided from operating activities was $33.6 million, which included $35.6 million generated by
CCLP. Our cash provided from operating activities is reduced by the amount we spent on
Maritech decommissioning liabilities, which was $3.4 million during the six months ended
June 30, 2016. In addition, during the first six months of 2016 we received $11.2 million from
CCLP as our share of CCLP distributions.
Our consolidated operating cash flows during the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by
$48.6 million, or 59.1%, compared to the corresponding prior year period. Partially offsetting the
decrease in revenues and earnings, our consolidated operating cash flows reflect the impact of
the fiscal management steps noted above, including a focus on timely collection of accounts
receivable and other steps to manage working capital. Consolidated capital expenditures were
$9.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016, and included $3.8 million of capital
expenditures by our Compression Division, compared to $73.3 million of consolidated capital
expenditures during the corresponding prior year period, including $57.1 million by our
Compression Division. Our lower capital expenditure levels reflect our efforts to defer or reduce
capital expenditure projects in the current market environment. Key objectives associated with
our separate capital structure (excluding the capital structure of CCLP) include the ongoing
management of amounts outstanding and available under our bank revolving credit facility and
repayment of our 11% Senior Notes. CCLP also continues to monitor its 2016 capital expenditure
program, in light of current low demand levels for its compression products and services in the
current environment, minimizing borrowings under its revolving bank credit facility (the "CCLP
Credit Agreement"). TETRA's future consolidated operating cash flows are also affected by the
continuing challenges associated with extinguishing the remaining Maritech asset retirement
obligations. The amount of recorded liability for these remaining obligations is approximately
$45.6 million as of June 30, 2016. Approximately $3.3 million of this amount is expected to be
performed during the twelve month period ending June 30, 2017, with the timing of a portion of
this work being discretionary.
Critical Accounting Policies
 
There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting
estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
except as discussed below. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make
assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We base these
estimates on historical experience, available information, and various other assumptions that we
believe are reasonable. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments, including
those related to potential impairments of long-lived assets (including goodwill), the collectability
of accounts receivable, and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning
obligations. The fair values of portions of our total assets and liabilities are measured using
significant unobservable inputs. The combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments
made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources.
28
These judgments and estimates may change as new events occur, as new information is
acquired, and as changes in our operating environments are encountered. Actual results are
likely to differ from our current estimates, and those differences may be material.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
 
The determination of impairment of long-lived assets, including identified intangible assets, is
conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are
present, the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future
operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives. If
an impairment of a long-lived asset is warranted, we estimate the fair value of the asset based on
a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset
in a transaction between market participants. The oil and gas industry is cyclical, and our
estimates of the amount of future cash flows, the period over which these estimated future cash
flows will be generated, as well as the fair value of an impaired asset, are imprecise. Our failure
to accurately estimate these future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long-
lived assets being overstated, which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to
the time in which the impairment indicators were first present. Alternatively, if our estimates of
future operating cash flows or fair values are understated, impairments might be recognized
unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts. During the first six months of 2016,
primarily as a result of the significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices, we recorded
consolidated long-lived asset impairments of $10.9 million. During periods of economic
uncertainty, the likelihood of additional material impairments of long-lived assets is higher due to
the possibility of decreased demand for our products and services.
 
Impairment of Goodwill
 
The impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present, but not
less than once annually. The assessment for goodwill impairment begins with a qualitative
assessment of whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of each reporting unit is less
than its carrying value. This qualitative assessment requires the evaluation, based on the weight
of evidence, of the significance of all identified events and circumstances for each reporting unit.
Due to the decrease in the price of our common stock and the price per common unit of CCLP
during the first three months of 2016, our and CCLP's market capitalizations as of March 31,
2016, were below their respective recorded net book values, including all goodwill. In addition,
the continuing low oil and natural gas commodity prices have resulted in a further negative
impact on demand for the products and services for each of our reporting units. As a result of
these factors, we determined that it was “more likely than not” that the fair values of certain of our
reporting units were less than their respective carrying values as of March 31, 2016. When the
qualitative analysis indicates that it is “more likely than not” that a reporting unit’s fair value is less
than its carrying value, the resulting goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step accounting
test performed on a reporting unit basis. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the
estimated fair value with the recorded net book value (including goodwill) of our reporting units. If
the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to
exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the carrying amount of the reporting unit
exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying
amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill. Our
estimates of reporting unit fair value, if required, are based on a combination of an income and
market approach. These estimates are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future
cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate
into each business’ estimated fair value. These estimates and judgments are affected by
numerous factors, including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment,
which affects our overall market capitalization. If we overestimate the fair value of our reporting
units, the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated. Alternatively, if our estimated
reporting unit fair values are understated, impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in
excess of the appropriate amounts.
Throughout 2015, and continuing during the first six months of 2016, lower oil and natural gas
commodity prices have resulted in a decreased demand for many of the products and services of
each of our reporting units. With regard to our Compression Division, demand for low-
horsepower wellhead compression services and for sales of compressor equipment decreased
significantly and are expected to continue to be decreased for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the fair value for the Compression Division reporting unit, including the market
capitalization for CCLP, was less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016. For our
Production Testing Division reporting unit, demand for production testing services decreased in
each of the market areas in which we operate, resulting in decreased estimated future cash
flows. As a result, the fair value of the Production Testing reporting unit was also less than its
carrying value as of March 31, 2016. As part of our internal annual business outlook for each of
our
29
reporting units that we performed during the fourth quarter of 2015, we considered changes in the
global economic environment that affected the equity prices and market capitalizations of TETRA
and CCLP. As part of the first step of goodwill impairment testing as of March 31, 2016, we
updated our annual assessment of the future cash flows for each of our reporting units, applying
expected long-term growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values that we consider
reasonable for each reporting unit. Our Maritech and Offshore Services reporting units are
excluded, because they do not contain goodwill. We calculated a present value of the respective
cash flows for each of the other reporting units to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the
income approach and then used the market approach to corroborate these values. Based on
these assumptions, we determined that the fair value of our Fluids Division was significantly in
excess of its carrying value, which includes $6.6 million of goodwill as of March 31, 2016 and
June 30, 2016.
After making the hypothetical purchase price adjustments as part of the second step of the
goodwill impairment test, there was $0.0 million residual purchase price to be allocated to the
goodwill of both the Compression and the Production Testing reporting units as of March 31,
2016. Based on this analysis, we concluded that full impairments of the $92.4 million of recorded
goodwill for Compression and $13.9 million of recorded goodwill for Production Testing were
required as of March 31, 2016.

Consolidated revenues for the current quarter decreased compared to the prior year quarter due
to continuing overall industry market challenges as a result of lower oil and natural gas
commodity prices compared to early 2015. Each of our segments reported decreased revenues
due to the impact of reduced demand for our products and services. The Fluids Division reported
the most significant reduction in revenues, with decreased water management services,
manufactured product sales, and completion services and products combining for $62.1 million of
decreased revenues. Our Compression and Production Testing Divisions each also reported
significantly decreased revenues during the current year period, due to lower industry demand
and activity levels in each of the domestic and international markets we serve. See Divisional

pressures in each of our businesses. Our Fluids Division reported the most significant reduction
in gross profit, due to the reasons noted above and due to the impact from offshore completion
fluids products and services associated with the new fluid technology projects during the prior
year quarter. Our Compression Division reported the highest gross profit during
30
the current year period, despite the decreased demand, particularly for its low horsepower
compression services and new compressor unit sales compared to the prior year quarter. The
results of each of our businesses reflect the impact of additional company-wide salary reductions
that were implemented during the current year period, which are expected to result in reduced
operating expenses going forward. We continue to review the cost structure of each of our
businesses for opportunities to further improve gross profit.
 
Consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased during the current year quarter
compared to the prior year quarter, due to cost reduction efforts across all segments resulting in
lower salary and employee related expenses. In addition, professional service expense and
other general expenses were also decreased. Despite the cost reductions made during the
current year period, consolidated general and administrative expense increased as a percentage
of consolidated revenues due to the significant decrease in revenues.
 
Consolidated interest expense increased in the current year quarter compared to the prior year
quarter due to the increased interest rate applicable to the 11% Senior Notes. In addition,
Compression Division interest expense increased compared to the prior year quarter due to
increased borrowings during early 2015 under the CCLP Credit Agreement. Interest expense
during the current and prior year periods includes $1.0 million of finance cost amortization.
 
Consolidated other expense was $2.2 million during the current year quarter compared to $1.0
million during the prior year quarter, primarily due to $1.5 million of non-cash charges associated
with the repayment of senior notes and senior secured notes.
 
Our consolidated provision for income taxes during the first six months of 2015 and 2016 is
primarily attributable to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes. Our
consolidated effective tax rate for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 of negative 6.4%
was primarily the result of losses generated in entities for which no related tax benefit has been
recorded. The losses generated by these entities do not result in tax benefits due to offsetting
valuation allowances being recorded against the related net deferred tax assets. We establish a
valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in our deferred tax assets are
net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income tax
liabilities in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions.

The decrease in Fluids Division revenues during the current year quarter compared to the prior
year quarter was primarily due to $49.8 million of decreased product sales revenues, primarily
due to decreased clear brine fluids ("CBF") and associated product sales revenues in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico, reflecting the decreased rig count activity compared to the prior year quarter and
including decreased revenue resulting from a customer well completion project during the prior
year quarter using a new completion fluid technology that was introduced during 2015. In
addition, product sales revenues also decreased compared to the prior year quarter due to
decreased domestic manufactured products sales revenues. Service revenues decreased $12.3
million, primarily due to
% 26.5
%
31
reduced demand in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for completion services as a result of a reduction in
completion activity, including the impact from the prior year well completion project noted above.
In addition, service revenues also decreased due to decreased water management services
activity resulting from the impact of lower oil and natural gas commodity prices. We have begun
to see an increased demand in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for certain of our completion products and
services for the second half of the year.
Fluids Division gross profit during the current year quarter decreased compared to the prior year
quarter primarily due to decreased revenues and decreased profitability associated with the mix
of CBF products and services, particularly for offshore completion fluids products and services
associated with the new fluid technology projects during the prior year period. In addition, gross
profit declined as a result of reduced demand for manufactured products during the current year
quarter compared to the prior year quarter.
 
Fluids Division reported minimal pretax earnings during the current year quarter compared to
significant pretax earnings during the prior year quarter primarily due to the decreased gross
profit discussed above. Fluids Division administrative cost levels decreased compared to the
prior year quarter, primarily due to $1.4 million of decreased salary and employee related
expenses, partly offset by increased legal and professional fees. The Fluids Division continues to
review opportunities to further reduce its administrative costs. Partially offsetting the decreased
gross profit, other income increased primarily due to increased foreign currency gains.

Production Testing Division revenues decreased significantly during the current year quarter
compared to the prior year quarter due to reduced overall market activity. Production Testing
service revenues decreased $21.5 million during the current year quarter compared to the prior
year quarter, as the impact of lower oil and natural gas pricing has negatively impacted demand
for services in each of the division's areas of operations, including certain shale reservoir markets
that were a source of revenue growth prior to 2015. Decreased U.S. demand reflects the
significant decrease in onshore rig count activity compared to the prior year quarter. In addition,
increased competition for decreased market activity negatively affected pricing levels for
services, particularly internationally.

Production Testing Division had a gross loss during the current year quarter compared to gross
profit during the prior year quarter due to the decreased industry activity and increased
competition as discussed above. This decrease and resulting gross loss occurred despite cost
reduction efforts, which have included headcount reductions, salary reductions, and other steps
to adjust the Production Testing Division's cost structure in light of current market conditions.
 
The Production Testing Division reported an increased pretax loss during the current year
quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the gross loss discussed above.
General and administrative expenses decreased due to $1.2 million of decreased employee-
related expenses, primarily from reduced headcount, salary reductions, and other employee
related cost reductions, and $1.2 million of decreased bad debt and other general expenses. The
division continues to review additional opportunities to further reduce its operating and
administrative cost levels in light of current market conditions.

Compression Division revenues decreased during the current year quarter compared to the prior
year quarter, primarily due to decreased sales of compressors and parts. The $34.9 million
decrease in compressor equipment and parts sales revenue was due to a lower number of
customer projects compared to the prior year quarter, particularly for high-horsepower projects.
The current reduced equipment fabrication backlog indicates that this decrease in compressor
package sales revenues will continue going forward. Compression service revenues also
decreased $15.4 million, primarily from the reduction in overall utilization in total horsepower as
well as compression services pricing compared to the prior year quarter. The decreased overall
utilization has affected each horsepower class of the Compression Division's service fleet, but
has particularly decreased the demand for low-horsepower production enhancement
compression services as a result of lower oil and natural gas commodity prices.
Compression Division gross profit decreased during the current year quarter compared to the
prior year quarter as a result of the lower demand for compressors and compression services
discussed above. Competitive pricing pressures and rate reduction requests in the current market
environment have also resulted in reduced gross profit. During the second quarter of 2016, the
Compression Division took additional steps to reduce its operating costs and improve operating
efficiencies. The impact of these cost reduction efforts is expected to result in additional cost
efficiencies in future periods.
 
The Compression Division recorded a pretax loss during the current year quarter compared to
pretax earnings during the prior year quarter primarily due to the decreased gross profit
discussed above. General and administrative expense levels decreased compared to the prior
year period, mainly due to administrative cost and salary reductions.

Revenues for the Offshore Services segment decreased during the current year quarter
compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to reduced revenues from its well abandonment
and diving services businesses, more than offsetting the increased revenues from heavy lift
services. Decreased diving services and well abandonment activity levels in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico during the current quarter reflected an overall reduction in demand in this market, due to a
postponement of certain well abandonment projects and increased competition. Given the
current low oil and natural gas commodity price environment, Offshore Services anticipates
continued low demand for its services for the foreseeable future. There was no Offshore Services
work performed for our Maritech segment during the current year quarter, compared to $2.9
million of revenues during the prior year quarter. Revenues for work performed for Maritech,
which are eliminated in consolidation, are expected to continue to be low in future periods.
Gross profit for the Offshore Services segment decreased during the current year quarter
compared to the prior year quarter as the impact of the decreased activity levels for diving and
well abandonment services discussed above more than offset the cost reduction measures and
process efficiencies that have been implemented. The Offshore Services segment continues to
consider additional opportunities to optimize its operating cost structure.
 
Offshore Services segment reported a decrease in pretax earnings before taxes during the
current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the decreased gross profit
discussed above that more than offset a reduction in general and administrative expenses.
Administrative expenses decreased primarily from reduced salary and employee related
expenses of $0.8 million and decreased professional services of $0.2 million. These decreases
were offset by an increased provision of $0.2 million related to doubtful accounts. The Offshore
Services segment continues to review its administrative cost structure for additional cost
reductions and process efficiency actions in response to current market conditions.

As a result of the sale of almost all of its producing properties during 2011 and 2012, Maritech
revenues were negligible and are expected to continue to be negligible going forward. Revenue
decreased during the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter due to decreased
production and commodity pricing.
 
Maritech reported a gross loss during the current year quarter compared to gross profit during the
prior year quarter, primarily due to charges during the period for decommissioning costs incurred
in prior periods no longer considered collectible from third parties.

Corporate Overhead pretax loss decreased during the current year quarter compared to the prior
year quarter, primarily due to decreased general and administrative expense. Corporate general
and administrative expenses decreased due to $3.5 million of decreased salary and employee
related expenses and $0.2 million of decreased professional service fees. Interest expense
increased primarily due to the higher interest rate of the 11% Senior Notes that were issued in
November 2015. Corporate other expenses increased compared to the prior year quarter due to
$1.5 million of unamortized deferred finance costs that were charged to earnings pursuant to the
repayment of senior notes and senior secured notes, as well as increased losses associated with
foreign currency derivative instruments of $0.2 million.

Consolidated revenues for the current year period decreased compared to the prior year period
due to continuing overall industry market challenges as a result of lower oil and natural gas
commodity prices compared to early 2015. Each of our segments reported decreased revenues
due to the impact of reduced demand for our products and services. The Fluids Division reported
the most significant reduction in revenues, with decreased water management services,
manufactured product sales, and completion services and products combining for $102.3 million
of decreased revenues. Our Compression and Production Testing Divisions each also reported
significantly decreased revenues during the current year period, due to lower industry demand
and activity levels in each of the domestic and international markets we serve. See Divisional
Comparisons section below for additional discussion.
Consolidated gross profit decreased during the current year period compared to the prior year
period due to the reduced demand for our products and services, as well as the impact of pricing
pressures in each of our businesses. Our Fluids Division reported the most significant reduction
in gross profit, due to the reasons noted above and due to the impact from offshore completion
fluids products and services associated with the new fluid technology projects during the prior
year period. Our Compression Division reported the highest gross profit during the current year
period, despite also reporting a decrease compared to the prior year period largely due to
impairments of long-lived intangible assets. The results of each of our businesses reflect the
impact of company-wide salary reductions that were implemented during the current year period,
and which are expected to result in reduced operating expenses going forward. We continue to
review the cost structure of each of our businesses for opportunities to further improve gross
profit.
 
Consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased during the current year period
compared to the prior year period, primarily due to cost reduction efforts across all segments
resulting in lower salary and employee related expenses. The decrease in general and
administrative expenses for Production Testing, Compression, and Offshore Divisions was
partially offset by increased Corporate Overhead expenses. Despite the cost reductions made
during the current year period, consolidated general and administrative expense increased as a
percentage of consolidated revenues due to the significant decrease in revenues.

During the first quarter of 2016, we updated our test of goodwill impairment in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
350-20 "Goodwill" due to the decreases in the price of our common stock and the common unit
price of CCLP. The continued decreased oil and natural gas commodity prices had, and are
expected to have, a continuing negative impact on industry drilling and capital expenditure
activity, which affects the expected demand for products and services of each of our reporting
units. Specifically, demand for our Compression Division's compression services and for sales of
compressor equipment decreased significantly and are expected to continue to be decreased for
the foreseeable future. Demand for our Production Testing Division's services also decreased as
a result of decreased drilling and completion activity. This expected decreased demand, along
with the decreases in the price of our common stock and the common unit price of our CCLP
subsidiary, also caused an overall reduction in the fair values of each of our reporting units,
particularly our Compression and Production Testing reporting units. As part of the test of
goodwill impairment, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units, and determined,
based on these estimated values, that impairments of the remaining goodwill of our Compression
and Production Testing reporting units were necessary, primarily due to the market factors
discussed above. Accordingly, during the first quarter of 2016, we recorded total impairment
charges of $106.2 million associated with the goodwill of these reporting units.
Consolidated interest expense increased in the current year period due to the increased interest
rate applicable to the 11% Senior Notes. In addition, interest expense also increased due to
increased borrowings by the Compression Division, through CCLP, during early 2015 to fund its
capital expenditures. Interest expense during the current and prior year periods includes $2.1
million and $1.8 million, respectively, of finance cost amortization.
 
Consolidated other expense was $1.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $0.1 million during the prior year period, primarily due to the charges during the
period for unamortized deferred financing costs that were expensed as a result of the repayment
of senior notes and senior secured notes.
 
Our consolidated provision for income taxes during the first six months of 2015 and 2016 is
primarily attributable to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes. Our
consolidated effective tax rate for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 of negative 0.2%
was primarily the result of losses generated in entities for which no related tax benefit has been
recorded. The losses generated by these entities do not result in tax benefits due to offsetting
valuation allowances being recorded against the related net deferred tax assets. We establish a
valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in our deferred tax assets are
net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income tax
liabilities in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. Further, the effective tax rate is
negatively impacted by the nondeductible portion of our goodwill impairments recorded during
the six month period ended June 30, 2016.

year period and a decrease resulting from a customer well completion project during the prior
year period using a new completion fluid technology that was introduced during 2015. In
addition, product sales revenues also decreased compared to the prior year period due to
decreased domestic manufactured products sales revenues (as a result of reduced demand due
to milder winter weather). Service revenues decreased $29.9 million, primarily due to decreased
water management services activity resulting from the impact of lower oil and natural gas
commodity prices. Service revenues also decreased due to reduced demand in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico for completion services as a result of a reduction in completion activity. We have begun to
see an increased demand in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for our completion products and services
during the second half of the year.
Fluids Division gross profit during the six month period decreased compared to the prior year
period primarily due to decreased revenues and decreased profitability associated with the mix of
CBF products and services, particularly for offshore completion fluids products and services
associated with the new fluid technology projects during the prior year period. In addition, Fluids
Division gross profit declined and as a result of reduced demand for manufactured products
during the current year period compared to the prior year period.
 
Fluids Division reported a significant decrease in pretax earnings compared to the prior year
period primarily due to the decreased gross profit discussed above. Fluids Division
administrative cost levels decreased compared to the prior year period, primarily due to $2.0
million of decreased salary and employee expenses due to administrative cost and salary
reductions. This increase was offset primarily by increased legal and professional fees. The
Fluids Division continues to review opportunities to further reduce its administrative costs.
Partially offsetting the decreased gross profit, other income increased primarily due to increased
foreign currency gains.

Production Testing Division revenues decreased significantly during the current year period
compared to the prior year period due to reduced overall market activity. Production Testing
service revenues decreased $38.4 million during the current year compared to the prior year
period, as the impact of lower oil and natural gas pricing has negatively impacted demand for
services in each of the division's areas of operations, including certain shale reservoir markets
that were a source of revenue growth during the past several years. Decreased U.S. demand
reflects the significant decline in onshore rig count activity compared to the prior year quarter. In
addition, increased competition for decreased market activity negatively affected pricing levels for

significant decreases in future profitability and cash flows expected in the current market
environment. General and administrative expenses decreased due to $2.0 million of decreased
employee-related expenses, primarily from reduced headcount, salary reductions, and other
employee related cost reductions, and $1.5 million of decreased general, office and bad debt
expenses. The division continues to review additional opportunities to further reduce its
operating and administrative cost levels in light of current market conditions.

year period decreased $37.9 million compared to the prior year period due to a reduction in
customer projects, particularly for high-horsepower compressor packages. The current reduced
equipment fabrication backlog indicates that this decrease in compressor package sales
revenues will continue going forward. The $33.6 million decrease in compression service
revenues resulted primarily from the reduction in overall utilization in total horsepower as well as
compression services pricing compared to the prior year period. The decreased overall utilization
has affected each horsepower class of the Compression Division's fleet, but has particularly
decreased the demand for low-horsepower production enhancement compression services as a
result of lower oil and natural gas commodity prices.
Compression Division gross profit decreased during the current year period compared to the prior
year period as a result of the lower demand for compressors and compression services
discussed above. In addition, the Compression Division recorded $7.9 million of long-lived
intangible asset impairments. Competitive pricing pressures and rate reduction requests in the
current market environment have also resulted in reduced gross profit. During the first six months
of 2016, the Compression Division took additional steps to reduce its operating costs and
improve operating efficiencies. The impact of these cost reduction efforts is expected to result in
additional cost efficiencies in future periods.
 
The Compression Division recorded a pretax loss during the current year period compared to
pretax earnings during the prior year period. The amount of the pretax loss for the current year
period was significantly increased due to the impairment of goodwill during the current year
period pursuant to ASC 350-20. In addition to the decreased gross profit discussed above,
interest expense increased as a result of increased borrowings outstanding by CCLP under the
CCLP Credit Agreement during the current year period compared to the prior year period.
General and administrative expense levels decreased compared to the prior year period, mainly
due to $3.4 million of administrative salary reductions.

Revenues for the Offshore Services segment decreased during the current year period compared
to the prior year period primarily due to reduced revenues from its well abandonment and diving
services businesses. Decreased diving services and well abandonment activity levels in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico during the current quarter reflected an overall reduction in demand in this market,
due to a postponement of certain well abandonment projects. These decreases were partially
offset by increased revenues from heavy lift services due to increased activity during the second
quarter of 2016. Given the current low oil and natural gas commodity price environment, Offshore
Services anticipates a continued decrease in demand for its services for the foreseeable future.
Offshore Services revenues during the current year period include work performed for our
Maritech segment, with $0.5 million of such work being performed during the current year period
compared to $3.2 million of revenues during the prior year period. Revenues for work performed
for Maritech, which are eliminated in consolidation, are expected to continue to be lower in future
periods.
Gross loss for the Offshore Services segment increased compared to the prior year period as the
impact of decreased activity levels for well abandonment and diving services as discussed
above more than offset cost reduction measures and process efficiencies that have been
implemented. The Offshore Services segment continues to consider additional opportunities to
optimize its operating cost structure.
 
Offshore Services segment loss before taxes increased compared to the prior year period
primarily due to the increased gross loss discussed above, and despite a reduction in general
and administrative expenses, that was primarily from reduced salary and employee related
expenses of $1.4 million and decreased professional services and general expenses of $0.3
million and other decreased general expenses of $0.2 million, respectively. The Offshore
Services segment continues to review its administrative cost structure for additional cost
reductions and process efficiency actions in response to current market conditions.

As a result of the sale of almost all of its producing properties during 2011 and 2012, Maritech
revenues were negligible and are expected to continue to be negligible going forward. Revenue
decreased compared to the prior year period due to the lower volumes and pricing and the
suspension of production on one of Maritech's non-operated properties during a portion of the
current year period.
 
Maritech reported a gross loss during the current year period compared to gross profit during the
prior year period, primarily due to charges during the period for decommissioning costs incurred
in prior periods no longer considered collectible from third parties.
 
Maritech reported a pretax loss during the current year period compared to pretax income during

Corporate Overhead pretax loss increased during the current year period compared to the prior
year period, despite decreased general and administrative expense, due to increased interest
expense caused by the higher interest rate on the Series 2015 Senior Notes that were issued in
November 2015. Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased due to $3.6 million
of decreased salary, incentives and other employee related expenses. This decrease was offset
by $0.8 million of increased professional service fees, and $0.7 million of increased general
expenses. Decreased administrative salary expenses reflect the company-wide salary reduction
steps taken, as well as decreased incentives. Corporate other expenses increased compared to
the prior year period due to the expensing of $1.5 million of deferred financing costs associated
with the repayment of senior notes and senior secured notes, and from increased losses
associated with foreign currency derivative instruments of $0.2 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
    
Due to the significantly challenging market environment for a number of our businesses, our
consolidated cash flows from operating activities decreased significantly during the first six
months of 2016 compared to the corresponding prior year period. This decrease occurred as a
result of a significant decrease in revenues and profitability, and despite a number of mitigating
factors, including the impact of cost reduction efforts and the focus on improved collections of
customer accounts receivable compared to the corresponding prior year period. Approximately
$35.6 million of our consolidated operating cash flows during the six months ended June 30,
2016 were generated by CCLP, and we received $11.2 million of distributions from CCLP during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $15.0 million during the corresponding prior
year period. We believe the cost reduction steps we have taken have enhanced our capital
structure and operating cash flows and additional steps may be taken to enhance our operating
cash flows in the future. Our ability to meet our financial obligations and fund future growth is
dependent on future levels of consolidated operating cash flows and the availability of capital
resources in uncertain operating and financial markets.
We and CCLP are in compliance with all covenants of our respective credit agreements and
senior note agreements as of June 30, 2016. Considering financial forecasts based on current
market conditions as of August 9, 2016, we anticipate that, despite the current industry
environment and activity levels, we will have sufficient operating cash flows to maintain
compliance with the financial covenants under our long-term debt agreements, as amended,
through June 30, 2017. With regard to CCLP, also considering financial forecasts based on
current market conditions as of August 9, 2016, as a result of the impact of recent cost reduction
efforts, the May 2016
41
amendment of certain financial covenants under the CCLP Credit Agreement, and the August
2016 receipt of $49.8 million of net proceeds from the private placement (the "Private
Placement") of its Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the "CCLP Preferred Units"), CCLP
believes that it will have adequate liquidity to fund its operations and debt obligations and
maintain compliance with the financial covenants under its long-term debt agreements, as
amended, through June 30, 2017.
Our consolidated sources and uses of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 are as follows:

Because of the level of consolidated debt, it is increasingly important to consider our capital
structure and CCLP's capital structure separately, as we have no cross default provisions, cross
collateralization provisions, or cross guarantees with CCLP's debt, nor does CCLP with our debt.
(See Financing Activities section below for a complete discussion of the terms of our and CCLP's
respective debt arrangements.) Our consolidated debt outstanding has a carrying value of
approximately $788.2 million as of June 30, 2016. However, approximately $569.2 million of this
consolidated debt balance is owed by CCLP and is serviced from the existing cash balances and
cash flows of CCLP and secured by its assets. Through our 42% common unit ownership interest
in CCLP and ownership of an approximately 2% general partner interest that includes incentive
distribution rights, we receive our share of the distributable cash flows of CCLP through its
quarterly distributions. Approximately $16.7 million of the $23.9 million of the cash balance
reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is owned by CCLP and is not accessible by us. As
of June 30, 2016, and subject to compliance with the respective financial covenants and other
provisions of the agreements that may limit borrowings under the respective credit facilities,
CCLP had availability of $101.9 million under the CCLP Credit Agreement, and we had
availability of $114.2 million under our Credit Agreement.
Operating Activities
 
Cash flows generated by operating activities totaled $33.6 million during the first six months of
2016 compared to $82.2 million during the corresponding prior year period, a decrease of $48.6
million. Operating cash flows decreased primarily due to decreased earnings compared to the
prior year period. We have taken steps to aggressively manage working capital, which resulted in
increased collections of accounts receivable during the first six months of 2016 compared to the
corresponding prior year period, despite decreased activity levels. In addition, we also are
focused on managing inventory levels. We continue to monitor customer credit risk in the current
environment and have historically focused on serving larger capitalized oil and gas operators
and national oil companies.
Demand for the vast majority of our products and services is driven by oil and gas industry
activity, which is affected by oil and natural gas commodity pricing. The dramatic decreases in oil
and natural gas prices during 2015 and through mid-2016, particularly oil prices, significantly
reduced the current capital expenditure and operating plans of our oil and gas customers,
affecting each of our operating segments. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices is expected
to continue in the future. Worldwide drilling activity related to oil and natural gas wells has
decreased, particularly affecting our Production Testing and Fluids Divisions. In addition, our
Compression Division operations are also highly vulnerable to the impact of a sustained low
natural gas price environment. A large portion of our consolidated cash flows generated by
operating activities during 2015 resulted from equipment and product sales and specific
customer projects that may not recur in 2016 at current oil and natural gas industry activity levels.
If oil and gas industry activity levels remain at current levels or decrease in the future, we expect
that our levels of operating cash flows will be negatively affected.
During the first portion of 2016, we have continued to take steps to reduce operating and
administrative headcount, defer salary increases, reduce salaries, and implement other cost
reductions for each of our segments. These steps are designed to further streamline our
operations and downsize our organization, particularly in
42
response to continuing market challenges for certain of our businesses. Together with the
specific cost reduction steps taken during prior periods, these cost reduction efforts have partially
mitigated the decreased operating cash flows and profitability resulting from the current market
environment. We will continue to review for other opportunities to reduce costs.
As of June 30, 2016, Maritech’s decommissioning liabilities associated with its remaining
offshore oil and gas production wells, platforms, and facilities totaled approximately $45.6 million.
Approximately $3.3 million of this amount is expected to be performed during the twelve month
period ended June 30, 2017, with the timing of a portion of this work being discretionary. Until the
remaining decommissioning liabilities are extinguished, our future operating cash flows will
continue to be affected by Maritech’s decommissioning expenditures as they are incurred.
Included in Maritech’s decommissioning liabilities is the remaining abandonment,
decommissioning, and debris removal work associated with offshore platforms that were
previously destroyed by a hurricane as well as certain remediation work required on wells that
were previously plugged. Due to the unique nature of the remaining work to be performed
associated with these properties, actual costs could greatly exceed these estimates and could
therefore result in significant charges to earnings and cash flows in future periods.
 
Asset retirement obligations are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 410, Asset Retirement and
Environmental Obligations, whereby the estimated fair value of a liability for asset retirement
obligations is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate can be
made. Such estimates are based on relevant assumptions that we believe are reasonable. The
cost estimates for Maritech asset retirement obligations are considered reasonable estimates
consistent with market conditions at the time they are made, and we believe reflect the amount of
work required to be performed in accordance with Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement ("BSEE") standards, as revised from time to time.
The amount of work performed or estimated to be performed on a Maritech property asset
retirement obligation often exceeds amounts previously estimated for numerous reasons
including physical subsea, geological, or downhole conditions, that are different from those
anticipated at the time of estimation due to the age of the property and the quality of information
available about the particular property conditions. Maritech’s remaining oil and gas properties
and production platforms were drilled and constructed by other operators many years ago and
frequently there is not a great deal of detailed documentation on which to base the estimated
asset retirement obligation for these properties. Appropriate underwater surveys are typically
performed to determine the condition of such properties as part of our due diligence in estimating
the costs, but not all conditions are able to be determined prior to the commencement of the
actual work. During the performance of asset retirement activities, unforeseen weather or other
conditions may also extend the duration and increase the cost of the projects, which are normally
not done on a fixed price basis, thereby resulting in costs in excess of the original estimate.
Maritech has one remaining property that was damaged by a hurricane in the past, leaving the
production platform toppled on the seabed and production tubing from the wells (which may be
under pressure) bent underwater. While the basic procedures involved in the plugging and
abandonment of wells and decommissioning of platforms and pipelines and removal of debris is
generally similar for these types of properties, the cost of performing work at these damaged
locations is particularly difficult to estimate due to the unique conditions encountered, including
the uncertainty regarding the extent of physical damage to many of the structures.
In addition, Maritech has encountered situations where previously plugged and abandoned wells
on its properties have later exhibited a build-up of pressure that is evidenced by gas bubbles
coming from the plugged well head. We refer to this situation as “wells under pressure” and this
can either be discovered by us when we perform additional work at the property or by notification
from a third party. Wells under pressure require Maritech to return to the site to perform additional
plug and abandonment procedures that were not originally anticipated or included in the estimate
of the asset retirement obligation for such property. Remediation work at previously abandoned
well sites is particularly costly due to the lack of a platform from which to base these activities.
Maritech is the last operator of record for its plugged wells and bears the risk of additional future
work required as a result of wells becoming under pressure in the future.
For oil and gas properties previously operated by Maritech, the purchaser of the properties
generally became the successor operator and assumed the financial responsibilities associated
with the properties’ operations and abandonment and decommissioning. However, to the extent
that purchasers of these oil and gas properties fail to perform the abandonment and
decommissioning work required and there is insufficient bonding or
43
other security, the previous owners and operators of the properties, including Maritech, may be
required to assume responsibility for the abandonment and decommissioning obligations.
Investing Activities
 
During the first six months of 2016, the total amount of our net cash utilized on investing activities
was $6.7 million. Total cash capital expenditures during the first six months of 2016 were $9.0
million. Our Fluids Division spent $0.9 million of our capital expenditures during the first six
months of 2016, the majority of which related primarily to chemical plant improvements. Our
Production Testing Division spent $0.3 million on capital expenditures, primarily to add to its
international production testing equipment fleet. Our Compression Division spent $3.8 million,
primarily for the expansion of its high-horsepower compressor and equipment fleet. Our Offshore
Services segment spent $3.8 million on its various heavy lift barges and dive support vessels,
primarily for required drydock expenditures.
Generally, a significant majority of our planned capital expenditures has been related to identified
opportunities to grow and expand certain of our existing businesses. However, a majority of
these planned expenditures have been postponed or canceled in an effort to conserve capital or
otherwise address expected future market conditions. We currently have no long-term capital
expenditure commitments and are reviewing all capital expenditure plans carefully during the
current period of reduced demand for our products and services in an effort to conserve cash and
fund our liquidity needs. The deferral of capital projects could affect our ability to compete in the
future. Excluding the capital expenditures of our Compression Division, we expect to spend
approximately $10 to $15 million during 2016, primarily for maintenance projects. Our
Compression Division expects to spend approximately $20 to $25 million during 2016. The level
of future growth capital expenditures depends on forecasted demand for our products and
services. If the forecasted demand for our products and services during 2016 increases or
decreases, the amount of planned expenditures on growth and expansion will be adjusted
accordingly.
 
Financing Activities 
 
During the first six months of 2016, the total amount of cash used by financing activities was
$25.3 million. To fund our capital and working capital requirements, we may supplement our
existing cash balances and cash flow from operating activities from short-term borrowings, long-
term borrowings, leases, equity issuances, and other sources of capital. On March 23, 2016, we
filed a universal shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and it was declared effective on April 13, 2016. In June 2016, pursuant to this shelf
registration statement, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11.5 million shares of our
common stock, which included 1.5 million shares of common stock pursuant to an option granted
to the underwriters to purchase additional shares, which generated net proceeds of $60.4 million.
These offering proceeds were used to repay indebtedness, pay offering expenses, and for
general corporate purposes. For further discussion, see Other Sources and Uses section below.
We and CCLP are in compliance with all covenants of our respective credit agreements and
senior note agreements as of June 30, 2016.
See CCLP Long-Term Debt below for discussion of CCLP's long-term debt.
Our Long-Term Debt
Our Bank Credit Facility. As of August 8, 2016, TETRA (excluding CCLP) has an outstanding
balance on its revolving credit facility (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), of $149.3 million,
and had $8.1 million in letters of credit and guarantees against the revolving credit facility,
leaving a net availability, subject to compliance with our financial covenants and other provisions
of the Credit Agreement that limit borrowings under the Credit Facility, of $67.6 million. These
amounts do not reflect the CCLP Credit Agreement, which is separate and distinct from TETRA's
Credit Agreement, and is discussed further below. All obligations under the Credit Agreement
and the guarantees of such obligations are secured by first-lien security interests in substantially
all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries (limited, in the case of foreign subsidiaries, to
66% of the voting stock or equity interests of first-tier foreign subsidiaries). Such security interests
are for the benefit of the lenders of the Credit Agreement as well as the holder of our 11% Senior
Notes.
    
Under the Credit Agreement, which matures on September 30, 2019, borrowings generally bear
interest at the British Bankers Association LIBOR rate plus 2.25% to 4.00%, depending on one of
our financial ratios. We pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.35% to 0.75% on unused portions
of the facility. The Credit Agreement contains
44
customary covenants and other restrictions, including certain financial ratio covenants based on
our levels of debt and interest cost compared to a defined measure of our operating cash flows
over a twelve month period. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes limitations on aggregate
asset sales, individual acquisitions, and aggregate annual acquisitions and capital expenditures
and requires us to use designated consolidated cash and cash equivalents of TETRA and
certain subsidiaries in excess of $25.0 million to prepay loans. Access to our revolving credit line
is dependent upon our compliance with the financial ratio covenants set forth in the Credit
Agreement. These financial ratios include a fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated
leverage ratio. The fixed charge coverage ratio compares (a) EBITDA as adjusted and defined in
our Credit Agreement less (1) cash income tax expense, (2) non-financed capital expenditures,
and (3) cash dividends and distributions to (b) interest expense plus (1) scheduled principal
payments and (2) stock purchases. As amended by the Agreement and Fourth Amendment dated
July 1, 2016 (the "Fourth Amendment"), the Credit Agreement provides that the fixed charge
coverage ratio may not be less than 1.25 to 1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The consolidated
leverage ratio covenant was amended by the Fourth Amendment and may not exceed (a) 4.00 to
1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including June 30, 2016
through and including March 31, 2018, (b) 3.75 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending during
the period from and including June 30, 2018 through and including December 31, 2018, and (c)
3.5 to 1 at the end of each of the fiscal quarters thereafter. Consolidated net earnings under the
credit facility is defined as the aggregate of our net income (or loss) and our consolidated
restricted subsidiaries (which does not include CCLP), including cash dividends and
distributions (not the return of capital) received from persons other than consolidated restricted
subsidiaries (including CCLP) and after allowances for taxes for such period determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, excluding certain items more specifically
described therein. At June 30, 2016, our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.27 to 1 (compared to
a 4.00 to 1 maximum as required under the Credit Agreement), compared to 1.86 to 1 at
December 31, 2015 and 2.94 to 1 at December 31, 2014. At June 30, 2016, our fixed charge
coverage ratio was 4.32 to 1 (compared to a 1.25 to 1 minimum required under the Credit
Agreement), compared to 6.33 to 1 at December 31, 2015. Deterioration of these financial ratios
could result in a default by us under the Credit Agreement that, if not remedied, could result in
termination of the Credit Agreement and acceleration of any outstanding balances. Any such
default could also result in a cross-default under our Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior
Secured Notes. CCLP is an unrestricted subsidiary and is not a borrower or a guarantor under
the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement includes cross-default provisions relating to any other indebtedness
(excluding indebtedness of CCLP) greater than a defined amount. Our Credit Agreement also
contains a covenant that restricts us from paying dividends in the event of a default or if such
payment would result in an event of default.
45
Our Senior Notes. In May 2016, we purchased for cash all of the outstanding Series 2010-A
Senior Notes, Series 2010-B Senior Notes, and Series 2013 Senior Notes (together the "Tender
Offer Senior Notes"), in the aggregate principal amount of $100 million, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, pursuant to tender offers (the "Tender Offers"). The purchase of the Tender Offer Senior
Notes was funded by borrowings under our Credit Agreement. In June 2016, following the
issuance of 11.5 million shares of our common stock, we utilized a portion of the proceeds to
repay the remaining $30.0 million outstanding under our Senior Secured Notes. The remaining
proceeds were used to pay offering related expenses and reduce the amount of borrowings
outstanding under our Credit Agreement. Following the purchase of the Tender Offer Senior
Notes and the repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, our remaining senior notes consist of the
11% Senior Notes that were issued and sold in November 2015. The 11% Senior Notes were
issued pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement with GSO Tetra Holdings LP ("GSO"). On July 1,
2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (the "Amended and
Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement") with GSO to amend and replace the previous note
purchase agreement. The Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement contains
customary default provisions, as well as the following cross-default provision. An event of default
will occur if we (i) fail to make any payment when due beyond any applicable grace period under
any indebtedness of at least $20.0 million, (ii) default in the performance of any obligation under
the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement or collateral documents and such
default is not remedied within the applicable cure period, (iii) default in the performance of or
compliance with any term of any indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of
at least $20.0 million or of any mortgage, indenture or other agreement relating to such
indebtedness or any other condition exists, and as a result of such default or condition such
indebtedness is accelerated and declared due and payable before its stated maturity or before its
regularly scheduled dates for payment, (iv) we become obligated to purchase or repay
indebtedness before its regular maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount of at least $20.0 million or one or more persons have the
right to require us to purchase or repay such indebtedness or (v) with certain exceptions, the
security interest in the collateral ceases to be in full force and effect. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuation of an event of default under the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note
Agreement, the 11% Senior Notes may become immediately due and payable, either
automatically or by declaration of holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the 11%
Senior Notes at the time outstanding.
In addition, the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement requires a minimum
permitted fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter of 1.1 to 1 and a maximum
permitted ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness at the end of any fiscal quarter of a defined
measure of earnings of (a) 4.50 to 1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period
commencing July 1, 2016 and ending on March 31, 2018, (b) 4.25 to1 as of the end of any fiscal
quarter ending during the period commencing on June 30, 2018 and ending on December 31,
2018 and (c) 4.00 to 1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending thereafter. Pursuant to the
Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement, the 11% Senior Notes are secured by first-
lien security interests in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries. See the
above discussion of the Fourth Amendment to our Credit Agreement for a description of these
security interests. The 11% Senior Notes are pari passu in right of payment to all borrowings
under the Credit Agreement and rank at least pari passu in right of payment with all other
outstanding indebtedness. The Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement contains
customary covenants that limit our ability to, among other things; incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness; incur or create liens; merge or consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets;
engage in a different business; enter into transactions with affiliates; and make certain payments
as set forth in the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Purchase Agreement. We are in
compliance with all covenants of the Senior Unsecured Note Purchase Agreements as of June
30, 2016. At June 30, 2016, our leverage ratio was 2.27 to 1, compared to 1.86 to 1 at December
31, 2015.
Deterioration of these financial ratios could result in a default by us under the Amended and
Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement and, if not remedied, could result in termination of the
Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement and acceleration of any outstanding
balances of the 11% Senior Notes. CCLP is an unrestricted subsidiary and is not a borrower or a
guarantor under our Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement.
CCLP Long-Term Debt
CCLP Preferred Units. On August 8, 2016, CCLP entered into a Series A Preferred Unit
Purchase Agreement (the “CCLP Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement”) with certain purchasers
(collectively, the “Purchasers”) to issue and sell in a private placement (the “Private Placement”)
an aggregate of 4,374,454 of CSI Compressco LP Series A Convertible Preferred Units
representing limited partner interests in CCLP (the “CCLP Preferred Units”) for a cash purchase
price of $11.43 per CCLP Preferred Unit (the “Issue Price”), resulting in total net proceeds to
46
CCLP, after deducting certain offering expenses, of $49.8 million. We purchased 874,891 of the
CCLP Preferred Units at the Issue Price, aggregating $10.0 million. The CCLP Preferred Units,
net of the units we purchased, will be classified as long-term liabilities in our consolidated
balance sheet. Proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to pay additional offering
expenses and reduce outstanding CCLP indebtedness under the CCLP Credit Agreement or the
CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes.
Pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, in connection with the closing, CSI Compressco GP
Inc (our wholly owned subsidiary) executed a Second Amended and Restated Agreement of
Limited Partnership of CCLP (the “Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement”) to,
among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the CCLP Preferred
Units. The CCLP Preferred Units are a new class of equity security that will rank senior to all
classes or series of equity securities of CCLP with respect to distribution rights and rights upon
liquidation. We and the other holders of CCLP Preferred Units (each, a “CCLP Preferred
Unitholder”) will receive quarterly distributions, which will be paid in kind in additional CCLP
Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of 11.00% of the Issue Price ($1.2573 per unit
annualized), subject to certain adjustments. The rights of the CCLP Preferred Units include
certain anti-dilution adjustments, including adjustments for economic dilution resulting from the
issuance of common units in the future below a set price.
A ratable portion of the CCLP Preferred Units will be converted each month over a period of thirty
months beginning in the seventh calendar month following the closing (each, a “Conversion
Date”), subject to certain provisions of the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement
that may delay or accelerate all or a portion of such monthly conversions. On each Conversion
Date, the CCLP Preferred Units will convert into common units representing limited partner
interests in CCLP in an amount equal to, with respect to each CCLP Preferred Unitholder, the
number of CCLP Preferred Units held by such CCLP Preferred Unitholder divided by the number
of Conversion Dates remaining, subject to adjustment described in the Amended and Restated
CCLP Partnership Agreement, with the conversion price determined by trading prices of the
common units over the prior month, among other factors, and as otherwise impacted by the
existence of certain conditions related to the common units. CCLP may, at its option, pay cash, or
a combination of cash and common units, to the CCLP Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing
common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the
Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement and the CCLP Credit Agreement.
In addition, each Purchaser may convert its CCLP Preferred Units, generally on a one-for-one
basis and subject to adjustment for certain splits, combinations, reclassifications or other similar
transactions and certain anti-dilution adjustments, in whole or in part, at any time following May
31, 2017 so long as any conversion is not for less than $250,000 or such lesser amount, if such
conversion relates to all of such Purchaser’s remaining CCLP Preferred Units. CCLP has the
right to be reimbursed for any cash distributions paid with respect to common units issued in any
such optional conversion until March 31, 2018. The CCLP Preferred Units will vote on an as-
converted basis with the common units and will have certain other rights to vote as a class with
respect to any amendment to the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement that
would affect any rights, preferences or privileges of the CCLP Preferred Units, as more fully
described in the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement.
In addition, the CCLP Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement includes certain provisions regarding
change of control, transfer of CCLP Preferred Units, indemnities, and other matters described in
detail in the CCLP Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement. In connection with the Closing, CCLP
agreed to pay a transaction fee of $1.2 million to its financial advisor for this transaction. The
CCLP Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and
covenants of CCLP and the Purchasers.
CCLP’s Bank Credit Facilities. Under CCLP's bank credit agreement, (as amended, the "CCLP
Credit Agreement"), CCLP and CSI Compressco Sub, Inc. are named as the borrowers and all
obligations under the CCLP Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of CCLP's existing and
future, direct and indirect, domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than domestic subsidiaries that
are wholly owned by foreign subsidiaries), and secured by substantially all of CCLP's assets and
the assets of its domestic subsidiaries. We are not a borrower or a guarantor under the CCLP
Credit Agreement. The CCLP Credit Agreement matures on August 4, 2019 and includes a
maximum credit commitment of $340.0 million, and included within such amount is availability for
letters of credit (with a sublimit of $20.0 million) and swingline loans (with a sublimit of $60.0
million). The amount of borrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement is subject to certain
limitations, including borrowing limitations as a result of financial covenants. As of August 8,
2016, and prior to the use of CCLP Preferred Unit proceeds to reduce the amount of borrowings
outstanding, CCLP has a balance outstanding under the CCLP Credit Agreement of $230.0
million, has $4.9 million letters of credit and performance bonds outstanding, and subject to
compliance with
47
financial covenants and other provisions in the CCLP Credit Agreement that limit borrowings
under the CCLP Credit Agreement, has availability under the CCLP Credit Agreement of $105.1
million.
The CCLP Credit Agreement requires CCLP to maintain (i) a minimum consolidated interest
coverage ratio (ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization ("EBITDA") to consolidated interest charges) of 3.0 to 1, (ii) a maximum
consolidated total leverage ratio (ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated
EBITDA) of (a) 5.50 to 1 as of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016; (b) 5.75 to 1 as of
December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017; (c) 5.50 to 1 as of
December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018; (d) 5.25 to 1 as of June 30, 2018 and September 30,
2018, and (e) 5.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2018 and thereafter, and (iii) a maximum
consolidated secured leverage ratio (consolidated secured indebtedness to consolidated
EBITDA) of 3.5 to 1.0, in each case, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, calculated on a
trailing four quarters basis. At June 30, 2016, the CCLP consolidated total leverage ratio was
5.04 to 1 and the CCLP interest coverage ratio was 3.81 to 1. In addition, the CCLP Credit
Agreement includes customary negative covenants that, among other things, limit CCLP's ability
to incur additional debt, incur, or permit certain liens to exist, or make certain loans, investments,
acquisitions, or other restricted payments. In addition, the CCLP Credit Agreement requires that,
among other conditions, CCLP use designated consolidated cash and cash equivalent balances
in excess of $35.0 million to prepay the loans; allows the prepayment or purchase of
indebtedness with proceeds from the issuances of equity securities or in exchange for the
issuances of equity securities; and restricts the amount of CCLP's permitted capital expenditures
in the ordinary course of business during each fiscal year ranging from $25.0 million in 2016 to
$75.0 million in 2019. The CCLP Credit Agreement provides that CCLP can make distributions to
holders of its common units, but only if there is no default or event of default under the facility.
    
CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes. In August 2014, CCLP, and CSI Compressco Finance Inc., a
Delaware corporation and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CCLP (CSI Compressco Finance
and, together with CCLP, the "Issuers"), issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
Issuers’ 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "CCLP Senior Notes") in a private offering exempt
from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act") pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement dated July 29, 2014. The CCLP Senior Notes
were subsequently registered through a public exchange offer that closed on July 20, 2015.
The obligations under the CCLP Senior Notes are jointly and severally and fully and
unconditionally, guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of CCLP’s domestic restricted
subsidiaries (other than CSI Compressco Finance) that guarantee CCLP’s other indebtedness
(the "Guarantors" and together with the Issuers, the "Obligors"). The CCLP Senior Notes and the
subsidiary guarantees thereof (together, the "CCLP Securities") were issued pursuant to an
indenture described below.
The Obligors issued the CCLP Securities pursuant to the Indenture dated as of August 4, 2014
(the "Indenture") by and among the Obligors and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the
"Trustee"). The CCLP Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum. Interest on the
CCLP Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each
year. The CCLP Senior Notes are scheduled to mature on August 15, 2022.
The Indenture contains customary covenants restricting CCLP’s ability and the ability of its
restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends and make certain distributions, investments and other
restricted payments; (ii) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; (iii)
create certain liens; (iv) sell assets; (v) merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its assets; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (vii) designate its
subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under the Indenture. The Indenture also contains
customary events of default and acceleration provisions relating to such events of default, which
provide that upon an event of default under the Indenture, the Trustee or the holders of at least
25% in aggregate principal amount of the CCLP Senior Notes then outstanding may declare all
amounts owing under the CCLP Senior Notes to be due and payable. CCLP is in compliance
with all covenants of the CCLP Senior Note Purchase Agreement as of June 30, 2016.
Other Sources and Uses
In addition to the aforementioned revolving credit facilities, we and CCLP fund our respective
short-term liquidity requirements from cash generated by our respective operations, leases, and
from short-term vendor financing. Should additional capital be required, we believe that we have
the ability to raise such capital through the
48
issuance of additional debt or equity. However, instability or volatility in the capital markets at the
times we need to access capital may affect the cost of capital and the ability to raise capital for an
indeterminable length of time.
 
TETRA's Credit Agreement, as amended, matures in September 2019, the CCLP Credit
Agreement matures in August 2019, TETRA's 11% Senior Notes mature in November 2022, and
the CCLP Senior Notes mature in August 2022. The replacement of these capital sources at
similar or more favorable terms is not certain. If it is necessary to issue additional equity to fund
our capital needs, additional dilution to our common stockholders will occur.
Although near-term growth plans have been suspended and are subject to our efforts to conserve
cash and rationalize our cost structure during the current period of low oil and natural gas prices,
we maintain a long-term growth strategy for our core businesses. On March 23, 2016, we filed a
universal shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"). On April 13, 2016, the Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared
effective by the SEC. Pursuant to this registration statement, we may sell debt or equity securities
in one or more public offerings up to a total public offering price of $400 million. In June 2016,
pursuant to this shelf registration statement, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11.5
million shares of our common stock, which included 1.5 million shares of common stock pursuant
to an option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of
$5.50 per share ($5.2525 per share net of underwriting discounts). We utilized the net offering
proceeds of $60.4 million to repay the remaining balance outstanding of our Senior Secured
Notes, to reduce the balance outstanding under our Credit Agreement, to pay offering related
discounts and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. This shelf registration statement
currently provides us additional flexibility with regard to potential financings that we may
undertake when market conditions permit or our financial condition may require. As part of our
long-term strategic growth plans, we will evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses and assets
that may involve the payment of cash. Such acquisitions may be funded with existing cash
balances, funds under credit facilities, or cash generated from the issuance of equity or debt
securities. CCLP has also temporarily suspended many of its capital expenditure projects,
CCLP's long-term growth objectives are funded from cash available under its credit facilities,
other borrowings, cash generated from the issuance of its common units, as well as its available
cash.
CCLP’s Partnership Agreement requires that within 45 days after the end of each quarter, it
distribute all of its available cash, as defined in the Partnership Agreement, to its unitholders of
record on the applicable record date. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, CCLP
distributed $25.6 million, including $14.4 million to its non-affiliated unitholders.
 
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
As of June 30, 2016, we had no “off balance sheet arrangements” that may have a current or
future material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
 
Commitments and Contingencies
 
Litigation
 
We are named defendants in several lawsuits and respondents in certain governmental
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits or other
proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it
reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits or other proceedings in excess of
any amounts accrued has been incurred that is expected to have a material adverse impact on
our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
 
Other Contingencies
 
During 2011, in connection with the sale of a significant majority of Maritech’s oil and gas
producing properties, the buyers of the properties assumed the associated decommissioning
liabilities pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements. For oil and gas properties Maritech
previously operated, the buyers of the properties assumed the financial responsibilities
associated with the properties' operations, including abandonment and decommissioning, and
generally became the successor operator. Some buyers of these Maritech properties
subsequently sold certain of these properties to other buyers who also assumed these financial
responsibilities associated with the properties' operations, and these buyers also typically
became the successor operator of the properties. To the extent that a buyer of these properties
fails to perform the abandonment and decommissioning
49
work required, the previous owner, including Maritech, may be required to perform the
abandonment and decommissioning obligation. A significant portion of the decommissioning
liabilities that were assumed by the buyers of the Maritech properties in 2011 remains
unperformed and we believe the amounts of these remaining liabilities are significant. We
monitor the financial condition of the buyers of these properties from Maritech, and if current oil
and natural gas pricing levels continue, we expect that one or more of these buyers may be
unable to perform the decommissioning work required on the properties acquired from Maritech.
    
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, continued low oil and natural gas prices have
resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for all oil and gas producing companies, including
those companies that bought Maritech properties in the past. Certain of these oil and gas
producing companies that bought Maritech properties are currently experiencing severe financial
difficulties. With regard to certain of these properties, Maritech has security in the form of bonds or
cash escrows that are intended to secure the buyers' obligations to perform the decommissioning
work. One company that bought, and subsequently resold, Maritech properties filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Maritech and its legal counsel continue to monitor the
status of these companies. As of June 30, 2016, we do not consider the likelihood of Maritech
becoming liable for decommissioning liabilities on sold properties to be probable.
Contractual Obligations
Our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments principally consist of obligations
associated with our outstanding indebtedness, CCLP's outstanding indebtedness, product
purchase obligations, decommissioning and other asset retirement obligations, and obligations
under operating and capital leases. During the first six months of 2016, there were no material
changes outside of the ordinary course of business in the specified contractual obligations.
For additional information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in
our annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

•
Such forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and
financial performance and are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but such
forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks, and uncertainties, including, but not
limited to:
economic and operating conditions that are outside of our control, including the supply, demand,
and prices of crude oil and natural gas;

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. For a
discussion of our indirect exposure to fluctuating commodity prices, please read “Risk Factors —
Certain Business Risks” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4,
2016. We depend on U.S. and international demand for and production of oil and natural gas,
and a reduction in this demand or production could adversely affect the demand or the prices we
charge for our services, which could cause our revenues and operating cash flows to decrease in
the future. We do not currently hedge, and do not intend to hedge, our indirect exposure to
fluctuating commodity prices.
Interest Rate Risk
Through June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes pertaining to our interest risk rate
exposures as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Exchange Rate Risk
As of June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes pertaining to our exchange rate
exposures as disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of June 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II
OTHER INFORMATION
 
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
 
We are named defendants in several lawsuits and respondents in certain governmental
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits or other
proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it
reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits or other proceedings in excess of
amounts accrued has been incurred that is expected to have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
51
Environmental Proceedings
 
One of our subsidiaries, TETRA Micronutrients, Inc. ("TMI"), previously owned and operated a
production facility located in Fairbury, Nebraska. TMI is subject to an Administrative Order on
Consent issued to American Microtrace, Inc. (n/k/a/ TETRA Micronutrients, Inc.) in the
proceeding styled In the Matter of American Microtrace Corporation, EPA I.D. No.
NED00610550, Respondent, Docket No. VII-98-H-0016, dated September 25, 1998 (the
"Consent Order"), with regard to the Fairbury facility. TMI is liable for ongoing environmental
monitoring at the Fairbury facility under the Consent Order; however, the current owner of the
Fairbury facility is responsible for costs associated with the closure of that facility. While the
outcome cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not consider it reasonably
possible that a loss in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred or is expected to have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
 
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
There have been no material changes in the information pertaining to our Risk Factors as
disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except for the following:
Deterioration of our financial ratios could result in covenant defaults under our long-term debt
agreements and result in decreased credit availability.
 
As of June 30, 2016, our total debt outstanding included $101.6 million under our bank revolving
credit agreement (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") and $117.4 million of our 11% Senior
Notes due November 5, 2022 (the "11% Senior Notes"). In addition, our consolidated balance
sheet includes $569.2 million of long-term debt of CCLP (consisting of $231.2 million under the
CCLP Credit Agreement and $338.0 million under the CCLP Senior Notes). Additional growth
could result in increased debt levels to support our or CCLP's capital expenditure needs or
acquisition activities. Debt service costs related to outstanding long-term debt represent a
significant use of our operating cash flow and increase our vulnerability to general adverse
economic and industry conditions.
Each of these long-term debt agreements contains customary covenants and other restrictions
and requirements. The agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including a
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, both of which are defined in
our Credit Agreement, and in the Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreements relating to
our 11% Senior Notes (the "Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement"). Deterioration
of these ratios could result in a default under the agreements. Although these agreements
include cross-default provisions relating to other of our indebtedness that is greater than a
defined amount, we have no cross default provisions, cross collateralization provisions, or cross
guarantees with CCLP's debt, nor does CCLP with our debt. If any of our indebtedness is not
paid or is accelerated and such event is not remedied in a timely manner, a default will occur
under our long-term debt agreements. Any event of default, if not timely remedied, could result in
a termination of all commitments of our lenders thereunder and an acceleration of all amounts
owed thereunder and of our senior notes.
Access to our revolving credit line is dependent upon our compliance with the financial ratio
covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, as amended. Following the Fourth Amendment to
the Credit Agreement in July 2016, these financial ratios include a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio (ratio of a defined measure of earnings to interest) of 1.25 to 1 and a maximum
leverage ratio (ratio of debt and letters of credit outstanding to a defined measure of earnings) of
(a) 4.00 to 1 at the end of fiscal quarters ending during the period from and including June 30,
2016 through and including March 31, 2018, (b) 3.75 to 1 at the end of the fiscal quarters ending
during the period from and including June 30, 2018 through and including December 31, 2018,
and (c) 3.5 to 1 at the end of each of the fiscal quarters thereafter. Consolidated net earnings
under our Credit Agreement is the aggregate of our net income (or loss) and the net income (or
loss) of our consolidated restricted subsidiaries, including cash dividends and distributions (not
the return of capital) received from persons other than consolidated restricted subsidiaries (such
as distributions from CCLP) and after allowances for taxes for such period determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"),
excluding certain items more specifically described therein. This definition of consolidated net
earnings excludes an amount of extraordinary and nonrecurring gains and losses up to 25% of a
measure of earnings. Under the Amended and Restated 11% Senior Note Agreement, the
financial ratio requirements include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1 and a
maximum leverage ratio of 3.5 as of June 30, 2016, increasing to (a) 4.50 to1 as of the end of any
fiscal quarter ending during the period commencing on July 1, 2016 and ending on March 31,
2018, (b) 4.25 to 1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period commencing on
June 30, 2018 and ending on
52
December 31, 2018 and (c) 4.00 to 1 as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending thereafter. At
June 30, 2016, our leverage ratio was 2.27 to 1 and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.32 to
1.
Our continuing ability to comply with these financial covenants depends largely upon our ability
to generate adequate operating cash flows. Historically, our financial performance has been
more than adequate to meet these covenants. Due to the decreased demand for certain of our
products and services by our customers in response to decreased oil and natural gas prices, we
have taken strategic cost reduction efforts, including headcount reductions, deferral of salary
increases, salary reductions, and other efforts to reduce costs and generate cash to mitigate the
reduced demand for our products and services. In addition, in June 2016 we utilized the $60.4
million of net proceeds from the issuance of 11.5 million shares of our common stock to repay the
remaining balance outstanding under our senior secured notes, reduce borrowings outstanding
under our Credit Agreement, and to pay for offering expenses. We believe the steps taken have
enhanced our capital structure and operating cash flows and will continue to enhance our
operating cash flows in the future. We and CCLP are in compliance with all covenants of our
respective credit agreements and senior note agreements as of June 30, 2016. Based on our
financial projections and including the impact of cost reduction efforts and expected activity
levels on future estimated operating cash flows, we anticipate that, despite the current industry
environment and activity levels, we will have sufficient operating cash flows to maintain
compliance with the financial covenants under our long-term debt agreements through June 30,
2017. However, there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with these financial
covenants going forward, and would consequently be in a condition of default under our Credit
Agreement and 2015 11% Senior Notes if we were unable to obtain a waiver or amendment from
our lenders. There can be no assurance that the cost reduction steps will be successful or that
market conditions and operating performance will not be further decreased compared to our
projections.
Deterioration of CCLP's financial ratios could result in covenant defaults under the CCLP Credit
Agreement and result in decreased credit availability and reduced distributions to us.
CCLP has a credit agreement (as amended, the "CCLP Credit Agreement"), with a borrowing
capacity of up to $340 million, subject to borrowing base requirements. As of June 30, 2016,
CCLP's outstanding borrowings under the CCLP Credit Agreement were $231.2 million. In
addition, as of August 8, 2016, CCLP has outstanding borrowings under the CCLP Credit
Agreement of $230.0 million. In addition, CCLP has $350 million in aggregate principal amount
of CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes outstanding. CCLP depends on the earnings and cash flow
generated by its operations to meet its debt service obligations. Payment of CCLP's debt service
obligations reduces cash available for distribution to its common unitholders including to us. The
operating and financial restrictions and covenants applicable to the CCLP Credit Agreement and
the CCLP 7.25% Senior Notes restrict its ability to take certain actions. Violations of these
restrictions and covenants may result in a breach of, or CCLP's inability to borrow under, the
CCLP Credit Agreement, including to fund distributions (if CCLP elected to do so).
The CCLP Credit Agreement contains covenants requiring CCLP to maintain (i) a consolidated
interest coverage ratio (ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charges) of not less
than 3.0 to 1; (ii) a consolidated total leverage ratio (ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to
consolidated EBTIDA) of not more than (a) 5.50 to 1 as of June 30, 2016 and September 30,
2016; (b) 5.75 to 1 as of December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30,
2017; (c) 5.50 to 1 as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018; (d) 5.25 to 1 as of June 30,
2018 and September 30, 2018, and (e) 5.00 to 1 as of December 31, 2018 and thereafter; and (iii)
a consolidated secured leverage ratio (consolidated secured indebtedness to consolidated
EBITDA) of not more than 3.5 to 1, in each case calculated on a quarterly basis for the trailing
four quarters. The CCLP Credit Agreement provides that CCLP may make distributions to
holders of its common units, but only if there is no default under the CCLP Credit Agreement.
CCLP's ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the CCLP Credit
Agreement may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic,
financial, and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, CCLP's
ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the provisions of
the CCLP Credit Agreement could result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless
waived, the lenders under the CCLP Credit Agreement would have all remedies available to
secured lenders and could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans,
require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause their loans to become due and payable in
full, institute foreclosure proceedings against CCLP or its subsidiaries’ assets, and force CCLP
and its subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of CCLP's debt is accelerated,
its assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of CCLP common units,
including us, could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. An event of default by
CCLP under the CCLP Credit Agreement could also result in a default under the CCLP 7.25%
Senior Notes

CCLP is in compliance with all covenants of the CCLP Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2016. At
June 30, 2016, the CCLP consolidated total leverage ratio was 5.04 to 1 and the CCLP interest
coverage ratio was 3.81 to 1. CCLP's continuing ability to comply with its financial covenants
depends largely upon CCLP's ability to generate adequate cash flow. Historically, CCLP
financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants, and CCLP
expects this trend to continue. However, as a result of the recent decreased demand for certain of
CCLP's products and services by CCLP's customers in response to decreased oil and natural
gas prices beginning in 2014, and CCLP's expectation that the reduced demand will continue for
an indefinite period, CCLP has taken strategic cost reduction efforts, including headcount
reductions, deferral of salary increases, salary reductions, and other efforts to reduce costs and
generate cash. In August 2016, CCLP completed a private placement of CCLP Preferred Units
and will use the $49.8 million of net proceeds to pay other offering expenses and reduce
outstanding indebtedness of CCLP. CCLP believes the steps taken have enhanced its operating
cash flows and preserved its cash, and additional steps may be taken to continue to enhance its
operating cash flows and preserve cash in the future. Considering financial forecasts based on
current market conditions as of August 9, 2016, there can be no assurance that CCLP will remain
in compliance with these financial covenants of the CCLP Credit Agreement in the future.
We may have continuing exposure on abandonment and decommissioning obligations
associated with oil and gas properties sold by Maritech.
 
During 2011, in connection with the sale of a significant majority of Maritech’s oil and gas
producing properties, the buyers of the properties assumed the associated decommissioning
liabilities having a value at the time of sale of approximately $122.0 million pursuant to the
purchase and sale agreements. For oil and gas properties Maritech previously operated, the
buyer of the properties assumed the financial responsibilities associated with the properties'
operations, including abandonment and decommissioning, and generally became the successor
operator. Some buyers of these Maritech properties subsequently sold certain of these properties
to other buyers who also assumed the financial responsibilities associated with the properties'
operations, and these buyers also typically became the successor operator of the properties. To
the extent that a buyer of these properties fails to perform the abandonment and
decommissioning work required, the previous owner, including Maritech, may be required to
perform the abandonment and decommissioning obligation. A significant portion of the
decommissioning liabilities that were assumed by the buyers of the Maritech properties in 2011
remains unperformed and we believe the amounts of these remaining liabilities are significant.
We monitor the financial condition of the buyers of these properties from Maritech, and if current
oil and natural gas pricing levels continue or deteriorate further, we expect that one or more of
these buyers may be unable to perform the decommissioning work required on properties they
acquired from Maritech. To the extent Maritech is required to perform a significant portion of the
abandonment and decommissioning obligations associated with these previously owned oil and
gas properties, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, continued low oil and natural gas prices have
resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for all oil and gas producing companies, including
those companies that bought Maritech properties in the past. Certain of these oil and gas
producing companies that bought Maritech properties are currently experiencing severe financial
difficulties. With regard to certain of these properties, Maritech has security in the form of bonds or
cash escrows that are intended to secure the buyers' obligations to perform the decommissioning
work. One company that bought, and subsequently resold, Maritech properties filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in August 2015. Maritech estimates that of the total amount of
decommissioning liabilities associated with properties sold to this company, Maritech is exposed
to a high level of risk on properties that had decommissioning liabilities at the time they were sold
in 2011 of approximately $6 million. Some of these liabilities are currently part of a liquidation
plan being administered for this company. This amount, which is net to Maritech's interest, may
not be representative of the current fair value of these obligations and does not reflect the
potential benefit of bonding that may be available to Maritech if it were to be required to perform
such obligations. Maritech and its legal counsel monitor the status of these companies. There
can be no assurance that Maritech will not become legally responsible to perform
decommissioning work on properties it previously sold, resulting in charges to our future earnings
and increases to our future operating cash requirements.
We are exposed to significant credit risks.
 
We face credit risk associated with the significant amounts of accounts receivable we have with
our customers in the energy industry. Many of our customers, particularly those associated with
our onshore operations, are small- to medium-sized oil and gas operators that may be more
susceptible to declines in oil and gas
54
commodity prices or generally increased operating expenses than larger companies. Our ability
to collect from our customers is impacted by the current decreased oil and natural gas price
environment.
 
As the owner and operator of its oil and gas property interests, Maritech is liable for the proper
abandonment and decommissioning of these properties. We have guaranteed a portion of the
abandonment and decommissioning liabilities of Maritech. With respect to certain properties,
Maritech is entitled to be paid in the future for all or a portion of these obligations by the previous
owner of the property once the liability is satisfied. We and Maritech are subject to the risk that
the previous owner(s) will be unable to make these future payments. In addition, for certain
remaining Maritech properties to be decommissioned or abandoned, the co-owners of such
properties are responsible for the payment of their portions of the associated operating expenses
and abandonment liabilities. However, if one or more co-owners do not pay their portions,
Maritech and any other nondefaulting co-owners may be liable for the defaulted amount. If any
required payment is not made by a previous owner or a co-owner and any security is not
sufficient to cover the required payment, we could suffer material losses.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, continued decreased oil and natural gas prices
have resulted in reduced revenues and cash flows for oil and gas producing companies,
including companies that are joint-owners in Maritech oil and gas properties and
decommissioning obligations currently owned or from whom Maritech is entitled to receive
payments upon satisfaction of certain decommissioning obligations. Certain of these previous
owners of Maritech properties who are obligated to pay Maritech in the future are currently
experiencing severe financial difficulties and have filed for bankruptcy protection. During the
three month period ended June 30, 2016, Maritech charged to earnings $2.8 million of such
contractual payment receivables no longer considered realizable. The majority of the remaining
amounts owed to Maritech by these companies are not contractually required to be paid to
Maritech until several years in the future. Nevertheless, we are monitoring the financial condition
of these companies, and if current oil and natural gas pricing levels continue, certain of these
companies may be unable to pay Maritech for contractual amounts owed. Maritech intends to
take any action necessary to protect Maritech's interests. Although certain of these
decommissioning obligations may not be performed for many years, there can be no assurance
that the current oil and gas price environment will not result in additional charges to our future
earnings and increases to our future operating cash requirements.
New federal requirements for financial assurance on offshore oil and gas decommissioning
obligations may restrict our borrowing capacity.
Through our Maritech subsidiary, we have interests in oil and gas production platforms and
facilities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As of June 30, 2016, Maritech’s decommissioning liabilities
associated with its remaining offshore oil and gas production wells, platforms, and facilities
totaled approximately $45.6 million. In July 2016, the Bureau of Ocean Engineering Management
("BOEM") notified companies holding oil and gas leases in federal waters that it is updating
financial assurance and risk management requirements to ensure that U.S. taxpayers never have
to pay for decommissioning and removing a company’s offshore production facilities. The
issuance of Notice to Lessees No. 2016-N01 ("NTL 2016-N01"), which becomes effective
September 12, 2016, provides updated procedures for requiring additional financial security for
oil and gas or sulphur leases. The NTL 2016-N01 will provide updated criteria for determining a
lessee's ability to self-insure its decommissioning liabilities on the outer continental shelf of the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico based on the lessee's financial capacity and financial strength. It also
provides new methods and additional flexibility for lessees to meet their additional financial
security requirements through a tailored plan. The guidance and clarification will apply to all
BOEM regions and planning areas. In addition to lease holders, the NTL also applies to right of
use and easement holders.
The issuance of NTL 2016-N01 may require us, and our Maritech subsidiary, to increase or
modify the type of financial assurance we provide in connection with Maritech's remaining
decommissioning obligations. Such requirements may include the provision of new or increased
bonding or other collateral that could serve to reduce the amount of borrowing capacity we have
under our Credit Agreement, thus reducing our liquidity.
  
The Series A Convertible Preferred Units of CCLP issued on August 2016 (the "CCLP Preferred
Units") are senior in right of distributions, liquidation and voting to the common units, and will
result in the issuance of additional CCLP common units in the future, resulting in dilution of our
existing common unit ownership in CCLP, and such dilution is potentially unlimited.
 
CCLP's partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional common units that CCLP
may issue at any time without the approval of its common unitholders. In addition, subject to the
provisions of the August 8, 2016 CCLP Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement, CCLP may
issue an unlimited number of partnership
55
units that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation, or voting. On
August 8, 2016, CCLP issued an aggregate of 4,374,454 of CCLP Preferred Units for a cash
purchase price of $11.43 per CCLP Preferred Unit (the “Issue Price”), resulting in total net
proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of $49.8 million. We purchased 874,891 of
the CCLP Preferred Units at the Issue Price, aggregating $10.0 million.
Pursuant to the CCLP Series A Convertible Unit Purchase Agreement, our wholly owned CSI
Compressco GP Inc subsidiary (the general partner of CCLP), executed the Second Amended
and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the “Amended and Restated
CCLP Partnership Agreement”) to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and
preferences of the CCLP Preferred Units. The CCLP Preferred Units are a new class of equity
security that ranks senior to CCLP's common units with respect to distribution rights and rights
upon liquidation. The holders of CCLP Preferred Units (each, a “CCLP Preferred Unitholder”) will
receive quarterly distributions in kind in additional Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of
11.00% of the Issue Price ($1.2573 per unit annualized), subject to certain adjustments, including
adjustments relating to any future issuances of common units below a set price. Beginning on the
first Trading Day (as defined in the Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement) after
the seventh calendar month following the closing date and on the first Trading Day of each
calendar month thereafter for a total of thirty months (each, a “Conversion Date”), the CCLP
Preferred Units will convert into common units in an amount equal to, with respect to each CCLP
Preferred Unitholder, the number of CCLP Preferred Units held by such CCLP Preferred
Unitholder divided by the number of Conversion Dates remaining. CCLP may, at its option, pay
cash, or a combination of cash and common units, to the CCLP Preferred Unitholders instead of
issuing common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the
Amended and Restated CCLP Partnership Agreement and the CCLP Credit Agreement.
•
Because we own 42.4% of the outstanding CCLP common units, 20% of the newly issued CCLP
Preferred Units, and approximately 2% general partner interest in CCLP (including incentive
distribution rights), the issuance by CCLP of the CCLP Preferred Units will have the following
effects:
our previously existing common unitholders’ proportionate ownership interests in CCLP will
decrease;
•the amount of cash available for distribution on each CCLP common unit may decrease;
the relative voting power of our previously existing CCLP common unitholder interest will be
diminished; and
•the market price of CCLP common units may decline.
