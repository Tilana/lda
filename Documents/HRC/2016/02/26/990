<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the universality, interdependence, indivisibility and interrelatedness of 
</p>
<p>human rights as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and consequently 
</p>
<p>elaborated in other human rights instruments, such as the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights and other relevant core human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that all 
</p>
<p>human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and that everyone is entitled to 
</p>
<p>all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such 
</p>
<p>as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
</p>
<p>property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action affirms that 
</p>
<p>all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, that the 
</p>
<p>international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the 
</p>
<p>same footing and with the same emphasis, and that while the significance of national and 
</p>
<p>regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be 
</p>
<p>borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural 
</p>
<p>systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which the 
</p>
<p>Assembly stated that the Human Rights Council should be responsible for promoting 
</p>
<p>universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, 
</p>
<p>without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all relevant Human Rights Council and General Assembly resolutions 
</p>
<p>on combating all forms of discrimination and violence exercised due to discrimination of 
</p>
<p>any kind, particularly Council resolution 17/19 of 17 June 2011, 
</p>

<p><i>Expressing grave concern</i> at acts of violence and discrimination, in all regions of the 
</p>
<p>world, committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation and gender 
</p>
<p>identity, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> positive developments at the international, regional and national levels in 
</p>
<p>the fight against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender 
</p>
<p>identity, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming also</i> the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights in the fight against violence and discrimination based on race, colour, 
</p>
<p>sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth 
</p>
<p>or other status, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights entitled &#8220;Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of 
</p>
<p>violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/19/41) and of the panel discussion held at the nineteenth session of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to update the report (A/HRC/19/41) with a 
</p>
<p>view to sharing good practices and ways to overcome violence and discrimination, in
