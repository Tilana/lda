Conference Call Scheduled for 9:00 a.m. CT (10:00 a.m. ET) on Thursday, August 4
DALLAS, August 3, 2016 - Sunoco LP (NYSE: SUN) (“SUN” or the “Partnership”) today
announced financial and operating results for the three-month period ended June 30, 2016.
Revenue totaled $4.1 billion, a decrease of 19.6 percent, compared to $5.1 billion in the second
quarter of 2015. The decline was the result of a 60.5 cent per gallon decrease in the average
selling price of fuel partly offset by an increase in retail merchandise sales.
Total gross profit was $580.6 million, compared to $545.2 million in the second quarter of
2015.  Key drivers of the increase were a higher total weighted average fuel margin, an increase
in merchandise margin and the contribution from third party acquisitions and new-to-industry
locations opened during the last 12 months.
Income from operations was $124.2 million, versus $123.7 million in the second quarter of 2015,
reflecting an increase in gross profit offset by higher general and administrative and other
operating expenses.
Net income attributable to partners was $72.1 million, or $0.53 per diluted unit, versus $34.9
million, or $0.87 per diluted unit, in the second quarter of 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA (1) for the quarter totaled $164.0 million, compared with $142.4 million in the
second quarter of 2015.  The favorable year-over-year comparison reflects stronger retail fuel and
merchandise margins, the contribution from third party acquisitions and new-to-industry locations
opened during the last 12 months offset by weaker wholesale margins.
Distributable cash flow attributable to partners (1), as adjusted, was $92.2 million, compared to
$39.3 million a year earlier.
On a weighted-average basis, fuel margin for all gallons sold increased to 13.8 cents per gallon,
compared to 12.9 cents per gallon in the second quarter of 2015.  The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase in margins in both the retail and wholesale segments.
Net income attributable to partners for the wholesale segment was $83.2 million compared to
$30.7 million a year ago.  Adjusted EBITDA was $77.3 million, versus $61.5 million in the
second quarter of last year.  Total wholesale gallons sold were 1,315.7 million, compared with
1,285.0 million in the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 2.4 percent.  This includes gallons
sold to consignment stores and third-party customers, including independent dealers, fuel
distributors and commercial customers. The Partnership earned 8.8 cents per gallon on these
volumes, compared to 8.6 cents per gallon a year earlier.

Exhibit 99.1
Net loss attributable to partners for the retail segment was $11.0 million compared to a net
income of $4.2 million a year ago.  Adjusted EBITDA was $86.7 million, versus $80.9 million in
the second quarter of last year.  Total retail gallons sold increased by 0.3 percent to 641.2 million
gallons as a result of the contribution from third party acquisitions and new-to-industry locations
opened during the last 12 months.  The Partnership earned 24.0 cents per gallon on these
volumes, compared to 21.4 cents per gallon a year earlier.
Total merchandise sales increased by 2.8 percent from a year ago to $576.6 million, reflecting
the contribution from third party acquisitions and new-to-industry locations opened during the last
12  months.  Merchandise sales contributed $187.3 million of gross profit with a retail
merchandise margin of 32.5 percent, a 100 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2015.
Same-store merchandise sales decreased by 1.8 percent, reflecting continued weakness in
SUN’s convenience store operations in the Texas oil producing regions and inclement weather
in May in Texas and on the East Coast.  Same-store fuel sales decreased by 2.8 percent as a
result of weakness throughout the state of Texas, particularly lower year-over-year activity in oil
producing markets.  In the Texas oil producing regions, same-store merchandise sales
decreased by 15.6 percent, and same-store fuel sales declined 17.9 percent.  Excluding the oil
producing regions, same-store sales increased by 0.6 percent, and same-store gallons
decreased by 1.0 percent.
As of June 30, SUN operated approximately 1,340 convenience stores and retail fuel outlets
along the East Coast, in the Southwest and in Hawaii. Third party operated sites totaled
approximately 5,600 locations.
SUN’s other recent accomplishments include the following:
·Completed the acquisition of retail locations serving the upstate New York market from
Valentine Stores, Inc., including 18 company-operated convenience stores that sell
approximately 20 million gallons of fuel annually.
 ·Completed the acquisition of the "Rattlers" convenience store assets and wholesale fuel
business from Kolkhorst Petroleum, Inc. This includes 14 company-operated locations and
wholesale fuel supply contracts for a network of independent dealer-owned and dealer-
operated locations in the Austin, Houston and Waco, Texas markets totaling approximately 46
million gallons annually.
 ·Entered into an agreement to purchase the fuels business of Emerge Energy Services LP
(NYSE: EMES) for $178.5 million, subject to working capital adjustments.  This includes Dallas-
based Direct Fuels LLC and Birmingham-based Allied Energy Company LLC, which engage in
the processing of transmix and the distribution of refined fuels.  These two processing plants
have attached refined product terminals with over 800,000 barrels of storage capacity.
 ·Entered into an agreement to purchase the convenience store, wholesale motor fuel distribution
and commercial fuels distribution businesses serving East Texas and Louisiana from Denny Oil
Company, Inc. The purchase agreement comprises six company-operated locations and
approximately 127 supply contracts with dealer-owned and dealer-operated sites and over 500
commercial customers.  
 ·Issued $800.0 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2021 through an upsized private offering that
raised proceeds, net of underwriter fees and expenses, of $789.4 million.  The notes proceeds
were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the senior secured term loan facility.
SUN’s segment results and other supplementary data are provided after the financial tables
below.
Distribution Increase
On July 26, the Board of Directors of SUN’s general partner declared a distribution for the second
quarter of 2016 of $0.8255 per unit, which corresponds to $3.3020 per unit on an annualized
basis.  This represents a 1.0 percent increase compared to the distribution for the first quarter of
2016 and a 19.1 percent increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. This is the
2
Exhibit 99.1
Partnership’s thirteenth consecutive quarterly increase. The distribution will be paid on August
15 to unitholders of record on August 5.
SUN’s distribution coverage ratio for the second quarter was 0.93 times. The distribution
coverage ratio on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.20 times.
Liquidity
At June 30, SUN had borrowings against its revolving line of credit of $675.0 million and other
long-term debt of $3.6 billion.  Availability on the revolving credit facility after borrowings and
letters of credit commitments was $802.8 million.  Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma for
acquisitions, was 5.2 times at the end of the second quarter.
(1)Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures of
performance that have limitations and should not be considered as a substitute for net income.
Please refer to the discussion and tables under "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures" later
in this news release for a discussion of our use of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash
flow, and a reconciliation to net income.

(1)Excludes the impact of inventory fair value adjustments consistent with the definition of
Adjusted EBITDA.
(2)We define EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income tax expense and
depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA to include
adjustments for non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on disposal of assets,
unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives and inventory fair value adjustments.
We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense including
the accrual of interest expense related to our 2020 and 2023 Senior Notes that is paid on a
semi-annual basis, current income tax expense, maintenance capital expenditures, and other
non-cash adjustments. Further adjustments are made to distributable cash flow for certain
transaction-related and non-recurring expenses that are included in net income.
7
Exhibit 99.1
We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and distributable cash flow are useful to investors in
evaluating our operating performance because:
•Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance measure under our revolving credit facility;
 •securities analysts and other interested parties use such metrics as measures of financial
performance, ability to make distributions to our unitholders and debt service capabilities;
•our management uses them for internal planning purposes, including aspects of our
consolidated operating budget, and capital expenditures; and
•distributable cash flow provides useful information to investors as it is a widely accepted
financial indicator used by investors to compare partnership performance, and as it provides
investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets and the cash our
business is generating.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not recognized terms under GAAP
and do not purport to be alternatives to net income (loss) as measures of operating performance
or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
and distributable cash flow have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in
isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these
limitations include:
•they do not reflect our total cash expenditures, or future requirements for, capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;
•they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;
 •they do not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our revolving credit facility or term loan;
•although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated
and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and
•because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies.
