particular with regard to the goals on the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, 
environmental sustainability and health, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that, as stated in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible 
cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate 
international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities 
and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also</i> that, as stated in the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and 
economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impact on 
the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for 
the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and

<p>development and the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling that in no 
case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> that, while these implications affect individuals and 
communities around the world, the adverse effects of climate change will be felt most 
acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations owing 
to factors such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status and 
disability, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that people in developing countries, particularly in least developed 
countries, small island developing States and African countries, that have contributed the 
least to global greenhouse gas emissions, are among the most vulnerable to the adverse 
effects of climate change on the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights, including 
the right to development, and should be provided with predictable, sustainable and adequate 
support to meet the costs of adaptation to and mitigation of those adverse effects, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the need to give due consideration in the elaboration of the post-2015 
development agenda to the role of international cooperation in relation to the special needs 
and particular circumstances of developing countries and to addressing the adverse impact 
of climate change on the full and effective realization of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that climate change is an urgent global problem requiring a global 
solution, and that effective international cooperation to enable the full, effective and 
sustained implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change in accordance with the provisions and principles of the Convention is important in 
order to support national efforts for the realization of human rights affected by climate 
change-related impact, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that, as stated in the Rio Declaration, States should cooperate to strengthen 
endogenous capacity-building for sustainable development by improving scientific 
understanding through the exchange of scientific and technological knowledge, and by 
enhancing the development, adaptation, diffusion and transfer of technologies, including 
new innovative technologies, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that human rights obligations, standards and principles have the potential 
to inform and strengthen international, regional and national policymaking in the area of 
climate change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the establishment of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the launching of the 
second edition of <i>Climate Vulnerability Monitor</i> in 2012 in New York, which may become

</p>
<p>1. <i>Reiterates its concern</i> that the adverse effects of climate change have a range 
of direct and indirect implications for the effective enjoyment of all human rights, and that 
the effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by individuals and communities 
around the world that are already in vulnerable situations owing to geography, poverty, 
gender, age, indigenous or minority status or disability; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Expresses concern</i> that climate change has contributed to the increase of both 
sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse 
effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Emphasizes</i> the urgent importance of continuing to address, as they relate to 
States&#8217; human rights obligations, the adverse consequences of climate change for all, 
particularly in developing countries and its people whose situation is most vulnerable to 
climate change, especially those in a situation of extreme poverty, and deteriorating 
livelihood conditions; </p>


<p>4. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of fostering dialogue and cooperation between 
relevant international organizations and stakeholders to develop the analysis of the linkages 
between human rights and climate change; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to continue to enhance international dialogue and 
cooperation in relation to the adverse impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human 
rights, including the right to development, particularly in developing countries, especially 
least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, including 
through dialogue and measures, such as the implementation of practical steps to promote 
and facilitate capacity-building, financial resources and technology transfer; 
</p>
<p>6.  <i>Decides</i> to incorporate into its programme of work for the twenty-eighth 
session a full-day discussion on specific themes relating to human rights and climate 
change on the basis of the different elements contained in the present resolution, and to 
dedicate one panel to identifying challenges and ways forward towards the realization of all 
human rights for all, including the right to development, in particular those in vulnerable 
situations, as well as the measures and best practices to promote and protect human rights 
that can be adopted by States in addressing the adverse effects of climate change on the full 
and effective enjoyment of human rights, and another panel discussion to how climate
