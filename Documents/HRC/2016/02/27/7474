<p><b> I. Mandate on promoting human rights through sport and the 
Olympic ideal 
</b>1. In its resolution 24/1, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory Committee 
to prepare a study on the possibilities of using sport and the Olympic ideal to promote 
human rights for all and to strengthen universal respect for them, bearing in mind both the 
value of relevant principles enshrined in the Olympic Charter and the value of good 
sporting example, and to present a progress report thereon to the Council before its twenty-
seventh session. 
</p>
<p>2. Also in that resolution, the Council requested the Committee to seek the views and 
input of States Members of the United Nations, international and regional organizations, 
national human rights institutions, civil society organizations and other relevant 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>3. The Advisory Committee designated, at its twelfth session, in February 2014 a 
drafting group1 to be in charge of the preparation of the study. The drafting group submitted 
a draft progress report to the Committee before its thirteenth session, with a view to its 
being submitted it to the Council in September 2014. 
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with Council resolution 24/1, the drafting group prepared a 
questionnaire, which was sent in March 2014 to all Member States, international and 
regional organizations, national human rights institutions, civil society organizations and 
other relevant stakeholders. As of August 2014, responses had been received from 22 States 
(Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Chile, China, Colombia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Cuba, 
Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Guatemala, Mauritania, Myanmar, Peru, Qatar, the 
Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Tunisia), 5 national human rights institutions, 
8 non-governmental organizations and civil society representatives, an international 
organization and a special procedure mandate-holder. The Committee intends to seek 
further contributions on the issue and to send a reminder to those who have not yet 
responded. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General outline of the study 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction and objectives 
</b>5. The purpose of the present study is to help stakeholders assess the general factors 
relating to modern human rights policy in sport and provide some insights for its 
development and improvement in a coherent, comprehensive and systematic manner. 
Widening the possibilities of using sport and the Olympic ideal to promote and to 
strengthen universal respect for human rights for all requires sustained efforts based on the 
following considerations. 
</p>
<p>6. Sport plays a significant role and represents an expanding portion of among human 
activity. It stand for a strong will to overcome the limitations of human abilities, a desire for 
self-realization aimed at cultivating our fullest potential, and a way of learning to 
communicate and achieve harmony through fair play. 
</p>

 The drafting group is composed of Mr. Al Faihani, Mr. Coriolano, Mr. Lebedev (Rapporteur) and 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang. </p>


<p>7. The values, purposes and mission of sport in the modern globalized world are 
multifaceted and multidisciplinary. Sport is a multidimensional cultural activity for all as it 
is a physical group and leisure activity which enriches our lives.2 Sport has a broad scope: it 
includes physical exercise and is also a tool to improve lifestyle, provide employment 
opportunities, and promote peace, development, respect and anti-racism. Taken together, 
these elements can generate outstanding results and outcomes. If sport is used in the right 
way it can help build a generation and environment that is based on respect and 
cooperation, thereby strengthening respect for human rights3 and promoting human rights 
for all. 
</p>
<p>8. Sport brings new opportunities and potential for individuals, communities and 
States. It expands global commitments in strengthening physical, mental and emotional 
health, social welfare and cohesion, promoting camaraderie, physical prowess, team 
cooperation, solidarity, adherence to standards and rules of the game, with an emphasis on 
participation, equality, shared humanity, harmony and generosity, preventing to impose 
individual supremacy on others in cultural everyday life, leisure and sport, raising 
awareness and understanding of human rights. Sport and the Olympic ideal can also be a 
means to advance the cause of peace, promote development and combat all forms of 
discrimination. Sport is important in promoting human rights worldwide through 
interaction between different people and races. It unites many people on one issue 
irrespective of race, religion, and background. Discrimination could wither away with sport 
because sport teaches people co-operation, coordination and respect for others. In sport 
people from different cultures have the opportunity to work together in a team spirit. The 
universality of sport and Olympic ideals can educate people with regard to the values of 
respect, diversity, tolerance and fairness and serve as a means to combat all forms of 
discrimination and promote a coherent society. 
</p>
<p>9. Sport is a critical part of a strong, healthy, confident community, and is described by 
UNESCO as a &#8220;fundamental right for all&#8221;.4 The values of sport &#8211; including integrity, 
teamwork, excellence, respect, tolerance, fair play and friendship &#8211; mean that it provides an 
excellent context in which young people can learn and grow. Hence, the values of the 
Olympic Movement and human rights go hand in hand. Sport and all those involved in 
sport events are directly dealing with the Olympic values and are therefore key in 
promoting, educating and sensitizing people about the importance of these values.5 
Moreover, sports should be used as channel to promote equality of education, health, 
gender and ethnic groups as well as to protect the rights of persons with disabilities and the 
environment.6 
</p>
<p>10. The right to play sport has undergone a remarkable conceptual development in 
recent years and now reflects a desire to conduct a healthy way of life as part of human 
dignity. This right is rooted in different other rights and concepts, first of all in the rights for 
health, participation in cultural life and development. It must be guaranteed to all, children, 
youth, elderly, women, the rich, the poor and people with special needs.7 It is evident that in 
sports competitions stakeholders cannot interfere in the winning of medals, and the fact that 
prizes are achieved in an individual capacity, and not as result of State interference, makes 
us consider the potential of the individual as a creative and dignified actor in him or herself,

<p>beyond the State as a whole. This enhances the protection of individual rights and freedoms 
as a guarantee for future social progress.8 
</p>
<p>11. It is important to implement sport freedom, the right to play sport, beyond politics 
seeking to sustain an important work to create a better world through sport, physical 
activity and play. The cohesion and neutrality of the sport movement are important factors 
for achieving Olympic ideals and values. Sport events should not be used to demonstrate 
political protests or boycotts as measures of political pressure. Not without reason it 
becomes promising to promote the ideals of the Olympic Truce in advance of the Games of 
the Olympiads and the Paralympic Games, and recognize the importance of constructive 
partnerships with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International 
Paralympic Committee, the International Olympic Truce Centre, hosts of the Games, the 
United Nations and other Member States in supporting the implementation of resolutions 
on the Olympic Truce. Because sports promote rapprochement and help reduce the levels of 
violence, recreational programmes and sports games have become a tacit truce in some 
regions surged by armed conflicts.9 
</p>
<p>12. The following evaluations, observations and recommendations provide a review and 
examination of the main areas where the continuing integration of a human rights approach 
into the practice of sport and the implementation of the Olympic ideal seems potentially the 
most beneficial or fruitful in the short-run to promote and to strengthen universal respect 
for human rights for all. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal and social framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. Placing sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind, with a 
view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity is 
embedded in the Olympic Charter and as such forms part of the fundamental principles of 
IOC. For the purposes of the present study the following provision of the Olympic Charter 
has core significance: &#8220;<i>The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have 
the possibility to practice sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic 
spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair 
play</i>&#8221;.10 
</p>
<p>14. IOC and the constituents of the Olympic Movement at large devote a growing 
quantity of resources to areas of development through sport, helping to promote youth, 
formal education, culture, healthy lifestyles, sustainability, gender equality, understanding 
among peoples and peace. Their projects, beyond granting vulnerable communities their 
right to leisure, support human rights at large. Countless initiatives with this objective and 
scope have been implemented by IOC and relevant partners over the last two decades.11 
Over the last years, the collaboration between UN and the Olympic Movement was further 
strengthened.12 Obviously, sport as a form of human activities should be construed and 
practiced under general human rights provisions and specific conventions. 
</p>
<p>15. A pivotal role of Olympic Charter is complemented by the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and different UN basic guiding documents and resolutions. General 
Assembly resolution 67/17 of 28 November 2012 recalls its resolutions 58/5 of 3 
November 2003, 59/10 of 27 October 2004, its decision to proclaim 2005 the International

 UNOSDP ANNUAL REPORT 2012 covering 1 January through 31 December 2012. </p>


<p>Year for Sport and Physical Education, to strengthen sport as a means to promote 
education, health, development and peace, and its resolutions 60/1 of 16 September 2005, 
60/9 of 3 November 2005, 61/10 of 3 November 2006, 62/271 of 23 July 2008, 63/135 of 
11 December 2008 and 65/4 of 18 October 2010.  
</p>
<p>16. The report of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;Sport for development and peace: 
mainstreaming a versatile instrument&#8221; reviews the programmes and initiatives implemented 
by UN Members States , UN funds and programmes, specialized agencies and other 
partners, using sport as a tool for development and peace. The UN General Assembly 
recognized the potential of sport to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), noting that sport has the potential, as declared in the 2005 
World Summit Outcome, to foster peace and development and to contribute to an 
atmosphere of tolerance and understanding, and reaffirming that sport is a tool for 
education that can promote cooperation, solidarity, social inclusion and health at the local, 
national and international levels, as declared in the outcome document of the high-level 
plenary meeting of the GA on the MDGs. Moreover, numerous UN resolutions and reports 
appeal to advance peace, development, diversity, tolerance, fairness, mutual respect, human 
understanding, dialogue, reconciliation, competition spirit, gender equality, combating 
discrimination, racism, social exclusion and marginalization. Member States are for 
instance requested to create more opportunities for persons with disabilities, to contribute to 
expansion of mass sport activities, to support high performance in sporting events, to 
engage more children and young persons, women and girls and older persons in sport and 
to provide access facilitation and barriers-free environment. 
</p>
<p>17. It is worth outlining the regional scope of developing legal grounds for promoting 
human rights through sport and the Olympic ideal. A good example is the March 2013 
Commonwealth Charter, which outlines the Commonwealth&#8217;s core values and aspirations. 
Building on previous communiqu&#233;s and declarations (such as the Harare Declaration in 
1991), the Charter demonstrates the commitment of Commonwealth countries to a defined 
set of shared beliefs.13 
</p>
<p>18. Observations of States and independent experts underpinned the work on this study 
to a major extent. It is furthermore essential to stress the tremendous contribution, including 
in terms of awareness raising, of scientific community that continues to provide vibrant 
critical evaluations, sometimes controversial and disputable, on all features of sport&#8217;s 
proliferation in society, to identify advantages and shortcomings of sporting management, 
to suggest ways and means of improvement in the interest of promoting human rights and, 
at the end, wellbeing of all. For many years governments have kept academics at arm&#8217;s 
length, academic knowledge was geared mostly to the sport community, the identification 
of talent and the production of medals-industrial complex.14 It appears that the increasing 
number of impressive academic multidisciplinary sport research leads to changing this 
situation, which deserves special attention, but is beyond the scope of this study. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Role of different types of sporting events 
</b></p>
<p>19. Sporting events can help promote awareness and understanding of human rights 
principles through interaction between different people and cultures. It is important to 
identify synergies and complementarities between sport and human rights that would 
pinpoint the relations between them, so as to promote the values of diversity, tolerance and

<p>fairness and to combat all forms of discrimination. It is also important to identify the 
obstacles to promoting human rights faced in that regard. 
</p>
<p>20. Sport and Olympic events encourage people from different backgrounds to promote 
certain games and can thus bring people closer together and make them familiar with each 
other. The spirit of mutual promotion of sports would eventually decrease prejudice, and as 
many people would join in this, disseminate such spirit further. This would create an 
environment that is conducive to the promotion of their rights. 
</p>
<p>21. The following categories of sports events may be distinguished: local, national, 
regional, continental, international and global as well as special targeted programmes. The 
categorization is functional and depends on the commitments and objectives of the 
organizers who decide upon the concrete requirements for each category. 
</p>
<p>22. As a result of the staging of multiple sports events in different regions of a country, 
the regions have benefited from the construction of sports venues, hotels, access roads, and 
especially from the development of the know-how, the tourism industry and the overall 
impact on the economy.15 Countries hosting events have to ensure equality among the 
participating countries, and participants have to treat all competitors equally.16 
</p>
<p>23. Global or mega sporting events like the Olympics or World Cups capture special 
national and international attention due to their advancing human rights role and well-
known wider economic, social and cultural agenda. Global dimension and increasing 
ratings of major competitions let us assume that modern sport becomes universal facilitator 
of general humanitarian ideas and approaches addressed to all mankind.17 From a human 
rights perspective, recent controversies about the balance between related opportunities and 
risks have renewed fundamental questions about the responsibilities of host governments, 
and international governing bodies sports that set the terms for staging this kind of events.18 
A scholar discourse continues on failures to strike a fair balance between celebrating 
humanity and market manipulation.19 
</p>
<p>24. Major sporting events can be used as a catalyst to implement child protective 
strategies and to strengthen cooperation among various stakeholders to mitigate potential 
harm. In this respect, there is a need to involve and build partnerships with key 
stakeholders, such as IOC, host countries, and the business sector. It is necessary to include 
a human rights (including children&#8217;s rights) impact assessment in the bidding criteria of 
major sport organizers.20 In this regard, the &#8220;Children Win Project&#8221; of ECPAT and Terre 
des Hommes calls for a revision of bidding processes of major sport organizers, to include 
at all stages assessment, risk mitigation measures, and reinforcement of positive effects.21

<p>25. Local, national and regional sports events could include special targeted 
competitions for ethnic sport strands designed to demonstrate different ethnic traditions, 
practices and customs.22 
</p>
<p>26. Stakeholders, and in particular the organizers of mass sports events, should use and 
leverage such events to promote and support sport for development and peace initiatives.23 
</p>
<p><b> D. Instrumental significance of education, training and capacity-building 
in sport 
</b></p>
<p>27. Sport and Olympic values should be the most privileged channel to spread the 
Olympic ideal among citizens and to educate them to respect human rights.24 If the practice 
of sport is a human right, education programmes to support that right, need to be given due 
prominence in curriculum planning. Through such programmes can the spirit of friendship, 
mutual respect, solidarity and fair play be promoted, learned and embedded into individuals 
and their communities.25 
</p>
<p>28. Physical activity and sports are employed when training children and youth in social 
skills and in the acquisition of positive attitudes and moral values. Hence the need to 
promote active participation and involvement in all matters relating to human rights, using 
sport as a motivator to learn about them in training processes of children and young people 
and helping to ensure that education is durable thanks to its popularity.26 
</p>
<p>29. Sport is more than an isolated activity. It can be represented as an integrative bridge 
between education, culture, music and dance in order to strengthen the Olympic values.27 
Physical activity should aim at children becoming acquainted with their culture and more 
respectful for diversity, tolerance, games rules and behavioural codes. It is significant that 
sports events in Cyprus are organized to bring together Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot 
children.28 
</p>
<p>30. In primary education, sports have a profound effect on children, the development of 
their skills and the promotion of gender equality.29 
</p>
<p>31. Promoting peace culture, aiming to prevent vandalism and violence during sport 
events, particularly in football stadiums, calls for continuous and active action by all 
stakeholders. An important reference is the UNESCO International Charter of Physical 
Education and Sport which seeks to combat these human rights violations.30 
</p>
<p><b> E. Sport as a tool for advancing civil society 
</b></p>
<p>32. Sport does not need a language, but only the human capacity, irrespective of the 
different nationalities, religions and ideas. It can form the cornerstone to combine states and 
human society.31 Sport should be conceived as a tool for dialogue, fraternity and respect. It

<p>has often been the only way to find the path for dialogue between divided communities. It 
allows creating synergies between public and private sectors in vulnerable areas worldwide 
in a concrete and effective manner, and can engage international corporations by making 
them aware of their social and local responsibility.32 
</p>
<p>33. Certain alliances between civil society, private enterprises, international 
organizations and national institutions for the promotion of sport, including those focusing 
on children, youth, the elderly and persons with disabilities deserve to be recognized. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Sport and combating all forms of discrimination and racism 
</b></p>
<p>34. One of the distinctive features of the Olympic Charter is to oppose all forms of 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>35. In sports, any type of discrimination is prohibited, such as based on race, colour, 
gender, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, belonging to 
national minority, property, disability, birth or other status. Besides, illegal migration and 
the financial crisis are feeding sources for racist ideas inside society and can therefore be 
brought to sport. 
</p>
<p>36. The Olympic Ideal envisages a society without any discrimination. It seeks to 
develop sincere understanding, cooperation and friendship between people and to set up a 
unique and shining example: gaining laurels through fair competition on an equal footing.33 
</p>
<p>37. The best way to combat all forms of discrimination is education, especially for 
young generation who can be used to respect human rights thought the Olympic principles 
of friendship, respect and excellence.34 While the respect of the Olympic Movement values 
could lead to overcome all forms of discrimination,35 an international academic debate 
continues on the real benefits of promoting these values. Critical scholars argue that 
&#8220;athletes who are co-opted by the &#8220;educational outreach&#8221; branch of the Olympic industry as 
role models, risk entrenching sexism, racism, and other discriminatory systems that they 
may be hoping to challenge&#8221;.36 
</p>
<p>38. Sport can combat social barriers, promote communication about gender 
discrimination and contribute to bringing men and women closer together to enhance social 
cohesion.37 
</p>
<p>39. The adoption of certain protocols has contributed to combating discrimination, such 
as handshakes between players, anti-discrimination banners in athletic fields, international 
athletic conferences and laws providing penalties for all forms of discrimination.38

<p><b> G. Business, public-private partnerships on human rights and sport 
</b></p>
<p>40. Labour, employment, health and safety in sport activities management require that 
employment standards as expressed in the International Labour Organization&#8217;s (ILO) 
Fundamental Conventions are met by suppliers (including any sponsors who provide goods 
or services), along with, where appropriate, other local initiatives. ILO Conventions set out 
a &#8220;social floor&#8221; in the world of employment, and provide for the elimination of all forms of 
compulsory or forced labour and the effective abolition of child labour. Accountability and 
transparency, and complaint mechanisms guarantee the inadmissibility of human rights 
abuses of licensees, including child labour, excessive working hours, and abuses of health 
and safety laws in the supply chains.39 Some researchers call for social responsibility to 
become a pillar of the Olympic Movement and argue that if future Olympic Games and the 
Olympic movement in general wish to claim an authentic legacy, this must be demonstrated 
by accessible housing, tenants&#8217; rights, freedom of assembly, a free media, unrestricted 
public use of public spaces, and the protection of children and young people from Olympic 
propaganda.40 
</p>
<p>41. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human rights can contribute to the 
promotion of human rights during the management of sport events, but they cannot avoid 
negative human rights impacts. However, if implemented from the outset of the life-cycle 
of mega sporting events, the UN Guiding Principles can reaffirm state duties to protect 
individuals from rights abuses involving non-state actors. In addition, they can offer a 
process to mitigate and effectively manage business-related human rights risks.41 In this 
respect strong not-for-profit partnerships and sponsorships could be required to accumulate 
additional revenues to support sport activities in schools and universities. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Incorporating sport to conflict-prevention activities and peace building 
</b></p>
<p>42. The potential of sports is often described as a tool to overcome humanitarian crises 
and conflict and post-conflict situations, and to help achieve the Millennium Development 
Goals and create a better world.42 The greatest challenge for a country in disturbances or 
internal conflict is a dialogue or signature of a peace agreement with actors in the armed 
conflict. Because sports promote rapprochement and helps reduce the levels of violence, 
recreational programs and sports games have become a tacit truce in some regions where 
there is armed conflict. Several programs have been launched too assist victims of the 
conflict and the children, and young people involved. Coexistence and Peace Programs 
complete this work by means of recreational training and sports training in order to 
strengthen relations of coexistence among children and youth, and also to prevent and 
mitigate the effects of violence.43 
</p>
<p>43. Sport can promote peace through the competition of athletes of enemy countries.44 
The fact that citizens of countries at war or conflict can meet others in an environment of 
peace and tranquillity is very positive and helps break taboos which have been the source of

<p>many conflicts.45 In the current peace process and in accordance with the Millennium 
Development Goals, sports play a relevant role which is directly linked to poverty 
reduction, inclusion and equality of opportunities. In this process, the media can take an 
essential part for the common goal of peace.46 Practice of sport and its impressive attracting 
power have allowed peoples living in high-risk areas or rivalry zones to meet at diverse 
sport activities through several programmes. This has increased socialization without 
violent confrontations and has contributed to acceptation and tolerance, favouring social 
cohesion.47 
</p>
<p>44. In post-conflict societies, the use of sport and the values of the Olympic Movement 
can offer an alternative life model and an outlet for the energy of youth, life training 
through rules, respect for one&#8217;s opponent and tolerance of difference. In non-post-conflict 
societies the first step is to tolerate the specific characteristics of others, respect their human 
rights and defend them when needed. The next step is to enhance cross-cultural exchange 
and teach the young generation to eliminate the causes of conflict like sex discrimination 
and marginalization of social groups for cultural reasons. Sport can help educate people 
about these values, especially youth.48 Sport also helps eradicate extreme poverty and 
hunger, promotes gender equality, reduces child mortality, improves maternal health and 
develops a global partnership for development.49 
</p>
<p>45. Sports play an important role in promoting international relations among peoples 
and open up the field of competition between amateur and professional athletics. 
Exchanging visits away from the political conflicts lead to the expression of love and 
cooperation and thus help politicians to solve a lot of problems. Moreover, athletes are 
considered as ambassadors of peace, cooperation and friendship between the peoples 
through their participation at local and international levels.50 
</p>
<p>46. Sports can also advance the cause of peace by bridging social, economic and cultural 
divides and building a sense of shared identity. It is important for States to cooperate with 
IOC and the International Paralympic Committee to use sport as a tool to promote peace, 
dialogue and reconciliation in areas of conflict during and beyond the period of the 
Olympic and Paralympic Games.51  
</p>
<p><b> I. Media, sport and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>47. The media is a critical stakeholder and has an essential role in the promotion of 
human rights in as far as information dissemination is concerned. Because it has the power 
to shape public opinion, it can illustrate how sport can translate into respect for human 
rights and promote social cohesion and acceptance of diversity.52 Media use mass 
communication tools during commentaries of football and other sporting events and can 
easily disseminate human rights promotion messages during such events.53 Moreover, the 
mass media could play a pivotal role in either encouraging or discouraging human rights in 
sport. The sentimental reporting has a negative impact, while factual reporting increases

<p>respect for human rights and hence contributes to their promotion. The media has an 
important role in demonstrating the clear benefits of sport, not only in the area of health, 
but regarding social cohesion.54 Cooperation between the public and the media&#8217;s role in the 
protection of human rights is at a very high level. Media gives a fair coverage of every 
violation of the rights of athletes and also broadcasts programmes to educate people.55 The 
media as an influential actor spreads social responsibility through sport and promotes 
massive social mobilization as regards its practice. It is argued that sports event should thus 
be covered by more television channels and national newspapers. In this way, they would 
be able to highlight the requirements for a culture of peace, such as fair game, cooperation 
and respect for the opponent.56 Media can strengthen human rights through the exposure of 
all levels of sport, moderating obsession and highlighting minority sports, sports played by 
women, and sports performed by persons with disabilities.57 
</p>
<p>48. Spreading knowledge about physical fitness, broadcasting sporting events and 
reporting on public figures in sports encourages viewers to appreciate high-level matches 
and sportsmanship. Disseminating knowledge of sports and the Olympic Games helps 
enhance cooperation, the understanding of friendship and enterprising spirit. It is important 
to work to improve friendship and communication between athletes and trainers from 
different countries or regions. Launching advertising campaigns to promote human rights, 
sometimes with the assistance of star athletes, is intended to raise awareness in society, to 
increase accessibility and to encourage greater inclusion of disadvantaged groups.58 Some 
programmes do this by hosting members of the public and jurists who condemn cases of 
racial discrimination or intolerance, whether by athletes, judges, or audiences, in order to 
raise the level of awareness of human rights among the public.59 
</p>
<p>49. The media play a very important role in the promotion and popularization of sport, 
and in shaping the needs of the population with regard to everyday sport practices and 
healthy living. It is the media which have made possible the globalization of sports. They 
act as an amplifier for actions and sports policies, both positive and negative, and have 
therefore become a powerful tool both for and against the promotion of human rights 
through sport.60 The media aims to encourage governments to impose more transparency 
and accountability in the sports system. The media also expose human rights violations, 
provide an arena for different voices to be heard and offer a significant opportunity for the 
promotion of peace through sports and the Olympics and play a vital role in the creation of 
a friendlier society and more peaceful world.61 
</p>
<p>50. The media have made sport attractive to business, thereby turning it into a huge 
industry and helping to launch new mass sport trends. The modern media promotes 
outstanding sportsmen, provides funding, and fulfils humanitarian, educational and other 
support objectives. 
</p><p>51. Misleading and false information can have an adverse effect on the promotion of 
human rights in sport. Incorrect information often circulates in certain countries, where 
athletes and fans may take it for fact. This could give rise to violence and infringe the rights

<p>of sporting adversaries. The public should be educated on the prevention of the spread of 
false information without knowing its consequences. 
</p>
<p>52. The racist comments and slander which are widespread during sport games and 
sometimes in the Olympic Games may occur either deliberately or involuntarily as a result 
of loss of temper and may contribute to the erosion of the rights of others during the 
Games. To avoid such negative outbursts it is important to adopt and implement rigorous 
and effective disciplinary measures to preserve the rights of athletes and promote human 
rights in sports. It is not enough that victims are to use only legal procedures, which are too 
long-winded to allow them to assert their rights or obtain compensation. 
</p>
<p>53. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as ECPAT and Terre des Hommes 
work with traditional and digital media on awareness-raising initiatives, such as the &#8220;Don&#8217;t 
Look Away&#8221; campaign and the &#8220;Children Win&#8221; project, which highlight positive and 
negative effects of major sporting events on children.62 
</p>
<p><b> J. Sport and development, in particular in post-2015 development agenda 
</b></p>
<p>54. The ability of sport to promote self-belief alongside collective optimism makes it an 
ideal social development tool. All sport is based on respect for the rules and an equal 
respect for, and acceptance of, those who make and apply the rules. The Olympic focus on 
the harmonious development of humankind is echoed at every level from children&#8217;s street 
games to the highest levels of performance sport.63 Sport can promote sustainable 
development if accompanied by awareness of economic and environmental issues of 
international sport events and measures to address them.64 
</p>
<p>55. The Olympic Games have the capacity to boost economic development. Hosting the 
Olympic Games can generate considerable indirect economic benefits.65 Sport promotes 
development in a country in a variety of ways. For example, building urban and rural public 
sports and exercise facilities for several disciplines in different regions contributes to 
economic dynamism.66 Sport has unique attributes that can contribute to the development 
process: its capacity as a communication platform, its ability to connect people and its 
popularity make it a development tool that can be used to meet high standards.67 
Developmental strategies may be used to promote a country&#8217;s human resources as its main 
asset and capital.68 The first European Games, to be hosted by Azerbaijan in 2015, will be 
aiming to develop new sports infrastructure, to create new jobs, to provide visas, 
transportation and other services at the highest standards.69 Guatemala expects to host the 
Central-American and Caribbean Games in 2018, which would involve an estimated 
investment in infrastructure and organization of 450 million quetzals.70 After IOC approved 
the Olympic Movement&#8217;s Agenda 21 (for the 21st century), the London and Sochi Olympic 
Games were managed on a sustainable development basis.71

<p>56. Sport has the potential for creating employment, thereby increasing the revenue base 
of a country. The money raised through taxes can be used for different development 
projects such as the construction of roads, bridges, hospitals, water pumps etc. Sport can 
also be a mechanism through which youth talent can be exploited to create income 
generation for the individual and the community. Additionally, sport can provide a 
mechanism for keeping youth busy and engaged and thereby keeping them from idleness 
and vagrancy.72 Development programmes that use sport can facilitate the transfer of skills 
acquired in the field, in particular life skills and employability skills. Moreover, sport is a 
catalyst for economic development whereby all elements of the sports economy are 
interconnected, and simultaneously contribute to, and benefit from, its development, at the 
local level in particular, as a result of economies of scale.73 
</p>
<p>57. One of the most important factors in promoting the development of a country in 
different ways is to bring social change. The organization of sporting events in the country 
and the practice of various disciplines carry educational messages which can raise 
awareness on social issues such as HIV/AIDS, racial or gender discrimination, as these 
events and playing sport itself often attract people who do not normally respond to current 
inclusion policies. Institutional methods can thereby reach a much wider and diverse 
audience. Sport can also be used as an effective tool to promote school attendance, improve 
health, create jobs, help the economy, promote gender equality and increase environmental 
awareness, inter alia.74 
</p>
<p>58. Projects addressing life skills and teaching values contributing to constructive 
behaviours and respect for human rights are of essential importance. Under &#8220;Sports for 
Hope Programme&#8221; &#8211; by setting up Olympic Youth Development Centres (OYDCs) in 
developing countries, in particular, in Zambia and Haiti, IOC aims to provide young people 
and communities with positive sports and lifestyle opportunities, offer modern and 
professional training facilities to the athletes of the entire region, and spread the Olympic 
values of excellence, friendship and respect.75 
</p>
<p>59. IOC projects integrated into development projects and delivered jointly with 
appropriate specialized partners, adapted sports activities and sport at large can be effective 
tools for the socioeconomic development of communities. 
</p>
<p>60. Promoting policies to train teachers and qualified coaches to ensure good sports 
facilities and make them available for free access are fundamental factors for the 
development.76 
</p>
<p><b> K. Best practices, national experiences and models to follow 
</b></p>
<p>61. Opportunities to play, competitively or recreationally, are readily available to all 
either through education, community or commercial provision. Sport is increasingly being 
recognized as a vehicle for inclusion and cohesion. Its benefits, in terms of equality and 
social integration, of building self-esteem and resilience and its power to unite more than 
divide are gaining ever more political and apolitical credibility. Its contributions to the 
physical and mental well-being of individuals, communities and the nation are manifold 
and not to be ignored or undervalued, as has happened in recent times.

<p>62. The best practices arise from the collective body of sport lobbying and persuading 
politicians to coordinate the input of health, education and social services to address the 
inadequate emphasis that has plagued sport for so long. Improving collective focus on the 
wellbeing of children gives a strong base on which to build and make the most out of sport 
in order to to turn increasingly active children into lifelong active adults with all the societal 
benefits that that will provide.77 
</p>
<p>63. An example of the promotion of social inclusion and the concept of fair play and 
respect for opponents, especially among children and adolescents, is the &#8220;Get Ahead&#8221; 
programme in Colombia, which contributes to having a complete education and improving 
the quality of life of children and young people between 7 and 17 years, both at and outside 
school. The programme is supported by an incentives package for students and athletes, 
teachers and coaches, as well as educational institutions, municipalities and departments.78 
</p>
<p>64. The Government of Greece seeks to use sports as a tool to instil the Olympic values 
in the young generation, to help them gradually to build a culture of peace. It is there that 
Olympic values come together with the respect for human rights. The Ministry of 
Education also supports the development of innovative educational programmes that help to 
reach the young generation and educate them on how to uphold the Olympic ideals and 
respect for human rights in their everyday lives. The Imagine Peace Educational 
programme that was implemented in the school years 2011&#8211;2012 and 2012&#8211;2013 was 
aimed at teaching children the basic Olympic values, which encompass human rights. The 
Respecting Diversity Educational programme began this school year and is aimed at 
educating students, through the history and ideals of the Olympic Truce, on how to respect 
diversity and how to address such issues when they face them through the work of 
Olympians, who share with students their experiences of participating in the Olympic 
Games. The International Olympic Truce Centre is organizing the Imagine Peace Youth 
Camp in Ancient Olympia, with participants from all over the world, brought together in a 
week-long camp to learn the principles and ideals of Olympism. Finally, the Government of 
Greece has endorsed a joint project between UNICEF Hellas and the International Olympic 
Truce Centre which promote the values of peace, tolerance and solidarity.79 
</p>
<p>65. In Guatemala, the 90-0 Programme (90 minutes with no violence) focuses on 
promoting peace culture, and is aimed at preventing vandalism and violence during sports 
events in football stadiums, as it is the most popular sport in Guatemala. It is supported by 
the Guatemalan Football Players Association and the National Football Federation of 
Guatemala. The Friday 24-0 prevention programme (24 hours with no violent deaths) is a 
programme launched in January 2014 by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of 
Governance via the Third Deputy-Ministry for the Prevention of Violence and Crime. It 
covers 3,791 educational centres and is aimed at the coordination of sport and arts projects 
with a view conducive to an environment of peaceable coexistence within a human rights 
framework. It is also aimed at teaching students in public institutions behaviours against 
domestic violence, in schools and in their communities. 
</p>
<p>66. In view of the effects of sport on society, in Guatemala it is also used as a tool for 
social mobilization in support for a variety of causes (i.e. cancer, autism, peace and non-
violence, HIV/AIDS, disabled persons) through different activities. Through these 
programmes, sport also plays a role as an alternative to harmful or high-risk activities.80

<p>67. In China, the National Health Plan, which was adopted in 1995, effectively 
integrates sport and sporting events with national development and national education 
policies. The Plan lists goals and targets, such as building 1,200,000 nationwide sport 
fields, thereby increasing the per capita sport field to 1.5 square meters. The Plan stipulates 
that all children should engage in physical exercise at least one hour daily while at school. 
China has 250 million students at school; thus the benefits of the plan are self-evident. The 
plan contains policies for vulnerable groups such as women, children and youth, the 
elderly, the disabled and national minorities. The plan also calls for the strengthening of 
research into and development of sport for persons with disabilities, the organization of 
cultural, physical and recreational activities specifically for children, with free access to 
public sports facilities.81 
</p>
<p>68. The Russian Federation promotes the establishment and development of national 
and international systems of Olympic education, and puts forward its model as best practice 
to follow, with 20 years of successful experience of partnership between government and 
non-government stakeholders.82 
</p>
<p>69. In France, the Ministry of Sport has a policy of prevention and combating behaviour 
that fails to respect human rights and sports values. The Minister of Sport aims to promote 
athletes&#8217; awareness of the values of the Olympic ideal to prevent behaviour that would 
violate human rights. It also aims to promote sport as a privileged place with shared values 
such asrespect for tolerance, solidarity and fair play. In this regard, it has put in place three 
interministerial programmes: 
</p>
<p>(a) National Programme 2012&#8211;2014 against racism and anti-Semitism organized 
by the Comit&#233; interministeriel de lutte contre le racism et l&#8217;antis&#233;mitisme (CILRA); 
</p>
<p>(b) Government Programme 2014&#8211;2016 against sexual violence and 
discrimination; 
</p>
<p>(c) 4th Interministerial Programme for combating violence against women. 
</p><p>70. As the media play a very important role in communicating the Olympic ideal on 
human rights, significant awareness-raising with regard to the inclusion of women began 
with a programme of the Conseil sup&#233;rieur de l&#8217;audiovisuel (CSA), which had a seat on the 
National Council of Sport. The Ministry of Sport provides grants for financial projects to 
increase broadcasting time for less popular sports with a view to encouraging the 
universalization of sport. To enhance respect for human rights, the Government of France 
has as one of its aims that every federation should draft a statute giving effect to the 
principles of the charter of ethics and conduct of the National Olympic Committee.83 
</p>
<p>71. In Cyprus special sports programmes are aimed at strengthening the relationship 
between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities and at facilitating 
communication.84 
</p>
<p>72. Long-term awareness-raising campaigns are important to involve major sport 
organizers in a sustainable way before, during and after major sporting events. ECPAT, 
Terre des Hommes, and the Oak Foundation have conducted important initiatives and 
media campaigns to combat the sexual exploitation of children in major sporting events. 
The &#8220;Don&#8217;t Look Away&#8221; campaign, led by ECPAT, provides for awareness-raising 
activities in the countries hosting major sports events, such as the 2014 F&#233;d&#233;ration

campaign also addresses the demand side. Both the European Union and the Government of 
Brazil have engaged in the campaign, thus acknowledging the serious challenges that major 
sports events represent in relation to the sexual exploitation of children.85 
</p>
<p>73. In addition, countries that have recently hosted major sports events, such as Brazil, 
Poland and South Africa, have deployed efforts to minimize the risks faced by children of 
falling victim to sexual exploitation. Those efforts include: the adoption of specific 
legislation, the monitoring of tourist and sports zones, the launching of awareness-raising 
campaigns, the creation of nationwide hotline services and the development of smartphone 
applications, regional cooperation, and the implementation of training programmes for law 
enforcement agencies.86 
</p>
<p><b> L. Challenges &#8211; exploring the complexities of using sport to promote 
human rights, preventing human rights abuses and detrimental 
practices related to sport 
</b></p>
<p>74. Like any social activity, sport may also have potentially negative side effects.87 The 
challenges to be faced are common for the whole world with a bit differences according to 
the culture. The main challenge is to raise the awareness of all sports actors as to the fact 
that they are a vector through which sports values can be promoted.88 The main question is 
how we can create a culture where people can endorse the Olympic ideals and make their 
way of life. A culture of this type, a culture of peace, can be achieved only through 
education.89 
</p>
<p>75. Cultural, political or military conflict and low economic development are significant 
challenges. In many countries, owing to the low level of economic development or a 
sudden increase in sports activities, not everybody has access to well-equipped sport 
facilities, and the which therefore affects the number of persons being able to actually 
practice sport. Hence, this number has yet to be improved. Furthermore, due to imbalanced 
development structures and imperfect rules and regulations, the gap in wealths as well as 
social conflicts have become constraints for people&#8217;s participation in sports.90 Otherwise, 
different perspectives and understanding of people may cause disagreements, and it is 
difficult to reach out to all segments of the country.91 A special focus should be placed on 
religious and cultural issues, with some countries preventing the practice of certain sports; 
gender issues, with women having limited or no opportunity to participate; and economic 
issues, with some countries not making quality sports accessible to large sectors of the 
population.92 
</p>
<p>76. All the challenges faced in promoting respect for human rights clearly indicate a 
crisis in the value system. Amongst them, central challenges have been identified in the

<p>politicization of sports and the claim that some western values are universal.93 Numerous 
incidents indicate the level of challenge faced in promoting human rights through sport and 
the Olympic ideal (the sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era, certain 
attitudes towards the track and field athlete Jesse Owens at the Berlin Olympics in 1936, 
the Munich massacre in 1972, in which members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken 
hostage and killed by the Palestinian Black September group). Strategies should be 
developed to translate the symbolic role of sport in the promotion of human rights. There 
are also challenges to be faced with regard to the fight against corruption discrimination at 
all levels, unfair rules and regulations, and the promotion of values, in view of the hierarchy 
given to Western countries.94 It is natural that some observers highlight a lack of awareness 
and a low level of social education; political or financial instability, extreme national 
defence strategies that may be a cause of discrimination; customs and traditions that can 
impede the involvement or simply disturb the emotions of women, or people of a certain 
age group, race and background.95 
</p>
<p>77. Sport is also at risk from the trafficking of children in underdeveloped countries; 
young people who leave school early; doping; identity fraud in selections in the case of 
some young people who have already passed the age of eligibility; insufficient policies to 
promote the participation of women in sport, who still face difficulties in accessing 
competitions; and a lack of infrastructure in developing countries.96 
</p>
<p>78. The media have exerted a considerable influence on society. In the area of equal 
rights for women, the media have tended to emphasize the participation of men in sports, 
thereby ignoring the right of women to sport and recreational physical activity. In addition, 
the promulgation and promotion of sports and physical activities with a gender-equity 
approach amounts to little if the different needs of men and women are not actually 
addressed. It is of great importance that sport in any country is &#8220;democratic&#8221; to make it 
accessible to everyone. It is here that the contribution of the media can be most helpful, in 
its broadcasting of sport-related programmes and events, aimed at a broad and diverse 
population , constituting of people who are all rights-holders.97 
</p>
<p>79. Among the main challenges faced by sport are a lack of the funds required for the 
promotion of sport activities, especially for vulnerable groups and disabled children,98 the 
difficulties associated with building sports infrastructure, especially for the expensive 
activities that cannot be practised by all, and, clearly, doping.99 Generally, the provision of 
sport facilities remains an acute problem, although several inter-institutional alliances have 
been set up to allow access for a wider range of the population to the facilities of the 
educational centres. The budget allocation is also challenging, and it has forced 
prioritization in those areas where violent episodes are more frequent (&#8220;red zones&#8221;).100 
</p><p>80. The following problems related to discriminatory practices in sport are to be 
understood in an international context: 
</p>
<p>(a) The difference in the distribution of sports sponsorship by gender: it is 
estimated that with regard to participants at the Olympics, only 0.5 per cent of all 
commercial sponsorships are focused on female athletes;

<p>(b) Media coverage for women&#8217;s sport is estimated at only 5 per cent. Teenage 
athletes therefore lack sufficient female role models for fair sports behaviour; 
</p>
<p>(c) The wage gaps related to gender inequality in sports; 
(d) The underrepresentation of women in leadership and management positions 
</p>
<p>in sports bodies.101 
</p>
<p>81. Factors such as illegal migration and the financial crisis, may in turn create racist 
ideas within society, which may thereafter be transferred to sport. Other obstacles refer to 
threats of sexual harassment and abuse in sport, and the poor representation of women in 
decision-making position.102 There are of course certain problems that might impede sport 
from promoting human rights. Some such obstacles include extreme nationalist sentiment, 
which might impinge on others&#8217; rights and generate violence between athletes and fans, 
thereby increasing hatred among all parties, and eroding the rights of many. It is important 
to encourage the culture of friendship and tolerance, a culture which could flourish if 
people did not have prejudices about each other. 
</p><p>82. In recent decades, it has been shown that, far from being a competitive activity, sport 
is a multidimensional tool that substantially promotes quality of life and indirectly serves to 
bring nations together. 
</p>
<p>83. The main challenges that the international community faces as regards promotion of 
human rights through sport and the Olympic ideal are the inclusion of professional athletes 
in the Olympic games, the trading of athletes, the rapid introduction of technology in 
developing countries (and the consequent increase of the cost of sports activities) and the 
obligation to recruit and pay sponsors in order to take part in high-level sport events. These 
practices have deeply impacted the international sport situation, especially in the 
developing countries.103 One of the main challenges countries face in the promotion of 
human rights through sport is in supporting athletes without considering them as 
commodities, as is the case in the World Cup, where some games have allegedly been 
rigged.104 The rights of athletes are sometimes at stake due to the exploitation faced by 
others. In many regions in the world, especially in Europe and the Middle East, athletes are 
treated like goods when they are sold from one club to another; although the word &#8220;sell&#8221; 
does not appear in the deals, the conditions involved treating players like goods. Moreover, 
the deals struck with clubs are mostly arranged by third parties who work as middlemen. In 
certain instances, while the negotiations for deals are in progress, the athletes may become 
the victims of human traffickers. 
</p>
<p>84. Another concern relates to the lack of a human rights code of conduct. For instance, 
in Asia, the largest and important Asian sport confederation is the Asian Football 
Confederation, which was established in 1954 in the Philippines and whose headquarters 
are currently located in Malaysia. It is one of the six confederations which make up FIFA. 
The current President of the Confederation is Shaikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al-Khalifa, a 
Bahraini. The Confederation has not been involved in any serious human rights violations 
or abuses in the past that have been reported; however there have been a few accusations 
which cannot be substantiated. With the advancement of issues of a human rights nature in 
sport, it is important that there should be a human rights code of conduct for all affiliated 
members of the Confederation, as a preventive measure for any future human rights

<p>violations. A code of conduct encompassing all federations under FIFA could be 
developed, enabling a culture of human rights to flourish within the members of the 
Confederation, which would strengthen respect for human rights in sport in general. 
</p>
<p>85. A lot of focus has been placed on competitive sports. However, we should also not 
disregard the importance of promoting non-competitive sports, or sports which do not 
produce opponents, sports with a collective and supportive nature, sports that do not have a 
winner and a loser.105 
</p>
<p>86. Noteworthy also are some concerns over the use of outdated coaching methods 
which are hierarchical and confrontational. This is by no means universal but still presents 
an issue. Meanwhile, structures like Winning Scotland are bringing a new and inclusive 
approach to coaching techniques. 
</p>
<p>87. The behaviour of parents and caretakers on the touchline, lack of equal access to 
sports facilities and training times are also disturbing. This often excludes young people 
from playing and participating.106 
</p>
<p>88. Major sports events, such as the Olympic Games, can put children at a greater risk of 
becoming victims of sexual exploitation, with the arrival of thousands of additional tourists 
in a festive environment, thus increasing the number of potential abusers. Countries that 
have recently hosted major sports events, such as Brazil, Poland and South Africa, have 
deployed efforts to minimize the risks faced by children of falling victim to sexual 
exploitation. It is important to take stock of these recent efforts, good practices and lessons 
learned, in order to minimize risks for vulnerable children. Through comprehensive and 
sustainable child protection strategies, ethical and responsible sports events can be 
developed.107 
</p>
<p><b> III. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National legislation and executive practice 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Strengthen existing legislation on the promotion and development of sport; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Adopt specific legislation regarding the prohibition of sexual exploitation, sexual 
harassment and abuse in sport, and the use of doping; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Guarantee constant safeguards against discrimination; racism; extreme nationalist 
sentiment; violence in sport; unlawful influence on decision-making during 
competitions and other sports events; and the discrediting of, or undermining 
confidence in, the apolitical and autonomous nature of sport and sports federations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Provide access to sport at the national level, regardless of gender, race, religion, social 
status, etc.; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Encourage States to continue and to increase efforts at all levels to combat the sexual 
exploitation of children at major sports events, sexual harassment and abuse in sport, 
and the use of doping.

<p><b> B. Programme support</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Use coherent, sustainable and integrated sport strategies and programmes to advance 
peace, development, diversity, tolerance, fairness, mutual respect, human

</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Develop sports and leisure programmes, highlighting the importance of ethical and 
moral values,</b>108<b> and raising awareness and understanding of human rights and the 
Olympic ideal as a means to advance the cause of peace, promote development and 
combat all forms of discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Invite States, national and international sports organizations, in cooperation with the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) and IOC, to 
reflect on the design of models for cooperation with IOC and the International 
Paralympic Committee to use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue and 
reconciliation in areas of conflict or disturbance during and beyond the period of the 
Olympic and Paralympic Games, in particular by observing the Olympic Truce; 
</b></p>

environment; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 5. Develop coherent and integrated policies to prevent and combat the trafficking of

should be cross-cutting, creating a balanced &#8220;participation is more important than 
winning&#8221; mentality, respect for opponents, punctuality and solidarity. Those values 
will ultimately be reflected in the lifestyle of athletes, who will disseminate them 
throughout society; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 10. Substantially increase female participation in high-performance sports; 
</b></p>
<p><b> 11. Publicize and promote sports and physical activities with a gender-equity approach,
