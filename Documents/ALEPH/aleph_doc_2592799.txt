2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016 Results*:
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased by 9% when compared to the 1Q-2016, reaching R$ 22,821 million, due to higher
sales revenues, mainly as a result of crude oil and oil products export volumes. This increase was
partially offset by lower gasoline sales in Brazilian market and decreased power generation.
Lower import costs of crude oil and natural gas were registered in the 2Q-2016 due to higher domestic
production and lower thermoelectric generation, partially offset by higher expenses with production taxes
and oil products imports.
Operating Income
Operating income reached R$ 7,184 million in the 2Q-2016, compared to a R$ 8,148 million operating
income in the 1Q-2016, mainly due to expenses with the new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan (PIDV),
to impairment of Comperj assets (due to the project reassessment) and to the return of exploratory
blocks. In addition, there were higher general and administrative expenses, as a result of increased
consulting expenses.
Net Finance Expense
Net finance expense was R$ 6,061 million in the 2Q-2016, a 30% decrease compared to the 1Q-2016,
mainly due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro.
Net Income (Loss) attributable to the shareholders of Petrobras
The net income in the 2Q-2016 was R$ 370 million, reverting the loss occurred in 1Q-1016, mainly due to
higher gross profit and lower net finance expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow**
The Adjusted EBITDA was 4% lower compared to the 1Q-2016, totaling R$ 20,317 million. The Adjusted
EBITDA Margin was 28% in the 2Q-2016. The increased net cash provided by operating activities and the
lower capital expenditures and investments resulted, for the fifth consecutive quarter, in higher positive
free cash flow* of R$ 10,790 million, 3.5 times higher when compared to the 1Q-2016. This result
represents an important effort to deleverage the Company.
* Additional information about operating results of 2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016, see item 5.
** See definitions of Free cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA in glossary and the respective reconciliations in
Liquidity and Capital Resources and Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA.
4
1H-2016 x 1H-2015 Results*:
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased by 9% when compared to 1H-2015, reaching R$ 43,829 million due to lower sales
revenues, as a result of an 7% reduction of domestic sales for oil products, partially offset by higher diesel
and gasoline margins. The decrease in sales revenues was also a result of a decrease of crude oil and oil
products export prices, lower power generation, decreased electricity prices, and lower domestic natural
gas sales volume.
The Company experienced lower import costs and decreased production taxes in Brazil due to lower
crude oil prices and decreased sales. However, higher depreciation expenses occurred as a result of a
decrease in reserves estimates (mainly due to lower crude oil prices), which were partially offset by a
lower carrying amount of assets that were impacted by impairment losses in 2015.
Operating Income
Operating income was R$ 15,332 million in 1H-2016, a 32% decrease when compared to the 1H-2015,
resulting from decreased gross profit, higher idleness expenses related to drilling rigs, higher expenses
with legal proceedings, expenses associated with the new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan and with
the return of exploratory blocks. In addition, the 1H-2015 was impacted by the reversal of losses related to
trade receivables from companies in the electricity sector. These effects were partially offset by lower tax
expenses.
Net Finance Expense
Net finance expense was R$ 14,754 million in the 1H-2016, an additional net expense of R$ 3,085 million
when compared to the 1H-2015, resulting from higher interest expenses due to higher debt and to the
effect of the depreciation of Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.
Net Income (loss) attributable to the shareholders of Petrobras
Net loss attributable to the shareholders of Petrobras of R$ 876 million in the 1H-2016, mainly due to lower
operating income, higher net finance expenses and to the effect of foreign exchange translation over the
debt of structured companies in U.S. dollars that impacted net income attributable to non-controlling
interests.
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow**
Adjusted EBITDA of R$ 41,408 million in the 1H-2016, remaining relatively flat compared to the 1H-2015.
The Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 29% in the 1H-2016. The lower capital expenditures and investments
resulted in positive free cash flow of R$ 13,171 million. This result represents an important effort to
deleverage the Company.
* Additional information about operating results of 1H-2016 x 1H-2015, see item 6.
** See definitions of Free cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA in glossary and the respective reconciliations in
Liquidity and Capital Resources and Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA.

RESULT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION
Gross Profit
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): The decrease in gross profit in
the 1H-2016 was generated by decreased Brent prices
and by lower crude oil and NGL production in Brazil
and abroad, partially offset by the depreciation of the
Real against the U.S. dollar. In addition, gross profit
was impacted by higher depreciation costs, partially
offset by lower production taxes.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): The increase of the gross profit
in the 2Q-2016 was generated by increased Brent
prices and by higher crude oil and natural gas
production, partially offset by the appreciation of the
Real against the U.S. dollar and by increased
production taxes.
Operating Income
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): The decrease in operating
income was due to lower gross profit, to increased
idleness expenses related to drilling rigs, to expenses
related to legal proceedings, to the new Voluntary
Separation Incentive Plan and to higher expenses
mainly due to the return of exploratory blocks.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): The operating income was due
to higher gross profit and lower impairment, partially
offset by expenses related to legal proceedings, to the
new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan and to higher
expenses mainly due to the return of exploratory
blocks.
Operating Performance
Production
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Domestic crude oil and NGL
production decreased by 3% mainly due to higher
realization of scheduled stoppages, mainly in P-48, P-
53, FPSO Cid. Paraty and P-18 platforms. However,
there were start-up and ramp-up of new systems,
mainly FPSO Cid. Itaguaí (Lula – Iracema Norte area),
FPSO Cid. Maricá (Lula Alto) and P-58 (Parque das
Baleias).
Natural gas production in Brazil remained relatively flat
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): Domestic crude oil and NGL
production increased 8% mainly due to lower
realization of scheduled stoppages and to the
production ramp-up of FPSO Cid. Maricá (Lula Alto).
These effects also generated a 5% increase of
domestic gas production.
Crude oil and NGL production abroad increased 2%,
mainly due to the production return in Akpo field in
Nigeria, which was under scheduled stoppage in the
because the scheduled stoppages mentioned above
were mainly offset by increased gas production of P-58
(Parque das Baleias) and by the production start-up of
FPSO Cid. Maricá (Lula Alto).
1Q-2016.
Gas production abroad increased 9% due to new wells
in the Hadrian South field in the United States.
Crude oil and NGL production abroad decreased 12%
mainly as a result of the sale/return of fields in
Argentina, and of the scheduled stoppage of Akpo field
in Nigeria.
Gas production abroad increased 11% due to the
production ramp-up in the Hadrian South field in the
United States.
Lifting Cost
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Excluding foreign exchange
variation effects, lifting cost in U.S. dollar decreased
due to lower expenses with well intervention and with
engineering and submarine maintenance, in addition
to the higher share of pre-salt production, which has a
lower unit cost.
In addition, production taxes decreased as a result of
lower crude oil price.
Lifting cost decreased abroad due to the sale of Austral
Basin fields in Argentina, with higher operating costs
and to the higher production in the United States, with
lower costs.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): Excluding foreign exchange
variation effects, lifting cost in US$ dollar decreased
due to higher production in the period. This decrease
was partially offset by higher well intervention
expenses.
In addition, the higher crude oil price generated
increased production taxes.
The decreased lifting cost abroad was impacted by
lower costs in Argentina.

REFINING, TRANSPORTATION AND MARKETING
Gross Profit
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Gross profit increased due to a
decrease in crude oil purchase/transfer costs, following
lower Brent prices, the lower share of crude oil imports
on feedstock processing and the decreased share of oil
product imports in our sales mix. These effects were
partially offset by lower crude oil exports and by lower
economic activity in Brazil that decreased domestic oil
product sales.
Operating Income
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): Gross profit remained relatively
flat in the period. The higher domestic and abroad sales
were offset by higher purchase/transfer costs of crude oil
as a result of the increase in Brent price.
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Higher operating income due to
higher gross profit, partially offset by impairment of
Comperj assets due to the project reassessment.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): Lower operating income mainly
due to the impairment in Comperj assets and to the
expenses of the new Voluntary Separation Incentive
Plan.
Operating Performance
Imports and Exports of Crude Oil and Oil Products
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Improved balance of crude oil
exports (imports) net, due to lower imports, as a result of
decreased volume processed and a higher share of
domestic crude oil on feedstock processed. These
effects were partially offset by decreased export volume
available, as a result of the lower production.
The decreased deficit of oil products exports (imports)
net was due to lower need for diesel imports as a result
of the lower economic activity.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): Higher positive balance of crude
oil exports (imports) net, due to higher domestic
production that generated higher share of domestic
crude oil on feedstock processed, lower import need and
increased crude oil available for export.
The decreased deficit of oil products exports (imports)
net was due to lower need of gasoline imports as a
result of decreased demand, and of diesel imports, due
to the inventories generated in the 1Q-2016.
Refining Operations
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Daily feedstock processed was
5% lower, due to scheduled stoppages, mainly in
distillation plants of REPLAN and REVAP, partially
offset by higher production of RNEST, as a result of
operating improvements made.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): Daily feedstock processed
remained relatively flat, because the return of REPLAN
into operation, after scheduled stoppage, was offset by
scheduled stoppages of REFAP and REVAP.
Refining Cost
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Refining cost in R$/barrel
increased 7% mainly due to higher personnel expenses
as a result of higher employee compensation costs
attributable to the 2015/2016 Collective Bargaining
Agreement, along with a decrease in feedstock
processed. Refining cost, in US$/barrel, decreased by
14%.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): In R$/barrel, refining cost
decreased by 2% mainly due to lower expenses with
bulk materials and technical services. Refining cost, in
US$/barrel, increased by 8%.

GAS & POWER
Gross Profit
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Gross profit in the 1H-2016 was
higher due to lower acquisition costs, mainly because of
the reduction of natural gas and LNG imports. This effect
was partially offset by lower natural gas sales to the
thermoelectric sector and by decreased electricity
generation due to the improvement of hydrological
conditions in Brazil.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): The increased gross profit was
due to lower acquisition cost and decreased gas and
LNG imports. These effect was partially offset by lower
electricity generation in the 2Q-2016.
Operating Income
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Operating income increased due
to higher gross profit and also to lower operating
expenses. The 1H-2015 was mainly impacted by
expenses related to tax contingencies and impairment,
partially offset by the reversal of impairment with trade
receivables from companies in the electricity sector.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): Lower operating income in the
2Q-2016 compared to the 1Q-2016 due to higher
impairment with trade receivables from companies in the
electricity sector.
Operating Performance
Physical and Financial Indicators
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Electricity sales to the Brazilian
free contracting market (Ambiente de Contratação Livre
– ACL) were 5% lower, attributable to the termination of
agreements.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): The higher electricity prices in
the spot market (PLD) was a result of worsening in
hydrological conditions.
Decreased electricity sales volumes to the Brazilian
regulated market (Ambiente de Contratação Regulada
– ACR) was due to the termination of agreement
representing 205 average MW, which occurred at
Electricity Auction of 1H-2015.
The decrease electricity generation and lower
electricity prices in the spot market (PLD) were due to
improved hydrological conditions.
The lower electricity generation was due to the
decision of the Electric Sector Monitoring Committee
(Comitê de Monitoramento do Setor Elétrico - CMSE) of
not making plants dispatch for energy security with
variable unit cost above settlement limits.
LNG imports decreased by 55% and natural gas
imports from Bolivia were 10% lower due to decreased
thermoelectric demand in the period and to higher
domestic gas supply, due to 5% increase on
production.
LNG imports decreased by 56% and natural gas
imports from Bolivia were 10% lower, reflecting a
decrease in thermoelectric demand.

DISTRIBUTION
Gross Profit
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Gross profit decreased due to
lower sales volumes in Brazil, following the lower
economic activity that mainly impacted industrial
customers, in which the share of BR Distribuidora is
higher than its competitors. These effects were partially
offset by improved result abroad, due to higher gross
margin as a result of increased mix of sales products in
Paraguay and of the positive impact of foreign exchange
variation.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): The lower gross profit in Brazil
was due to decreased ethanol and gasoline C prices,
which impacted inventory costs, and lower sales
volumes, partially offset by improved result abroad due
to higher gross margin, as a result of increased mix of
sales products in Paraguay and of the positive impact of
foreign exchange variation.
Operating income
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Operating income in Brazil
decreased as a result of higher losses with tax
contingencies, partially offset by improved result abroad.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): The higher operating income was
due to lower impairment with trade receivables from
companies in the electricity sector in Brazil, and to the
improved result abroad.
Operating Performance
Market Share - Brazil
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Decreased market share was due
to lower sales to the thermoelectric sector and lower
economic activity that mainly impacted industrial
customers, in which the share of BR Distribuidora is
higher than its competitors. In addition, the lower market
share is a result of a shift in our sales policy to prioritize
higher margins instead of sales volumes.
(2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016): Market share was lower mainly
due to a decrease in fuel oil thermoelectric dispatch, to
lower gasoline and jet fuel sales. In addition, the
Company policy was to maintain margins preserved.

As of June 30, 2016, the balance of cash and cash equivalents was R$ 62,940 million and the balance of
adjusted cash and cash equivalents for the same period was R$ 65,370 million. Our principal uses of
funds in the 1H-2016 were for repayment of long-term financing (and interest payments) and for capital
expenditures. We partially met these requirements with cash provided by operating activities of R$ 39,250
million and with proceeds from long-term financing of R$ 32,679 million. The balance of adjusted cash and
cash equivalents was negatively impacted in the 1H-2016 by foreign exchange rate variation applied on
our foreign financial investments.
Net cash provided by operating activities of R$ 39,250 million was mainly generated by higher diesel and
gasoline margins, lower production taxes in Brazil and crude oil, oil products and natural gas  imports
costs, along with a higher share of domestic crude oil on feedstock processing. These effects were
partially offset by lower prices of crude oil and oil products exports and decreased sales volume in Brazil
due to lower economic activity.
Capital expenditures and investments in operating segments were R$ 26,079 million in the 1H-2016 (89%
in E&P business segment), a 25% decrease when compared to the 1H-2015.
Free cash flow* was positive, amounting R$ 13,171 million in the 1H-2016, for the fifth consecutive quarter.
From January to June 2016, the Company issued global notes in international capital markets totaling
US$ 6.75 billion, with maturities of 5 and 10 years, and the proceeds of those notes offerings were used to
tender for US$ 6.3 billion of Petrobras’s existing global notes. In addition, the Company entered into a sale
and leaseback operation with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in the amount of US$ 1
billion. The average maturity of outstanding debt was 7.30 years as of June 30, 2016 (7.14 years as of
December 31, 2015). It is important to mention the issuing of US$ 3 billion for tender offer at the same
amount in July 2016.
Repayments of interest and principal were R$ 69,778 million in the 1H-2016 and the nominal cash flow
(cash view), including principal and interest payments, by maturity, is set out in R$ million as follows:

Consolidated debt
Consolidated gross debt in Reais decreased by 19% and net debt decreased by 15% when compared to
December 31, 2015, mainly as a result of the 17.8% foreign exchange appreciation.
Current debt and non-current debt include finance lease obligations of R$ 80 million and R$ 313 million on
June 30, 2016, respectively (R$ 73 million and R$ 303 million on December 31, 2015).

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
1.     Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA
Our adjusted EBITDA (according to CVM Instruction 527 of October 4, 2012) is the net income before net
finance income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, share of earnings in
equity-accounted investments and impairment.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards – IFRS. In
addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA by other
companies and it should not be considered as a substitute for any measure calculated in accordance with
IFRS. The Company reports its Adjusted EBITDA to give additional information about its profitability and
must be considered in connection with other measures and performance indicators for a better
understanding regarding the Company's financial performance.
The LTM Adjusted EBITDA is used to calculate the ratio of net debt/LTM Adjusted EBITDA, that
corresponds to a metric included in the Company’s Business and Management Plan.

The decreased reclassification of foreign exchange variation expenses from the Shareholders’ Equity to
the Statement of Income was mainly due to the fact that the 1Q-2016 was impacted by planned exports
that were no longer expected to occur or did not occur, mainly due to the decrease in crude oil prices.
Decreased planned export volumes were no longer expected to occur or did not occur in the 2Q-2016.
Additional hedging relationships may be revoked or additional reclassification adjustments from equity to
the Statement of Income may occur as a result of changes in forecast export prices and export volumes
following a review in the Company’s business plan. Based on a sensitivity analysis considering a US$
10/barrel decrease in average Brent prices stress scenario, when compared to the Brent price projections
in our most recent update of the 2015-2019 Business and Management Plan (Plano de Negócios e Gestão
– PNG), a R$1,141 million reclassification adjustment from Shareholders’ Equity to the statement of
income would occur.
The expected annual realization of the foreign exchange variation balance in shareholders’ equity, on
June 30, 2016, is set out below:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
3.     Assets and Liabilities subject to Exchange Variation
The Company has assets and liabilities subject to foreign exchange rate variation, for which the main
gross exposures are the Real relative to the U.S. dollar and the U.S. dollar relative to the Euro. Beginning
in mid-May 2013, the Company extended the use of hedge accounting to hedge highly probable future
exports.
The Company designates hedging relationships between exports and its long-term debt obligations
(denominated in U.S. dollars) to simultaneously recognize the effects of the existing natural foreign
exchange hedge between those operations in its financial statements. Through the extension of the
hedge accounting practice, foreign exchange gains or losses, generated by foreign exchange variation,
are recognized in our shareholders’ equity and will only affect the statement of income at the moment of
realization of future exports.
The balances of assets and liabilities in foreign currency of our foreign subsidiaries are not included in
our foreign exchange rate variation exposure below when transacted in a currency equivalent to their
respective functional currencies.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a net liability exposure to foreign exchange rates, of which the
main exposure is the relation between U.S. dollar and euro.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
5. Results of Operations of 2Q-2016 compared to 1Q-2016:
Sales revenues of R$ 71,320 million in the 2Q-2016, a 1% increase when compared to the 1Q-2016 (R$
70,337 million), due to:
·         Higher crude oil and oil product export revenues; and
·         Higher domestic sales of naphtha (55%) and diesel (2%).
These effects were partially offset by lower domestic gasoline sales and decreased electricity revenue,
reflecting lower power generation.
Cost of sales of R$ 48,499 million in the 2Q-2016, a 2% decrease compared to R$ 49,329 million in the 1Q-
2016, due to lower crude oil and natural gas import costs, partially offset by the increase of production
taxes and oil products imports.
General and administrative expenses were R$ 2,844 million in the 2Q-2016, a 7% increase when compared
to the 1Q-2016 (R$ 2,652 million), due to higher third-party service expenses.
Exploration costs were R$ 1,641 million in the 2Q-2016, a 43% increase when compared to the 1Q-2016 (R$
1,147 million), mainly generated by the return of exploratory blocks due to their economic viability.
Other expenses, net were R$ 6,509 million in the 2Q-2016, a 53% increase when compared to R$ 4,265
million in the 1Q-2016, mainly as a result of:
·         Expenses with the new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan (R$ 1,212 million); and
·         Impairment of Comperj assets (R$ 1,124 million), due to the project reassessment that generated the
review of time schedule and completion costs of refining units of the Natural Gas Processing Unit (UPGN).
Net finance expense decreased by 30% to R$ 6,061 million in the 2Q-2016, from R$ 8,693 million in the 1Q-
2016, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains of R$ 910 million attributable to a 3.1% appreciation of
the U.S. dollar against the Euro and its impact on the Company’s net debt in the 2Q-2016, compared to the
foreign exchange losses of R$ 1,443 million attributable to a 4.7% foreign exchange depreciation in the
1Q-2016 (R$ 2,353 million).
Income taxes expenses (corporate income tax and social contribution) of R$ 622 million in the 2Q-2016, a
178% increase when compared to R$ 224 million in the 1Q-2016, mainly due to the negative result in the
1Q-2016.
Loss attributable to non-controlling interests of R$ 529 million in the 2Q-2016, a 39% decrease when
compared to the 1Q-2016 (loss of R$ 865 million), mainly reflecting the impact of foreign exchange
variation on debt in U.S. dollar of structured entities in the period.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
6. Results of Operations of 1H-2016 compared to 1H-2015:
Sales revenues of R$ 141,657 million in the 1H-2016, a 8% decrease when compared to the 1H-2015 (R$
154,296 million), due to:
·       Decreased domestic sales for oil products (7%), reflecting lower economic activity in Brazil and
decreased diesel and fuel oil consumption for thermoelectric generation;
·       Decreased electricity generation and prices due to improved hydrological conditions and decreased
domestic natural gas sales volumes; and
·       Lower crude oil and oil product export prices as a result of lower international crude oil prices.
These effects were partially offset by higher margins of diesel and gasoline.
Cost of sales of R$ 97,828 million in the 1H-2016, a 8% decrease compared to R$ 106,324 million in the 1H-
2015, reflecting lower crude oil, oil products and natural gas import costs, as well as lower production
taxes in Brazil. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expenses as a result of a
decrease in estimated reserves (based on the unit of production method), partially offset by lower carrying
amounts of assets impacted by the impairment losses recognized in 2015.
Selling expenses were R$ 7,441 million in the 1H-2016, a 33% increase compared to R$ 5,610 million in the
1H-2015, mainly due to the reversal of impairment of trade receivables from companies in the electricity
sector in the 1Q-2015 (R$ 1,295 million) and higher freight expenses in 2016, following the depreciation of
the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.
Exploration costs were R$ 2,788 million in the 1H-2016, a 16% increase compared to R$ 2,403 million in the
1H-2015, mainly generated by the return of exploratory blocks due to their economic viability.
Other taxes were R$ 988 million in the 1H-2016, a 79% decrease compared to R$ 4,713 million in the 1H-
2015, mainly due to the burden of tax on financial operations (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras - IOF)
applicable to intercompany loans made by Petrobras to foreign subsidiaries and to the VAT tax (Imposto
sobre a Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços) on the acquisition of natural gas recognized in the 1H-
2015.
Other income and expenses, net were R$ 10,774 million in the 1H-2016, a 76% increase when compared to
R$ 6,139 million in the 1H-2015, as a result of:
·       Increased unschedulled stoppages and pre-operating expenses, mainly with drilling rigs idleness (R$
2,392 million);
·       Higher expenses related to legal proceedings, mainly in connection with labor and civil lawsuits (R$
1,835 million); and
·       Expenses with the new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan (R$ 1,213 million).
Net finance expenses increased by 26% to R$ 14,754 million in the 1H-2016, from R$ 11,669 million in the
1H-2015, as a result of:
·       Higher interest expenses due to higher debt and to the effect of the depreciation of the average
Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar (R$ 3,453 million, net of capitalized borrowing costs);
·       Foreign exchange gains of R$ 590 million generated by the impact of a 17.8% appreciation of the
Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar on the Company’s net debt in the 1H-2016, compared to foreign
exchange losses of R$ 2,937 million generated by the impact of a 16.8% depreciation in the 1H-2015 (R$
3,527 million);
·       The higher reclassification of cumulative foreign exchange variation from shareholders’ equity to net
income due to occurred exports designated for cash flow hedge accounting, and to a portion of future
exports that were previously designated but were no longer expected to occur or did not occur (R$ 3,066
million);
·       Foreign exchange losses of R$ 533 million caused by the impact of a 1.4% depreciation of the U.S.
dollar against the Euro on the Company’s net debt in the 1H-2016, compared to foreign exchange gains of
R$ 1,563 million caused by the impact of an 8.2% appreciation in the 1H-2015 (R$ 2,096 million); and
·       Foreign exchange gains of R$ 970 million caused by the impact of a 10.7% appreciation of the U.S.
dollar against the Pound Sterling on the Company’s net debt in the 1H-2016, compared to foreign
exchange losses of R$ 80 million caused by the impact of a 0.9% depreciation in the 1H-2015 (R$ 1,050
million).
Share of earnings in equity-accounted investments were R$ 786 million, a 130% increase when compared
to R$ 342 million in the 1H-2015, mainly due to impairment losses in investee companies of Exploration
and Production and Biofuels segments in the 1H-2015, as a result of decreased crude oil prices and
higher discount rates, due to an increase in Brazil’s risk premium resulting from a credit risk downgrade
(losing its investment grade status).
Income taxes (corporate income tax and social contribution) were R$ 846 million in the 1H-2016, a 85%
decrease compared to R$ 5,696 million in the 1H-2015, mainly due to lower taxable income before income
taxes and decreased corporate income tax and social contribution tax expenses in Brazil over income
earned abroad.
Loss related to non-controlling interests were R$ 1,394 million in the 1H-2016 (a R$ 425 million gain in the
1H-2015), mainly reflecting the impact of foreign exchange variation on debt of structured entities in U.S.
dollars in the period.
