</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 17/20 of 17 June 2011, requested  the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue providing technical 
assistance, through her Regional Office in Bishkek, and to work with the Government of 
Kyrgyzstan and other actors, as needed, to identify additional areas of assistance that will 
aid Kyrgyzstan in fulfilling its human rights obligations, to brief the Council on progress 
and to submit a report thereon to the Council for consideration at its twentieth session. 
</p>
<p> The present report covers the period from June 2011 to February 2012. It identifies 
and reviews the main human rights developments, and describes the technical assistance 
provided by OHCHR to the Government of Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p> The report describes, inter alia, the legislative changes as well as the ongoing 
selection of judges, which should be done in a transparent manner in line with international 
human rights standards. The report also notes that serious institutional deficiencies have 
hampered the delivery of justice and undermined the rule of law, and points out that the 
lack of progress in addressing these matters impacts on reconciliation and peacebuilding 
efforts between the ethnic communities, as well as between civil society and authorities, 
with serious risks for the long-term stability of the country. The report further describes the 
ongoing practice of arbitrary detention and torture and continued discriminatory patterns 
based on ethnic grounds. In this context, it highlights institutional shortcomings, lack of 
capacity and, in some instances, lack of political will to take necessary measures. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner acknowledges the spirit of cooperation between the 
Government and her Office and proposes recommendations to further the promotion and 
protection of human rights in Kyrgyzstan.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
17/20 of 14 July 2011, whereby the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
was requested to continue to provide technical assistance through the Regional Office for 
Central Asia (ROCA) in Bishkek, to work with the Government of Kyrgyzstan and other 
actors, as needed, to identify additional areas of assistance that would aid Kyrgyzstan in its 
ability to fulfil its human rights obligations, and to submit a report thereon to the Council 
for consideration at the twentieth session of the Council.  
</p>
<p>2. The report reviews the main human rights developments during the period under 
review and describes the technical assistance provided by ROCA on specific human rights 
issues. 
</p>
<p>3. ROCA was established in Bishkek in 2008 and covers Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, 
Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. It works to strengthen the capacity of governments, 
parliaments, national human rights institutions and civil society organizations to address 
human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>4. In July 2010, in response to the June 2010 violence in southern Kyrgyzstan, and 
within the context of the humanitarian emergency phase, the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) set up the OHCHR Mission to Osh (OMO). 
From 30 June 2011, the Mission focused on rule of law issues, with the aim to encourage 
peacebuilding, stability and reconciliation. It also provided technical assistance to the 
authorities for the implementation of recommendations of the United Nations Human 
Rights mechanisms, the High Commissioner and the Commissions of Inquiry into the June 
2010 violence.1 
</p>
<p>5. ROCA/OMO has continued to identify key human rights challenges that persist 
throughout Kyrgyzstan, advising and providing technical assistance to the Government, 
Parliament, Ombudsman Institution, civil society organizations and the donor community, 
to address gaps, build on progress and ensure compliance by Kyrgyzstan with international 
human rights standards, as highlighted in recommendations of the treaty bodies, United 
Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) Special Procedures, and the Universal Periodic 
Review (UPR). 
</p>
<p>6. On 30 October 2011, the first presidential election was held since the April 2010 
ousting of President Bakiev. Interim Prime Minister<b>,</b> Mr. Almazbek Atambaev<b>,</b> of the 
Social Democratic Party, won in the first round, with 63.2 per cent of the votes. He 
defeated a field of 16 candidates. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe (OSCE) found that &#8220;the 30 October presidential election was conducted in a 
peaceful manner, but shortcomings underscored that the integrity of the electoral process 
should be improved to consolidate the democratic process in line with international 
commitments&#8221;.2 On 1 December 2011, Mr. Atambaev was inaugurated as President and a 
new Government was formed at the end of 2011. 
</p>
<p>7. ROCA appreciates the significant support provided by the European Union 
Instrument for Stability and the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund.

<p><b> II. Human rights developments and technical assistance  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislation and policies 
</b></p>
<p>8. During the reporting period, several legislative reforms were initiated concerning 
human rights issues. Most of them are still at the drafting stage. ROCA has provided 
technical assistance and advice in all cases. However, some concerns remain regarding the 
formal adoption of the proposals.  
</p>
<p><b>  Draft Concept Note on Legal Policy for 2012-2016 
</b></p>
<p>9. In February 2011, the Ministry of Justice initiated the drafting of a Concept Note on 
Legal Policy of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2012-2016 with the aim of strengthening the rule 
of law and human rights protection based on the 2012 Constitution, and taking into account 
best practices from around the world and academic views. The concept outlines the key 
directions for reform in various branches of law in order to improve practice, legal 
education and public awareness on national legislation. In November 2011, the Draft 
Concept Note was informally launched by the Ministry of Justice. However, it was not 
followed by a broader consultation with participation of stakeholders, such as civil society. 
</p>
<p>10.<b> </b>ROCA has consistently advised on bringing national legislation in line with 
international human rights norms and standards. Following the presidential elections and 
government restructuring, it is unclear for ROCA whether the draft Concept Note will be 
finalized and submitted for the Government&#8217;s approval and adoption by Parliament.  
</p>
<p><b>  Draft Concept Notes on Ethnic Policy  
</b></p>
<p>11. Two draft concept notes on ethnic policy are currently under discussion by the 
Government. Drafting for both was initiated in the summer of 2011 but was delayed by the 
Presidential elections and the formation of a new Government. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The draft Concept on Ethnic Policy and Society Consolidation was drafted by the 
Department on Inter-ethnic and Religious Issues of the Presidential Administration 
in May 2011 and supported by the People&#8217;s Assembly of Kyrgyzstan on 18 June, 
</p><p>2011. It is a comprehensive document intended to outline key principles and policies 
directed at fostering inter-ethnic cooperation, societal consolidation and respect for 
minority rights. It includes a number of recommendations suggested by ROCA and 
other international organizations. It covers participation in political, economic and 
public life, media and culture, multicultural and multilingual education, language 
and inter-ethnic relations at the local level.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The draft State Concept of National Policy of the Kyrgyz Republic was developed 
by the Ata-Jurt political party parliamentary faction. The document was adopted by 
Parliament at the first reading on 30 June 2011. ROCA provided comments noting 
inconsistencies with international norms and standards on minority protections.  
</p>
<p>12. On 1 February 2012, President Atambaev signed a decree to strengthen public 
security in Kyrgyzstan. Inter alia, the decree tasks the President&#8217;s Office with completing 
the development of an ethnic policy concept in cooperation with civil society and 
Parliament, and reconciling the draft Concept on Ethnic Policy and Society Consolidation 
and the draft State Concept of National Policy of the Kyrgyz Republic into one 
comprehensive document on ethnic policy for consideration by the Defence Council at the 
end of March 2012.  
</p>
<p>13. ROCA has been supporting the authorities in their efforts to reconcile the two drafts 
through the provision of technical expertise.  </p>


<p><b>  Draft National Action Plan on Gender and National Strategy on Gender Equality 
</b></p>
<p>14. Following the restructuring of the Government in December 2011, the newly formed 
Ministry of Youth, Labour and Employment took over the portfolio of gender-related issues 
from the reformed Ministry of Labour, Employment and Migration. The newly formed 
Ministry has limited capacity in terms of available staff and technical expertise to develop, 
coordinate and implement gender equality.  For many years, the women&#8217;s movement in 
Kyrgyzstan has called on the Government to create a separate body in the executive power 
that would be responsible for gender equality issues and would have the mandate and 
sufficient resources to formulate comprehensive State policy on gender equality, and to 
coordinate among various government entities. However, these appeals have remained 
unanswered.   
</p>
<p>15. The National Action Plan on Gender Equality in Kyrgyzstan expired in 2010. In 
April 2011 the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights recommended that the 
Government consider developing a new Action Plan and a long-term strategy. In July 2011, 
the Government established an Inter-ministerial Working Group to draft a National Strategy 
on Gender Equality up to 2020 with a corresponding National Action Plan for 2012-2014. 
The Strategy covers four areas: (1) increasing economic opportunities for women; (2) 
improvement of awareness in issues of parenthood, reproductive health and life in diverse 
society; (3) elimination of discrimination and increasing access to justice; (4) achievement 
of gender parity in decision-making and development of women&#8217;s political participation.  
ROCA considers that long-term planning of the National Strategy, for nine years, is an 
innovative approach compared to short-term planning for three years, which had proved to 
be inefficient in the case of previous national gender policies. Another innovation is the 
methodology:  The Ministries have conducted consultations in each province of Kyrgyzstan 
to reflect local priorities and needs in the policy documents.  Moreover, the National Action 
Plan for 2012-2014 provides for a detailed budget.   
</p>
<p>16. Originally expected to be completed by October 2011, both drafts should be 
submitted for further discussion with major national and international stakeholders in the 
spring of 2012. Once approved by a Government decree, the drafts will go before 
Parliament. 
</p>
<p>17. On 24 and 25 October 2011, ROCA, in cooperation with international partners, 
supported a training-of-trainers on gender issues, carried out by the Ministry of Labour, 
Employment and Migration. Participants are expected to undertake regional discussions to 
raise awareness and obtain contributions for the National Strategy on Gender Equality and 
the National Action Plan on Gender. 
</p>
<p><b>  Draft Law on a National Preventive Mechanism (OPCAT) 
</b></p>
<p>18. On 25 October 2011, the draft law &#8220;On the National Centre of the Kyrgyz Republic 
on Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment,&#8221; with associated amendments to other legislative acts, was presented for its 
first plenary reading in Parliament. This draft law provides for the establishment of a 
national preventive mechanism (NPM) in line with the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
Against Torture (OPCAT). Citing the Government&#8217;s conclusion that no funds would be 
available for the creation of the National Centre and referring to a possible duplication with 
the role of the Ombudsman Institution, the draft law was returned by parliamentarians to 
the initiators for additional review. Additional consultations were then undertaken with the 
Government, which changed its initial position and agreed to allocate 6 million Kyrgyz 
soms (around US$130,000), to be taken from the budget of the Ombudsman Institution. </p>


<p>19. On 2 March 2011, the draft law was adopted by Parliament at its first reading &#8211; two 
more readings are required before full adoption. The issue of the financial allocation is yet 
to be discussed by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>20. ROCA provided technical assistance on the elaboration of this draft law through the 
provision of legal expertise. ROCA also undertook advocacy with relevant government and 
parliament officials, organized public discussions and supported an awareness-raising 
campaign. ROCA is concerned that the reallocation of funds from the Ombudsman 
Institution to the national preventive mechanism may have an impact on the level of human 
rights activities undertaken by the Ombudsman Office. 
</p>
<p><b>  Draft Law on Peaceful Assembly  
</b></p>
<p>21. On 2 March 2012, Parliament approved the Draft Law on Peaceful Assembly at a 
second reading. The draft law has generally been commended by the European Commission 
for Democracy through Law of the Council of Europe and the Office of Democratic 
Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(ODIHR/OSCE). However, several shortcomings that are inconsistent with the Constitution 
and international standards remain, including imprecise wording of counter assembly, 
inadequate treatment of spontaneous assemblies, and blanket restrictions on assembly in 
certain locations.   
</p>
<p>22. ROCA has consistently advised on the development of the draft law on Peaceful 
Assembly through various public discussions, parliamentary public hearings and within the 
Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights, Equal Opportunities and Public Associations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Draft Law on Freedom of Religion and Religions Organizations  
</b></p>
<p>23. The Law on Freedom of Religion and Religious Organizations (amended in 2008), 
contains terminology and stipulates procedures that contradict the new Constitution and 
international standards. In particular, religious associations are banned from operating 
without registration and requests for registration are only valid if submitted by at least 200 
citizens. The State justifies the restrictions on grounds of national security and similarly 
restrictive laws in neighbouring States. In general, its approach is to favour the perceived 
traditional religions of Islam and Christianity, while viewing the activity of others, 
perceived as non-traditional, with caution.  
</p>
<p>24. ROCA, with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has provided 
technical assistance with the drafting process and developed provisions in line with 
international human rights standards.  The proposed draft law is currently with the Ministry 
of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b>  Draft amendments to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code 
</b></p>
<p>25. On 13 October 2011, Parliament created a working group, comprising 
Parliamentarians and Government representatives, to finalize and merge into a single draft 
law more than a dozen draft laws with proposed amendments and additions to the Criminal 
Code and Code of Criminal Procedure. The main objective of the draft amendments is to 
ensure compliance of the Codes with the new Constitution and international standards. 
</p>
<p>26. ROCA provided technical assistance by hiring international and national legal 
experts to assist in the development of the draft amendments. It supported discussions on 
the proposed draft to ensure compliance with the provisions of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture, and ROCA hopes that 
written comments provided by the experts will be taken into account by the drafters. </p>


<p><b>  Draft Housing Code 
</b></p>
<p>27. On 6 June 2011, ROCA supported working consultations with parliamentarians to 
familiarize primary decision-makers with international standards and best practices on the 
right to adequate housing. These were followed by parliamentary hearings on the draft 
Housing Code, during which comments and recommendations from Mr. Miloon Kothari, 
the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, were taken 
into consideration. The draft specifies concrete public needs which can be used as 
justification for the demolition of housing and obliges the State to provide proper 
compensation or equivalent housing. The draft also outlines the creation of a specialized 
housing stock as an option to implement the right to adequate housing for vulnerable 
groups of the population such as the homeless, orphans, persons with disabilities, and 
elderly persons. The draft Housing Code is currently with the Parliamentary Committee on 
Economic and Fiscal Policy, which is to review it in the spring of 2012.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B.  Selection of judges 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Constitution identifies the Council for the Selection of Judges (CSJ) as the main 
body tasked with the selection of judges.   
</p>
<p>29. On 14 June 2011, the then President Rosa Otunbaeva signed the Constitutional Law 
on the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, according to which judges of the 
Constitutional Chamber were to be elected by Parliament.  Nominees were proposed by 
Otunbaeva on the basis of the selection carried out by CSJ. 
</p>
<p>30. On 27 July 2011, CSJ began the selection process, which faced both internal and 
external criticism. Several CSJ members, civil society and Supreme Court judges publicly 
expressed their disapproval over the grading of candidates by CSJ, stating that it was not 
made public. Under pressure from civil society, the then President asked CSJ to release the 
grading results showing how each candidate had been graded. Upon their publication, civil 
society raised a number of concerns, including that the candidates who had received the 
highest grades were not the ones recommended by CSJ to the then President.  
</p>
<p>31. On 13 and 14 August 2011, the then President Otunbaeva interviewed the candidates 
proposed by CSJ for the Constitutional Chamber positions. Against a backdrop of public 
protests staged against CSJ, Parliament ultimately approved two of the three candidates 
recommended by Rosa Otunbaeva out of the 11 proposed by CSJ. These moves, both from 
Parliament and the then President, were criticized by some civil society representatives as 
an excess of authority of the legislative and executive powers over the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>32. President Otunbaeva established a Commission tasked with preparing amendments 
to the laws on the judiciary, which were approved in October 2011. On 15 November 2011, 
she vetoed the draft amendments, stating that complete reappointment of CSJ was 
necessary. This put on hold the appointment process of judges. In November 2011, 
Parliament overturned three Decrees of the President issued in 2010 regarding the dismissal 
of 10 Supreme Court judges from their functions, thereby restoring eight of them. In its 
Resolution, Parliament stated that the President&#8217;s Decrees had been adopted in violation of 
the Constitution and existing Laws regulating the judiciary that grant only to Parliament the 
right to dismiss Supreme Court judges from their functions following a conclusion of the 
National Justice Council (which was replaced under the Constitution by the Council of 
Judges). The President&#8217;s Decrees had been previously criticized by some non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) as illegitimate and violating the principles of the independence of the 
judiciary.   
</p>
<p>33. In February 2012, the pending amendments to the laws on the judiciary were again 
vetoed by President Atambaev, who stated that the CSJ should not be dismissed and that </p>


<p>Judges of the Constitutional Chamber should first be appointed for seven years and could 
only be reaffirmed for life upon completion of the initial term.  
</p>
<p>34. On 1 March 2012, a Parliamentary conciliatory commission reviewed the vetoes to 
be submitted to Parliament. The following day, Parliament voted in favour of the 
amendments to the law on CSJ.  The most controversial amendment is section 5 of article 
19, which stipulates that the president has a right to return to CSJ the proposed candidates 
for judges of local courts without any reasoning; and CSJ is now stripped of its powers to 
override the President&#8217;s veto on the candidates, being obliged to conduct a new selection 
process and propose new candidates instead of those vetoed by the President. ROCA 
believes that this provision seriously undermines the independence of the selection process 
conducted by CSJ and may inadvertently lead to the exertion of covert pressure on CSJ to 
propose only those candidates acceptable to the President.    
</p>
<p>35. On 17 January 2012, President Atambaev issued a Decree creating a Commission to 
develop various legislative proposals by 31 March 2012, including the selection and 
appointment of judges; improvement of judicial oversight ensuring adversarial trial 
proceedings and equality of arms; improvement of the material and financial resources of 
courts; the security of the parties to the trial, and effective implementation of court 
decisions through adoption of laws on court bailiffs; improving the system of training for 
judges and court staff; introducing effective accountability mechanisms for judges; as well 
as other measures aimed at the improvement of the judicial function. Discussions are 
ongoing to clarify which branch of power plays the leading role in the reform process, how 
thematic areas covered by the mandate of the Commission will be streamlined, and who 
will initiate legislative proposals developed by the Commission.  
</p>
<p>36. A seminar for CSJ took place from 2-5 November 2011, co-organized by ROCA and 
international partners. Five international experts provided their expertise on applicable 
international standards and national best practices concerning the selection of judges. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Administration of justice in the aftermath of the June 2010 violence  
</b></p>
<p>37. Since the June 2010 violence in the south of Kyrgyzstan, serious institutional 
deficiencies have hampered the delivery of justice and undermined the rule of law. Lack of 
progress in addressing these matters impacts on reconciliation and peacebuilding efforts 
between the ethnic communities, as well as between civil society and authorities, and poses 
serious risks for the long-term stability of the country.  
</p>
<p>38. Criminal investigations into the June 2010 violence appear to have been marred by 
discriminatory practices against ethnic minorities. Only 7 per cent of the criminal cases 
related to the June 2010 violence have been initiated.3 Official statistics indicate that ethnic 
Uzbeks currently comprise 77 per cent of those detained and charged for serious crimes 
committed during the June 2010 violence. If the investigations and prosecutions into these 
crimes are not radically improved in terms of fairness and impartiality, the exercise will 
continue to lack legitimacy.  
</p>
<p><b>  Arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment and torture 
</b></p>
<p>39. Human rights violations continue to be committed during police investigations into 
the June 2010 violence. These include arbitrary arrests, torture and ill-treatment in 
detention, forced confessions, and extortion including of private property. The impact of 
these violations on the affected individuals and the broader communities is hard to measure, 
</p>
<p>  
 3 Office of the General Prosecutor, 28 February 2012. </p>


<p>although there are reports of individuals sustaining injuries, psychological trauma, loss of 
financial and material resources and even of life. In the Osh region, two ethnic Uzbek 
citizens of Kyrgyzstan, arrested in relation to the June 2010 violence, died on 11 July and 
14 August 2011 respectively, allegedly as a result of injuries sustained while in police 
custody. In the Jalal-Abad region on 9 August 2011, an ethnic Uzbek man of Russian 
nationality was arbitrarily detained by law enforcement officials. He was allegedly tortured 
and a forensic examination confirmed severe internal injuries which led to his death two 
days after his release.  
</p>
<p>40. Violations of the rights of those arrested continue to be compounded by a lack of 
adequate prosecutorial oversight. Torture is generally used by police to extract confessions 
to crimes, which are later accepted in court. Thorough criminal investigations in response to 
complaints by lawyers are lacking and are frequently discontinued after inadequate 
preliminary inquiries by prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>41. Allegations of torture and ill-treatment in detention remain common. The cases 
reported to OHCHR typically exhibit similar characteristics: (i) police officers conduct 
arrests in violation of legal procedures; (ii) detainees are denied access to a lawyer; (iii) 
arrests are only registered 18 hours or more post facto; (iv) detainees are reportedly ill-
treated or tortured in the hours immediately following arrest; (v) ill-treatment or torture is 
frequently aimed at extracting confessions to crimes. 
</p>
<p>42. Deficiencies in the administration of justice are aggravated by corruption and 
extortion at all levels of the justice system. Police officers often use arbitrary arrest with the 
purpose of extorting money. In 2011, there were reports of migrants returning from Russia 
being targeted for extortion by border police with demands of up to US$4,500. In early 
2012, reports surfaced that individuals who had received financial compensation for 
damages or the death of family members during the June 2010 violence had been subjected 
to extortion by police officers and representatives of the local public administration.  
</p>
<p>43. The impunity of law enforcement officials for torture and other abuses remains a 
widespread and serious problem. Prosecutors continue to fail to effectively investigate 
torture allegations. Investigations into and prosecutions of cases of torture have also been 
closed after victims withdrew their complaints following reports of intimidation by law 
enforcement officials. There is no effective protection programme for victims and witnesses 
of torture.  
</p>
<p>44. Despite steps taken to ensure accountability of law enforcement officers, the Office 
of the General Prosecutor acknowledged that the percentage of cases initiated in 2011 is 
incommensurably low in comparison with the number of complaints received by 
prosecutors.  Since October 2011, eight law enforcement officers have been facing 
prosecution for torturing detainees, abuse of power and extortion during investigations into 
the June 2010 violence. 
</p>
<p>45. In 2011, the General Prosecutor issued three decrees (in April, September and 
October), aimed at strengthening prosecutorial oversight of the prohibition of torture and 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in particular in places of detention. 
ROCA has welcomed the decrees and continues to urge their full implementation by the 
authorities to ensure where appropriate that perpetrators of torture are prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>46. Following the April 2011 decree, three Memorandums of Understanding were 
signed between prosecutors and human rights organizations in Osh Province, Osh City and 
Jalal-Abad Province. These agreements set out mechanisms for regular dialogue and 
cooperation on the prevention and prosecution of torture within the framework of public 
councils. ROCA/OMO supported the establishment of these public councils, participating 
in discussions as an independent observer and advising all parties. Ten months after the 
signature of the Memorandums of Understanding, little substantial progress has been made, </p>


<p>due in part to the lack of trust on the part of human rights NGOs in the prosecutorial 
authorities and the overall lack of strategic engagement by all parties, posing challenges to 
the effective functioning of the public councils. 
</p>
<p>47. Closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras have been installed in the temporary 
police detention centres (IVS) in Jalal-Abad, and are also planned for the IVS in Osh. The 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office believes this will assist in preventing cases of torture and ill-treatment 
of detainees. ROCA has advised the General Prosecutor that while CCTV can be an 
additional measure to prevent torture, it is not a panacea for the human rights violations 
observed in detention centres, given the potential ease with which the system can be 
bypassed or disabled. Worse, it risks lending a measure of protection to law enforcement 
officials if the CCTV system proves susceptible to tampering. 
</p>
<p>48. In November 2011, ROCA supported a training seminar for lawyers and 
representatives of the Ombudsman Institution on strategic litigation in torture cases. ROCA, 
with the OSCE Centre in Bishkek, is also working with the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office on 
the design of a human rights training module, with a corresponding manual to reinforce the 
training curriculum for prosecutors.  
</p>
<p>49. ROCA/OMO supported the visit of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in his visit to 
Kyrgyzstan from 3-5 December 2011. The Special Rapporteur concluded that there is a 
&#8220;serious lack of sufficiently speedy, meaningful, thorough and impartial investigations&#8221; 
</p>
<p>into allegations of torture and ill-treatment, as well as a lack of effective prosecution of law 
enforcement officials, and that the use of torture is exacerbated by the reliance placed on 
confessions in the judicial system. 
</p>
<p>50. ROCA/OMO continue to ensure that individuals at risk are provided with 
independent legal representation free of charge through a consolidated referral system with 
local partners. 
</p>
<p><b>  Trials 
</b></p>
<p>51. In general, trials related to the June 2010 violence do not uphold basic fair trial 
standards and judges have failed to respond to allegations that defendants confess to crimes 
under duress, with such evidence being admitted in the judicial proceedings. 
</p>
<p>52. Physical violence, intimidation and harassment targeting ethnic Uzbek defendants 
and their lawyers continue to occur in trials related to the June 2010 violence, despite 
measures taken by the authorities to increase security for such trials. Judges continue to fail 
to use their powers to take disciplinary measures against individuals responsible for violent 
assaults and intimidation inside court rooms, merely issuing verbal warnings. ROCA/OMO 
observed only one case where legal action was taken, against an individual alleged to have 
attacked lawyers in the court room.   
</p>
<p>53. In 2011, the Supreme Court reviewed appeals related to the June 2010 violence, but 
failed to provide a full assessment of fair trial violations, to address admissibility of 
confessions as evidence or to reverse verdicts of lower courts where serious claims of fair 
trial violations were raised.  
</p>
<p>54. For instance, on 20 December 2011, the Supreme Court upheld the life sentence 
handed down to human rights defender Mr. Azimjan Askarov (the case of Askarov et al) on 
charges of organizing mass disorder and inciting inter-ethnic hatred in connection with the 
June 2010 violence. However, his trials at lower courts had not met basic standards of fair 
trial, with, inter alia, evidence of torture having been used by law enforcement bodies to 
extract a confession.   </p>


<p>55.  During the reporting period, ROCA/OMO conducted trial monitoring in connection 
with the June 2010 violence. In general, ROCA/OMO observed flagrant violations of the 
right to a fair trial, including the partiality of judges, intimidation of defendants, absence of 
an interpreter, delayed trial proceedings, beatings of defendants and forced confessions.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Truth and accountability for the June 2010 violence 
</b></p>
<p>56. Follow-up to the recommendations to the four inquiries into the June 2010 violence 
is still required. The severe deficiencies in the administration of justice, together with the 
lack of effective response to address past violence and to bring perpetrators to justice, 
undermine the rule of law and threaten the peaceful coexistence of ethnic communities and 
the long-term stability of the country. 
</p>
<p>57. The failure of the authorities to investigate and deliver justice for the June 2010 
violence has resulted in further human rights violations. The right to justice for all victims 
of the 2010 inter-ethnic violence has been seriously impeded. Furthermore, in many cases, 
victims who claim their right to compensation as provided for by law face serious obstacles 
as well as further harassment and intimidation by local authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Housing, land and property 
</b></p>
<p>58. Access to adequate housing and the protection of housing, land and property rights 
remain of serious concern. The June 2010 inter-ethnic violence in Osh and Jalal-Abad 
further exacerbated the situation as it resulted in large-scale destruction of properties and 
businesses. When implementing master plans for the construction and development of 
urban areas, local administrations must ensure that property rights are respected and upheld.  
Assurance on this has been given to ROCA/OMO by the authorities of Jalal-Abad but is 
still pending from the Osh authorities.   
</p>
<p>59. Beneficiaries of emergency transitional shelters constructed by UNHCR and ICRC 
remain at risk regarding respect for their property rights. They still face obstacles 
concerning the technical acceptance and registration of the constructions as private 
property. Whereas at the time of construction, the State Directorate for reconstruction and 
development of the cities of Osh and Jalal-Abad (SDRD) guaranteed the full registration of 
the emergency shelters as permanent houses and private property, at the end of 2011, of the 
approximately 1,620 buildings reconstructed, only 38 were registered in Jalal-Abad city and 
region, with none in Osh City or the region.  
</p>
<p>60. Recent changes in the legislative and administrative frameworks governing this 
issue lack reference to the specific procedures necessary for property registration. 
Currently, this legal uncertainty makes it almost impossible for affected households to 
register their shelters, leaving them vulnerable to infringement of their property rights. This 
further impedes the right to compensation in case of expropriation or demolition, as 
beneficiaries lack the required registration documents necessary to file compensation 
claims. This vulnerability is exacerbated by previous hurdles cited by authorities against 
reconstructing and registering the shelters and uncertainties regarding implementation of 
the master plans in affected areas. </p>


<p><b> F.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>61. In 2011, UNICEF reported that 29,000 children did not attend school in 
Kyrgyzstan.4 In the south of Kyrgyzstan, socio-cultural and economic factors were found to 
be the main contributors to this, including issues such as poverty, negative parental attitude 
towards education, migration of parents, security concerns, lack of available transportation 
means, language barriers at school and limited access for children with special needs.5 
Exposure to child labour also contributed to children being out of school. During the winter 
season, access to education is particularly difficult in rural and remote areas, due to the 
combination of harsh weather conditions and poverty. Children are unable to attend school 
because of their lack of appropriate winter clothing, limited public transport, and the time 
required for travel.   
</p>
<p>62. Financial constraints limit the availability of books or other learning support 
materials, particularly in minority languages. The minority languages of instruction are 
Uzbek, Tajik and Dungan. A UNICEF project provided textbooks in Uzbek in the south of 
Kyrgyzstan; teaching materials in other languages, such as Tajik and Dungan, are not 
available. 
</p>
<p>63. In September 2011, Kyrgyz language classes were integrated into Uzbek schools in 
two districts in Jalal-Abad and Osh oblasts. This was reportedly at the request of parents, 
with the aim of ensuring a more comprehensive education for all in the Kyrgyz language. 
While teaching of the State language is essential, it is important that the State supports 
instruction for minorities in their native languages. The Government adopted the Concept 
of Multicultural and Multilingual Education in 2008. Although the Concept mentions the 
value of having education in a child&#8217;s native language at primary school and, if possible, at 
</p>
<p>other levels of the education system, the legislation does not contain explicit obligations to 
guarantee minority language education. 
</p>
<p>64. In December 2011, ROCA, with international and national partners, supported an 
event on language policy in the education sector. It highlighted the need for strategies to 
improve the quality of teaching, and access to instruction in the State language as well as 
inclusion in the curriculum of instruction in minority languages. 
</p>
<p><b> G.  Gender-based violence 
</b></p>
<p>65. Gender-based violence, including domestic violence, remains a widespread problem, 
requiring an effective and comprehensive response from all relevant stake-holders. It is 
compounded by the lack of economic and social independence of women and the 
prevalence of poverty. Many women are forced to stay in an environment where violence 
occurs, in the absence of a functioning referral mechanism and lack of access to appropriate 
and professional services. Women&#8217;s shelters operated by non-governmental organizations 
receive no financial support from central and local authorities. Women hesitate to report 
and, when they do, have to overcome problems such as intimidation, inadequate 
professional services and harassment, due in part to the lack of trained and skilled 
professional staff in medical, psychological and law enforcement institutions. As with all 
public services, there is also the risk of a lack of trust among minority ethnic populations, 
where centre staff are ethnically Kyrgyz.

<p>66. Bride kidnapping leads to 30 per cent of all marriages in the country.6 Some victims 
of bride kidnapping are reportedly under 18 years of age.7  
</p>
<p>67. In December 2011, ROCA organized a consultation for both central and regional 
authorities to promote and raise awareness about the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur on Violence against Women,8 and with other partners is urging the Government 
to undertake more work on the implementation of the 2008 CEDAW recommendations,9 
which have only partially been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> H.  Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>68. Levels of minority representation in official bodies are low, which severely 
undermines the ability of minority communities to fight discrimination, to voice their 
specific concerns and to influence the design and implementation of public policies. ROCA 
is working on a detailed assessment of levels and causes of underrepresentation of 
minorities in elected bodies, public institutions and in law enforcement agencies. Such an 
assessment should generate indicators of minority exclusion from participation in public 
life, and provide a baseline situation analysis, with a set of recommendations on legislative 
norms and policy practices required to address the issues of underrepresentation.  
</p>
<p>69. There is a wide gap between the authorities&#8217; view of inter-ethnic relations and those 
of ethnic minority communities themselves. Authorities paint a positive picture, while 
communities raise concerns including: (i) the need to stop any police misconduct, in 
particular arbitrary arrest, extortion, ill-treatment and torture; (ii) requests for justice to be 
done and crimes committed during the June 2010 violence to be prosecuted; (iii) the lack of 
effective and meaningful participation in political and economic life; (iv) discrimination 
and harassment in the field of education and employment; (v) seizure of businesses and a 
takeover of the economic sector by ethnic Kyrgyz; (vi) migration of the male workforce to 
foreign countries.10 
</p>
<p>70. On 21-22 June 2011, ROCA co-organized a regional conference in Bishkek on 
&#8220;Advancing the Rights of Minorities in Central Asia&#8221; with a focus on effective minority 
participation in public life and ensuring effective participation in political, economic, social 
and cultural life. A concluding statement adopted by Governments&#8217; representatives pledged 
to strengthen efforts to further improve minority participation in the countries represented 
and to continue dialogue on these issues.  
</p>
<p>71.<b> </b>ROCA supported efforts to inform and educate minority voters about forthcoming 
local elections, on 4 March 2012. Local elections traditionally receive less attention than 
national-level elections, although they are extremely important for the situation of national 
and ethnic minorities. ROCA, with UNDP, is assessing the effects of voter education on 
voter turnout surrounding the local council elections of March 2011 in Osh, Tokmok and

campaigns directed at increasing the civic and political engagement of the minority 
population. 
</p>
<p><b> I.  Support for legal aid  
</b></p>
<p>72. ROCA has provided advice, guidance and capacity-building aimed at the long-term 
sustainability of national human rights organizations, lawyers and human rights defenders. 
ROCA has supported local partners in their work to provide free legal assistance and aid, 
which continues to be particularly needed in Osh and Jalal-Abad in cases related to the June 
2010 violence.   
</p>
<p><b> J. Support for the Ombudsman Institution 
</b></p>
<p>73. ROCA contributed to the United Nations Joint Technical Assistance Programme for 
the Ombudsman Institution throughout 2009-2011. The Programme focused on the 
improvement of the internal structure and procedures regarding the review of individual 
complaints, the development of gender-disaggregated indicators, and the improvement of 
communication between the central office and provincial offices of the Ombudsman 
Institution. ROCA intends to support the second phase of the Joint Programme 2012-2013.  
</p>
<p>74. In December 2011, ROCA assisted the Ombudsman Institution in the preparation of 
its Statement on Compliance with the International Coordinating Committee Sub-
Committee on accreditation, which will be reviewed in late March 2012.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Cooperation of Kyrgyzstan with the United Nations human 
rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>75. On 6 September 2011, the Parliamentary Committee on health care, social policy, 
labour and migration approved the accession of Kyrgyzstan to the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It was signed by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs in New York on 25 September 2011. 
</p>
<p>76. In October 2011, in order to promote ratification of the Convention, ROCA 
organized an international conference on the Convention in cooperation with the Open 
Society Institute and the public association Movement of Young Disabled People. This 
event took place with participation of the relevant authorities, international experts and 
local groups of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>77. On 20 February 2012, the Prime Minister formally approved reports on the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Approval is still pending for the prepared drafts of 
the common core document and the draft periodic report for the Convention against 
Torture. Drafting of these reports was undertaken by a working group comprising 
representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and five national experts. On 12 
August 2011, ROCA facilitated a round table at which the State authorities and civil society 
discussed the draft national periodic reports. The final national periodic reports to the 
United Nations human rights bodies are to be submitted to relevant United Nations treaty 
bodies in the spring of 2012.  
</p>
<p>78. In December 2011, ROCA organized a workshop for government officials and NGO 
representatives on individual communications to United Nations human rights mechanisms. </p>


<p>The overall objective was to raise awareness of the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, relevant procedures and the obligations of the State in this area, including 
cooperation with the relevant committees, and to discuss strategies and mechanisms for the 
implementation of recommendations.  
</p>
<p>79. A draft decree on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Action Plan, which will 
serve as a basis for implementation of the accepted recommendations from the 2010 
review, has been open for public comments since September 2011. At that time ROCA 
assisted with the organization of the first and only public discussion of the draft Action 
Plan. Due to internal changes in the Ministry of Justice, the draft Action Plan has not been 
finalized. ROCA is providing guidance on steps to be taken for the formal adoption of the 
Action Plan, as well as for the preparation of an interim report on the implementation of the 
accepted UPR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. In addition, ROCA is advising the authorities on an overall comprehensive approach 
to the implementation of recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights 
mechanisms &#8211; treaty bodies, Human Rights Council special procedures and UPR. The 
Presidential Administration has announced its intention to create an interdepartmental body 
for the implementation of recommendations of all United Nations Human Rights 
mechanisms, and would link in recommendations from the reports of the High 
Commissioner and the Commissions of Inquiry into the June 2010 violence, including that 
of the Kyrgyzstan Inquiry Commission (KIC). ROCA is advising on the formation of this 
interdepartmental body, with a recommendation that it coordinate with civil society and the 
Ombudsman Institution, and be supported by the United Nations system and the donor 
community. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights welcomes the 
continued cooperation between the Government and other relevant State authorities 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Kyrgyzstan and OHCHR, and supports the commitment of the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>taking steps to improve the national human rights protection system. The efforts it has 
</b></p>
<p><b>made to bring national laws into line with international human rights standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>illustrates the will to comply with its obligations</b>. 
</p>
<p>82. <b>The High Commissioner commends the Government of Kyrgyzstan for its 
efforts in connection with legislative reforms and the adoption of policies that promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>and protect human rights. However, concerns remain about continued delays in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption or implementation of these new policies and legislation.</b>  
</p>
<p>83. <b>The ongoing judicial reform is a major challenge particularly with regard to 
the selection of judges. An independent and impartial judiciary is a fundamental 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantee for a democratic State based on the rule of law. The selection of judges 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be carried out in a transparent and impartial manner, in line with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards. Also, the integration of a gender perspective in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the justice system is key to ensuring the representation of women in the judiciary.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>In addition to all her previous recommendations, the High Commissioner has 
formulated the recommendations which follow</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>  On discrimination   
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The authorities should take all appropriate measures to ensure equality and 
non-discrimination in all spheres of public and political life. Rights guaranteed by 
</b></p>
<p><b>international and national human rights law should be exercised without </b></p>


<p><b>discrimination of any kind, including any form of indirect discrimination or perceived 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, in particular regarding access to social and health services, 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation in public life, law enforcement and judiciary and any other public 
</b></p>
<p><b>service.</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  On administration of justice   
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The authorities should urgently address investigative deficiencies, severe 
patterns of abuses and widespread corruption of the police forces through a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive reform, with the support of the international community. Urgent 
</b></p>
<p><b>changes are needed in particular in the criteria for assessment of the performance of 
</b></p>
<p><b>law enforcement bodies and in the incentive structure for investigators and police 
</b></p>
<p><b>officers</b>. 
</p>
<p>87. <b>The authorities should support continued efforts of the Office of the General 
Prosecutor to strengthen prosecutorial functions and performances. The orders issued 
</b></p>
<p><b>in 2011 by the General Prosecutor on strengthening prosecutorial oversight 
</b></p>
<p><b>(regulations N40, N70 and N76) should be supported to enable their comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation.</b>  
</p>
<p>88. <b>The authorities should take urgent steps to address the current and past 
deficiencies in the protection of rights to fair trials. The Government should conduct 
</b></p>
<p><b>an assessment of all judicial proceedings related to the June 2010 violence reviewed by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Supreme Court and in which there have been allegations of serious violations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>defendants</b>&#8217;<b> fair trial rights. In case of a retrial, the hearings should take place in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>north of the country in order to ensure the impartiality of judges</b>. 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The authorities should ensure that lawyers are able to perform all of their 
professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper 
</b></p>
<p><b>interference. Judges should have recourse to disciplinary measures, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative detention, to halt violent behaviour in audiences attending trials. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Prosecutors should react promptly to attacks against lawyers and witnesses and 
</b></p>
<p><b>launch criminal investigations for serious incidents</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>  On torture and detention  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The authorities should ensure timely and effective investigations into all cases 
and allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and ensure that victims are protected 
</b></p>
<p><b>from adverse repercussions when investigations or prosecutions of law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies are launched</b>. 
</p>
<p>91. <b>The authorities should bring national legislation into compliance with the 
Convention against Torture and establish clear procedural legal safeguards against 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture at all stages of the legal process.</b>  
</p>
<p>92. <b>The authorities should complete the reform of the police and declare 
unambiguously that torture and ill-treatment will not be tolerated, and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators will be held to account. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The authorities should make efforts aimed at the development of policies and 
programmes for poverty alleviation and eradication, with special emphasis on 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, women and children, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>mainstream a gender perspective into all relevant policies and programmes being 
</b></p>
<p><b>developed</b>. </p>


<p><b>  On housing, land and property 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The authorities should take all appropriate steps to ensure that people whose 
houses were rebuilt following their destruction in the June 2010 violence receive all 
</b></p>
<p><b>the necessary documents to register the houses as private property and thus ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they do not remain vulnerable to arbitrary interference in their land and 
</b></p>
<p><b>property rights.</b>  
</p>
<p>95. <b>The authorities should continue their efforts to develop a comprehensive 
national housing strategy, including a social housing component, to ensure that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to adequate housing is fully realized, as expressed in general comment No. 9 
</b></p>
<p><b>(1998) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</b>.  
</p>
<p><b>  On education 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The authorities should take appropriate measures to ensure that all children 
enjoy full access to primary education and beyond.</b>  
</p>
<p>97. <b>The authorities should take all appropriate steps to ensure that all children are 
provided with a high standard of instruction in the State and official languages of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Kyrgyzstan, and that minorities enjoy access to education in their own language, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>instruction in minority languages progressively integrated into the curriculum</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>  On gender equality and gender-based issues 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The authorities should prioritize the fight against any form of gender-based 
violence, such as domestic violence, forced marriages and trafficking in human beings. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This should include the strengthening of provisions for the investigation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>punishment of such crimes, support for and protection of victims, and raising public 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness. The authorities should further adopt measures to ensure full compliance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with laws criminalizing bride kidnapping, forced marriage and polygamy, and should 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure mechanisms of protection for victims of domestic violence</b>. 
</p>
<p>99. <b>The authorities should fully support the establishment of a separate body in the 
executive power that would be tasked with formulating a comprehensive State policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>on gender equality and coordinate its implementation among various government 
</b></p>
<p><b>entities</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>  On minorities 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The authorities, at all levels, should publicly condemn any attacks against 
minorities, including hate speech and hate crime, and ensure that such attacks are 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigated in order to bring the perpetrators to justice</b>. 
</p>
<p>101. <b>The authorities should undertake inclusive and longer-term measures with 
respect to linguistic policy, education and participation in decision-making for 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities</b>. 
</p>
<p>102. <b>The authorities should take all appropriate measures to ensure better 
representation of minorities in Parliament, Government and in public administration, 
</b></p>
<p><b>by eliminating obstacles preventing their appointment or restricting their promotion</b>. 
</p>
<p><b>  On the Ombudsman Institution 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Parliament should remove from the Law on the Ombudsman those provisions 
that are not in line with the Paris Principles. The Ombudsman Institution should 
</b></p>
<p><b>intensify its efforts to comply fully with the Paris Principles.</b> </p>


<p>104. <b>The Ombudsman Institution should continue its efforts to become a more 
effective entity to promote and protect human rights and should ensure that its 
</b></p>
<p><b>representative offices in the various provinces of Kyrgyzstan effectively address cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights violations.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  On human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Government should submit as soon as possible any overdue reports to 
international human rights treaty bodies, and increase its responses to 
</b></p>
<p><b>communications from special procedures of the Human Rights Council, and views of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations Human Rights Committee on individual communications.</b>  
</p>
<p>106. <b>The Government should establish an interdepartmental body reporting to the 
Presidential Administration to implement the recommendations of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights mechanisms. Participation of all key ministries and other relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders, such as the Ombudsman Institution and civil society, should be ensured. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The Government should consider submitting an interim report to the universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>periodic review on the implementation of recommendations accepted in September 
</b></p>
<p><b>2010</b>. 
</p>
<p>107. <b> The Government should ratify or accede to instruments to which it is not yet a
