<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

corporation (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;), entered into an Equity 
Distribution Agreement
(the &#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148;) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC 
(&#147;<B>Wells Fargo Securities</B>&#148;). Pursuant to the Agreement, the 
Company may sell from time to time shares of its common stock, no par value (the
&#147;<B>Shares</B>&#148;), having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $50 
million (the &#147;<B>ATM Offering</B>&#148;). The Shares to be sold in the ATM 
Offering are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
&#147;<B>Securities Act</B>&#148;), pursuant to the Company&#146;s effective 
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No.&nbsp;333-210114). Sales of 
the Shares, if any, may be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an 
&#147;at the
market&#148; offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, including 
without limitation sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange, on any 
other existing trading market for the Shares or to or through a market maker. 
Subject to the
terms of the Agreement, Wells Fargo Securities may also sell Shares by any other
method permitted by law, including but not limited to privately negotiated 
transactions. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company may also sell Shares 
from time to time to Wells Fargo Securities as principal for its own account. 
Any sale of
Shares to Wells Fargo Securities as principal would be pursuant to the terms of 
a separate agreement between the Company and Wells Fargo Securities. </P> <P 
STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New
Roman">The
Company made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants 
concerning the Company, the Shares and the ATM Offering in the Agreement and 
also agreed to indemnify Wells Fargo Securities against certain liabilities, 
including liabilities
under the Securities Act. The Company will pay Wells Fargo Securities a 
commission equal to 2.00% of the gross proceeds from the sales of the Shares. 
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-
family:Times New Roman">A
copy of the Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-
K, and the descriptions of the material terms of the Agreement in this 
Item&nbsp;1.01 are qualified in their entirety by reference to such Exhibit 1.1,
