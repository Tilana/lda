<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance visited Mauritania from 20 to 24 January 2008 at the 
Government&#8217;s invitation. The main purpose of the visit was to contribute to the elimination, in 
the context of the current drive towards democracy, of the historical legacy of ethnic 
discrimination which has long characterized that society. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main conclusion following the visit was that, while there are no 
manifestations of legally endorsed or State-approved racism in the country, Mauritanian society 
has been deeply marked by continuing discriminatory practices of an ethnic and racial nature, 
rooted in cultural traditions and pervasively present in social structures, the principal institutions 
of the State, in particular the armed forces and justice system, and attitudes. A number of 
persistent features of Mauritanian society have given substance and depth to such discrimination 
over a long period of time, including: the central role of traditional slavery; the cultural and 
social entrenchment of the caste system; and the use of ethnicity as a political tool, for example, 
through language policies which have contributed to the polarization of various communities. 
The pervasiveness of a culture of racism and discrimination is the greatest obstacle to the 
establishment of democracy and respect for human rights in Mauritanian society. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur believes that Mauritania currently faces three major challenges: 
construction of a democratic, egalitarian and participatory society; comprehensive and 
permanent eradication of discriminatory cultural traditions; and the correction of political, 
economic and social inequalities caused by the historical legacy of discrimination. The 
Special Rapporteur makes several recommendations to the Mauritanian authorities, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) At the political level, consistent communication to the public of a clear political will 
to combat all forms of racism and discrimination and to foster democratic, egalitarian and 
participatory multiculturalism, based on respect for and recognition and promotion of cultural 
diversity; 
</p>
<p> (b) At the strategic level, recognition that the eradication of racism and discrimination is 
the key to the establishment of sustainable democracy in Mauritania; 
</p>
<p> (c) At the legislative level, the adoption of comprehensive legislation against all forms 
of discrimination that incorporates a definition of discrimination that is applicable in all areas of 
social life, as well as recognition in the Constitution of the multicultural and multi-ethnic 
character of Mauritanian society and of its main ethnic groups and communities and their 
languages and cultures; 
</p>
<p> (d) At the institutional level, the creation of an independent special commission with a 
mandate to prepare a white paper on the status, root causes, manifestations and consequences of 
the forms of discrimination that have left their mark on Mauritanian society and to establish a 
permanent independent national institution in accordance with the principles relating to the status 
of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles) and 
responsible for upholding human rights, combating all discrimination and promoting democratic, 
egalitarian and participatory multiculturalism; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> (e) In parallel to the political, legal and institutional strategy, the adoption of a cultural 
and ethical strategy aimed at the full and lasting eradication of the underlying causes of the 
culture and mindset of discrimination and the building of a spirit of partnership, for example 
through education, culture and communication. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur recalls that the present report reflects only the situation he 
observed during his visit in January 2008. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, visited Mauritania from 20 to 24 January 2008 at the 
Government&#8217;s invitation. The main purpose of the visit, the first by a special procedure mandate 
holder, was to contribute to the elimination, in the context of the current drive towards 
democracy, of the historical legacy of ethnic discrimination which has long characterized that 
society. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit included the cities of Nouakchott and Rosso. He met with 
the President of the Republic, Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi and Prime Minister, 
Mr. Zein Ould Zeidane, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Education, the 
Advancement of Women, Children and the Family, Islamic Affairs and Basic Education, and 
senior officials of the Ministry of Justice. He also met with the President of the Supreme Court 
and the Speaker of the Senate. At the local level he met with the President of the Nouakchott 
metropolitan area and the wali (governor) of Rosso. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur likewise met representatives of non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), spiritual and religious leaders, political party leaders, intellectuals, journalists and other 
members of civil society involved in the efforts to eliminate racism and racial discrimination. He 
also met with the Ombudsman of the Republic and the members of the new National Human 
Rights Commission. He made a point of visiting the deprived El-Mina neighbourhood and the 
Dar Naim prison in Nouakchott and the Toulel II area near Rosso, where he met with 
Mauritanian refugees from 1990 who had since returned from Senegal. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Mauritania for its invitation, 
the warm welcome he received and the openness it showed throughout his visit. He believes the 
invitation extended to him testifies to the existence of a real desire at the highest levels of the 
State to cooperate in an independent and objective review of the situation of racism and 
discrimination in the country. He would also like to thank the various civil society stakeholders 
for taking the time to meet with him and for the information they provided. He would also like to 
express his gratitude to the United Nations country team for its assistance during the preparation 
and visit phases of his mission. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL INFORMATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Historical and political context 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since achieving independence from France on 28 November 1960, the Islamic Republic of 
Mauritania has been governed by authoritarian civilian or military regimes that created a political 
identity based on the Arabization of the country and Arab nationalism. Measures to promote that 
policy of identity politics took many forms: for example in the area of education, starting 
in 1965, successive laws made the use of Arabic compulsory in primary education and at the 
political level, Mauritania strengthened its relations with the Arab world while gradually 
disengaging from sub-Saharan Africa. That policy took a dramatic turn when Colonel Maaouya 
Ould Sid&#8217;Ahmed Taya took power, and Halpular officers were executed in 1987, followed by a 
wave of arrests and the demobilization of thousands of Halpular soldiers, who were accused of 
trying to overthrow the Government. Between 20 and 29 April 1989 there was a series of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>pogroms against Mauritanians in Senegal and Senegalese in Mauritania; hundreds were killed 
and nearly 300,000 people made refugees, displaced or repatriated. The repression organized by 
the Taya regime against Mauritanian citizens of black African origin, accused of &#8220;s&#233;n&#233;galit&#233;&#8221;, 
led to the expulsion or flight of tens of thousands of Mauritanians to Senegal and Mali. This 
campaign of ethnic cleansing was accompanied by the destruction of identity documents, 
confiscation of property and land, arbitrary arrests, rape and summary executions. In the 
early 1990s nearly 60,000 black Mauritanians were living in refugee camps located along the 
border with Senegal and 40,000 were in camps in Mali. 
</p>
<p>6. The emergence in those camps of resistance movements that challenged the Arab-Berber 
political and economic domination of Mauritania led to new human rights violations against 
black Mauritanians in 1990-1991, in particular within the army and the administration. In 1990, 
on the basis of an alleged conspiracy among black Mauritanian officers, more than 3,000 black 
Mauritanian soldiers, civil servants and managers were detained and imprisoned and 500 of them 
executed in extrajudicial killings. 
</p><p>7. On 3 August 2005 a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat led by Colonel Ely Ould Mohamed Vall overthrew the 
Taya regime after more than 20 years in power. The Military Council for Justice and Democracy 
was established as a temporary body charged with &#8220;putting an end to the regime&#8217;s totalitarian 
practices, which had caused so much suffering among the population in recent years&#8221; and 
organizing &#8220;democratic elections open to all political groups&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. During this period, commonly referred to in Mauritania as the &#8220;period of transition to 
democracy&#8221;, major reforms were undertaken and several elections organized, including: a 
referendum in 2006 on amending the 1991 Constitution; legislative, municipal and Senate 
elections, likewise in 2006; and, in 2007, presidential elections that marked the end of the 
transition period. Mr. Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi was elected President following 
multiparty elections generally considered to have been free and transparent, and took office 
on 19 April 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Population and ethnic, linguistic and religious composition 
</b></p>
<p>9. Mauritania is a multicultural and multi-ethnic country with a surface area of more 
than 1 million square kilometres. The population, estimated to be 3 million is made up of two 
major cultural and ethno-linguistic groups: the Arab-Berber or Beidane peoples, commonly 
referred to as Moors, largely nomadic and inhabiting mostly the north of the country; and the 
black African population, made up of Halpular, Soninke, Wolof and Bambara, mostly settled and 
inhabiting the south and east of the country. In addition to these two large groups there is a 
Harratin community, also called the black Moors, as opposed to the white Moors, black African 
by skin colour but an integral part of the Moorish ethnic group, whose language and culture they 
share. 
</p>
<p>10. Pursuant to article 6 of the Constitution of 2006 only Arabic has the status of official 
language whereas Arabic, Pular, Soninke and Wolof have the status of national languages. 
Hassanya, an Arabic language with Berber influences, is spoken by the Arab-Berber population, 
while Pular, Soninke and Wolof are spoken by the black African population. Article 5 of the 
Constitution makes Islam the official religion of the population and the State. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Political and judicial structure 
</b>11. Mauritania has a presidential political regime. Pursuant to the Constitution of 20 July 1991, 
as amended and restored by Order No. 2006/14 of 12 July 2006, the President of the Republic is 
the Head of State. He exercises executive power, chairs the Council of Ministers and is the 
Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. He is elected for a term of five years by direct 
universal suffrage and may be re-elected once. 
</p>
<p>12. Legislative power is exercised by Parliament, composed of two representative chambers, 
the Senate and the National Assembly. Article 89 of the Constitution establishes the principle of 
separation of judicial, legislative and executive branches. The President of the Republic is the 
guarantor of the independence of the judiciary and is assisted by the High Council of the 
Judiciary, which he chairs. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>13. Mauritania is a party to the main international human rights instruments, including the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Mauritania has also acceded to the Slavery 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>14. Mauritania has ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the 
Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in 
Africa. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur had a number of meetings with representatives of the executive, 
legislative and judicial branches with a view to obtaining their opinion on the situation of racism 
and racial discrimination in Mauritania, on the adequacy of the current legal framework on the 
elimination of racism and racial discrimination, and on the programmes and policies 
implemented by the authorities for that purpose. The Special Rapporteur also met with 
representatives of NGOs, spiritual and religious leaders, political party leaders, intellectuals, 
journalists and other members of civil society. 
</p><p>16. In order to make his analysis as comprehensive and objective as possible, the Special 
Rapporteur organized his meetings with all stakeholders around three main issues: (a) the 
existence of racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia in Mauritania; (b) their causes and 
principal forms and manifestations; (c) measures and programmes adopted by the Government to 
address them on the political, legal and cultural levels as well as policy alternatives. 
</p>
<p>17. In the first part of this report the Special Rapporteur describes the legal and political 
strategy implemented by the authorities to combat the forms and manifestations of racism and 
racial discrimination in Mauritania. In the second part he describes the positions of civil society 
and of representatives of the victimized communities. The third part contains the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s analysis of the problem of racism in Mauritania based on information received. The 
final part contains his recommendations to the Government of Mauritania. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>II. LEGAL AND POLITICAL STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED  
BY THE AUTHORITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Legal and institutional framework to combat racism  
and racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Legal provisions against racism and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>18. Article 1 of the Constitution of Mauritania enshrines the principle of the right to equality, 
declaring that &#8220;the Republic guarantees equality before the law to all of its citizens without 
distinction as to origin, race, sex, or social condition&#8221;. Article 15 of the Constitution guarantees 
the right of property and the right of inheritance to all citizens without distinction. 
</p>
<p>19. Other laws and regulations enshrine the principle of non-discrimination, in particular 
article 395 of the Labour Code, which explicitly establishes equal access to employment and 
prohibits any discrimination, exclusion or preference based on race, national origin, colour, sex, 
religion, political opinion or social origin. 
</p>
<p>20. Mauritanian law, including article 1 of the Constitution, prohibits incitement to acts of 
racial or ethnic discrimination and contains a series of provisions that criminalize the 
dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination 
and violence or provocation against another race or a group of a different colour or ethnic origin. 
Article 3 of Order No. 91-023 of 25 July 1991 on freedom of the press prohibits ethnic or 
regional hatred and prejudice and any acts considered crimes or offences. In addition, article 4 of 
Order No. 091-024 of 25 July 1991 on political parties states that &#8220;political parties shall ensure 
that their statutes, programmes, public statements and political activities are free from incitement 
to intolerance and violence or propaganda intended to undermine territorial integrity or national 
unity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. In the area of criminal legislation, no provision of Order No. 083-162 of 9 July 1983 on the 
Criminal Code deals specifically with racial or ethnic discrimination. In that regard, in 
March 2004, in its sixth and seventh periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination (CERD/C/421/Add.1), Mauritania states that the provisions contained in 
the chapter of the Criminal Code entitled &#8220;Crimes and offences against the person&#8221; authorize a 
judge to draw on a wide range of criminal sanctions in order to punish any racist practice in a 
manner commensurate with its severity but nevertheless states that &#8220;to date, no case law exists in 
respect of racist offences, as such offences are alien to Mauritanian society, where making a 
distinction on grounds of race or colour is inconceivable&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Legal provisions against slavery 
</b></p>
<p>22. Slavery has long been a problem in all ethnic communities in Mauritania. Differences of 
opinion exist even among those who admit that the practice continues to exist and has left its 
mark on contemporary Mauritanian society: some deny it exists in their community, but point the 
finger at other ethnic groups; others claim it is limited to the Arab-Berber community; still others 
say it also exists in the other communities but in the form of a caste-like system. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>23. Slavery was first abolished in Mauritania in 1905 following colonization by France, in a 
colonial decree implementing in Mauritania the law adopted in 1848 abolishing slavery in all 
French colonies. Abolition was reaffirmed at independence by the 1961 Constitution, which 
incorporated the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>24. Order No. 081-234 of 9 November 1981 on the abolition of all forms of slavery was 
promulgated in the context of a review of basic legal texts following the proclamation of sharia 
law in 1980 in order to underscore the acceptance by Muslim jurists of laws adopted under 
positive law. Article 1 of the Order definitively abolished slavery throughout the national 
territory but did not impose a criminal penalty for slavery. Article 2 stated that compensation for 
the abolition of slavery would be provided to rightful claimants, i.e., slave-owners. However, no 
implementing regulations were adopted for the Order, which rendered it without practical effect. 
</p>
<p>25. On 25 June 2003 the Government adopted Act No. 025/2003 on combating human 
trafficking. Pursuant to that Act, the expression human trafficking means, inter alia, the 
recruiting, transport or transfer of persons by force, intimidation or other forms of constraint; by 
abduction, deceit, abuse of authority or exploitation of a person in a vulnerable situation; or by 
offering or accepting payment or other advantages with a view to obtaining the consent of a 
person in a position of authority over another, for the purpose of exploitation. The Act provides 
for criminal penalties up to hard labour for life for the perpetrators of such crimes. 
</p>
<p>26. The adoption on 3 September 2007 of the Act criminalizing slavery and punishing 
slavery-like practices was a turning point in the approach to this issue in Mauritania. The 
Prime Minister, introducing the bill, described it as &#8220;a decisive turning point, aimed at the 
elimination of all the wrongs inherited from the past, the promotion of a culture of equality, 
tolerance and citizenship and the establishment of favourable conditions for progress and the 
emancipation of all Mauritanians&#8221;. That position is in contrast to the attitude of complete denial 
at the highest level of the State in the past, as evidenced for example in 1997 when 
President Ould Taya stated that those who raised the issue of slavery were only trying to tarnish 
the country&#8217;s image and must be linked to a group previously involved in an attempted 
coup d&#8217;&#233;tat. More recently, in September 2001, a representative of the Government of 
Mauritania stated to the Committee on the Rights of the Child that &#8220;Mauritanian society had 
never known servitude, exclusion or discrimination [...] and no vestiges of such practices could 
thus persist&#8221;.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Article 2 of the Act defines slavery as &#8220;the exercise of all or some of the rights of property 
over one or more persons&#8221;. Article 3 prohibits &#8220;discrimination, in any form, against a person 
alleged to be a slave&#8221;. The crime of slavery is held to occur when &#8220;any person reduces another 
person, or a person under their care or responsibility, to slavery or incites them to forfeit their 
liberty or dignity, for the purpose of enslaving them&#8221; and is punishable by 5 to 10 years&#8217; 
imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 to 1 million ouguiyas (art. 4).

</p>
<p><b>3. Tripartite agreement on the voluntary repatriation of  
Mauritanian refugees in Senegal 
</b></p>
<p>28. On 12 November 2007 the Governments of Mauritania and Senegal and the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) signed the Tripartite Agreement on 
the Voluntary Repatriation of Mauritanian Refugees in Senegal. The agreement opens the way 
for a lasting solution to unresolved humanitarian issues, the most grievous consequence of the 
tragic events of 1989 and the ensuing two-year state of emergency, with the expulsion or flight 
of tens of thousands of Mauritanians to Senegal and Mali, mostly black Mauritanians who felt 
their lives were endangered by the ethnic violence. 
</p>
<p>29. The Agreement sets forth each party&#8217;s undertakings with a view to ensuring the 
satisfactory organization of the voluntary return of refugees to Mauritania, under the supervision 
of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The Agreement 
is based on the principles of the right of return (art. 1), the voluntary nature of repatriation 
(art. 2), preservation of family units (art. 3) and repatriation in conditions of safety and dignity 
and in a context conducive to a sustainable return (art. 4). 
</p>
<p>30. As for Senegal&#8217;s principal responsibilities, article 5 of the Agreement states that refugees 
who decide not to participate in the repatriation programme may continue to reside in Senegal 
and integrate more fully into Senegalese society, while articles 7 and 8 provide for assistance 
with departure formalities for Mauritanian refugees and the issuance of certificates of civil status 
and judicial documents to refugees. 
</p><p>31. Mauritania&#8217;s responsibilities include the preparation of appropriate administrative 
structures for the realization of the return of the refugees in safety and dignity and their full legal, 
social and economic reintegration into the national community (art. 9); the adoption of measures 
to help returnees establish themselves in their communities of origin or of choice by 
guaranteeing protection for their movable and immovable property (art. 12); the reintegration of 
the returnees into economic and social life without discrimination; and the adoption of any 
measures needed to inform, notify and prepare the local populations with a view to facilitating 
harmonious and peaceful reintegration (art. 13). 
</p>
<p><b>B. Policies and programmes to combat racism, racial  
discrimination and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>32. The representatives of the Government of Mauritania indicated that, in addition to the 
existing legal framework, several institutional initiatives have been adopted to promote tolerance 
and respect for diversity and combat all forms of discrimination, xenophobia or related 
intolerance. 
</p>
<p>33. At the institutional level, the authorities pointed to the recent creation of the National 
Human Rights Commission, an independent advisory, monitoring, early warning and mediation 
body to promote respect for human rights. It is under the responsibility of the Prime Minister and 
comprises prominent persons from professional organizations, civil society, the Bar Association, 
unions and government institutions. The Commission is now the main institution responsible for 
defining and developing human rights promotion and protection policies, alongside other 
institutions with a more specific mandate, such as the Secretariat of State for the Status of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>Women, the National Council for Children and the Ombudsman. The Special Rapporteur 
recognizes the essential role of the Commission and can testify personally to the lively 
discussions among its members on such topical issues as the new law on slavery, unresolved 
humanitarian issues and the importance of reinforcing social cohesion and national unity. 
</p>
<p>34. With regard to the return of Mauritanian refugees from Senegal, the authorities highlighted 
the creation on 2 January 2008 of the National Refugee Support and Integration Agency. The 
Agency&#8217;s mandate is currently limited to three years and its general mission is to ensure the 
integration of Mauritanian refugees returning from Senegal and Mali, support the government 
offices and commissions responsible for the identification, return and reception of refugees, and 
promote the economic and social development of the areas concerned. In order to ensure its 
actions will have a lasting effect, the Agency&#8217;s programmes are aimed not only at new returnees 
but also at refugees who have returned on their own account since 1996, Mauritanians sent back 
from Senegal, known as &#8220;Moussafarines&#8221;; and the population as a whole in reception areas. The 
first group to return was expected on 29 January 2008, in the city of Rosso. 
</p>
<p>35. The Government likewise underscored the implementation of programmes and policies 
aimed at developing and protecting the various social groups, for example the National Plan of 
Action for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and the Strategic Framework for 
Poverty Reduction. The National Plan of Action, adopted in 2003, is intended, inter alia, to 
provide Mauritania with a framework for consultation and cooperation on the coordination of 
human rights promotion and protection programmes, promote the rule of law and a constitutional 
framework enshrining human rights, and strengthen national capacities and partnership between 
the Government and civil society for the promotion and protection of human rights. The 
Strategic Framework for Poverty Reduction (2001-2015) aims to give greater attention to the 
particularly vulnerable groups in Mauritanian society with such measures as job creation, 
promotion of sectors that directly help the poor in the areas where they are concentrated, 
development of the education system, basic health care, and the promotion of good governance. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur also met with the Ombudsman, an independent authority 
established by Act No. 93/027 of 7 July 1993. The Ombudsman deals with complaints from 
citizens relating to their dealings with the State bureaucracy, local authorities, public institutions 
and other bodies providing a public service. After reviewing the complaints the Ombudsman 
drafts a confidential report for the President of the Republic containing recommendations on how 
to remedy the complaints. During his meeting with the Special Rapporteur the Ombudsman 
stressed that by far the most complaints are related to land ownership and decisions affecting 
enforced retirement or dismissals from the civil service, and not issues involving manifestations 
of discrimination based on race, ethnicity or other factors. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Official perceptions and reactions 
</b></p>
<p>37. Most of the Mauritanian officials the Special Rapporteur met with underscored that 
Mauritanian society is multi-ethnic and multicultural, cemented together by a common history 
and shared Islamic values. While the authorities admit that there have been tensions between 
communities in the past and particularly the recent past, those tensions are not considered to be 
attributable to any discriminatory practices based on ethnicity or race that might have led to deep 
divisions between the various communities, but rather the result of a range of differences 
between the various ethnic groups and within ethnic groups themselves. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>38. Without exception the Mauritanian authorities highlighted the political will of the current 
Government to resolve the problems inherited from the practices of the past that have had 
profound consequences for society today, in particular unresolved humanitarian issues and 
slavery. In that context many references were made to the solemn declaration by the President of 
the Republic of 29 June 2007, which was welcomed by both the political authorities and civil 
society representatives, and in which he expressed his compassion for all the victims of those 
years and reaffirmed the State&#8217;s desire to ensure a dignified return for all fellow citizens who 
wished to return and to find a definite solution to the humanitarian situation. 
</p>
<p>39. The President of the Republic himself, during his meeting with the Special Rapporteur, 
said that determination was essential for the consolidation of national unity and the strengthening 
of social cohesion, which were his two highest priorities. He said that he was convinced that 
Mauritania could set an example in promoting union and unity among all communities in its 
population. That same political will was expressed by the Prime Minister, who told the Special 
Rapporteur that he was determined to overcome the heavy legacy of the past and make 
Mauritania a nation in which all its citizens, whatever their ethnic origin, could feel they belong 
to the same nation and have the same rights, obligations and equality of opportunity. In that 
regard he explained the reforms the Government intends to undertake, in particular in the 
educational sphere, to ensure that this political will and vision will lead Mauritanian society to 
harmonious coexistence, without any form of ethnic, tribal, social or other tension. 
</p>
<p>40. The officials who met with the Special Rapporteur emphasized the efforts being made to 
promote all languages and cultures in Mauritania. While they are aware of the polarization in the 
past of the black Mauritanian and Arab Mauritanian communities along ethnic lines, they 
strongly deny the existence of language policies that might give an advantage to a particular 
community and encourage social polarization. The Minister of Education for example recalled 
that since 1999 there has been a single education system for all children, whatever their ethnic or 
tribal origin. She also drew attention to the current programmes of the Ministry of Education, 
including the holding in the near future of a national conference on education to review the 
values and objectives the education system should transmit, and the launching of initiatives 
aimed at eliminating any discriminatory content from teaching materials. The Minister likewise 
stressed the importance, in the context of the voluntary return of Mauritanian refugees from 
Senegal, of developing an educational strategy to fashion a common history based on a feeling of 
belonging and on the acceptance by all communities of the unity of the Mauritanian nation. 
</p>
<p>41. Most of the officials who met with the Special Rapporteur stated that slavery was no 
longer practised and had left merely traces, underpinned to a large extent by underdevelopment, 
poor living conditions and poverty. In order to eradicate these remnants of slavery - which in 
many cases were not very different from the problem of castes, which affected all communities - 
the authorities stressed the importance of the new law criminalizing and penalizing slavery. They 
noted that a number of supporting measures will be introduced to implement the law, including 
the creation of mechanisms for the social and economic reintegration of the victims of slavery 
and a wide-ranging public awareness campaign. 
</p>
<p>42. Most of the members of the Government mentioned that there is no discrimination in 
access to employment in the public or private sectors and gave examples showing that all ethnic </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>groups are represented in the political parties, the economy and the Government. Officials from 
the judicial system, for example the President of the Supreme Court, also pointed out that no 
case of racial discrimination had been tried by the courts. 
</p>
<p>43. Such claims were in contrast to the opinions expressed by some local officials, in particular 
from the Nouakchott municipality, who spoke openly of the high degree of language-based 
polarization among the various communities. They said it was important for Mauritania to be 
recognized - notably in the Constitution - as an Arab-African country. 
</p>
<p><b>III. POINT OF VIEW OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND CONCERNED 
COMMUNITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Concerns relating to Government policies and measures 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur had a number of meetings with a diverse and representative group 
of persons from civil society, including representatives of NGOs, spiritual and religious leaders, 
leaders of the main political parties, union and employer representatives, journalists, academics 
and intellectuals. He commends the courage and vitality of Mauritanian civil society, which was 
severely oppressed for years - its commitment and energy are decisive factors in the current 
democratic process. 
</p>
<p>45. The great majority of civil society representatives were convinced that racism, racial 
discrimination and intolerance are deeply rooted in Mauritanian society. They believe that the 
problem of slavery, the existence of castes and, more recently, political practices that have 
favoured the Arab dimension in the building of a national identity, have contributed to 
discrimination and created divisions among the various communities. 
</p>
<p>46. Civil society representatives acknowledged that there is a legal framework containing 
instruments to combat such phenomena and that there is a strong political will that has led, 
inter alia, to the formulation of a new legal strategy and the creation of new institutions and 
mechanisms to eradicate the heavy legacy of the past. Yet in the effort to eradicate these 
problems, several representatives of human rights organizations noted the lack of implementing 
measures to transform a formal political commitment into real democratic progress, and the gap 
between the legal framework and its application. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur would like to deal with three specific issues in this section: the 
political, economic and social invisibility of certain communities, in particular the black 
Mauritanian communities, in the structures of political power and of the military, police and 
security forces, and in the business sector and the media; the tacit acceptance of relations of 
servitude, an example of the long-term effect of slavery; and concerns over unresolved issues 
relating to the voluntary repatriation of Mauritanian refugees in Senegal and to humanitarian 
needs. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Perspective of black Mauritanian and Harratin communities 
</b></p>
<p>48. The black Mauritanian community, which along with the Arab-Berber community, is one 
of the two ethno-linguistic and cultural groups in Mauritania, is itself made up of the Halpular, 
Soninke, Wolof and Bambara. The Harratin community, which is black African by skin colour </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>but in fact forms part of the Moorish ethnic group, whose language and culture it has inherited, is 
situated between the two main groups. Also called &#8220;black Moors&#8221;, they were enslaved by the 
&#8220;white Moors&#8221; for generations. 
</p>
<p>49. In a number of meetings with the Special Rapporteur members of the black Mauritanian 
communities expressed great frustration at their lack of representation in political circles, the 
military and police and security forces, business and the media. They provided many examples 
of this inviolability: the small number of black Mauritanian senior officials in the civil service, at 
most four ministers or five prefects in any Government since independence; the lack of black 
Mauritanian women ambassadors and ministers, despite the recent appointment of three women 
ministers; the lack of black Mauritanian police or military commanders; the lack of private 
corporations or enterprises led by black Mauritanians, in particular in the banking and 
commercial sectors, and their low level of representation in the media, both in terms of visibility 
in audio-visual programmes and as regards employment in journalism, especially at the 
management level. This underrepresentation, which is reflected in the lack of ethnic data in 
census information, is accentuated by Arab-Berber officials who, in contacts with the rest of the 
world, depict Mauritania as an Arab country and do not mention its African roots. 
</p>
<p>50. Numerous other concerns were expressed about the existence of a language policy, a 
legacy of the past, which gives priority to Arabic and excludes the black Mauritanian languages. 
Evidence of that discriminatory policy is particularly clear in the following structures: the 
education system, where Arabic is entrenched as the main language, in particular at the 
university level, which has the direct effect of excluding black Mauritanians from positions of 
responsibility; the judicial system, where Arabic is the only working language, which thus 
precludes members of those communities educated in French from obtaining posts and prevents 
all who do not speak Arabic and cannot afford an interpreter from obtaining access to justice; 
and the media, in particular television, where programmes in Pular, Soninke or Wolof receive 
little air time. 
</p>
<p>51. During his visit to the deprived El-Mina neighbourhood in Nouakchott, the Special 
Rapporteur met with women from the Pular and Soninke communities, who described their 
social marginalization, leading in particular to difficulties in access to decent housing; lack of 
drinking water and electricity; problems of access to school for their children; and obstacles 
caused by their poor command of Arabic. That visit highlighted for the Special Rapporteur the 
overlap between the distribution of socio-economic marginalization and that of ethnic 
communities; he was told that certain ethnic communities were increasingly being squeezed into 
specific areas of the capital, and that the black Mauritanian population in particular was 
increasingly concentrated in the most disadvantaged areas. 
</p>
<p>52. The Harratin also claimed to be the victims of discrimination not only because of the 
colour of their skin but also because of the profound impact of slavery on attitudes and 
behaviours, as manifested by continued discrimination against those who were slaves in the past 
and their descendants. That discrimination made itself felt in many ways, but particularly in the 
wholesale exclusion of the Harratin from high-level positions in such political institutions as the 
High Constitutional Council, the High Islamic Council, the High Council of the Judiciary and the 
National Chamber of Commerce, their relegation to the lower ranks in the army, gendarmerie, 
national guard and police, and their poor representation on national television and radio. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>53. During his visit to the Dar Naim prison, the Special Rapporteur heard many claims that 
most of the detainees were from the communities that were traditionally discriminated against, 
whereas individuals from the Arab-Berber communities escaped imprisonment thanks to the 
discriminatory application of the law and the protection provided by their family or tribe. Despite 
the absence of statistics on the ethnic makeup of the prison population, the Special Rapporteur 
observed that most of the prison population were black Moors and black Mauritanians. He was 
also concerned at the prison conditions, notably overcrowding, which prevented pretrial 
detainees from being separated from convicts and, among other things, hampered access to 
medical services. At the time of his visit there were 760 inmates, whereas the prison&#8217;s capacity 
was 380. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Perception of new legislation and persistence of slavery-like practices 
</b></p>
<p>54. The adoption of the new Act criminalizing slavery was welcomed by civil society as an 
important step toward the effective eradication of the practice, which affects all the ethnic 
communities in Mauritania. Many individuals nevertheless deplored the official position that 
slavery is no longer practised in Mauritanian society but is rather a phenomenon of the distant 
past, of which only a few traces still remain. 
</p>
<p>55. Representatives of NGOs that work directly with slaves or their descendants expressed 
concern with regard to certain omissions in the Act that would prevent, on the legal level, the 
effective eradication of slavery. In the first place, they pointed out that the Act focuses only on 
the individual criminal responsibility of slave-owners and thus can only be applied through 
criminal prosecution, with no possibility for victims to take civil proceedings for reparation or 
compensation. They also noted that the Act does not take into account slavery-like practices, 
including the inextricably related issue of discrimination based on the social status of persons 
enslaved in the past and their descendants, who continue to be the victims of discrimination 
before the law, in their place of work and in their social life. They deplored the lack of reference 
in the Act to concrete application measures and the resulting lack of genuine supporting 
measures to publicize the Act and combat the effects of slavery on the attitudes and behaviour of 
the population in the long term. 
</p>
<p>56. During a meeting with slaves and former slaves, the Special Rapporteur heard several 
reports of the reluctance of the police and the courts to follow up allegations of slavery-like 
practices brought to their attention, either because of ignorance of the law or simply pressure 
from certain communities or tribes. The case of Ms. Tarba Mint M&#8217;Boyrick, born a slave in a 
family in the town of Gu&#233;rou, in the Assaba region in south-eastern Mauritania, and the mother 
of two children she said she had been forced to abandon because of ill-treatment at the hands of 
her masters, provides an example of the authorities&#8217; attitude. In October 2007 she lodged a 
complaint against the family for slavery and trafficking in minors. Although the police initially 
freed the children on the orders of the wali (governor) of Assaba, and following the family&#8217;s 
admission that the children were &#8220;slaves by descent&#8221; and had never attended school, the Public 
Prosecutor of the Court of Appeal in Kiffa ordered the release of the family and returned the 
two children to them on the grounds that Tarba Mint M&#8217;Boyrick had failed to bring them up but 
had abandoned them, whereas the family she had lodged a complaint against had fed and 
supported them. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>57. Civil society representatives also pointed out the limits to legal liberation encountered by 
slaves who do not have the material or financial means to take care of themselves and integrate 
into society. That situation is the principal cause of the many cases of voluntary servitude, where 
slaves or former slaves agree to continue working for their masters or former masters in 
exchange for payment in cash or in kind (e.g., housing, food, or medical care). Given that reality, 
the representatives indicated that in addition to strengthening the legislative framework and 
providing appropriate training to judges and magistrates, it is essential to create mechanisms for 
the social and economic reintegration of persons kept as slaves, now or in the past, undertake a 
campaign to increase public awareness about slavery, and implement measures to provide 
education and literacy for victims. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Concerns relating to the return of refugees  
and unresolved humanitarian issues 
</b></p>
<p>58. Although the civil society representatives on the whole welcomed President Abdallahi&#8217;s 
clear intention to make the repatriation of refugees and the resolution of humanitarian issues a 
Government priority, many of them were extremely concerned by the lack of concrete measures 
aimed at ensuring that the return of refugees took place in dignified conditions and an 
environment conducive to a sustainable return. 
</p>
<p>59. In that regard they expressed concern at, inter alia, the lack of decent facilities, housing, 
health infrastructure and drinking water in the areas designated for those who choose to return. 
With respect to land issues, described as a major challenge to reintegration and a possible 
source of friction between refugees and the communities currently living in those areas, in 
particular the Harratin, they stressed the importance of establishing a specific programme for 
restitution of lost homes and farmland or compensation, without prejudice to the legitimate rights 
of the owners and the current occupants. A point repeatedly made was that, to guarantee a 
sustainable return, it was important to reintegrate returnees into economic and social life by 
promoting income-generating activities, implementing cultural, social and psychological support 
programmes and involving the media and mosques in information and awareness programmes. 
</p>
<p>60. Concerns were likewise expressed about the vulnerability of the Mauritanian refugees who 
had returned from Senegal voluntarily in the 1990s. During his visit to the Toulel II area on the 
outskirts of Rosso, the Special Rapporteur was able to observe the difficult situation of several 
families who had returned to Mauritania in 1993, attributable not only to the extreme poverty in 
which they lived but also to the feeling that they had been forgotten because promises of the 
return of their land and homes had not been kept. 
</p>
<p>61. The resolution of outstanding humanitarian issues was the subject of frequent discussions, 
often open and emotional, in particular with regard to the establishment of a body to look into 
the period between 1989 and 1991. Taking into account the sensitivity of that issue and the 
interest expressed at the highest level of the State to launch a frank and constructive consultation 
process, civil society representatives all agreed on the need for a concerted approach based on 
the principles of historical truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation, with a view to achieving 
genuine and lasting national unity. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur also followed the discussions that took place on this issue during 
the conference on strengthening national unity in Mauritania held on 22 and 23 January 2008 in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>Nouakchott, whose main purpose was to analyse the various models for strengthening national 
unity in other countries and identify the best approach for implementing a model specially suited 
to the situation in Mauritania. During the discussions a consensus developed on the 
establishment of an independent national structure to deal solely with the unresolved 
humanitarian issues and composed, inter alia, of representatives of victims, human rights 
organizations, the Bar Association, religious leaders and eminent persons. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>63. Having considered the information and analyses provided by the national and regional 
authorities, the members and representatives of the communities concerned, NGOs and other 
civil society stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur submits below his analysis of the situation of 
racism and ethnic and racial discrimination in Mauritania and his conclusions. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s main conclusion following the visit was that, while there are no 
manifestations of legally endorsed or State-approved racism in the country, Mauritanian society 
has been deeply marked by continuing discriminatory practices of an ethnic and racial nature, 
rooted in cultural traditions and pervasively present in social structures and attitudes. A number 
of persistent features of Mauritanian society have given substance and depth to such 
discrimination over a long period of time, including: the central role of traditional slavery; the 
cultural and social entrenchment of the caste system; the pervasiveness of the racial and ethnic 
paradigm in the principal institutions of the State such as the armed forces and the justice system, 
and the use of ethnicity as a political tool, for example through language policies which have 
contributed significantly to the polarization of various communities.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur believes that Mauritania currently faces three major challenges: 
construction of a multicultural, democratic, egalitarian and participatory society; comprehensive 
and permanent eradication of discriminatory cultural traditions; and the correction of political, 
economic and social inequalities caused by the historical legacy of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur identifies positive points and makes various critical comments 
regarding the need to strengthen peaceful coexistence based on respect for and recognition of the 
rich ethnic and cultural diversity of this society as well as a feeling of belonging and an 
acceptance by all communities of the unity of the Mauritanian nation. 
</p>
<p><b>Positive points 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur believes that the political will expressed at the highest level of the 
State by President Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, to combat the heavy legacy of racism and 
racial discrimination by means of a determined transition to democracy and the rule of law, 
constitutes the most decisive positive factor that will enable Mauritanian society to not only 
come to terms with its historical legacy of discrimination but also find ways and means of 
eradicating the root causes of discrimination and its various forms and manifestations, and 
remedy its consequences. He welcomes the President&#8217;s commitment in that regard, which was 
expressed with sincerity and determination and has led, among other things, to the 
implementation of significant programmes and measures at the legislative and institutional levels 
aimed at improving the human rights situation. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>68. In the area of legislation, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the Act 
criminalizing slavery and penalizing slavery-like practices, which marks a turning point in 
Mauritania&#8217;s approach to the issue. He also welcomes the stated will of the authorities to 
implement supporting measures in application of the Act, including the creation of mechanisms 
for the social and economic reintegration of the victims of slavery-like practices and preparation 
of a wide-ranging public awareness campaign. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur likewise welcomes the signing of the Tripartite Agreement on the 
Voluntary Repatriation of Mauritanian Refugees in Senegal by Mauritania, Senegal and the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The terms of the 
Agreement, based on the fundamental principles of the right to return and the voluntary nature of 
repatriation, are exemplary, and pave the way for a lasting resolution of the humanitarian issues. 
The provisions on adapting the necessary administrative structures with a view to ensuring the 
effective return of the refugees and their legal, economic and social reintegration without 
discrimination, are particularly encouraging. 
</p>
<p>70. At the institutional level, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the creation of new 
democratic institutions and mechanisms, in particular the National Human Rights Commission, 
whose commitment to promoting and protecting human rights he commends. He also welcomes 
the existence of national structures, in particular the National Refugee Support and Integration 
Agency, whose mission of facilitating the integration of Mauritanian refugees is essential for a 
lasting resolution of the humanitarian issues. 
</p>
<p>71. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the vitality and commitment of Mauritanian civil 
society, whose multiethnic composition, political courage, activism and support for victims make 
it a decisive factor in the transition to democracy. In that regard he welcomes the elimination of 
the obstacles to official recognition of human rights organizations and the exercise of the rights 
of freedom of expression and association which for many years were brutally repressed by the 
political authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>Critical comments 
</b></p>
<p>72. On the critical side, the Special Rapporteur underscores the central challenge of building a 
sense of identity for the Mauritanian nation, which means reconciling the ongoing tension 
between Mauritania&#8217;s two poles, Arab and African identity. This tension has historically been 
used for political gain in Mauritania, with the Arab dimension given greater prominence in 
defining the country&#8217;s official identity. The pervasive presence of a historical legacy of 
discrimination not only in social structures but in mindsets, in the relations between the 
communities and in their attitudes towards each other, is a particular obstacle to the eradication 
of the culture of discrimination and its various manifestations. 
</p>
<p>73. This pervasive discrimination manifests itself in part in the &#8220;invisibility&#8221; of its victims in 
the political, economic and social spheres, in public life, especially at decision-making levels in 
Government, the military and the police and security forces, as well as in the private sector, as 
evidenced by the low level of representation of certain communities in the business sector. This 
invisibility, which is also reflected in the victims&#8217; silence on their suffering, disproportionately 
affects the black Moor and black African communities. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur notes that the silence and invisibility of the victims also translates 
into a lack of census information or statistics disaggregated by descent or ethnic origin and the 
absence of any complaints of discrimination before the domestic courts. He recalls in that regard 
that the fact that victims do not apply to the courts does not necessarily mean there are no such 
cases; it could be attributable to several factors, including the victims&#8217; lack of resources, 
particularly those who do not have a good command of Arabic and cannot afford an interpreter, 
lack of awareness of the remedies available to them, mistrust of the public authorities, or lack of 
awareness of the issues relating to racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>75. While fully aware that Mauritania is a developing country where poverty and inequalities 
persist, and that the current reforms require considerable economic and financial resources, the 
Special Rapporteur nevertheless underscores the overlap in Mauritanian society between the 
distribution of socio-economic marginalization and that of ethnic groups and communities. In the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view this overlap is a characteristic indicator of the depth of racism in some 
societies. The increasing concentration of black Africans in particularly deprived 
neighbourhoods and their prevalence in the main prison in Mauritania illustrate that situation. 
</p>
<p>76. On the legal level, the Special Rapporteur notes firstly that only the Labour Code contains 
a definition of discrimination resembling that contained in the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and secondly that, despite the important new 
laws adopted recently there is a lack of practical supporting and implementing measures, in 
particular with regard to slavery. In that context, he stresses the need to take into account the 
profound effect slavery has had on attitudes and behaviours, and to implement practical and 
effective measures to help address and resolve the limits to legal liberation typically encountered 
by slaves who do not have the material or financial means to look after themselves and 
successfully integrate into society. 
</p>
<p>77. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur underscores the flaws in the intellectual and ethical strategy 
aimed at tackling root cultural causes of discrimination. Particularly important is the absence of 
collective memory work on the gravest violations of human rights; for example, the massacre of 
black Mauritanian officers and soldiers and the expulsion to Senegal and Mali of thousands of 
Mauritanians, most of them from the black Mauritanian community, as a result of ethnic 
violence. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends the adoption by the Mauritanian Government 
of a dual strategy - political, legal and institutional, on the one hand, and cultural and 
ethical, on the other - in order to combat the manifestations of ethnic or racial 
discrimination that have deeply marked Mauritanian society. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>On the political front, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the executive, the 
legislature and the judiciary should restate, publicly and consistently, their political 
determination to combat all forms of racism and discrimination and, in the long term, to 
promote democratic, egalitarian and participatory multiculturalism based, on the one 
hand, on the recognition, respect and promotion of cultural diversity and, on the other, on 
the systematic encouragement of interaction and cross-fertilization between the </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p><b>communities in order to encourage community partnership in the full acceptance of the 
historical truth of discrimination, and of the sensitive task of creating a feeling of belonging 
to one nation. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>On the legislative front, the Special Rapporteur recommends the insertion of specific 
provisions on racial and ethnic discrimination in the Criminal Code. Notwithstanding the 
existence of provisions proclaiming the principles of equality in various items of legislation, 
including the Constitution, he strongly recommends the adoption of comprehensive 
legislation against all forms of discrimination, incorporating a definition of discrimination 
that is applicable in all areas of social life and that contains all the elements of article 1 of 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that, in order to focus on the central role of 
social multiculturalism and strengthen the ongoing drive towards democracy, the 
Constitution should be amended to include two additional elements: the affirmation that 
Mauritanian society is built on democratic, egalitarian and participatory multiculturalism, 
and the recognition of the main ethnic groups or communities in society and their 
languages and cultures. Given that language policies have in the past been used as a tool 
that has helped polarize the various communities, he recommends that, in addition to 
Arabic, Pular, Soninke and Wolof should be given constitutional status as official 
languages.

<p>82. <b>In parallel with the adoption of the new Act prohibiting slavery and slavery-like 
practices, the Special Rapporteur recommends the adoption of measures under the Act to 
make it possible, over and above the criminal liability of individual slave-owners, for 
victims to bring civil suits, notably for restitution or compensation. He further 
recommends that support measures should be put in place as a matter of priority, to 
publicize the contents of the Act and, in the longer term, mitigate the impact of slavery on 
people&#8217;s attitudes and behaviour. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>At the institutional level, the Special Rapporteur recommends that a national 
assessment should be made of the historical and cultural underpinnings of discrimination. 
He therefore recommends the establishment by the National Human Rights Commission of 
an independent commission based on the principle of the democratic participation of all 
political movements, affected communities, traditional religious and spiritual leaders and 
civil society actors.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The commission should tackle the main issues in Mauritanian society which give rise 
to discrimination, including the issue of slavery and caste and political practices which, in 
recent years, have made ethnicity a political tool and have widened the gap between the 
various communities. It should be mandated, on the one hand, to draft a white paper on the 
status, root causes, manifestations and consequences of the discrimination which has 
scarred Mauritanian history and, on the other hand, to develop on that basis a national 
programme of action against all forms of discrimination to help counteract the 
consequences of the injustices and discrimination experienced by Mauritanian society. It 
should pay particular attention to key State institutions such as the armed forces and the 
justice system and could, in the short term, apply the principle of positive discrimination 
based on detailed demographic indicators showing ancestry and ethnic origin. </b></p>

<p>85. <b>In the context of the drive towards democracy noted by the Special Rapporteur 
during his visit, efforts to combat all forms of discrimination should be reflected in the 
adoption of a law establishing an independent standing national commission, in accordance 
with the Paris Principles, to uphold human rights, combat discrimination and promote 
democratic, egalitarian and participatory multiculturalism.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Alongside the political, legal and institutional strategy, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends the adoption of a cultural and ethical strategy aimed, in the long term, at the 
comprehensive and permanent eradication of the cultural and traditional root causes of 
discriminatory culture and attitudes, and the achievement of community partnership 
through education, culture and communication, for example. Particular attention should 
be paid to developing a national programme of education by, inter alia, recording and 
teaching history. This programme should aim to reunite society through shared memory 
and common values based on the promotion of society&#8217;s rich cultural diversity and the 
reinforcement of national unity. Under this strategy, it is vital to work on collective 
memory in order to eliminate community grudges - particularly in respect of unresolved 
humanitarian issues - by full recognition of all those issues, including the systematic killing 
of black Mauritanian army officers. In pursuit of this national catharsis, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends linking the drive towards democracy with the 
achievement of multicultural community partnership on the basis of the following 
three elements: historical truth; justice and redress; and reconciliation.
