<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report contains the findings and conclusions of the visit of the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons 
conducted from 28 June to 4 July 2009, to follow up on the mission to Serbia and 
Montenegro that he undertook in 2005. The Representative&#8217;s mission, to Belgrade, 
Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina and a number of other locations, was conducted in full compliance with 
Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). Any reference to Kosovo, whether to the territory, 
institutions or population, is to be understood in line with United Nations policy of strict 
neutrality on the status of Kosovo. 
</p>
<p> In the report, the Representative concludes that the Government of Serbia has made 
notable progress in the implementation of his recommendations. The institutional 
framework to address questions relating to internal displacement has been strengthened and 
responsibilities clarified. 
</p>
<p> The Representative notes that the number of returns to and within Kosovo has been 
disappointingly low, even though a considerable proportion of the population of internally 
displaced persons still seems willing to exercise its right to return. Security and freedom of 
movement for minority communities in Kosovo have improved, although challenges 
remain. Entrenched patterns of discrimination, lack of access to employment and

<p>livelihoods and too few schools for minorities are today the chief obstacles to sustainable 
returns. The restitution of housing, land and property left behind by displaced persons, or at 
least the provision of appropriate compensation, also remains a challenge. 
</p>
<p> Internally displaced Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians continue to be in a very 
vulnerable position, both in and outside Kosovo. The Representative is concerned that a 
lack of personal identification and other documents prevents these groups of internally 
displaced persons from enjoying their rights on an equal basis. The Representative 
highlights with concern that the situation of displaced Roma exposed to toxic lead waste in 
Northern Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235; has still not been resolved, and that children in particular are 
still exposed to grave risks to their health and physical integrity. He calls on all 
stakeholders to cooperate in a pragmatic manner to resolve the problem. 
</p>
<p> The Representative notes that members of minority communities who are forcibly 
returned to Kosovo from third countries face the same obstacles to reintegration in Kosovo 
as other returnees. While the security situation has improved, inter-ethnic relations remain 
tense. Owing to pervasive patterns of discrimination coupled with a lack of reintegration 
support, many risk becoming internally displaced persons upon their return. The 
Representative recommends that the Kosovo authorities, with the support of States 
returning rejected asylum-seekers and other persons from Kosovo belonging to minority 
communities, take robust measures to provide such persons with real reintegration 
perspectives. As long as they are not in place and discrimination remains pervasive, 
Governments should avoid the forced return of minorities to Kosovo and regulate the status 
of those in their host country until conditions in Kosovo permit their safe return.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report details the findings of a visit (28 June to 4 July 2009) the Representative 
undertook to follow-up on the mission he conducted in 2005 to then Serbia and 
Montenegro.1 The Representative commenced his follow-up visit in Belgrade, moved from 
there to Smederevo and Kraljevo before continuing to Kosovo, where he visited 
Prishtin&#235;/Pri&#353;tina, Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;, &#352;trpce/Sht&#235;rpc&#235; and Ferizaj/Uro&#353;evac.2 
</p><p>2. The Representative underscores that he conducted the mission in full respect of 
Security Council Resolution 1244. Any reference to Kosovo, whether to the territory, 
institutions or population, shall be understood in line with the United Nations policy of 
strict neutrality on the status of Kosovo. 
</p>
<p>3. The purpose of the visit was to assess to what extent the recommendations the 
Representative made pursuant to his 2005 mission have been implemented and what 
remains to be done. The Representative also looked at the impact the unilateral declaration 
of independence, pronounced by the Kosovo Assembly on 17 February 2008, had on the 
situation of persons who were internally displaced from and within Kosovo in 1999 and 
thereafter. In this context, he would like to recall that according to the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, internally displaced persons (IDPs) are 
&#8220;persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their 
homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the 
effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or 
natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized 
State border&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>4. During the course of the visit, the Representative had the opportunity to meet with 
the Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Assistant Ministers for Kosovo and Metohija, 
the State Secretary of the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights, the Serbian 
Commissioner for Refugees and other senior officials in the Government of Serbia. In 
Kosovo, the Representative had consultations with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General in Kosovo, the President of Kosovo, the Deputy Prime Minister, the 
Minister for Communities and Return, the Minister for Labour and Social Welfare and 
other senior officials. The Representative also appreciated the opportunity to speak with 
other representatives of the international community, civil society and internally displaced 
communities as well as the Serbian Ombudsperson and the Kosovo Ombudsperson during 
the course of his visit. The Representative would like to thank all his interlocutors for 
having taken the time to share their perspectives with the Representative. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Assistance and protection of internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Assistance and protection outside Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p>5. Following his 2005 visit, the Representative recommended that appropriate offices 
and organs be clearly mandated to provide for the assistance and protection of the human 
rights of the IDPs and to provide them with the appropriate powers and budgets. The 
</p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 In light of the small number of internally displaced persons remaining in Montenegro, the 
</p>
<p>Representative did not seek to re-visit that country. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-17505 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Representative specifically suggested to give the Commissioner for Refugees the mandate 
and adequate funds to assist and protect all IDPs, as well as the adequate funds.3 
</p>
<p>6. Positively, the Government of Serbia has since extended the mandate of the Serbian 
Commissioner for Refugees to cover the IDP population as well. The Commissioner has 
started a series of activities to assist and protect IDPs, while being in the process of 
elaborating a comprehensive IDP policy. According to the Serbian Commissioner&#8217;s own 
figures, which are calculated on the basis of registration figures dating back several years, 
there are currently more than 210,000 internally displaced persons in Serbia. The vast 
majority (75%) are of Serb ethnicity, about 10% are Roma and the remainder belongs to a 
total of 29 different minority groups. 
</p>
<p>7. The Government lacks reliable figures on how many of those who suffered internal 
displacement in 1999 and thereafter have already found a durable solution and no longer 
need specific assistance and also how many have since moved to other countries. The lack 
of a needs-based figure for operational purposes complicates assistance planning and may 
also undermine donor support for activities aimed at assisting IDPs and facilitating durable 
solutions for them. 
</p>
<p>8. More than a decade after the major wave of displacement, IDPs are still lagging 
behind the resident population in respect of key socio-economic indicators. According to 
the latest Living Standards Measurement Survey,4 IDPs are still more likely to depend on 
social welfare than the resident population. They are less likely to own their living space or 
go to university, although at least non-Roma IDP children seem to be integrated well in the 
school system. IDPs are more likely to be unemployed or hold a precarious employment in 
the informal sector, occasional seasonal jobs or other short-term employment. The current 
economic crisis has caused additional problems. During his visit to Kraljevo municipality, 
where 16.5% of inhabitants are IDPs from Kosovo, the Representative was for instance 
informed that the unemployment rate had shot up to 25%, which has resulted in increasing 
competition for employment and certain tensions between IDPs and the resident population. 
</p>
<p>9. Following his 2005 mission, the Representative recommended that Serbia should 
facilitate and proactively support IDPs who want to participate in society and its economic 
life.5 It is therefore very positive that various Government institutions have established 
programmes to help IDPs improve their living conditions and escape situations of 
dependency. The National Employment Agency, for example, provides IDPs with 
preferential access to programmes designed to foster employment, although the number of 
IDPs among the beneficiaries has so far been quite low. Particularly interesting is a scheme 
by the Serbian Commissioner for Refugees to provide matching grants to municipalities 
that devise and fund local action plans to improve the living conditions of IDPs and 
refugees. By July 2009, 58 municipalities had already received a total of 80 millions RSD 
to implement their plans; 40 more local action plans were in planning. 
</p>
<p>10. The Representative was also impressed by an UNHCR-administered programme that 
provides IDPs with a grant to purchase a village house of their choice as well as training 
and supplies to start livelihood activities such as small-scale farming or food processing. 
From 2008 up to August 2009, 100 families had already benefitted from the programme, 
which has received substantial support from the Divac Foundation and various 
governmental authorities. It would be important to expand this very successful programme 
or start similar new initiatives to improve the situation of IDPs in Serbia.

</p>
<p>11. Recalling his recommendation to find dignified solutions for IDPs in collective 
centres as a matter of priority,6 the Representative notes that IDPs living in collective 
centers continue to be among the most vulnerable IDPs. According to official figures, there 
were still 4419 IDPs in Government-supported collective centers in June 2009, compared to 
7408 persons in 2005. Even more problematic, there are a number of former collective 
centers, where IDPs have stayed on even though the centre is no longer receiving 
Government support. Most collective centers are in a terrible physical state. Having lived 
for often more than a decade an institutionalized dependency situation, many tenants are 
unable to take care of their own life. Social problems are rife in the centers. In this context, 
the Representative underscores that IDPs have the right to an adequate standard of living 
according to the Guiding Principles as well as the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights to which Serbia is a party. The Representative applauds the fact 
that the Serbian Commissioner for Refugees has initiated a programme to help IDPs who 
would like to leave collective centers with materials to build their own homes but considers 
that many may be too vulnerable to benefit from this initiative. 
</p>
<p>12. The Representative would like to re-emphasize his conviction that efforts to help 
improve living conditions at the site of their displacement do not undermine return 
perspectives. Allowing IDPs to rebuild a normal life empowers IDPs, gives them the energy 
to envisage a new life and the capital to invest upon return. The accuracy of this argument 
is borne out by the facts: although tenants of collective centers would seem to have the 
greatest incentive to leave their dreadful situation and return to Kosovo, they make up only 
a small minority of those who signed up in 2009 for the envisaged organized voluntary 
return programme to Kosovo.7 Instead, the majority of declared return candidates appear to 
be persons who have managed to resume a normal life and now feel prepared to attempt a 
return to Kosovo. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Assistance and protection in Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p>13. According to UNHCR, close to 20,000 persons remained displaced within Kosovo 
at the end of August 2009. More than half (10,349) are of Serb ethnicity. There are also 
7,573 Albanians who were displaced from Serb majority areas, namely Mitrovice/a and 
Gjilan/Gnjilane Regions. The rest of the IDP population within Kosovo is made up of 
following minority groups: 720 Ashkalis, 676 Roma, 313 Egyptians, while the remaining 
106 are Bosniaks, Goranis, Turks, Croats and others.8 
</p>
<p>14. The Serbian Commissioner for Refugees maintains 17 collective centres in Kosovo 
for IDPs who are in the majority of Serb ethnicity. Like other collective centres, the centres 
are generally not in a good physical state and most of the inhabitants are particularly 
vulnerable persons. The difficult situation is exacerbated by the fact that a number of 
collective centres receive hardly any support from the municipal authorities. The 
Representative spoke for with inhabitants of a collective centre in &#352;trpce/Sht&#235;rpc&#235;, who 
indicated that their centre was only provided four hours of electricity per day, making it 
impossible to cook at regular hours or keep the place heated in winter. The Representative 
also visited the &#8220;Branko Radi&#269;evi&#263;&#8221; Collective Centre in north Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;.

 There are three self-identified groups in Kosovo: Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians (the latter two groups 
</p>
<p>largely speaking Albanian) which largely live together and experience similar problems and 
treatment. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.1

<p>GE.09-17505 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Representative also had the opportunity to visit a collective center of Kosovo 
Albanians displaced from north Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;. They also appeared to be in need of 
specific assistance to improve their current living condition. Many still maintained a wish 
to return, but were not prepared to return under current conditions.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Return of internally displaced persons to and in Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Returns affected and returns envisaged 
</b></p>
<p>16. Returns of IDPs to and within Kosovo remain disappointingly low. Between 2000 
and May 2009, UNHCR registered 11,776 IDPs who had returned from outside Kosovo, 
while 2676 persons returned from displacement within Kosovo. It is uncertain how many of 
these returns have proven to be sustainable and resulted in durable solutions. Even some 
high-level Kosovo authorities, with whom the Representative conferred, acknowledged that 
many of those who initially returned may have left soon thereafter. 
</p>
<p>17. Returns of Kosovo-Albanians to Serb-majority areas in Kosovo have not fared much 
better than Serb returns. In the period of 2000&#8211;2006, UNHCR registered no more than 674 
returns. The numbers have further dwindled: Only 106 Kosovo-Albanian returns were 
registered between 2007 and June 2009. The Representative was encouraged to meet with 
several Kosovo Albanian families who had managed to return to Northern 
Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;, albeit to zones in close proximity of majority Albanian areas. 
However, such cases are the exception and not the rule. 
</p>
<p>18. Although many IDPs have made a conscious choice to integrate locally at the site of 
their displacement, settle elsewhere in the country or migrate to third countries, it cannot be 
concluded that the low number of returns results from a general unwillingness among IDPs 
to return. The latest Living Standards Measurement Survey found that 56.4% of non-Roma 
and 20.5% of Roma IDPs wished to return.9 At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit 
UNHCR, in cooperation with the Government of Serbia and the Kosovo authorities, had 
launched a programme to register persons interested in returning to Kosovo and refer these 
cases to the authorities for their follow-up. By the end of August 2009, 4563 internally 
displaced persons had registered to return to or within Kosovo under present conditions. 
This indicates that even after the unilateral declaration of independence, there is still a 
section of the IDP population willing to return. The Representative considers that this 
programme is an important test case for the willingness of authorities including at the 
municipal level and communities in Kosovo to re-integrate the displaced. 
</p>
<p>19. In order for such a programme to succeed and result in a considerable number of 
sustainable returns, it is important that the Government of Serbia, notwithstanding the 
vexed political situation, finds pragmatic ways to cooperate with the Kosovo authorities at a 
technical level. At the same time, the Kosovo authorities have to proactively support the 
return and reintegration process on the basis of established principles permitting a voluntary 
and sustainable return within 60 days. 
</p>
<p>20. Following his 2005 visit the Representative pointed out that many IDPs lack 
appropriate information and encouraged more &#8220;go and see&#8221; visits.10 The Representative 
appreciates that UNHCR in cooperation with municipalities, non-governmental 
organizations and the international security presence continues to organize &#8220;go and see&#8221; as

</p>
<p>well as &#8220;go and inform&#8221; visits that help displaced persons make an informed decision on 
what durable solution they would like to pursue. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Obstacles to sustainable returns 
</b></p>
<p>21. Ethnic tension, persistent social discrimination and a failure to turn the Kosovo 
authorities&#8217; stated commitment to allow returns into adequate support for returnees on the 
ground are at this point the chief obstacles to sustainable returns. The Representative 
underscores in this context that the competent authorities have the primary duty and 
responsibility to establish conditions, as well as provide the means, which allow internally 
displaced persons to return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places 
of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country.11 
</p>
<p>22. Compared to the situation in 2005, the security situation for minorities has improved 
and returnees enjoy greater freedom of movement. However, challenges remain and an 
international security presence in Kosovo remains necessary to protect returnees and 
minority populations generally. There are still considerable levels of fear among minority 
communities, who limit their day-to-day engagement with the majority population, 
especially in areas heavily affected by atrocities that occurred during the armed conflict and 
subsequent reprisals. It is difficult to quantify the level of insecurity since the Kosovo 
Police lacks the capacity to collect and collate data relating to the ethnicity of victims of 
crime and the Kosovo Police has no policy of recording crimes that are likely to be 
ethnically motivated.12 Concurring with the view of the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of 
Religion or Belief, the Representative considers it important to continue monitoring 
religious or ethnic tensions with particular vigilance to prevent large-scale violence against 
minority communities as they took place in March 2004.13 
</p>
<p>23. At this point, the situation in Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235; appears to be particularly volatile. 
One exemplary study, conducted by a non-governmental organization using Kosovo Police 
data, found that 32 out of 42 potentially ethnically motivated incidents reported throughout 
Kosovo in December 2008 and January 2009 took place in Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;.14 During 
the course of 2009, violent protests and related security incidents, requiring the intervention 
of the international security presence, repeatedly occurred in the northern suburb of Kroi i 
Vitakut/Brdjani, where former Kosovo Albanian residents started rebuilding their houses, 
which had been destroyed in 1999, despite opposition by local Serbs. Full freedom of 
movement in Northern Kosovo for returnees has not been restored as a first basic step 
towards achieving their social and economic reintegration. 
</p>
<p>24. These continuing security problems noted, the most serious challenge lies at this 
point in ensuring that returnees are protected from discrimination and can enjoy their 
economic, social and cultural rights on the basis of equality and non-discrimination. A dire 
economic situation in Kosovo characterized by extremely high levels of unemployment,15

<p>coupled with entrenched patterns of social discrimination, mean that it is often virtually 
impossible for returnees of a minority community to find a job or attract enough customers 
to sustain a small business. 
</p>
<p>25. Legislation in place indeed gives minority communities the right to public education 
at all levels in one of the official languages of their choice, i.e. in Albanian or Serbian. Yet, 
outside enclaves with a Serb majority, there are also hardly any primary and secondary 
schools which provide education in Serbian. Few potential returnees would accept that their 
children are taught in Albanian. A study conducted by the Organisation for Security and 
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has found that Kosovo Serb displaced families with school 
aged children deem lack of access to school facilities at their place of origin a major 
obstacle to return, second only to lack of job opportunities.16 As a result, most returns have 
been directed towards majority Serb-enclaves. 
</p><p>26. Sustainability problems of this nature could only be addressed if larger groups of 
IDPs would return to the same place at the same time, in particular areas where Serbs were 
at one point a sizable minority. However, high-level interlocutors told the Representative 
that organized return programmes focused on specific locations would likely to be resisted 
as &#8220;population engineering&#8221; by the majority population, which is a subject of concern. 
27. In meetings with the Representative, the Kosovo authorities consistently expressed a 
commitment to allow and facilitate returns regardless of ethnicity. Yet, the reality at the 
level of a number of municipalities, which have been assigned a lead role in the 
reintegration of returnees, does not necessarily mirror this commitment. The Representative 
was apprised of cases in which the municipal authorities outrightly discriminated against 
returnees, obstructing e.g. the provision of basic services (sewage, water, electricity etc.) to 
returnee houses. A number of municipalities and public enterprises fail to provide 
information in Serbian and other minority languages even though this would be required by 
law.17 The Kosovo Ministry of Local Government needs to urgently improve its oversight 
of the municipalities&#8217; reintegration work in these respects. 
</p>
<p>28. Responsibility for returns among the Kosovo authorities at the central level has been 
placed in the hands of the Kosovo Ministry for Communities and Returns. However, the 
Ministry has been largely marginalized. It lacks an adequate budget and the competences 
necessary to effectively fulfil its important mandate. For instance, each municipality has 
been assigned a municipal reintegration officer. Yet, there are no formal reporting lines 
between these officials and the Ministry for Communities and Returns, although the 
Ministry has taken the positive step to proactively establish five regional directorates with 
focal points for municipal actors. 
</p>
<p>29. The Government of Serbia, through its Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija of the 
Government of Serbia, has invested considerable resources to sustain the remaining Serb 
communities in Kosovo. In the past, the Government focused on providing support through 
parallel political and administrative structures, while discouraging the local Serb population 
from engaging with the Kosovo institutions. The Kosovo authorities refuse to recognize 
these institutions, which means in practice for instance that documents issued by Serb 
municipalities or for that matter also the dislocated municipalities outside Kosovo are not 
recognized. This creates serious bureaucratic obstacles for the minority population in 
Kosovo, including returnees.

</p>
<p>30. The parallel administrative structures in Kosovo have been widely criticized as 
inefficient and lacking transparency in their handling of public funds. The Representative 
was therefore interested to learn that the current Government of Serbia has adopted a more 
pragmatic approach towards supporting the minority population in Kosovo. The Ministry&#8217;s 
new strategy places greater emphasis on providing direct support to returnees and the 
resident minority population. In parallel, the Serb population in Kosovo, despite serious 
misgivings over the political developments, seems to increasingly adopt a more pragmatic 
approach to dealing with the Kosovo authorities in regards of documentation issues and 
other administrative matters.  
</p>
<p>31. The Representative underlines that all IDPs have the right to make an informed and 
voluntary choice whether they would like to return to their place of origin, integrate locally 
where they are or settle elsewhere in the country.18 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Resolution of housing, land and property issues 
</b></p>
<p>32. Regardless of whether they choose to return to their home or not, all IDPs have a 
right to restitution of their property or, where this is not possible, appropriate 
compensation.19 In practice, it has proven very difficult for persons who were internally 
displaced from or within Kosovo to realize this right. The Representative also finds that the 
authorities in Kosovo do too little to comply with their obligation under the Guiding 
Principles to protect property and possessions by internally displaced persons against 
destruction and arbitrary and illegal appropriation, occupation or use.20 
</p>
<p>33. During the later stage of the Kosovo conflict and in its aftermath,, Serbs and other 
minorities who were being driven out or fleeing from Kosovo had to leave their housing, 
land and property behind. The housing, land and property left behind was very often 
destroyed, illegally occupied or in some cases also expropriated without due process or 
adequate compensation. The latest Living Standards Measurement Survey suggests that a 
majority of IDP households (61.6%) had houses or apartments in Kosovo; almost half of all 
households (44.1%) also possessed land.21 Among internally displaced survey participants, 
only 3.2% of those who have land in Kosovo could use it, 48.3% did not consider it safe to 
use their land and 39.5% reported that their land was used by other persons without their 
authorization.22 Many Kosovo Albanians driven out of Northern Kosovo are living through 
a similar experience. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Cases before the Housing Property Directorate and Kosovo Property 
Agency 
</b></p>
<p>34. The justice system in Kosovo would not have had the capacity to handle a large 
number of restitution cases. There are also persistent allegations of widespread corruption 
and self-interested interference by influential figures in the judicial process, especially in 
cases relating to property. Against this backdrop, the international community set up a 
Housing and Property Directorate (HPD) under international control to deal with residential

<p>property claims. Since 2006, when HPD was closed, the implementation of HPD decisions 
has been the responsibility of the Kosovo Property Agency (KPA). The new agency has 
also been assigned the mandate to resolve conflict related ownership claims and right of use 
claims in respect of private immovable property, including agricultural and commercial 
property, resulting from the 1999 armed conflict. This is a positive development and 
implements one of the Representative&#8217;s key recommendations.23 
</p>
<p>35. The Representative was informed that all 29160 claims and counterclaims received 
by the HPD have been decided. They concern an estimated 21,500 properties and were 
submitted in the overwhelming majority by Serbs and other minorities in Kosovo. The KPA 
also informed the Representative that almost all HPD decisions have been implemented. 
However, for the majority of claims this does not mean that property was actually restituted 
and people regained effective control over their property. In 2,250 cases, there was no 
physical impediment to repossession by the identified owner. In 5,703 cases, an illegal 
occupant was evicted and the claimant subsequently handed the keys to repossess the 
property.24 The KPA has also instituted a property administration programme, in line with 
the Representative&#8217;s recommendations. 3,186 residential properties are now being 
administered by the KPA for the benefit of the owner. In 10,041 cases the property was 
destroyed resulting in no further implementation activity by the HPD since its mandate is 
limited to restitution and does not cover compensation or reconstruction. The remainder of 
HPD claims were dismissed, withdrawn or closed or at the claimant&#8217;s request or otherwise 
disposed of.25  
</p>
<p>36. The Representative is concerned that HPD decisions about residential property in 
Northern Kosovo have not yet been implemented. At the time of the Representative&#8217;s visit, 
there was a lack of cooperation on the part of the parallel political and administrative local 
authorities. According to information received by the Representative since then, HPD 
decisions have started to be implemented in Northern Kosovo following the signing in 
October 2009 of a revised Memorandum of Understanding between the KPA and Kosovo 
Police. 
</p>
<p>37. The KPA has in the meanwhile already decided a little more than half of the 40,623 
claims to agricultural and commercial land it has received although, EULEX has found that 
many of those decisions may need to be overturned and reprocessed on account of wrongful 
property notification.. The KPA has not yet implemented any decisions given that the 
Supreme Court panel that will hear appeals against KPA decisions remains to be 
established.26 The work of the KPA has been further complicated by the fact that Serbia 
ceased its cooperation with the KPA and closed its offices outside Kosovo in June 2008, 
when the Kosovo Assembly adopted a law transferring UNMIK&#8217;s responsibility for the 
KPA to the International Civilian Representative, an institution not recognized by Serbia. 
The closure of the KPA offices makes it difficult to notify claimants outside Kosovo and 
verify property documents on the basis of property registry records located outside Kosovo. 
Even many uncontested property claims can be processed because relevant title documents 
cannot be obtained outside Kosovo, although other claims can still be verified on the basis 
of information available in Kosovo. The lack of cooperation also encourages fraud by 
parties present in Kosovo, who can for instance present forged title documents that are 
difficult to identify as such without comparison to the official cadastre records. Internally

</p>
<p>displaced persons are particularly affected by these problems. In March 2009, the NGO 
Praxis reported that 3500 claims had already become dormant since the evidence 
verification procedure cannot be conducted in Serbia due to the suspension of KPA mission 
in Serbia.27 In 10,000 additional cases the claimants had been asked to produce additional 
documents. As result, the claim might become dormant unless the claimant finds other 
means to prove ownership. 
</p>
<p>38. In light of this situation, the Representative was encouraged to hear that, following 
his visit, the KPA concluded a memorandum of understanding with UNHCR, which allow 
the KPA to operate under the responsibility and umbrella of UNHCR outside Kosovo. This 
marks an important step forward and shows that, with the necessary political will, 
pragmatic solutions to resolve IDPs&#8217; problems can be found without foregoing positions of 
principle. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cases before Kosovo courts 
</b></p>
<p>39. Property restitution claims not submitted to the HPD or KPA, compensation claims 
as well as ordinary cases involving property transfers (e.g. inheritance cases) continue to be 
handled by Kosovo&#8217;s court system. The courts have accumulated a huge backlog estimated 
to amount to at least 50,000 cases (property and other), which overwhelms their limited 
capacity and unduly delays justice. This also has repercussions for the full implementation 
of HPD decisions since it requires a court decisions to annul fraudulent property 
transactions found by the HPD and remove them from cadastral records.28 
</p>
<p>40. Independent observers have also noted serious irregularities in the handling of 
property-related cases by courts in Kosovo. Courts often recognize ownership on the basis 
of uncontested possession for a specified period of time (a doctrine known as positive 
prescription), even though this discriminates against internally-displaced former owners 
who are usually not aware of or not in a position to contest the occupant&#8217;s possession. 
Courts also continue to appoint temporary representatives for absent respondents without 
following proper procedures.29 
</p>
<p>41. Many cases are reportedly also decided on the basis of forged or outdated 
documents. Neither in nor outside Kosovo are there complete and up-to-date cadastral 
records, not least since many property transactions during the 1990s were conducted 
without due regard for cadastral registration procedures. Moreover, the cadastral bodies in 
central Serbia and Kosovo do not cooperate with each other; there is no exchange of 
records or mutual recognition of documents, so that even once complete records are 
gradually becoming outdated.  
</p>
<p>42. EULEX will play a key role in curbing such irregularities and the Representative 
takes note of the fact that EULEX judges already found in several cases that alleged sales 
of the property of displaced persons were not proven and confirmed the claims of the 
original owners. The OSCE also plays a role and contributes to EULEX&#8217; work by 
identifying fraudulent property transactions through its monitoring activities.

</b></p>
<p><b> C. Protection of internally displaced person&#8217;s property by the Kosovo 
police 
</b></p>
<p>43. While the establishment of a functioning Kosovo Police is generally considered an 
overall success, the Representative received complaints that the local Kosovo Police did not 
always diligently carry out evictions of illegal occupants and failed to pursue criminal 
complaints against them as would be required by law.30 This appears to have also affected 
the implementation of HPD decisions: A number of claimants have reported that they 
picked up the keys to their property from the KPA only to find that their houses had been 
reoccupied in the meanwhile. In these situations, the Kosovo Police Service is responsible 
to provide relief and no further recourse to the KPA is possible. 
</p>
<p>44. In July 2009, several hundred ethnic Serb police officers in Kosovo, who had quit 
their posts in an organized protest against the unilateral declaration of independence, 
reported to duty again. The Representative hopes that the reestablishment of a multiethnic 
police force will help dispel concerns of ethnic bias and ensure a better protection of 
property and other rights for all people in Kosovo, including the Serb community. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Property of internally displaced persons and the privatization process 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Representative was also made aware about problems linked to privatization of 
former socially owned assets, which can have an impact on IDPs&#8217; property rights. Many 
private property titles emanate from the privatizations of the 1990s, which were 
implemented after Kosovo&#8217;s autonomous status had been revoked and many functionaries 
loyal to the Milo&#353;evi&#263; Regime were installed in public institutions and socially owned 
enterprises. A large majority of Kosovo-Albanians refused to engage with the state 
authorities organizing the privatization process at the time. Today many of them perceive 
the privatizations that took place as having unduly favoured Serbs. As a result, some 
municipalities have taken steps towards reversing privatizations, which may retroactively 
deprive a large number of IDPs of their private property rights regardless of whether they 
actually obtained the property lawfully. 
</p>
<p>46. A further concern is linked to the ongoing privatization of socially owned 
enterprises. The Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) has far-reaching powers to privatize and 
dispose of assets and the buyers enjoy protection from third party suits. UNMIK regulations 
have introduced a number of legal safeguards and a special chamber of the Supreme Court 
on Kosovo Trust Agency Related Matters has the jurisdiction to review KTA decisions. 
Nevertheless, some observers remain concerned that property that has already been 
privatized once (e.g. company-owned apartments) could be privatized and transferred a 
second time to the detriment of the actual owner.31 Especially displaced owners, who have a 
hard time staying abreast of such developments, may be at risk unless transparency and 
effective judicial control over the process is ensured.  
</p><p>47. IDPs also complained to the Representative about a lack of access to employee share 
distribution programmes. Under applicable legislation, part of the shares of a socially 
owned enterprise undergoing privatization will be distributed among those who were 
registered as employees of the enterprise at the time it was privatized. However, many IDPs 
were initially not included on the lists of eligible employees since they were not in a 
position to report to work after 1999. The Special Chamber of the Supreme Court of

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.09-17505 
</p>
<p>Kosovo has since ruled in an important precedent case that this amounts to impermissible 
discrimination.32 In practice, there still appear to be problems in ensuring that all IDPs are 
indeed being notified about share distribution programmes and included in eligibility lists.33 
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation of internally displaced Roma 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Internally displaced Roma outside Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p>48. Following his 2005 visit the Representative was concerned about the particularly 
serious situation of Roma IDPs in Serbia. He noted that Roma and other minorities are 
marginalized, vulnerable and exposed to discriminatory treatment. He called upon the 
national and local authorities to ensure that members of these minorities can meaningfully 
exercise their rights as citizens. The Representative specifically recommended that the 
Government of Serbia provide particular support in the areas of housing, access to 
livelihoods, and education to Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian IDPs, in particular those living 
in irregular settlements.34 
</p>
<p>49. The Government of Serbia has launched a number of initiatives in favour of Roma 
under the umbrella of Decade of Roma Inclusion (2005&#8211;2015), an initiative of 12 European 
countries, which was chaired by Serbia in 2008&#8211;2009. In April 2009, the Government of 
Serbia also adopted a Roma National Strategy, even though it remains uncertain to what 
extent its full implementation will be funded in light of the strained budgetary situation.  
</p>
<p>50. Despite these notable efforts, Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian IDPs remain in many 
respects worse off than other IDPs, which also reflects the considerable levels of social 
discrimination generally experienced by citizens of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians ethnicity. 
</p>
<p>51. The latest Living Standards Measurement Survey found that two in five Roma IDPs 
live in relative poverty, compared to only one in 20 non-Roma IDPs. Roma IDPs suffer 
from chronic illnesses such as heart problems or diabetes at a considerably younger age 
than non-Roma IDPs, although it must be noted that displaced Roma report health problems 
less often than non-Roma. Almost half (49.5%) of all school age Roma IDP children have 
not attended school. 46.3% have attended primary school and only a very small fraction of 
Roma IDP children move on to vocational school (1.3%) or high school (0.3).35  
</p><p>52. Almost a third of all Roma IDPs (32%, compared to 6.9% for non-Roma IDPs) 
surveyed reported to live in an object not intended for housing. During the course of his 
follow-up visit, the Representative had the opportunity to meet with Roma IDPs who had 
spent a decade living in a run-down former school. Another Roma IDP community visited 
lived under disastrous hygienic condition in self-constructed shacks in a forest at the 
outskirts of Belgrade. There was no running water, no electricity and no schools accessible 
to the community&#8217;s children and people feared to be evicted in the near future without any 
alternative housing offered to them.  
</p>
<p>53. The Representative was also informed about an increasing number of forced 
evictions of Roma in Belgrade, including some IDPs from Kosovo, as municipal authorities

<p>remove unauthorized informal settlements to clear space for public infrastructure projects. 
In this respect, the Representative sees a need for the Government, to develop, in close 
consultation with civil society, international organizations and the Serbian Ombudsman, 
clear and uniform guidelines that direct municipal and other concerned authorities on how 
to handle such cases in line with international standards.  
</p>
<p>54. In his previous report, the Representative recommended to the Government of 
Serbia to pay attention to the particular difficulties that unregistered members of displaced 
minorities, amongst them the Roma, have to face when trying to regularize their situation.36 
Major steps remain to be taken to implement this recommendation. 
</p><p>55. Many Roma IDPs live in informal settlements or other accommodation without out a 
recognized address and can therefore not register their residence. This means they can not 
apply for certain social welfare benefits or participate in programmes of the National 
Employment Agency. Moreover, the Rules of Procedure on Health Insurance now require 
that Roma IDPs provide registration of temporary residence. This shuts out the most 
vulnerable from the generous health care benefits the Government provides to IDPs. The 
rules also run counter to Article 22 of the Law on Health Insurance, which states that 
persons of Roma ethnicity who due to their traditional way of life do not have a permanent 
or temporary residence may still be beneficiaries of health care. The Representative was 
informed that the Minister of Interior is considering amendments to the Law on Permanent 
and Temporary Residence that may help resolve problems of residence. One good option 
would be to allow Roma and other persons without a recognized address to register under 
the address of the social welfare agency in their municipality. 
</p>
<p>56. Many Roma IDP also lack personal identification documents, including birth 
certificates, because they lost them during their flight or never had any in the first place. 
This renders them &#8220;legally invisible&#8221; and prevents them from accessing a number of 
rights.37 According to the Guiding Principle, the authorities are under an obligation that 
emanates from the human right to recognition as a person before the law to issue IDPs with 
all documents necessary for the enjoyment and exercise of their legal rights, such as 
passports, personal identification documents, birth certificates and marriage certificates.38 
The Minister of Human Rights has submitted a Draft Law on the Recognition of the Person 
before the Law (also referred to as the Law on Legal Subjectivity) for the consideration of 
other Ministries. The Draft Law was developed in close cooperation with international 
organizations and non-governmental experts. If the Law would be adopted along the lines 
of the original draft, this would mark a large step forward towards bringing many citizens 
of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian ethnicity from the margins of society into its fold. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Internally displaced Roma in Kosovo 
</b></p>
<p>57. The reintegration perspective in Kosovo for Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian who were 
internally displaced is generally dim, although the Representative was encouraged to meet 
some families who have managed to return and are actively rebuilding their life with the 
support of civil society groups and international organizations. Roma, Ashkali and 
Egyptians in Kosovo, including returnees, are still in a very vulnerable position. There is a 
widespread prejudice among the majority population that they collaborated with the

<p>Milo&#353;evi&#263; regime before and during the armed conflict, which further exacerbates historic 
patterns of social discrimination experienced by members of these minority groups. The 
Representative was also informed about isolated acts of violence against Roma, Ashkali 
and Egyptians, including a series of attacks on Roma returnees in Gjilan/Gnjilane that took 
place in late July and early August 2009. The Representative recalls the obligation of the 
Kosovo authorities to protect IDPs, without discrimination as to their national, ethnic or 
social origin, against acts of violence and attacks against their camps or settlements.39 He 
urges the Kosovo authorities to fulfil their obligation to promptly investigate these cases 
with due diligence and prosecute all identified perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>58. There are strong indications that only a minority of displaced Roma, Ashkali and 
Egyptians plans to return to Kosovo, which is to a large extent a reflection of the dire 
reintegration perspective. According to the Living Standards Measurement Survey, 
conducted even before the unilateral declaration of independence, only one in five 
internally displaced Roma (20.5%) wished to return to Kosovo.40 In the period from 2000&#8211;
June 2009, UNHCR registered returns of only 4515 Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian IDPs. A 
further 2992 persons voluntarily returned from third countries, namely the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Montenegro. As with regard to other returns, it 
is uncertain how many returns have proven to be sustainable. 
</p>
<p>59. Roma IDPs are more affected than other IDPs by a lack of documentation and often 
face difficulties in obtaining the new personal identification documents issued by the 
Kosovo authorities, if they are among the estimated 20&#8211;30% of Roma whose birth in 
Kosovo was never formally registered. Fearing that about 10,000 Roma, Ashkali and 
Egyptians in Kosovo face a risk of statelessness, UNHCR has initiated a campaign of civil 
registration to prevent statelessness. 
</p>
<p>60. The lack of documentation also negatively affects displaced Roma&#8217;s prospect of 
having their property restituted. Prior to the armed conflict many Roma families lived in 
<i>mahalas or mahallas</i> (neighbourhoods) in housing that been handed down in generations 
without the original title or its inheritance ever being registered. Houses were often built 
without building permits, a practice largely tolerated by the Yugoslav municipal authorities. 
The Representative notes complaints from Roma representatives that a lot of traditional 
Roma land had been designated for public buildings and commercial development. The 
Kosovo authorities have yet to develop a comprehensive policy to address the question of 
security of tenure, e.g. through regularising informal settlements, or allocating land on a 
long-term basis. In practice solutions are negotiated on an ad hoc basis, which often means 
that returnees end up in social housing instead of being able to return to their place of origin 
and reclaim the land they traditionally held. The Representative urges the Kosovo 
authorities to undertake greater efforts to regularize the title to housing, land and property 
historically held by Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian communities on the basis of a 
comprehensive policy. 
</p>
<p>61. During the course of his visit in 2005, the Representative was shocked to see first 
hand the situation of a group of Roma IDPs, who had been settled on highly contaminated 
land in Northern Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235; close to the tailing dams of the former Trepca lead 
mining and smelting complex. The children in particular suffered from lead poisoning, 
which has visibly impaired their health and development. Stressing that failure to act 
immediately was tantamount to a violation of the affected children&#8217;s rights to have their 
health and physical integrity protected, the Representative urged that UNMIK and the

possible.41 
</p>
<p>62. Not enough has been done to implement this recommendation. In 2006, UNMIK 
closed the contaminated &#381;itkovac/Zhitkovc and Kablare camps and offered the inhabitants 
to move to refurbished former military barracks named Osterode. The inhabitants of a third 
contaminated camp in &#268;esmin Lug/&#199;esmin Llug&#235; largely refused to move to the Osterode 
barracks, which are situated only 150m away from the &#268;esmin Lug/&#199;esmin Llug&#235; camp. At 
the point, an estimated 150 persons live in &#268;esmin Lug/&#199;esmin Llug&#235;. A further 500 
persons reside in the Osterode barracks, administration of which was handed over from 
UNMIK to the Kosovo Ministry for Communities and Returns in May 2008. Among these 
persons are a large number of children. 
</p>
<p>63. The World Health Organization informed the Representative that levels of lead in 
the blood were lower in Osterode than in &#268;esmin Lug/&#199;esmin Llug&#235; thanks to better 
hygienic conditions. However, even in Osterode they still exceed medically acceptable 
levels many times and are too high to even begin therapy measures. An evacuation of all 
inhabitants from the entire area remains therefore urgent to prevent further serious harm 
and protect the human rights of the inhabitants present in the two settlements. The 
Representative reiterates that a continued failure to do so amounts to a violation of the right 
to health and physical integrity of affected children and is concerned that despite 
recommendations not only by him but also several treaty bodies42 such a life-threatening 
situation remains basically unsolved. 
</p>
<p>64. In order to provide a durable solution, donors have funded the construction of blocks 
of flats and the reconstruction of some individual houses in Roma Mahalla (Southern 
Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;), the neighbourhood from where most of the camp residents had been 
displaced. However, many Roma IDPs who were offered the option of moving back to 
Roma Mahalla refused the offer or left shortly after their arrival as the needs of the affected 
IDP population were not adequately addressed. The Representative was particularly 
disturbed to hear that IDP children who have moved from the contaminated camps to the 
Roma Mahalla currently do not have access to therapy, even though this would be feasible 
and urgently needed. 
</p>
<p>65. Community representatives met by the Representative during the follow-up visit 
also expressed concern that they would not find jobs in Southern Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;, 
while social welfare benefits currently received from Serbian authorities might not be 
transferable. In addition, they emphasized that it would need to be ensured that their 
children can continue their schooling in Serbian and receive medical therapy, both of which 
is currently only available in Northern Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;. 
</p>
<p>66. The Representative was encouraged to see that the Kosovo authorities attach great 
importance to resolving the issue and have put forward an urban regulatory plan for the 
Roma Mahalla to allow for the relocation of the remaining camp residents. UNMIK also 
reassured him that the situation of IDPs living in the lead contaminated camps in northern 
Mitrovica/Mitrovice, is of special concern to the Mission. UNMIK reported that it had 
stepped up efforts to find a sustainable solution to the issues regarding these camps, 
including activating a coordination group of United Nations agencies and international 
donors concerned, and ensuring that IDP communities are treated as equal partners in 
finding a durable solution to their plight. Most recently on 13 November 2009, UNMIK 
Regional Office in Mitrovice/a facilitated a meeting with all the Roma camp leaders from

<p>Leposavic, Osterode, Cesmin Lug, and Roma Mahalla, to discuss the situation in the camps 
and to seek their views on relocation options. 
</p>
<p>67. The Representative calls on all actors to cooperate to resolve the situation without 
delay, in close consultation with the affected IDP population and without seeking to 
politicize the matter. IDPs need to be provided with security guarantees, culturally adequate 
housing, schooling, medical treatment as well as realistic options to rebuild their 
livelihoods. Alternatives have to be found within Kosovo for persons who are not prepared 
to return to the Roma Mahalla. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Prevention of additional displacement 
</b></p>
<p>68. Following his 2005 mission, the Representative called upon Governments concerned 
to implement forced returns to Kosovo cautiously and to refrain from returning members of 
threatened communities and particularly vulnerable persons to situations where they risk 
becoming IDPs without assistance and protection of their rights.43 The Representative 
considers that this recommendation remains overall valid. 
</p>
<p>69. In recent years, a number of countries have concluded readmission agreements with 
the Government of Serbia and/or the Kosovo authorities and consequently the numbers of 
forced returns have increased. Between January 2007 and May 2008, UNHCR registered 
6912 forced returns to Kosovo from third countries (mainly from Western Europe). 1035 
cases concerned persons belonging to minority communities. 
</p>
<p>70. The Representative is concerned that forcibly returned persons belonging to 
minority communities, like voluntary returnees, do not have much of a reintegration 
perspective owing to a lack of economic options and persistent patterns of social 
discrimination. The Kosovo authorities approved a Strategy for the Reintegration 
Repatriated Persons in October 2007, but observers highlight that this strategy is not 
implemented in practice. A recent OSCE report finds that few steps have been taken to 
implement the Strategy&#8217;s objectives at the local level.44 Concrete measures to facilitate the 
reintegration of repatriated persons in the key areas of health, education, employment and 
housing are still lacking, and no costs associated with the reintegration of repatriated 
persons have been included in the respective municipal budgets. There is also a lack of 
established and functioning referral and co-ordination mechanisms between the central and 
local level. As a result of these shortcomings, many forced returnees do not receive any 
meaningful assistance upon their arrival in Kosovo. In certain situations, forced returnees 
will also not be able to return to their actual home communities due to valid security 
considerations. Consequently, many forced returnees are at risk of becoming internally 
displaced persons, especially if they belong to minority communities. Many will 
immediately seek to re-enter Western Europe, setting in motion a cycle of irregular 
migration and forced returns that is not helpful to anyone except organized human 
smuggling rackets. To break this cycle it is important that the Kosovo authorities with the 
support of states returning rejected asylum seekers and other persons belonging to minority 
communities, take robust measures to provide such persons with real reintegration 
perspectives in line with the Strategy already adopted.

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>71. <b>On the basis of his follow-up visit, the Representative concludes that the 
Government of Serbia has made some notable progress in the implementation of his 
recommendations. The institutional framework to address questions relating to 
internal displacement, in particular the Office of the Serbian Commissioner for 
Refugees, has been strengthened and responsibilities clarified; nevertheless additional 
support is needed. It is very positive that several initiatives have been launched to 
improve the living conditions of IDPs. This will also enhance their ability to carry out 
a sustainable return if they so choose. The Representative recommends that this 
approach will be formally reflected and strengthened in the various IDP-related 
policy instruments that are currently being finalized. The Representative strongly 
encourages the authorities to strengthen their existing efforts to provide inhabitants of 
collective centers with dignified alternative solutions. The Representative also 
recommends that the Serbian authorities, in close cooperation with UNHCR, carry 
out a needs-based registration drive to find out, for operational purposes, how many 
of the more than 200,000 persons who were internally displaced have yet to find a 
durable solution and retain specific assistance needs. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Representative notes that the number of returns to and within Kosovo has 
been disappointingly low, even though a considerable part of the IDP population still 
seems willing to return. The vast majority of potential returnees are IDPs of Serb 
ethnicity, but there are also some Kosovo Albanians still hoping to return to Northern 
Kosovo. Security and freedom of movement for minority communities in Kosovo has 
improved, although challenges remain. Entrenched patterns of discrimination, lack of 
access to employment and livelihoods and too few schools for minorities are today the 
chief obstacles to sustainable returns.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Representative appreciates the consistently stated commitment of the 
Kosovo authorities to allow returns regardless of ethnicity. At the same time, the 
Kosovo authorities need to take more action to comply with their obligations as also 
reflected in the Guiding Principles and ensure that the authorities on the ground, 
especially municipal authorities, actively facilitate the reintegration of returnees. The 
successful implementation of the programme, under which IDPs (and refugees) from 
outside Kosovo interested in return have been registered, should become a priority for 
the authorities at all levels as it is a test case for returns to Kosovo. In addition, the 
Kosovo Ministry of Communities and Returns needs to be urgently strengthened and 
provided with the resources and competences necessary to implement its brief. It is 
important that efforts to facilitate returns fully include the large number of persons 
still displaced within Kosovo. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Representative calls on the Government of Serbia to find ways to engage 
with the Kosovo authorities at a technical level to resolve displacement-related 
challenges. The solution found to enable the KPA to continue its work outside Serbia 
is an excellent example that it is possible with the necessary political will to find 
pragmatic solutions without having to forego positions of principle. The international 
community should assist return efforts by ensuring that existing livelihood and 
employment projects prioritize returnees as well as communities willing to receive 
them. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The restitution of housing, land and property left behind by IDPs or at least the 
provision of appropriate compensation remains a challenge. The restitution 
mechanisms set up by the international community have shielded the restitution 
process to some extent from the serious deficiencies of the Kosovo justice system and 
administrative apparatus. However, many other cases relating to IDP property are </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.09-17505 
</p>
<p><b>pending before Kosovo&#8217;s courts, which do not yet have the capacity to handle this 
caseload and need to be strengthened as a matter of priority. The police and 
municipal authorities in Kosovo also have to increase their efforts to protect IDP 
property in line with their international obligations. The Representative calls on 
EULEX and other actors with a relevant mandate to pay particular attention to how 
housing, land and property cases involving displaced parties are handled by the 
courts, police and other authorities to prevent further miscarriages of justice and 
protect the human rights of IDPs. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Internally displaced Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians continue to be in a very 
vulnerable position both in and outside Kosovo. The Representative is concerned that 
a lack of personal identification and other documents prevents these IDP groups from 
enjoying their rights on an equal basis. The Representative welcomes efforts in Serbia 
to draft a Law on the Recognition of the Person before the Law and to amend the Law 
on Residence. The Representative encourages Government and Parliament to 
prioritize both legislative projects and adopt and implement them without further 
delay so as to end the legal invisibility of a significant section of the country&#8217;s citizens, 
including many IDPs. There are similar problems in Kosovo and the Representative 
encourages the Kosovo authorities to make a serious effort to provide this population 
with documents and regularize their situation, including with regard to land titles. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Representative is very concerned that the situation of Roma IDPs exposed 
to toxic lead waste in Northern Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235; has still not been resolved and 
that children in particular are still exposed to grave risks to their health and physical 
integrity. All stakeholders have to cooperate in a pragmatic manner and in close 
consultation with the IDP community concerned to organize the community&#8217;s 
immediate humanitarian evacuation, close the Osterode/ </b>&#268;<b>esmin Lug/&#199;esmin Llug&#235; 
site and provide durable solutions and all necessary medical treatment to the evacuees 
without further delay. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Representative notes that members of minority community who are being 
forcibly returned to Kosovo from third countries face the same obstacles to 
reintegration in Kosovo as other returnees. While the security situation has improved, 
inter-ethnic relationships remain tense. Due to pervasive patterns of discrimination 
coupled with a lack of reintegration support, many risk becoming internally displaced 
persons upon their return. This sets in motion a harmful cycle of irregular migration 
and forcible return. The Representative recommends that the Kosovo authorities with 
the support of states returning rejected asylum seekers and other persons from 
Kosovo belonging to minority communities take robust measures to provide such 
persons with real reintegration perspectives. As long as they are not in place and 
discrimination remains pervasive, governments should avoid forced returns of 
minorities to Kosovo and to regulate the status of those in their host country until 
conditions in Kosovo permit their safe return.
