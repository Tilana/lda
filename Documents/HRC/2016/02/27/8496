<p>5. In her introductory statement, the head of the delegation indicated that Nepal 
considers the UPR as an important process of discussing achievements, identifying 
constraints and challenges, and sharing best practices. 
</p>
<p>6. Nepali democratic history has been characterized by struggles and immense 
sacrifices by the people of Nepal. The peaceful People&#8217;s Movement of 2006 was decisive in 
reinstating democratic values, norms and institutions, unequivocally expressing people&#8217;s 
aspiration for peace, security and democracy.  
</p>
<p>7. The 2006 Comprehensive Peace Accord, which formally ended the armed conflict 
paved the way for the establishment of the universally accepted human rights, a multiparty 
competitive democratic system, rule of law, constitutional checks and balances and 
independent judiciary. The most defining feature was the election of the Constituent 
Assembly in 2008, which is fully reflective of Nepal&#8217;s social diversity for the first time in 
its history. It  performs the dual functions of writing a constitution and acting as legislature 
parliament.  
</p>
<p>8. It has been a long standing policy of Nepal to remain constructively engaged with 
the international community, since it joined the United Nations in 1955.

Commissioner for Human Rights, including its country office, the United Nations treaty

judiciary have stood exemplary in promoting and protecting human rights through various 
judgments. 
</p>
<p>12. The National Human Rights Commission is a constitutional body with full 
autonomy. The National Foundation for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities, 
National Women&#8217;s Commission and National Dalit Commission are also national human 
rights institutions established for the promotion and protection of the human rights of 
indigenous people, women and Dalit, respectively.   
</p>
<p>13. The delegation referred to several policies and action plans to provide non-
discriminatory and decent work opportunities; as well as policies to forge participation, 
protection and promotion of women in conflict resolution and other activities. It also 
referred to policies to address the issue of trafficking in persons and to promote the rights of 
persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>14. Despite not being a party to the 1951 Convention of the Status of Refugees and 1967 
Protocol, Nepal indicated that it has been providing shelter to over 100,000   Bhutanese 
refugees on humanitarian grounds. It expressed appreciation to the Core Group of countries 
that have generously offered  third country resettlement programme for refugees.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation indicated that one of the important achievements made in the peace 
process has been the release and reintegration of child soldiers, and thanked the 
international community including the United Nations for their goodwill and cooperation in 
this regard. 
</p>
<p>16. Nepal is committed to the protection and promotion of rights of the indigenous 
nationalities, Dalit and marginalized groups. Nepal referred to significant achievements in 
social development in recent years despite having emerged from over a decade-long armed 
conflict.   
</p>
<p>17. There has been tremendous awareness-raising of people across the country and 
people speak freely and without fear about their rights. A free and responsible media has 
remained engrained in democratic movements of Nepal.   
</p>
<p>18. At a time when Nepal is engaged in building national democratic institutions and 
developing institutional frameworks for human rights, the rule of law, and constitutionalism 
to address the remnants of the conflict period, the delegation looked forward to a candid 
and constructive interaction and contributions to Nepal's UPR.

particularly the Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, and the Palermo Protocols. 
</p>
<p>48. Regarding treaty-related issues, Nepal indicated that it believes that becoming a 
party to international instruments is also an opportunity to make the required legal and 
institutional reforms. Ensuring effective implementation of an international treaty is as 
important as ratifying it. Nepal reiterated that it would further undertake international treaty 
commitments as and when so required, taking into account the available requisite 
infrastructures and enabling environment, as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>49. Regarding cooperation with United Nations mechanisms, Nepal indicated that

and institutional measures. Nepal remains open to visits of mandate-holders, but indicated 
that, as the international community is well aware, Nepal is currently heavily occupied with 
the daunting task of institutionalizing peace and framing a new constitution. Nepal would 
welcome visits of mandate-holders at an appropriate earliest time.  
</p>
<p>50. Nepal is engaged in drafting a democratic Constitution that is inclusive and that 
guarantees all human rights. The Constitutional Committee and other thematic committees 
have already submitted their report to the chairman of the Constitutional Assembly. Some 
of the remaining issues are of a highly sensitive nature but it is expected that national 
consensus will be instrumental.  </p>


<p>51. Nepal indicated that it is fully committed to establishing Constitutional supremacy, 
ensuring the rule of law, good governance and human rights, as well as providing a positive 
conclusion to the peace process by eliminating insecurity and addressing impunity. 
Addressing impunity entails addressing the past and maintaining the rule of law at present.  
Nepal is fully committed to work on both fronts.

in the Parliament for the establishment of Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the 
Commission of Inquiry of the Disappeared.  
</p>
<p>53. Strong security and law enforcement measures are prerequisites to ending impunity. 
The Special Programme for Effectiveness of Peace and Security, the End to Impunity and 
Defending Human Rights, accompanied by a code of conduct that aims at protecting human 
rights and improving law and order situation has been implemented since 2009. 
</p>
<p>54. Regarding questions on the National Human Rights Commission, the delegation 
indicated that it is an autonomous institution by all standards, including financially. The 
selection of the administrative personnel is done through a competitive processes run by the 
Public Service Commission. The NHRC can appoint its Experts. The Chairman and 
Members of the Commission are appointed through the Constitutional Council. The 
Constitutional Council has balanced representation of the Executive, Legislative and 
Judiciary, including the Leader of the opposition in the Parliament. The representative of 
the Executive has one vote. Questions have been raised regarding the compliance with the 
Paris Principles on the basis of a draft law. The existing law is fully compliant with the 
Paris Principles. The delegation considers that it is premature to question the efficacy of the 
institution on the basis of a draft law that is still under consideration. 
</p>
<p>55. Regarding the advance questions on refugees and stateless persons, despite not being 
a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, 
Nepal has hosted over 100,000 refugees from Bhutan on humanitarian grounds. Nepal has 
honored the rights of the refugees and anyone living in Nepal has to respect the law of the 
land.  
</p>
<p>56. Regarding armed groups, the Government is in dialogue with various dissenting 
groups that are of a political nature. Agreements on peaceful settlements of disputes have

between political elements and criminal ones. To the latter, the Government responds

</p>
<p>89. Responding to additional questions and comments, the delegation reiterated that the 
Truth and Reconciliation Bill and the Disappearance Bill have been submitted to the 
Parliament. It clearly stated that these bills do not provide amnesty in serious violations of 
human rights and indicated that the government remains committed to have them cleared as 
expeditiously as possible. 
</p>
<p>90. The security agencies, including the Nepal Army, are fully committed to respect and 
support the protection of human rights and international humanitarian law. The isolated and 
unintended incidents of human rights and humanitarian law violations, if any, are not 
policy-driven. The institution strictly observes a zero-tolerance policy against all kinds of 
human rights violations. The Nepal Army is a disciplined and professional institution. It is 
supportive of democratic transformation. 
</p>
<p>91. Since 2005, Nepal has put in place a vetting mechanism. A rigorous vetting process 
is  under implementation in both army and police forces while nominating their personnel 
for United Nations peacekeeping operations.  
</p>
<p>92. On the issue of Tibetan refugees, Nepal stated that it does not allow its territory to be 
used against neighbours or any country. Anyone found in violation of the immigration laws 
or other laws is dealt with according to the law of the land. There are no forceful 
deportations.  
</p>
<p>93. Nepal referred to two major remaining tasks of the peace process. On 22 January 
2011, the command and control of the Maoist combatants passed to the constitutionally 
mandated Special Committee, which is responsible for the supervision, integration and 
rehabilitation of the former combatants. This is a major step towards the conclusion of the 
peace process. On the oversight mechanisms, the Government has adopted effective 
measures. Investigating bodies and institutions established by the Nepal Army and police 
have also contributed immensely to counter impunity. The investigations conducted by 
these bodies are complementary to those of national human rights institutions, including the 
NHRC and the Women commission. Importantly, the judicial oversight provision has been 
proved to be an effective instrument in the promotion and protection of human rights.   </p>


<p>94. Nepal further reported on compensation and relief packages distributed to the 
conflict victims and family members affected.    
</p>
<p>95. The delegation further referred to several acts and regulations that protect children,  
and to child-friendly mechanisms, including at the village and district level.  
</p>
<p>96. The Constitution has several provisions against caste-based discrimination and 
untouchability. Nepal has a caste-based discrimination control and punishment bill and also 
the National Dalit Commission, to be converted as a statutory body. These two bills are in 
the Parliament.  
</p>
<p>97. Nepal is committed to the promotion of the rights of minorities, including gender 
minorities. It has pursued the policy of recognizing the identity of gender minorities and 
achieving  effective implementation of relevant laws prohibiting discrimination on any 
ground.  Any person, regardless of gender, is entitled to obtain citizenship along with an 
identity consistent with equal rights policy. 
</p>
<p>98. Regarding ILO Convention No. 169, Nepal noted that 218 of the 601 Members of 
the Constituent Assembly are indigenous people, a testimony of positive outcome of 
policies and programmes in these fields.  
</p>
<p>99. Equality has been ensured in health programmes and services. However, progress 
has been uneven. Disparities have decreased in some areas, but the geography of Nepal 
presents serious challenges to deliver health services to all.  
</p>
<p>100. In answering to other questions, the delegation noted that the Government will soon 
finalize the draft bills on civil and penal codes, sentencing act and civil and criminal 
procedure codes, which contain provisions which are directly related to the implementation 
of various human rights treaties.  
</p>
<p>101. Nepal does not tolerate any form of torture. There is no systematic torture in Nepal. 
There are sufficient constitutional and legal safeguards for the prevention of torture and a 
special bill designed to incorporate provisions of CAT is also under active consideration. 
</p>
<p>102. Nepal believes that the timely and effective implementation of  recommendations by 
the national human rights institutions is an effective mechanism to ensure protection of 
human rights and is working towards establishing a follow-up mechanism.  
</p>
<p>103. In concluding, Nepal thanked the delegations for constructive support for the 
ongoing democratic transformation and the peace process.  
</p>
<p>104. Nepal indicated that it expects enhanced level of support for its efforts in the process 
of post conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation to firmly institutionalize peacebuilding 
efforts, create a network of national democratic institutions, and expedite the socio-
economic transformation within the democratic framework to create an environment for the 
enjoyment of human rights by the people.  
</p>
<p>105. Nepal reiterated its commitment to democracy and human rights. It valued the 
goodwill and support of friends and looked forward to working together.
