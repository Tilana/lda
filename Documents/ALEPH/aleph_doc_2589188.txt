Notice Cap has been invoked. On the day on which a Carve-Out Trigger Notice is given by
the Administrative Agent to the Debtors with a copy to counsel to the Creditors’
Committee (the “Termination Declaration Date”), the Carve-Out Trigger Notice shall (i) be
deemed a draw request and notice of borrowing by the Borrowers for Loans hereunder
(on a pro rata basis based on the then outstanding Commitments hereunder), in an
amount equal to the then unpaid amounts of the Allowed Professional Fees (any such
amounts actually advanced shall constitute Loans) and (ii) also constitute a demand to the
Borrowers to utilize all cash on hand as of such date and any available cash thereafter
held by any Debtor to fund a reserve in an amount equal to the then unpaid amounts of
the Allowed Professional Fees. The Debtors shall deposit and hold such amounts in a
segregated blocked account pledged to the Administrative Agent pursuant to reasonable
and customary arrangements to pay such then unpaid Allowed Professional Fees (the
“Pre-Carve-Out Trigger Notice Reserve”) prior to any and all other claims. On the
5
Termination Declaration Date, the Carve-Out Trigger Notice shall also be deemed a
request by the Debtors for Loans hereunder (on a pro rata basis based on the then
outstanding Commitments), in an amount equal to the Post-Carve-Out Trigger Notice Cap
(any such amounts actually advanced shall constitute Loans). The Debtors shall deposit
and hold such amounts in a segregated blocked account pledged to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to reasonable and customary arrangements to pay such Allowed
Professional Fees benefiting from the Post-Carve-Out Trigger Notice Cap (the “Post-
Carve-Out Trigger Notice Reserve” and, together with the Pre-Carve-Out Trigger Notice
Reserve, the “Carve-Out Reserves”) prior to any and all other claims. On the first Business
Day after the Administrative Agent gives such notice to such Lenders, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, including with respect to the existence of a Default or
Event of Default, the failure of the Debtors to satisfy any or all of the conditions precedent
for Loans hereunder, any termination of the Commitments following an Event of Default, or
the occurrence of the Stated Maturity Date, each Lender with an outstanding Commitment
(on a pro rata basis based on the then outstanding Commitments) shall make available to
the Administrative Agent such Lender’s pro rata share with respect to such Borrowing in
accordance with the terms hereof. All funds in the Pre-Carve-Out Trigger Notice Reserve
shall be used first to pay the obligations set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of this
definition of Carve-Out set forth above (the “Pre-Carve-Out Amounts”), but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Post-Carve-Out Trigger Notice Cap, until paid in full, and then, to
the extent the Pre-Carve-Out Trigger Notice Reserve has not been reduced to zero, to pay
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, unless the Facility has been
indefeasibly paid in full in cash and all Commitments have been terminated, in which case
any such excess shall be paid to the Existing Credit Agreement Lenders in accordance
with their rights and priorities as of the Petition Date. All funds in the Post-Carve-Out
Trigger Notice Reserve shall be used first to pay the obligations set forth in clause (iv) of
this definition of Carve-Out set forth above (the “Post-Carve-Out Amounts”), and then, to
the extent the Post-Carve-Out Trigger Notice Reserve has not been reduced to zero, to pay
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, unless the Facility has been
indefeasibly paid in full in cash and all Commitments have been terminated, in which case
any such excess shall be paid to the Existing Credit Agreement Lenders in accordance
with their rights and priorities as of the Petition Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, if either of the Carve-Out Reserves is not funded in full in the amounts set
forth herein, then, any excess funds in one of the Carve-Out Reserves following the
payment of the Pre-Carve-Out Amounts and Post-Carve-Out Amounts, respectively, shall
be used to fund the other Carve-Out Reserve, up to the applicable amount set forth herein,
prior to making any payments to the Administrative Agent or the Existing Credit
Agreement Lenders, as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, following delivery of a Carve-Out Trigger
Notice, the Administrative Agent and the Existing Credit Agreement Lenders shall not
sweep or foreclose on cash (including cash received as a result of the sale or other
disposition of any assets) of the Debtors until the Carve-Out Reserves have been fully
funded, but shall have a security interest in any residual interest in the Carve-Out
Reserves, with any excess paid to the Administrative Agent for application in accordance
with the Loan Documents. Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
(i) disbursements by the Debtors from the Carve-Out Reserves shall not constitute Loans
or increase or reduce the Facility, (ii) the failure of the Carve-Out Reserves to satisfy in full
the Allowed Professional Fees shall not affect the
6
priority of the Carve-Out, and (iii) in no way shall the DIP Budget, Rolling Budget, Carve-
Out, Post-Carve-Out Trigger Notice Cap, Carve-Out Reserves, or any of the foregoing be
construed as a cap or limitation on the amount of the Allowed Professional Fees due and
payable by the Debtors. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in the Existing Credit Agreement, the Carve-Out shall be senior to all
liens and claims securing the Facility, and any and all other forms of adequate protection,
liens, or claims securing the Facility. Any payment or reimbursement made prior to the
occurrence of the Termination Declaration Date in respect of any Allowed Professional
Fees shall not reduce the Carve-Out. Any payment or reimbursement made on or after the
occurrence of the Termination Declaration Date in respect of any Allowed Professional
Fees shall permanently reduce the Carve-Out on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Any funding of
the Carve-Out shall be added to, and made a part of, the Facility secured by the Collateral
and shall be otherwise entitled to the protections granted under the order approving the
Facility, the Bankruptcy Code, and applicable law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Carve-Out shall not include, apply to or be available for
any fees or expenses incurred by any party in connection with (a) the investigation,
initiation or prosecution of any claims, causes of action, adversary proceedings or other
litigation (i) against any of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, or the Existing Credit
Agreement Lenders or the Existing Credit Agreement Agent or (ii) challenging the amount,
validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of or asserting any defense, counterclaim or
offset to, the obligations and the liens and security interests granted under the Loan
Documents or the Existing Credit Agreement Documents (whether in such capacity or
otherwise), including, in each case, without limitation, for lender liability or pursuant to
section 105, 510, 544, 547, 548, 549, 550, or 552 of the Bankruptcy Code, applicable non-
bankruptcy law or otherwise; (b) attempts to modify any of the rights granted to the
Lenders or the Administrative Agent; (c) attempts to prevent, hinder or otherwise delay
any of the Lenders’ or the Administrative Agent’s assertion, enforcement or realization
upon any Collateral in accordance with the Loan Documents and the Final Order other
than to seek a determination that an event of default has not occurred or is not continuing;
or (d) paying any amount on account of any claims arising before the commencement of
the Cases unless such payments are approved by an order of the Bankruptcy Court;
provided, however, that the Carve-Out and such collateral proceeds and loans under the
Loan Documents may be used for allowed fees and expenses, in an amount not to exceed

Committee in investigating any potential Challenges (as defined in the Interim Order)

Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the Applicable Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion
to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to

month.
(b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender of the amount (and currency) of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans,

respect thereof). If such notice is given by the Applicable Borrower, the Applicable
Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice
shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of principal shall

repayment installments thereof in such order as the Applicable Borrower may elect and
(2) if applicable, shall be accompanied by the amount specified in clause (iii) below.
Subject to Section 2.16, each prepayment shall be paid to each Lender in accordance with
its Applicable Percentage in respect of the Facility.
(ii) [Reserved].

(A) From and after the Final Order Entry Date, in the event that the Borrowers (1) prepay,
refinance, substitute or replace the Facility pursuant to Section 2.05(a), (b)(i) or
Section 2.06 in connection with or with the proceeds of another financing during the
pendency of the Cases (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any prepayment,
refinancing, substitution or replacement in connection with the incurrence of
Indebtedness at the emergence of the Debtors from the Cases) or (2) effect any
amendment, amendment and restatement or other modification of this Agreement to effect
such other financing during the pendency of the Cases, the Borrowers shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable account of each Lender, (I) in the case of clause (1), a
prepayment premium of 2.00% of the principal amount of the Loans being prepaid or
Commitments being replaced and (II) in the case of clause (2), a payment equal to 2.00% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Loans and unused Commitments outstanding
immediately prior to such amendment that have been refinanced.
(B) If any Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender and is replaced pursuant to Section 10.13 in
connection with any amendment, amendment and restatement or other modification of
this Agreement in connection with such other financing during the pendency of the
Cases, such Lender shall receive its pro rata portion (as determined immediately prior to it
being so replaced) of the prepayment premium or payment described in the preceding
clause (A).
(b) Mandatory.
(i) Debt Issuance. Within five Business Days of the receipt by any Loan Party or any
Subsidiary of any Loan Party of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Debt Issuance, the

amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds.
(ii) Dispositions and Involuntary Dispositions. The Borrower shall prepay the Loans in
accordance with clause (v) below in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash
Proceeds received by any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party from all

(g), (h), (i), (j), (l) or (m)) and Involuntary Dispositions within five Business Days of the date
of receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds in connection with such Disposition or Involuntary
Disposition; provided, further, that so long as no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Borrowers shall not be required to prepay the Loans with such Net Cash
Proceeds from all such Involuntary Dispositions in an aggregate amount for all such Net
Cash Proceeds during the term of the Facility not to exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate,
if at the election of the Borrowers (as notified by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent
on or prior to the date on which a notice of prepayment shall be required to be delivered to
the Administrative Agent pursuant to
40
clause (v) below), and to the extent such Loan Party or such Subsidiary reinvests all or
any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds in operating assets (other than current assets)
within 365 days after the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds (or, if such Loan Party or
Subsidiary shall have entered into a legally binding commitment within such 365-day
period to so apply such Net Cash Proceeds, within 180 days following such 365-day
period); provided that if such Net Cash Proceeds shall have not been so reinvested within
the applicable period, the Borrower shall immediately prepay the Loans in an aggregate
amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Borrowers
reasonably determine (as certified by a Responsible Officer of the Borrowers describing in
reasonable detail the applicable limitations) that any amounts attributable to Foreign Loan
Parties and Foreign Subsidiaries that are required to be prepaid pursuant to this Section
2.05(b)(ii) would result in material adverse tax consequences or violate local law in respect
of upstreaming proceeds (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions
and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors), then the Borrowers and their
Subsidiaries shall not be required to prepay such amounts as required under this Section
2.05(b)(ii) until such material tax consequences or local law violation no longer exists;
provided that the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries shall take commercially reasonable
actions to permit repatriation of the proceeds subject to such prepayments in order to
effect such prepayments without violating local law or incurring material adverse tax
consequences.
(iii) [Reserved].
(iv) [Reserved].
(v) Application of Prepayments. (A) Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to the provisions
of Sections 2.05(b)(i) and 2.05(b)(ii) shall be applied ratably to the Loans then outstanding,
and (B) such prepayment shall be applied to the principal repayment installments thereof
in such order as the Borrower may elect. Subject to Section 2.16, all prepayments under
this Section 2.05(b) shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable
Percentages. Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments
pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to
Eurocurrency Rate Loans in such order as the applicable Borrower may elect. All
prepayments under this Section 2.05(b) shall be subject to Section 3.05 and all
prepayments under Section 2.05(b)(i) shall be subject to Section 2.05(a)(iii), but otherwise
without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount
prepaid through the date of prepayment

any mandatory prepayment of Loans required to be made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of
this Section 2.05(b) at least two Business Days prior to the date of such prepayment. Each
such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment, provide a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount of such prepayment and state under which subsection of
Section 2.05(b) the Borrower is making such prepayment. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify each Lender of the contents of the Borrowers’ prepayment notice and of
such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the prepayment.
41
Section 2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Optional. The Parent may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate
the unused Commitments or from time to time permanently reduce the unused
Commitments; provided that (i) any such written notice shall be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of
termination or reduction and (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate
amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.
(b) Mandatory. The Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced to zero
at the end of the Availability Period.
(c) Application of Commitment Reductions; Payment of Fees. The Administrative Agent
will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the unused
Commitments under this Section 2.06. Upon any reduction of unused Commitments, the
Commitment of each Lender shall be reduced by such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of
such reduction amount. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of any
Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.
Section 2.07 Repayment of Loans.
(a) The Borrowers shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date, the aggregate principal
amount of all Loans outstanding on such date.
(b) If any principal repayment installment to be made by the Borrowers (other than
principal repayment installments on Eurocurrency Rate Loans) shall come due on a day
other than a Business Day, such principal repayment installment shall be due on the next
succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing
interest or fees, as the case may be and if any principal repayment installment to be made
by the Borrowers on a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall come due on a day other than a
Business Day, such principal repayment installment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such
principal repayment installment into another calendar month, in which event such
principal repayment installment shall be due on the immediately preceding Business Day.
Section 2.08 Interest.
(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per
annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate;
and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus
the Applicable Rate.
(b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due, whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise and an Event of Default under 8.01(a) has occurred
and is continuing as a result of such failure to pay, such amount shall thereafter bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
42
(ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by any Borrowers under any
Loan Document is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise and an Event of Default under 8.01(a) has occurred and is continuing as a result
of such failure to pay, then such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating
interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Laws.
(iii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due
interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.
(c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest
hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after
judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor
Relief Law.
(d) For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), (i) whenever a rate of interest or fee rate
hereunder is calculated on the basis of a year (the “deemed year”) that contains fewer
days than the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation, such rate of
interest or fee rate shall be expressed as a yearly rate by multiplying such rate of interest
or fee rate by the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation and dividing it
by the number of days in the deemed year, (ii) the principle of deemed reinvestment of
interest shall not apply to any interest calculation hereunder and (iii) the rates of interest
stipulated herein are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields.
Section 2.09 Fees and OID.
(a) Commitment Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage a commitment fee in Dollars
equal to 5.00% per annum times the actual daily amount by which the aggregate
Commitments (which, prior to the Final Order Entry Date, shall be limited to the amount of
aggregate Commitments representing the amount authorized by the Bankruptcy Court in
the Interim Order) exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans. The
commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any
time during which one or more of the conditions in Article 4 is not met, and shall be due
and payable monthly in arrears on the last Business Day of each month and on the last
day of the Availability Period.
(b) OID and Administrative Agent Fees.
(i) The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for its own account, in Dollars, fees
in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned
when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
(ii) The Borrowers shall pay for the account of each Lender an original issue discount
equal to (x) on the Effective Date, 2.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Loans
authorized by the Bankruptcy Court in the Interim Order and (y) on the Final Order Entry
Date, 2.00% of (A) the aggregate amount of the Commitments as of the Final Order Entry
Date less (B) the aggregate principal amount of Loans authorized by the Bankruptcy Court
in the Interim Order, as applicable, which original issue discount
43
shall be earned, due and payable on such dates and calculated by multiplying 2.00% by
each Lender’s ratable share, determined in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, of
the aggregate principal amount of Loans authorized by the Bankruptcy Court in the
Interim Order or (A) aggregate amount of Commitments as of the Final Order Entry Date
less (B) the aggregate principal amount of Loans authorized by the Bankruptcy Court in
the Interim Order, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no applicable original
issue discount shall reduce the amount of Obligations.
Section 2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) All computations of interest for Base
Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Eurocurrency
Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the
basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as
applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall
accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a
Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid,
provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent
of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.
Section 2.11 Evidence of Debt. (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be
evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent
manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to each
Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in
doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers
hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any
conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts
and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and
records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon
the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, each Borrower shall
execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) Notes, which shall
evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may
attach schedules to its Notes and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount,
currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
(b) In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such
matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence
of manifest error.
Section 2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.
(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made free and clear of, and
without condition or deduction for, any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. All
payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative
Agent’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the
date specified
44
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may
require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. The
Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in
respect of the Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in
like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments
received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next
succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
Subject to Section 2.07(a) or as otherwise specifically provided for herein, if any payment
to be made by any Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment
shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be
reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date
of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans, prior to 11:00 a.m. on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on
such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate
Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the
time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available
to the Applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in
fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then
the applicable Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to
Applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds
Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar
fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing,
and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by any Borrower, the interest rate applicable
to Base Rate Loans. If a Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the
Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower
for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan
included in such Borrowing. Any payment by any Borrower shall be without prejudice to
any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such
payment to the Administrative Agent.
(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Applicable Borrower prior to the
time at which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Lenders hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative
Agent may assume that the Applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in
accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Lenders, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Applicable Borrower
has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, as the case may be,
severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
45
the amount so distributed to such Lender, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any Borrower with respect to any
amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the
Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the
foregoing provisions of this Article 2, and such funds are not made available to the
Applicable Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article 4 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received
from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The
failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on
any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding
obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).
(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the
funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by
any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place
or manner.
(f) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Borrowing
shall be made from the Lenders, each payment of fees under Section 2.09 shall be made
for account of the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the
Commitments shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata
according to the amounts of their respective Commitments and Loans; (ii) each Borrowing
shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their
respective Commitments or their respective Loans that are to be included in such
Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or
prepayment of principal of Loans by any Borrower shall be made for account of the
Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans
held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Loans by any Borrower shall be made
for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such
Loans then due and payable to the respective Lenders.
(g) Insufficient Funds. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due
hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, toward payment of interest and fees then
due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts
of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal
then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of principal then due to such parties.
46
Section 2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right
of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in
respect of the Facility due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of
(i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the
aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facility due and payable to all
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on
account of the Obligations in respect of the Facility due and payable to all Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders
at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of the Facility owing (but not due and payable) to
such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its
ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but
not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the
Obligations in respect of the Facility owing (but not due and payable) in respect of the
Facility to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of
payment on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the
Lenders at such time then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (x) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (y) purchase (for cash at face value) participations
in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable,
so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the Facility then due
and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case
may be, provided that:
(1) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(2) the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment
made by or on behalf of any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a
Defaulting Lender) or (B) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant,
other than an assignment to any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to
which the provisions of this Section 2.13 shall apply).
Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such
Borrower in the amount of such participation.
47
Section 2.14 Priority and Liens; No Discharge.
(a) Each of the Loan Parties hereby covenants and agrees that upon the entry of an
Interim Order (and when applicable, the Final Order) its obligations hereunder and under

secured by a valid, binding, continuing, enforceable perfected first priority senior priming

“Primed Liens”) which secure the Existing Credit Agreement, all of which Primed Liens
shall be primed by and made subject and subordinate to the perfected first priority senior
Liens to be granted to the Administrative Agent, which senior priming Liens in favor of the
Administrative Agent shall also prime any Liens granted after the commencement of the
Cases to provide adequate protection Liens in respect of any of the Primed Liens under
clauses (1) through (4) above, subject in each case to the Carve-Out and as set forth in the
Orders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, excluded from the foregoing grant of Lien is any
right, title and interest of any Loan Party in and to any (i) Real Property improved by a
Building or Manufactured (Mobile) Home and no such property shall be “Collateral”

Mortgage, assignment or similar instrument.

manner by the entry of an order confirming a Reorganization Plan.

Section 2.15 Payment of Obligations.
Subject to the last paragraph of Section 8.02, upon the maturity (whether by acceleration
or otherwise) of any of the Obligations of the Loan Parties under this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to
immediate payment of such Obligations without further application to or order of the
Bankruptcy Court.
Section 2.16 Defaulting Lenders.
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer
a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(i) Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set
forth in Section 10.01.
(ii) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether
voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 8 or otherwise, and including any
amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 10.08), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the
Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by that
Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrowers may
request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in
respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required
by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by
the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit
account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund
Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders
as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender
against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to
the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against that Defaulting Lender as a
result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
sixth, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any
Loans in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share
and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were
satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of owed to, all
non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any
Loans of that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or
payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a
Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.16(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and
redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
51
(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent agree in writing
in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as
of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth
therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding
Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may
determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the
Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, whereupon that Lender will
cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively
with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that
Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise
expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to
Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from
that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
Section 2.17 Designated Lenders. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender at its
option may make any Credit Extension or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder
through any Lending Office (each, a “Designated Lender”); provided that any exercise of
such option shall not affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay any Credit Extension
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any Designated Lender shall be
considered a Lender; provided, further, that in the case of an Affiliate or branch of a
Lender, all provisions applicable to a Lender shall apply to such Affiliate or branch of such
Lender to the same extent as such Lender.
ARTICLE 3
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
Section 3.01 Taxes.
(a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.
(i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder
or under any other Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for
any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If applicable Laws (as determined in the
good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent) require the deduction or withholding of
any Taxes from any such payment by the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party, then the
Administrative Agent or such Loan Party shall be entitled to make such deductions or
withholding.
(ii) If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold
or deduct any Taxes, including both United States federal backup withholding and
withholding Taxes, from any payment, then (A) the applicable Loan Party or the
Administrative Agent, whichever is required by law, shall withhold or make such
deductions as are determined, including based upon any information and documentation
received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the applicable Loan Party or the
Administrative Agent, whichever is required by law, shall timely pay the full amount
withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
52
the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be
increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required
deductions (including withholdings or deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(iii) If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws
other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such
Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make
such deductions as are determined, including based upon the information and
documentation received pursuant to subsection (e) below and applicable Law, (B) such
Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely
pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is
made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable
Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the
making of all required deductions (including withholdings or deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction
been made.
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by a Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of subsection
(a) above, each Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable Laws, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely
reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(c) Tax Indemnifications.
(i) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above:
(A) Each Loan Party shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally, indemnify each
Recipient and shall make payment in respect thereof within 20 days after demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted
from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
(B) A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability, and the basis for
calculation thereof delivered to any Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
53
(C) Each of the Loan Parties shall also, and hereby jointly and severally agrees to,
indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10
days after demand thereof, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay
indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below.
Upon a Borrower’s written request, and provided that the applicable Lender is then a party
to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to set
off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender, as the case may be,
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the
Administrative Agent from such Lender under clause (ii) of this subsection; provided,
however, that the Administrative Agent’s seeking of such set off shall not be a condition to
the Administrative Agent’s indemnification under the immediately preceding sentence,
and the Administrative Agent’s seeking of such set off, or its failure or delay in seeking
such set off, shall not constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent’s right to
indemnification under the immediately preceding sentence. If the Applicable Borrower has
paid an amount to the Administrative Agent pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (i)
(C), any set off with respect to such amount shall be for the benefit of the Applicable
Borrower.
(ii) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender shall, and
does hereby, severally indemnify and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10
days after demand therefor, (A) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes
attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already
indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the
obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (B) the Administrative Agent against any Taxes
attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d)
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (C) the Administrative Agent
against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or
paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect to, whether or not such Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby
authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time
owing to such Lender, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any
amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).
(d) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by any Borrower, Lender or the Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party or the
Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01, the
applicable Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent
shall deliver to such Borrower or Lender, as the case may be, the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a
copy of any return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to such Borrower, Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be.
54
(e) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with
respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the applicable
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the
applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed
documentation reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative
Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of
withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower
or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by
applicable Law or reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative
Agent as will enable the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine
whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences,
the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such
documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s
reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such
Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the
legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A) Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, on or before the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of a Borrower or
the Administrative Agent), two executed copies of IRS Form W-9, or any subsequent
versions thereof or successors thereto, certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S.
federal backup withholding tax;
(B) each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent
on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers
or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so),
whichever of the following is applicable:
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming benefits of an income tax treaty to which the
United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document,
two executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or any subsequent
versions thereof or successors thereto, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of,
U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and
(y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-
8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto,
establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to
the “business profits” or “other income” article of such treaty,
55
(2) two executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or
successors thereto,
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio
interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of any applicable
Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled
foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate”) and (y) two executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-
8BEN-E, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, or
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, two executed copies of IRS
Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E,
a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS
Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect
partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such
Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C) any such Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the
U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such numbers as shall be requested by
the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender
under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed
by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal
withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as
may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative
Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) If a payment made to a Lender hereunder or under any Loan Document would be
subject to United States Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were
to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those
contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall
deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by
Law and at such
56
time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, such
documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)
(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the
Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers or the
Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such
Lender has complied with its obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to
deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for the purposes of this clause (iii),
“FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(iii) Each Lender agree that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to
this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update
such form or certification or promptly notify such Borrowers and the Administrative Agent
in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in
good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has
been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.01 (including by the payment of additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount
equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional
amounts paid, under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise
to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such indemnified party and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect
to such refund), provided that such indemnifying party, upon the request of such
indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to
this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
subsection, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an
indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the
indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position the indemnified party would
have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not
been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or
additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall
not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any
other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party
or any other Person.
(g) Survival of Section 3.01. Each party’s obligations in this Section 3.01 shall survive the
resignation and/or the replacement of the Administrative Agent, and any assignment of its
rights by, or the replacement of a Lender, the termination of the aggregate Commitments
and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
Section 3.02 Illegality.
(a) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental
Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending
57
Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the
Eurocurrency Rate or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency
Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of
such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the applicable interbank
market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrowers through the
Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be
suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or
maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the
Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate
Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the
Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base
Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers
that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of
such notice, (i) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of
such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such
Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative
Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on
the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may
not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (ii) if such notice
asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the
Eurocurrency Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension
compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency
Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such
Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates
based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the
Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
(b) If, in any applicable jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent or any applicable Lender
determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has
asserted that it is unlawful, for the Administrative Agent or any Lender to (i) perform any of
its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (ii) to fund or maintain its
participation in any Loan or (iii) issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect
to any Credit Extension to any Borrower who is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
other than the United States, a State thereof or the District of Columbia such Person shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent, then, upon the Administrative Agent notifying
the Parent, and until such notice by such Person is revoked, any obligation of such
Person to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit
Extension shall be suspended, and to the extent required by applicable Law, cancelled.
Upon receipt of such notice, the Loan Parties shall, (A) repay that Person’s participation in
the Loans or other applicable Obligations on the last day of the Interest Period for each
Loan or other Obligation occurring after the Administrative Agent has notified the Parent
or, if earlier, the date specified by such Person in the notice delivered to the Administrative
Agent (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by
applicable Law) and (B) take all reasonable actions requested by such Person to mitigate
or avoid such illegality.
58
Section 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency
Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits are not being
offered to banks in the applicable interbank market for the applicable amount and Interest
Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist
for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a
proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base
Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a
proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the
Borrowers and each Lender. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lenders to make or
maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) in the event of a
determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate
component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in
determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative
Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt
of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a conversion to or
continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted
such request into a request for conversion into Base Rate Loans in the amount specified
therein.
Section 3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan,
insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement
contemplated by Section 3.04(e));
(ii) subject any Lender to any Tax (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described
in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income
Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or
its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii) impose on any Lender or the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or
expense affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of
making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is
determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make
any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request
of such Lender, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
59
(b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such
Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any,
regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender
or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such
Lender, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may
be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Borrowers
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender, as the
case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business Days
after receipt thereof.
(d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrowers shall not
be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to
the date that such Lender, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation
therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(e) Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. The Borrowers shall pay to each Lender, as
long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or
assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as
“Eurocurrency liabilities”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each
Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan
by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be
conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on
such Loan, provided the Borrowers shall have received at least 10 Business Days’ prior
notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such
Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 Business Days prior to the relevant Interest
Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 Business Days from
receipt of such notice.
Section 3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrowers shall promptly compensate such
Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it
as a result of:
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Eurocurrency Rate Loan
on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary,
mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
60
(b) any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make
a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Eurocurrency Rate Loan on the date or
in the amount notified by such Borrower;
(c) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by any Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;
or
(d) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan on its scheduled due date;
including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the
liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the
performance of any foreign exchange contract (but excluding any loss of anticipated
profits). The Borrowers shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such
Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrowers to the Lenders under this
Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan
made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other
borrowing in the applicable interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount
and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so
funded.
Section 3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount or indemnity
payment to any Lender, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then, at
the request of the Borrowers, such Lender shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to
designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates,
if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or
reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the
future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and
(ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender, to any unreimbursed cost or expense
and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrowers hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection
with any such designation or assignment.
(b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if
any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount or indemnity payment to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
3.01, and in each case such Lender is unable to designate a different lending office in
accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrowers may replace such Lender in accordance
with Section 10.13.
Section 3.07 Survival. All of the Borrowers’ obligations under this Article 3 shall survive
termination of the aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder,
and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

lapse of time or both would be a default) under any of the Loan Parties’ or their respective
subsidiaries’ debt instruments and other material agreements which, in the case of the

(m) No Default shall exist, or would result from the effectiveness of this Agreement or from
the other Transactions contemplated herein.

65
(o) The Effective Date shall be on or prior to a date that is no later than July 29, 2016 (or
such later date as the Required Lenders may agree).
Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 9.03(e), for purposes of
determining compliance with the conditions specified in this Section 4.01, each Lender
that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or
accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed
Effective Date specifying its objection thereto.

the extent required under this Agreement, (A) creation and perfection of a Lien on
Collateral that may be perfected solely by the filing of a financing statement under the
UCC, the PPSA (or similar provisions of foreign law) or filings with the United States Patent
and Trademark Office or United States Copyright Office or Canadian Intellectual Property

with stock (or similar) powers endorsed in blank with respect to which a Lien may be
perfected on the Effective Date by the delivery of a stock (or similar) certificate; provided
that the foregoing shall be deemed to be satisfied to the extent such certificates or
instruments in existence on the Effective Date have been delivered to the Administrative
Agent under the Existing Credit Agreement), then the provision of any such Lien search
and/or the provision and/or perfection of a security interest in such Collateral shall not
constitute a condition precedent to the Effective Date but may instead be delivered and
perfected within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date (or such later date as the
Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion). The failure of any Loan Party
to satisfy the conditions set forth in this paragraph on or prior to the date that is sixty
(60) days after the Effective Date (or such later date or time as the Administrative Agent
may agree in its reasonable discretion) shall constitute an Event of Default hereunder.
Section 4.02 Conditions to All Credit Extensions. The obligation of each Lender to honor
any Request for Credit Extension (other than a Loan Notice requesting only a conversion
of Loans to the other Type, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans), is subject to

discretion), (B) the Canadian Recognition Order shall have been entered by the Canadian
Court no later than ten (10) days following the Petition Date and (C) at the time of such
Borrowing the Final Order and Canadian Recognition Order shall be in full force and effect,
and shall not have been vacated or reversed, shall not be subject to a stay, and shall not
have been modified or amended in any respect without the prior written consent of the
Required Lenders; and (iii) if either the Interim Order, the Final Order, the Canadian
Recognition Order is the subject of a pending appeal in any respect, neither the making of
the Loans nor the performance by any Loan Party of any of their respective obligations
under any of the Loan Documents shall be the subject of a presently effective stay
pending appeal.
(c) With respect to any Credit Extensions on or after the Final Order Entry Date, (x) all
material “second day orders” intended to be entered on or prior to the date of entry of the
Final Order, including a final cash management order and any order establishing

and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and
correct in all material respects (without duplication of any materiality qualifier contained
herein or therein) as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 4.02,
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.05(a), 5.05(b) and 5.05(c) shall
be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to Section 6.01(a)
and Section 6.01(b), respectively, and to the financial condition and results of operations
of the Parent and its Subsidiaries.
(e) No Default shall exist, or would result from such proposed Credit Extension or from the

conditions specified in Sections 4.02(d) and (e) have been satisfied on and as of the date
of the applicable Credit Extension.

69

to Section 6.01(c) were prepared in good faith on the basis of the assumptions stated
therein, which assumptions were fair in light of the conditions existing at the time of
delivery of such forecasts, and represented, at the time of delivery, Parent’s best estimate

under or with respect to, or a party to, any Contractual Obligation (other than such
violations arising as a result of the commencement of the Cases and except as otherwise

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is
continuing or would result from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in writing to the
Administrative Agent, no “building” or “mobile home” (in each case, as such terms are
defined for purposes of the NFIP) exists on any real property which constitutes Collateral.
Section 5.09 Environmental Compliance.
(a) There are no Environmental Liabilities applicable to the Loan Parties, their respective
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations or properties that could,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Material Adverse Effect, no Hazardous Materials have been Released or are otherwise
present on any property currently or, to the knowledge of the Loan Parties, formerly

potentially
70
responsible parties, any investigation or assessment or remedial or response action

operation, either voluntarily or pursuant to the order of any Governmental Authority or the
requirements of any Environmental Law, except for any investigations, assessments or
remedial or response actions that could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the actual knowledge of the Loan
Parties, none of the respective properties currently owned, leased or operated by any
Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries is adjacent to any property listed or proposed for
listing on the NPL or any analogous state list, except as could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
all Hazardous Materials generated, used, treated, handled or stored at, or transported to or
from, any property currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by any Loan Party or
any of its Subsidiaries have been used, handled, stored or disposed of in accordance with
the requirements of all Environmental Laws.
(c) Except (i) as in accordance in all material respects with the requirements of all
Environmental Laws or (ii) as could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect, there are no underground or above ground
storage tanks or any surface impoundments, septic tanks, pits, sumps or lagoons in
which Hazardous Materials are being or have been treated, stored or disposed on any
property currently owned, leased or operated by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

this Agreement or delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document (in each case

misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided that, with respect to projected financial information, the Borrowers represent
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed
to be reasonable at the time, recognizing that there are industry-wide risks normally
associated with the types of business conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries, and the
Borrowers do not warrant that such projections and estimates will ultimately prove to have
been accurate.

have a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 5.18 [Reserved].

ARTICLE 9
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Section 9.01 Appointment and Authority. (a) Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably
appoints, designates and authorizes Cortland to act on its behalf as the Administrative
Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article are solely for
the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither any Borrower nor any
other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It
is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan
Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under
agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market
custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
contracting parties.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall also act as the “collateral agent” under the Loan
Documents, and each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender for purposes of acquiring,
holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to
secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably
incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and
any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to Section 9.05 for
105
purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof)
granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies
thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent, shall be entitled to the benefits of
all provisions of this Article 9 and Article 10 (including Section 10.04(c), as though such
co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the “collateral agent” under the Loan
Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.
Section 9.02 Rights as a Lender. If the Person serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder is also a Lender hereunder, then such Person shall have the same rights and
powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall,
unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the
Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act
as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust, financial, advisory, underwriting or other business with any Loan
Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the
Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders
or to provide notice to or consent of the Lenders with respect thereto.
Section 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties
or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents,
and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing:
(a) the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties shall not be subject to any fiduciary or
other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;
(b) the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and
powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly
provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative
Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its
counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan
Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be
in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a
forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any
Debtor Relief Law;
(c) the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties shall not, except as expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and
shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to any Loan Party or
any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person
serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity;
106
(d) the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties shall not be liable for any action taken
or not taken by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the
consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of
the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good
faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02)
or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and
until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the
Parent or a Lender;
(e) the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties shall not be responsible for or have
any duty or obligation to any Lender or participant or any other Person to ascertain or
inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith,
(iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or
conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document
or any other agreement, instrument or document, or the creation, perfection or priority of
any Lien purported to be created by the Collateral Documents, (v) the value or the
sufficiency of any Collateral, or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or
elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered
to the Administrative Agent; and
(f) the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any
duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof
relating to Disqualified Institutions; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent shall not (i) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to
whether any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified
Institution or (ii) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or
participation of Loans, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified
Institution.
Section 9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled
to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for
relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement,
instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or
intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by
it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall
not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition
hereunder to the making of a Loan, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of
a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to
such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary
from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent accountants
and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by
it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. For
107
purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01, each
Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved
or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to
be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed
Effective Date specifying its objections.
Section 9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document
by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The
exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their
respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facility provided for
herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that
a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that
the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in
the selection of such sub-agents.
Section 9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent.
(a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders
and Parent. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right, in consultation with Parent, to appoint a successor. If no such successor
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its
resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the
“Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting
the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such
resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation
Effective Date.
(b) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring
Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a
successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments
or other amounts then owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time,
if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for
above in this Section 9.06. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested
with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent
(other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments
or other amounts owed to the retiring Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective
Date), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
obligations
108
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as
provided above in this Section 9.06). The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless
otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring
Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the
provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring
Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
Section 9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision
to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently
and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their
Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time
deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under
or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
Section 9.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none
of the titles listed on the cover page hereof shall confer any powers, duties or
responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except with
respect to any Person in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or a
Lender hereunder.
Section 9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any
Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan
shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any
Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise:
(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and
unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to
file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due
the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09, and 10.04) allowed in such
judicial proceeding; and
(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such
claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee,
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby
authorized by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the
event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly
to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and
its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under
Sections 2.09 and 10.04.
109
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the
rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of
any Lender or in any such proceeding.
The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the
direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations
(including accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the
Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner
purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of
the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Code of the United States, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy
Code of the United States, any other Debtor Relief Laws, or any similar Laws in any other
jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, (b) at any other sale or foreclosure or
acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the
direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in
accordance with any applicable Law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase,
the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid
on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims
receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that would vest
upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of
the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) in the asset or
assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests or debt instruments of the acquisition
vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase). In connection with any
such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition
vehicles to make a bid, (ii) to adopt documents providing for the governance of the
acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with
respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or
Equity Interests thereof shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by the vote of the
Required Lenders, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving
effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 10.01),
(iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to assign the relevant Obligations to any
such acquisition vehicle pro rata by the Lenders, as a result of which each of the Lenders
shall be deemed to have received a pro rata portion of any Equity Interests and/or debt
instruments issued by such an acquisition vehicle on account of the assignment of the
Obligations to be credit bid, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition
vehicle to take any further action, and (iv) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned
to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of
another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the
acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of debt credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or
otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata and
the Equity Interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account
of the Obligations that had been assigned to the acquisition vehicle shall automatically be
cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any
further action.
110
Section 9.10 Collateral and Guaranty Matters.
(a) Each of the Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in
its discretion,
(i) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent
under any Loan Document (i) upon termination of the aggregate Commitments and
indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Obligations (other than contingent
indemnification obligations) (such event, the “Facility Termination Date”), (ii) that is sold or
otherwise disposed of or to be sold or otherwise disposed of as part of or in connection
with any sale or other disposal permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document,
(iii) in the event that such property is no longer required to be pledged pursuant to Section
6.12 hereof or any provision of any other Loan Document or (iv) if approved, authorized or
ratified in writing by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 10.01;
(ii) to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty if such Person ceases
to be a Subsidiary as a result of a transaction permitted hereunder or such Person is no
longer required to be a Guarantor pursuant to Section 6.12 hereof or any provision of any
other Loan Document; and
(iii) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative
Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is
permitted by Section 7.01(i).
Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm
in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in
particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations
under the Guaranty pursuant to this Section 9.10. In each case as specified in this Section
9.10, the Administrative Agent will, at the Borrowers’ expense, execute and deliver to the
applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to
evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest
granted under the Collateral Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to
release such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.10.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or
inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability
of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent’s Lien
thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall
the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor
or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
(b) If as a result of any transaction not prohibited by this Agreement any Guarantor
becomes an Excluded Subsidiary or is otherwise no longer required to be a Guarantor
pursuant to Section 6.12 hereof or any provision of any other Loan Document, then such
Guarantor’s Guarantee shall be automatically released. If as a result of any transaction not
prohibited by this
111
Agreement the property of (including Equity Interests held by) any Person is no longer
required to be pledged pursuant to Section 6.12 hereof or any provision of any other Loan
Document, then the security interest of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
Parties therein shall be automatically released. In connection with any termination or
release pursuant to this Section 9.10(b), the Administrative Agent and any applicable
Lender shall promptly execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan Party’s
expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such
termination or release. Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section
9.10(b) shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent or any Lender.
ARTICLE 10
MISCELLANEOUS
Section 10.01 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by any
Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall be effective unless in writing signed by

Lenders) and the applicable Borrower or the applicable Loan Party, as the case may be,
and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given;

terminated pursuant to Section 8.02) without the written consent of such Lender (it being

increase in Commitments of any Lender);
(d) postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for (i) any
payment (excluding mandatory prepayments) of principal, interest, fees or other amounts
due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under such other Loan Document

reduction of the Facility hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the written
consent of each Lender;
(e) (i) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any Loan, or any

the Default Rate;
(f) change (i) Section 8.03 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments

consent of each Lender directly affected thereby or (iii) modify the sharing provisions of
Section 2.13 without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;
(g) change any provision of this Section 10.01 or the definition of “Required Lenders” or

each Lender, except to the extent the release of any Subsidiary from the Guaranty is
permitted pursuant to Section 9.10 (in which case such release may be made by the
Administrative Agent acting alone); or
(j) release any Borrower or permit any Borrower to assign or transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents without the consent of
each Lender; and provided, further, that
(i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties
of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; and
(ii) the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing
executed only by the parties thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A) no Defaulting Lender shall have any
right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any
amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or
each affected Lender, or all Lenders, may be effected with the consent of the applicable
Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (1) the Commitment of any Defaulting
Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (2) any
waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected
Lender, or all Lenders, that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender disproportionately
adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting
Lender; and (B) each Lender is entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy
reorganization plan that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the
provisions of Section 1126(c) of Title 11 of the United States Code supersedes the
unanimous consent provisions set forth herein.
113
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrative Agent may, with the
prior written consent of the Parent only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents to cure any ambiguity, mistake, defect or inconsistency.
If any Lender becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, the Parent may replace such Non-
Consenting Lender in accordance with Section 10.13; provided that such amendment,
waiver, consent or release can be effected as a result of the assignment contemplated by
such Section (together with all other such assignments required by the Parent to be made
pursuant to this paragraph).
Section 10.02 Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communications. (a) Notices Generally.

(b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic
communication (including e-mail, FPML messaging and Internet or intranet websites)
pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article 2 if such Lender has
notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such
Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or any Borrower may each,
in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by
electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided that approval
of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications.
114
Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other

receipt of an acknowledgment from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt
requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement) and

deemed received by the intended recipient upon the sender’s receipt of an
acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested”
function, as available, return e-mail address or other written acknowledgement) indicating
that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address
therefor; provided that for both clauses (i) and (ii), if such notice or other communication is
not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice, email or
communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next
Business Day for the recipient.
(c) The Platform. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” THE
AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR
COMPLETENESS OF THE PARENT MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE
PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS
FROM THE PARENT MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM
FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH THE PARENT MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the
Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “Agent Parties”) have
any liability to any Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any
Borrower’s, any Loan Party’s or the Administrative Agent’s transmission of Parent
Materials or notices through the Platform, any other electronic platform or electronic
messaging service, or through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a
final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any
Agent Party have any liability to any Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for
indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages). The Parent acknowledges and agrees that the DQ List shall be deemed
suitable for posting and may be posted by the Administrative Agent on the Platform,
including the portion of the Platform that is designated for “public side” Lenders.
(d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent may
change its address, fax number or telephone number or electronic mail address for
notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. Each
other Lender may change its address, fax number or telephone number or electronic mail
address for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrowers and
the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative
Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an
effective address, contact name, telephone number, fax number and electronic mail
address to which notices and other communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire
instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least
one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected
115
the “Private Side Information” or similar designation on the content declaration screen of
the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with
such Public Lender’s compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United States
Federal and state securities Laws, to make reference to Parent Materials that are not made
available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that may
contain material non-public information with respect to the Parent or its securities for
purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.
(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and the
Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Loan
Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of any Borrower even if (i) such notices were
not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed
by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the
recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Loan Parties shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses,
costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice
purportedly given by or on behalf of a Loan Party. All telephonic notices to and other
telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the
Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.
Section 10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement. No failure by any Lender or
the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The
rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other
Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and
privileges provided by law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan
Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in,
and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be
instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with
Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided, however, that the foregoing shall
not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and
remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents, (b) [reserved], (c) any Lender from exercising setoff
rights in accordance with Section 10.08 (subject to the terms of Section 2.13), or (d) any
Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf
during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief
Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative
Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders
shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the
preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.13, any Lender may, with the consent of the
Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the
Required Lenders.
116
Section 10.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.
(a) Costs and Expenses. The Loan Parties shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, its Affiliates and the
Required Lenders (including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders), in
connection with the syndication of the credit facility provided for herein, the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or
thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated); provided that the Loan Parties shall not be required under this clause (i) to
pay the fees and expenses of (A) more than one principal outside counsel for each of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders, (B) more than one outside counsel acting as
regulatory counsel for each of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or (C) more than a
single local counsel for each of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in any relevant
jurisdiction as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders as the
case may be (and which may include a single local counsel acting in multiple
jurisdictions), except in, each case, to the extent there is an actual or perceived conflict of
interest between or among such parties and the party affected by such conflict informs the
Borrowers of such conflict and thereafter retains its own principal, regulatory or local
counsel and (ii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender (including the reasonable and documented fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any Lender), in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section 10.04 or
(B) in connection with Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.
(b) Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and each Lender, and each Related
Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “Indemnitee”)
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for any Indemnitee) incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any
Indemnitee by any third party or by any Borrower or any other Loan Party arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the
performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case
of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) any Loan or the use
or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release
of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned, leased or operated by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory, whether brought by a third party or by Parent or any other Loan Party or any of
Parent’s or such Loan Party’s directors, shareholders or creditors, and regardless of
whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED
BY OR
117
ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR
SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to
any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses (w) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee, (x) result from a claim brought by Parent or any other
Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if Parent or such Loan Party has obtained
a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction or (y) arise from any dispute solely among Indemnitees and not
arising out of any act or omission of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(other than any claims against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such). This
Section 10.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes, other than any Taxes that represent
losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax claims
(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Loan Parties for any reason fail to
indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 10.04 to
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of
any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or
any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata
share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity
payment is sought based on each Lender’s share of the Total Credit Exposure of all
Lenders at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount in
respect of a claim asserted by such Lender), such payment to be made severally among
them based on such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against any
Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-
agent) in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this
subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(d).
(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, no Loan Party shall assert, and each Loan Party hereby waives, and acknowledges
that no other Person shall have, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds
thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages
arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials
distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee through
telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection
with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual damages resulting from the gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final
and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
118
(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section 10.04 shall be payable not later than ten
Business Days after demand therefor.
(f) Survival. The agreements in this Section 10.04 and the indemnity provisions of Section
10.02(e) shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any
Lender, the termination of the aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all the other Obligations.
Section 10.05 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any
Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent
or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such
setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such
payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender
severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share
(without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative
Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is
made at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.
The obligations of the Lenders under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive
the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
Section 10.06 Successors and Assigns.
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
thereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except neither any
Borrower nor any other Loan Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and
each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.06(b), (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section
10.06(d), or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the
restrictions of Section 10.06(f) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any
party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall
be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in
subsection (d) of this Section 10.06 and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
119
(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment(s) and the Loans at the time
owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following
conditions:
(i) Minimum Amounts.
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s
Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a
Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be
assigned; and
(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section 10.06, the aggregate
amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding
thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the principal outstanding balance of
the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the
date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent shall not be less than $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment in
respect of the Loans, and in each case, in $1,000,000 increments in excess thereof, unless
each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, a Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an
Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a
single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group)
will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum
amount has been met. For the avoidance of doubt and for the purposes of article 1278 of
the Luxembourg civil code, notwithstanding any assignment, transfer and/or novation
permitted under and made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, any
Guarantee or security given by any Loan Party organized under the laws of Luxembourg
under any Loan Documents shall be preserved for the benefit of any assignee or
transferee of any Lender.
(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to the Loans or the Commitment
assigned.
(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the
extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section 10.06 and, in addition:
(A) the consent of a Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time
of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an
Approved Fund; provided that the Borrowers shall be deemed to have consented to any
such assignment unless they shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative
Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice thereof; and provided further
that the Borrowers’ consent shall not be required during the primary syndication of the
Facility;
120
(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of any Loan or unused
Commitment to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
Fund;
(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided that (x) in the case of
contemporaneous assignments by any Lender to one or more Approved Funds, only a
single recordation fee shall be payable for such assignments and (y) the Administrative
Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the
case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to Parent or
any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries,
(C) to any Disqualified Institution, (D) to a natural person or (E) in the case of an
assignment to a lender under the Existing Credit Agreement or any Affiliate thereof, to any
Person that itself or through its Affiliate is not a Supporting Creditor (as defined in the
Restructuring Support Agreement) under the Restructuring Support Agreement or does
not substantially simultaneously accede to the Restructuring Support Agreement as a
Supporting Creditor and, in each case, any Person who, upon becoming a Lender
hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in the foregoing
clauses (B), (C), (D) or (E).
(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights and
obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective
unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to
the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an
aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be
outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or
other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not
funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor
hereby irrevocably consent), to (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed
by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and
interest accrued thereon) and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share
of all Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the
provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a
Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
(vii) The assignee, if it is not already a Lender hereunder, shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent and the U.S. Borrower any applicable documentation required to be delivered under
this Agreement (including any Internal Revenue Service forms and other applicable
certificates, forms or documentation described in Section 3.01(e)).
121
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
subsection (c) of this Section 10.06, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 10.04 with respect to facts and
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that,
except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by
a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, each Borrower
(at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment
or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply
with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section
10.06(d).
(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrowers (and such agency being solely for Tax purposes), shall maintain at the
Administrative Agent’s Office in the United States a copy of each Assignment and
Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and
principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In
addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the
designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d) Participations.
(i) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a
Defaulting Lender, a Disqualified Institution or Parent or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the
Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall
remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section
10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participations.
122
(ii) Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,
without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other
modification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant.
Subject to subsection (e) of this Section 10.06, the Borrowers agree that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements
and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(e) (it being
understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to
the Lender who sells the participation)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.06(b); provided, that the
Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant. To the extent permitted
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it
were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as
though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters
the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest)
of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents
(the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose
all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or
any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of
credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the
extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of
credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United
States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive
absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility
for maintaining a Participant Register.
(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless (i) the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrowers’ prior written
consent or (ii) such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law
that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that
sells a participation agrees, at the Parent’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect
to any Participant.
(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall
release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(g) [reserved];
(h) Disqualified Institutions.
123
(i) No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that was a Disqualified
Institution as of the date (the “Trade Date”) on which the assigning Lender entered into a
binding agreement to sell and assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to such Person (unless the Parent has consented to such assignment in
writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such Person will not be
considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such assignment or participation).
For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that becomes a Disqualified
Institution after the applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice
pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the definition of
“Disqualified Institution”), (A) such assignee shall not retroactively be disqualified from
becoming a Lender and (B) the execution by the Parent of an Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no
longer being considered a Disqualified Institution. Any assignment or participation in
violation of this clause (h)(i) shall not be void.
(ii) The Parent shall, or shall cause, (A) a list of Disqualified Institutions and any updates
thereto from time to time to be posted (collectively, the “DQ List”) on the Platform,
including that portion of the Platform that is designated for “public side” Lenders and/or
(B) provide the DQ List to each Lender requesting the same.
Section 10.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed:
(a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates’ respective partners, directors, officers,
employees, agents, trustees, advisors and representatives (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of
such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential),
(b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over
it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners),
(c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar
legal process,
(d) to any other party hereto,
124
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this
Section 10.07, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or
Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or
prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
any Borrower and its obligations (it being understood that the DQ List may be disclosed to
any assignee or Participant, or prospective assignee or Participant, in reliance on this
clause (f)),
(g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating Parent or its
Subsidiaries or the credit facility provided hereunder or (ii) the provider of any Platform or
other electronic delivery service used by the Administrative Agent to deliver Parent
Materials or notices to the Lenders or (iii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency
in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market
identifiers with respect to the credit facility provided hereunder
(h) with the consent of the Parent or
(i) to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a
breach of this Section 10.07 or (B) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other
than the Parent. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the
existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data
collectors, similar services providers to the lending industry and service providers to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments.
For purposes of this Section 10.07, “Information” means all information received from
Parent or any Subsidiary relating to the Parent or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Parent or any
Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from the Parent or any
Subsidiary after the Effective Date, such information is clearly identified at the time of
delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section 10.07 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation
to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential
information.
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the Information
may include material non-public information concerning a Loan Party or a Subsidiary, as
the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of
material non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public information
in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities
Laws.
125
The Loan Parties consent to the publication by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of
customary advertising material relating to the transactions contemplated hereby using the
name, product photographs, logo or trademark of the Loan Parties.
Section 10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, after obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time
held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any
such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any and all of the
obligations of any Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document to such Lender or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document and although such obligations of such Loan Party may be contingent or
unmatured, secured or unsecured, or are owed to a branch, Affiliate or office of such
Lender different from the branch, Affiliate or office holding such deposit or obligated on
such indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise
any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the
Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section
2.16 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its
other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, and (b) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent
a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting
Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and their
respective Affiliates under this Section 10.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have.
Each Lender agrees to notify Parent and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such
setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application.
Section 10.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law
(including without limitation, the Criminal Code (Canada)) (the “Maximum Rate”). If the
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the
Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it
exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Applicable Borrower. In determining
whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a
Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or
premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof,
and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of
interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.
Section 10.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement and each of the
other Loan Documents may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken
126
together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents
and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof
and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written,
relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement
shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and
when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken
together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any
certificate delivered thereunder, by fax transmission or e-mail transmission (e.g. “pdf” or
“tif”) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement or
such other Loan Document or certificate. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent a
manually executed counterpart is not specifically required to be delivered under the terms
of any Loan Document, upon the request of any party, such fax transmission or e-mail
transmission shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.
Section 10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the
execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have
been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of
any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and
notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or
knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain
unpaid or unsatisfied.
Section 10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in
good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the
enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be
limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so
limited.
Section 10.13 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount or indemnity
payment to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting
Lender, then Parent may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and
the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse
(in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments
pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations
127
under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall
assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
such assignment), provided that:
(a) Parent shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in
Section 10.06(b);
(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the
outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any
amounts under Sections 2.05(a)(ii) and 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Applicable Borrower (in the
case of all other amounts);
(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment
will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and
(e) in the case of an assignment pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 10.01, the
applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or
consent.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto,
as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Parent to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative
Agent and any Affiliate thereof, and the Lenders are arm’s-length commercial transactions

ARTICLE 11
GUARANTY
Section 11.01 Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally, absolutely and
unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and not as a guaranty of collection,
prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon
acceleration, demand or otherwise and including any amounts which would become due
but for the operation of an automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law, and at all times
thereafter, of any and all existing and future Obligations, indebtedness and liabilities of
every kind, nature and character, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, voluntary or involuntary and whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees
indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, owing by any Borrower or any other
Loan Party to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors,
indorsees, transferees and assigns (the “Beneficiaries”) arising under, pursuant to, or in
connection with this Agreement or under any other Loan Document (including all
renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and, as
provided in the Loan Documents, all costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by
Administrative Agent or any Beneficiary in connection with the collection or enforcement
thereof), and whether direct or indirect (including those acquired by assumption), absolute
or contingent, due or to become due, now existing or hereafter arising, and including
obligations, liabilities, and indebtedness arising or accruing after the commencement of
any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws with respect to any Borrower or any
Guarantor or which would have arisen or accrued but for the commencement of such
proceeding and including all Obligations, liabilities and indebtedness arising from any
extensions or credit under or in connection with any Loan Document from time to time,
regardless of whether such interest and fees are allowed claims in such proceeding
(collectively, the “Guaranteed Obligations”). The Administrative Agent’s books and
records showing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be admissible in
evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon each Guarantor and
conclusive, absent manifest error, for the purpose of establishing the amount of the
Guaranteed Obligations. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity,
regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement
evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability,
perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or
circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a
defense to the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty other than the
indefeasible payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, and each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating
to any or all of the foregoing.
Section 11.02 No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments. Each Guarantor hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the terms of Section 3.01 of this Agreement shall be
binding on such Guarantor as though such Guarantor were a Borrower hereunder. Each
Guarantor shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable Law. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each
Guarantor will deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent the original or certified copy of
a receipt issued by the relevant Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy
of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The obligations of each Guarantor under this
section shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of
this Guaranty.
132
Section 11.03 Rights of Administrative Agent and Lenders. Each Guarantor consents and
agrees that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at any time and from time to
time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing
effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, increase, renew, compromise, discharge,
accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to
perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any
Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale
thereof as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their sole discretion may
determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any
manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which,
but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor.
Section 11.04 Certain Waivers. (a) Each Guarantor waives (i) any defense arising by reason
of any disability or other defense of any Borrower or any other Guarantor, or the cessation
from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of the Administrative Agent or
any Lender) of the liability of any Borrower other than due to the indefeasible payment in
full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any defense based on any claim that such
Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Borrower or
any other guarantor; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, no Guarantor’s obligations
hereunder shall exceed the aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any right
to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to proceed against any Borrower, any
Guarantor or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, proceed against or
exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the
Administrative Agent’s or any Lender’s power whatsoever; (iv) any benefit of and any right
to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender; and (v) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits
that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or
exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly waives, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments,
demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance,
protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any
kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of
acceptance of the terms set forth in this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or
incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.
(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor agrees that its
obligations under and in respect of the guarantee contained herein and any security
interest, if any, securing the Guaranteed Obligations, shall not be affected by, and shall
remain in full force and effect without regard to, and hereby waives all, rights, claims or
defenses that it might otherwise have (now or in the future) with respect to each of the
following (whether or not such Guarantor has knowledge thereof):
(i) the validity or enforceability of any Loan Document any of the Guaranteed Obligations
or any guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held
by any Beneficiary;
133
(ii) any renewal, extension or acceleration of, or any increase in the amount of the
Guaranteed Obligations, or any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of, or any
consent to departure from, the Loan Documents;
(iii) any failure or omission to assert or enforce or agreement or election not to assert or
enforce, delay in enforcement, or the stay or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of
law or otherwise, of the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right,
power or remedy (whether arising under any Loan Documents, at law, in equity or
otherwise) with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or any agreement relating thereto,
or with respect to any other guaranty of or security for the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations;
(iv) any change, reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or existence of
any Borrower or any other Guarantor or any of their Subsidiaries and any corresponding
restructuring of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(v) any settlement, compromise, release, or discharge of, or acceptance or refusal of any
offer of payment or performance with respect to, or any substitutions for, the Guaranteed
Obligations or any subordination of the Guaranteed Obligations to any other obligations;
(vi) the validity, perfection, non-perfection or lapse in perfection, priority or avoidance of
any security interest or lien, the release of any or all collateral securing, or purporting to
secure, the Guaranteed Obligations or any other impairment of such collateral;
(vii) any exercise of remedies with respect to any security for the Guaranteed Obligations
(including, without limitation, any collateral, including the Collateral securing or purporting
to secure any of the Guaranteed Obligations) at such time and in such order and in such
manner as the Administrative Agent and the Beneficiaries may decide and whether or not
such action constitutes an election of remedies and even if such action operates to impair
or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy that any
Guarantor would otherwise have and without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any
other provisions hereof, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all benefits
which might otherwise be available to such Guarantor under applicable law, including,
without limitation, California Civil Code Sections 2809, 2810, 2819, 2939, 2845, 2848, 2849,
2850, 2855, 2899 and 3433; and
(viii) any other circumstance whatsoever which may or might in any manner or to any
extent vary the risk of any Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations or which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal
discharge of the Borrower or any other Guarantor for the
134
Guaranteed Obligations, or of such Guarantor under the guarantee contained herein or of
any security interest granted by any Guarantor, whether in a bankruptcy proceeding or in
any other instance.
Section 11.05 Obligations Independent. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are
those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed
Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be
brought against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Borrower,
any other Guarantor, or any other person or entity is joined as a party.
Section 11.06 Subrogation.
(a) No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity,
reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this
Guaranty (including with respect to all “claims” (as defined in Section 101(5) of the
Bankruptcy Code)) against Borrower or any other Guarantor arising in connection with, or
any Collateral securing the Guaranteed Obligations (including rights of subrogation
(whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise)
contribution, and the like) until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable
under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and any
commitments of the Lenders or the facility provided by the Lenders with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. For purposes of the foregoing, all guarantees of
such Guarantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, other than the guarantee under
Section 11.06 hereof, will be deemed to be enforceable and payable after the guaranty
under Section 11.06 hereof. If any amounts are paid to a Guarantor in violation of the
foregoing limitation (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or
otherwise), then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and
shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders to reduce
the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. If any such
payment or distribution is made or becomes available to any Guarantor in any bankruptcy
case, receivership, or insolvency or liquidation proceeding, such payment or distribution
shall be delivered by the person making such payment or distribution directly to the
Administrative Agent, for application to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
(b) The Guarantors hereby agree, as among themselves, that if any Guarantor or any other
guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as
defined below) (but subject to the succeeding provisions of this Section 11.06(b)), to pay
to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to such Guarantor’s Pro Rata Share
(as defined below and determined, for this purpose, without reference to the properties,
assets, liabilities and debts of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of such Excess Payment
(as defined below). The payment obligation of any Guarantor to any Excess Funding
Guarantor under this Section 11.06(b) shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment
to the prior payment in full of the obligations of such Guarantor under the other provisions
of this Guaranty, and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any right or
remedy with respect to such excess except as provided in Section 11.06(a) above or in
any similar provision of any other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations. For purposes
hereof, (i) “Excess Funding Guarantor” shall mean, in respect of any obligations arising
under the other provisions of this Guaranty and any similar provisions of any other
guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations (hereafter, the “Subject Obligations”),
135
a Guarantor or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations that has paid an amount
in excess of its Pro Rata Share of the Subject Obligations; (ii) “Excess Payment” shall
mean, in respect of any Subject Obligations, the amount paid by an Excess Funding
Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Subject Obligations; and (iii) “Pro Rata
Share”, for purposes of this Section 11.06(b), shall mean, for any Guarantor or any other
guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (A) the
amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable value of all of its assets and
properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such guarantor (including
contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the
obligations of such guarantor under this Guaranty or the other applicable guaranty) to
(B) the amount by which the aggregate present fair saleable value of all assets and other
properties of the Borrowers, all of the Guarantors and all of the other guarantors of the
Guaranteed Obligations exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including
contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the
obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement, the Guarantors hereunder and any
other guarantors of the Guaranteed Obligations under the applicable guaranties) of the
Borrowers, all of the Guarantors and all of the other guarantors of the Guaranteed
Obligations, all as of the Effective Date (if any Guarantor becomes a party hereto (or any
other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations becomes a party to the applicable
guaranty) subsequent to the Effective Date, then for purposes of this Section 11.06(b))
such subsequent guarantor shall be deemed to have been a guarantor of the Guaranteed
Obligations as of the Effective Date and the information pertaining to, and only pertaining
to, such guarantor as of the date such guarantor became a guarantor of the Guaranteed
Obligations shall be deemed true as of the Effective Date.
(c) The obligations of the Guarantors under this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents,
including their liability for the Guaranteed Obligations and the enforceability of the security
interests granted thereby, are not contingent upon the validity, legality, enforceability,
collectability or sufficiency of any right of reimbursement, contribution or subrogation
arising under this Section 11.06 or otherwise. The invalidity, insufficiency, unenforceability
or uncollectability of any such right shall not in any respect diminish, affect or impair any
such obligation or any other claim, interest, right or remedy at any time held by any
Beneficiary against any Guarantor or its property. The Beneficiaries make no
representations or warranties in respect of any such right and shall have no duty to
assure, protect, enforce or ensure any such right or otherwise relating to any such right.
Section 11.07 Termination; Reinstatement. (a) This Guaranty is a continuing and
irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall
remain in full force and effect; provided that the Guarantors shall be released from their
respective guarantee obligations and other obligations under this Guaranty as follows:
(i) with respect to all Guarantors, upon the termination of all Commitments and
indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent
indemnification obligations), (ii) with respect to any Guarantor that ceases to be a
Subsidiary of a Borrower as a result of a transaction permitted under this Agreement,
automatically upon such Guarantor so ceasing to be a Subsidiary, (iii) with respect to any
Guarantor that becomes an Excluded Subsidiary or is otherwise no longer required to be a
Guarantor pursuant to Section 6.12 of this Agreement or any provision of any other Loan
Document as a result of a transaction permitted under this Agreement, automatically upon
such Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary or otherwise no longer being required
to be a Guarantor and (iv) with respect to any other release of a Guarantor, upon approval,
authorization or ratification in writing in accordance with Section 10.01 of this Agreement.
136
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or
be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower or any
other Loan Party is made, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of
setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of
such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or
any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or
otherwise, to the extent of such payment, all as if such payment had not been made or
such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender
is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation,
rescission, termination or reduction. The foregoing obligations of each Guarantor under
paragraph (b) of this section shall survive termination of this Guaranty.
Section 11.08 Subordination. All Subordinated Obligations (as defined below) of a
Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment and collection to the
payment and collection in full of all Guaranteed Obligations as described below:
(a) As used herein, the term “Subordinated Obligations” for a Guarantor means: (i) all
present and future indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations of any kind owed to such
Guarantor by any Borrower or any other Loan Party liable for the payment or performance
of the Guaranteed Obligations, including debt obligations, equity obligations, and other
contractual obligations requiring payments of any kind to be made to such Guarantor and
including any right of subrogation (including any statutory rights of subrogation under
Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 509), contribution, indemnification,
reimbursement, exoneration, or any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any
Beneficiary against any Borrower or any other Loan Party liable for the payment or
performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any collateral which the Administrative
Agent now has or may acquire, and (ii) any increases, extensions, and rearrangements of
the foregoing obligations under any amendments, supplements, and other modifications
of the documents and agreements creating the foregoing obligations.
(b) Until all Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full (and therefore the
payment thereof is no longer subject to being set aside or returned under the law), no
Guarantor shall take any action to enforce payment of the Subordinated Obligations of
such Guarantor, but this standstill is not intended as a permanent waiver of the
subrogation, contribution, indemnification, reimbursement, exoneration, participation, or
other rights of such Guarantor.
(c) [Reserved].
(d) Following notice from the Administrative Agent to the Parent that an Event of Default
exists and that no further payments shall be made on the Subordinated Obligations of any
Guarantor, all amounts due with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations shall be paid in full
before any Guarantor shall be entitled to collect or receive any payment with respect to the
Subordinated Obligations of such Guarantor.
137
(e) Any lien, security interest, or assignment securing the repayment of the Subordinated
Obligations of any Guarantor shall be fully subordinate to any lien, security interest, or
assignment in favor of the Administrative Agent which secures the Guaranteed
Obligations. At the request of the Administrative Agent, each Guarantor will take any and
all steps necessary to fully evidence the subordination granted hereunder, including
amending or terminating financing statements and executing and recording
subordinations of liens.
(f) This is an absolute and irrevocable agreement of subordination and the Administrative
Agent may, without notice to any Guarantor, take any action described in this Agreement,
this Guaranty or in any other Loan Document without impairing or releasing the
obligations of any Guarantor hereunder.
(g) No Guarantor shall assign or otherwise transfer to any other Person any interest in the
Subordinated Obligations of such Guarantor without the prior written permission of the
Lenders.
(h) If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of this Section 11.06, such
amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and immediately
turned over to the Administrative Agent, with any necessary endorsement, to be applied to
the Guaranteed Obligations.
Section 11.09 [Reserved].
Section 11.10 [Reserved].
Section 11.11 Miscellaneous. No failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
exercise, and no delay by the Administrative Agent in exercising, any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. A waiver by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy under this Guaranty on any
one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that the
Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any future occasion. The
rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law or in equity. The
unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the
enforceability or validity of any other provision herein. Unless otherwise agreed by the
Administrative Agent and the Guarantors in writing, this Guaranty is not intended to
supersede or otherwise affect any other guaranty now or hereafter given by any Loan
Party for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any term or provision
thereof. Nothing in this Guaranty is intended or shall be construed to make any other
person (other than the Beneficiaries) a third party beneficiary hereof or give such other
person any right, remedy or claims under, to or in respect hereof or the matters
contemplated herein.
Section 11.12 Conditions of Borrowers. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it
has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of obtaining from each Borrower
and
138
any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and
operations of such Borrower and any such other guarantor as such Guarantor requires,
and that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any duty, and such
Guarantor is not relying on the Administrative Agent or any Lender at any time, to disclose
to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial
condition of the Borrowers or any other guarantor (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the
part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to disclose such information and any
defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on
the Administrative Agent or any Lender at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any
information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrowers or
any other guarantor (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to
provide the same).
The rights of the Administrative Agent, each Lender and their respective Affiliates under
this Section 11.12 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) that the Administrative Agent, such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have.
Any such set-off shall be subject to the notice requirements of Section 10.08; provided,
however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.
Section 11.13 Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each Guarantor hereby agrees
to take, or refrain from taking, as the case may be, each action that is necessary to be
taken or not taken, as the case may be, so that no Default or Event of Default is caused by
the failure to take such action or refrain from taking such action by such Guarantor or any
of its Subsidiaries.
Section 11.14 Additional Guarantors. Any Subsidiary of the Parent that is required
pursuant to this Agreement to enter into a guaranty on substantially similar terms as those
set forth herein after the date hereof shall become a Guarantor for all purposes of this
Guaranty upon execution and deliver by such Subsidiary of a supplement in the form of
Exhibit O hereto.
Section 11.15 Several Enforcement. This Guaranty shall apply to each Guarantor and may
be enforced against each Guarantor as if each Guarantor had executed a separate
agreement. No Guarantor shall have any contractual rights or obligations against any
other Guarantor under this Guaranty, including any rights to have this Guaranty enforced
ratably or any right to restrict the amendment or waiver hereof with respect to another
Guarantor.

A. Reference is made to that certain Superpriority Secured Debtor-In-Possession Credit

Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as Administrative Agent. Pursuant to the Guaranty,
the Guarantors have agreed jointly and severally to guarantee, among other things, the full

B. Section 11.14 of the Credit Agreement provides that additional Subsidiaries of the
Borrowers may become Guarantors under the Guaranty by execution and delivery of an
instrument in the form of this Supplement. Each undersigned Subsidiary (each, a “New
Debtor” and, collectively, the “New Debtors”) is executing this Supplement in accordance
with the requirements of the Agreement to become a Guarantor under the Guaranty.
Accordingly, the Administrative Agent and the New Debtors agree as follows:
SECTION 1. In accordance with Section 11.14 of the Credit Agreement, each New Debtor

thereunder and (b) represents and warrants that the representations and warranties made
by it as a Guarantor thereunder are true and correct on in all material respects or, if already

representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects or, if already
qualified by materiality, in all respects, as of such earlier date. Each reference to a
“Guarantor” in the Guaranty shall be deemed to include each New Debtor.
SECTION 2. Each New Debtor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent that
this Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes
its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principals of equity (whether determined
at law or in equity).

SECTION 3. This Supplement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties

FOREIGN SECURITY PRINCIPLES
Reference is made to the Superpriority Secured Debtor-In-Possession Credit Agreement
dated July 29, 2016 (the “Credit Agreement”; the terms defined therein being used herein
as therein defined), among C&J ENERGY SERVICES LTD., a Bermuda exempted company
and a debtor and debtor-in-possession under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the
“Parent”), and CJ HOLDING CO., a Delaware corporation and a debtor and debtor-in-
possession under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “U.S. Borrower” and, together
with the Parent the “Borrowers” and each, a “Borrower”), the Guarantors from time to time
party thereto, the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Cortland Capital Market
Services LLC, as Administrative Agent.
Foreign Security
Documents:
The guarantees and security interests to be provided under or pursuant to any
Foreign Security Documents (as defined below) in connection with the Credit
Agreement will be given in accordance with the security and guarantee
principles set out in this Exhibit P (the “Foreign Security Principles”). This
Exhibit P addresses the manner in which the Foreign Security Principles will
impact the guarantees and security interests proposed to be granted pursuant
to and governed by the Foreign Security Documents in relation to the
Transactions.
The Foreign Security Principles embody recognition by all parties that there
may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining guarantees and
security interests from all Guarantors that are Foreign Subsidiaries in
jurisdictions in which such Guarantors are incorporated and/or in which it has
been agreed that such guarantees and security interests will be granted (any
documentation relating to such guarantees and security interests, the
“Foreign Security Documents”). In particular, with respect to each Foreign
Security Document:
(a) any assets subject to third party arrangements, existing on the Effective
Date or at the time such assets would otherwise become Collateral, which
are permitted by the Credit Agreement and which prevent those assets from
becoming subject to a security interest will be excluded from the Collateral in
any relevant security document;
(b) the Guarantors will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant
Guarantor or if the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties of those
directors or contravene any legal prohibition or would result in (or in a
material risk of) personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer as
advised by counsel;
(c) perfection of security interests, when required, and other legal formalities
will be completed as soon as practicable with commercially reasonable effort
and, in any event, within any time periods specified by applicable law in order
to ensure due perfection;
Exhibit P to Credit Agreement
-1-
(d) certain supervisory board, works council or another external body’s
consent may be required by law to enable a Guarantor to provide a guarantee
or security interest in the Collateral, and such guarantee and/or security
interest shall not be required unless such consent has been received;
(e) a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security interest
shall be taken is the applicable cost (including adverse effects on interest
deductibility and stamp duty, notarization and registration fees) which shall
not be disproportionate to the benefit to the banks of obtaining such
guarantee or security interest as reasonably determined in good faith by
Parent;
(f) the maximum granted or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp
duty, notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties
where the benefit of increasing the granted or secured amount is
disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes and duties as determined in
good faith by the Parent and, where such security interest is to be given in
light of the Foreign Security Principles, only those assets that are not
Excluded Property shall be subject to such security interest;
(g) where there is material incremental cost involved in creating a security
interest over all assets owned by a Guarantor in a particular category (e.g.
real estate) the principle stated at paragraph (f) above shall apply;
(h) it is acknowledged that in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible
or commercially impractical to create a security interest over certain
categories of assets as reasonably determined in good faith by Parent, in
which event a security interest will not be taken over such assets consistent
with customary practice in the relevant jurisdiction;
(i) general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital
maintenance rules, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalisation” rules, retention
of title claims and similar principles may limit the ability of a Foreign
Subsidiary to provide a guarantee or Collateral or may require that the
guarantee or Collateral be limited by an amount or otherwise, in each case as
reasonably determined in good faith by Parent;
(j) the giving of a guarantee, the granting of a security interest or the
perfection of the security interest granted will not be required if it would have
a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant Guarantor to conduct its
operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the
Loan Documents as reasonably determined in good faith by Parent;
Exhibit P to Credit Agreement
-2-
(k) to the extent possible, all security interests shall be given in favor of the
Administrative Agent; “Parallel debt” provisions will be used where necessary
[and such provisions will be contained in the Credit Agreement and not the
individual security documents unless required under local laws];
(l) unless required to perfect the relevant security interests or to maintain
perfection thereof, to the extent possible, there should be no action required
to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security interests when any Lender
transfers any of its participation in the Credit Agreement to a new Lender;
(m) information, such as lists of assets, will be provided if and only to the
extent, required by local law to be provided to perfect or register the relevant
security interests and, unless required to be provided by local law more
frequently (or as otherwise agreed), will be provided annually or upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, as reasonably requested
by the Administrative Agent;
(n) unless granted under (i) a global security document governed by the law
of the jurisdiction of a Guarantor or under New York law, (ii) a pledge
agreement governed by the law of the jurisdiction of a material Subsidiary
whose equity is being pledged or (iii) as required by local law, all security
interests shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of
that Guarantor or by the law of the jurisdiction where the assets are located
(as applicable) to the extent customary in the relevant jurisdiction or (iv) in the
case of any Loan Party organized in Canada or any province or territory
thereof, as otherwise agreed by local counsel; and
(o) no security interest will be required over investments/shares in joint
ventures or Subsidiaries that are not wholly owned directly or indirectly by
Parent or the assets of joint ventures or Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiaries
that are wholly owned directly or indirectly by Parent (if so restricted or limited
under the relevant joint venture agreement, the shareholders’ agreement or
applicable law) and no joint venture or Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiaries
that are wholly owned directly or indirectly by Parent will be required to
provide a guarantee.
Exhibit P to Credit Agreement
-3-
Foreign Security
Interests:
The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any foreign security
interest taken as part of this transaction:
(a) the security interest will be a first ranking security interest over such
present and future assets of the Guarantors, subject to liens permitted under
the Credit Agreement;
(b) enforcement actions pertaining to such security interest will not be
permitted to be taken by the secured parties until an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing;
(c) notification of pledges over bank accounts will be given to the bank
holding the account where this is required for perfection of a security interest
provided that this is not inconsistent with Parent and its Subsidiaries retaining
control over and the ability to use freely the balance of the account other than
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(d) notification of security interests in receivables to debtors and of security
interests over goods held by third parties will only be given if an Event of
Default has occurred;
(e) notification of security interests over insurance policies will only be served
on any insurer of Parent’s and its Subsidiaries’ assets if an Event of Default
has occurred;
(f) the Foreign Security Documents should only operate to create security
interests rather than to impose new commercial obligations (accordingly, the
Foreign Security Documents shall not contain any representations or
undertakings which are already included in the Credit Agreement, unless
such representations or undertakings (such as in respect of title, insurance,
information or the payment of costs) are required for the creation, perfection,
protection or enforcement of security interests and are no more onerous than
any equivalent representation or undertaking in the Credit Agreement (if
applicable));
(g) in respect of share pledges, until an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the pledgors shall be permitted to retain and to exercise voting
rights to any shares pledged by them in a manner which does not adversely
affect the validity or enforceability of the security interest or cause an Event of
Default to occur, and the pledgors should be permitted to pay dividends
upstream on pledged shares to the extent permitted under the Credit
Agreement;
(h) the Administrative Agent should only be able to exercise any power of
attorney granted to it under the security documents after an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing or after failure by a Guarantor to comply with a
further assurance or perfection obligation;
Exhibit P to Credit Agreement
-4-
(i) any rights of set off will not be exercisable until an Event of Default has
occurred;
(j) the Foreign Security Documents should not operate so as to prevent
transactions which are not prohibited under the Credit Agreement or to
require additional consents or authorizations by the Administrative Agent or
Lenders; and
(k) except as required under applicable law, in the Foreign Security
Documents there will be no repetition or extension of clauses set out in the
Credit Agreement such as those relating to cost and expenses, indemnities,
tax gross up, distribution of proceeds and release or otherwise for the
creation, perfection, protection or enforcement of security interests.
Guarantee and
Security
Principles:
Subject to the due execution of all relevant security documents, completion of
relevant perfection formalities within statutorily prescribed time limits,
payment of all registration fees and documentary taxes, any other rights
arising by operation of law, obtaining any relevant foreign legal opinions and
subject to any qualifications which may be set out in the Loan Documents
and any relevant legal opinions obtained and subject to the requirements of
the Foreign Security Principles, the Administrative Agent shall:
(i) receive the benefit of (A) an upstream, cross-stream and downstream
Guarantee from each Guarantor and (B) a security interest granted over
substantially all of the assets of each Guarantor to secure all its liabilities
under the Loan Documents, in each case in accordance with the Foreign
Security Principles; and
(ii) in the case of those security documents creating pledges or charges over
shares in a Guarantor) obtain a first priority valid security interest or
analogous or equivalent security interest over all of the shares in issue at any
time in that Guarantor which are owned by another Guarantor or a Borrower.
Such security document shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in
which such Guarantor whose shares are being pledged is incorporated.
