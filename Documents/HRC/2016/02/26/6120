<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,

<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees the right to life, 
liberty and security of person, and the relevant provisions of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights,

<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Having regard</i> to the legal framework of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, including the provisions contained in 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/72 of 5 March 1992 and General Assembly 
resolution 47/136 of 18 December 1992, 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Welcoming </i>the universal ratification of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, which 
alongside human rights law provide an important framework of accountability in relation to 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council 
and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council, 
of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his or her duties in 
accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of all relevant General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights resolutions 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in particular Commission resolution 2004/37 
of 19 April 2004 and Assembly resolution 61/173 of 19 December 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions are crimes under the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> of the need for effective action to combat and to eliminate the abhorrent 
practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which represents a flagrant violation 
of the inherent right to life, 
</p>
<p><i> Dismayed</i> that, in a number of countries, impunity, the negation of justice, continues to 
prevail and often remains the main cause of the continued occurrence of extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> <i>once again</i> all extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in 
all their forms, that continue to take place throughout the world; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 2. <i>Acknowledges</i> the importance of relevant special procedures of the Council, in 
particular the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in their key 
role as early warning mechanisms in preventing the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity 
and war crimes, and encourages the relevant special procedures, within their mandates, to 
cooperate towards this end; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Demands</i> that all States ensure that the practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions is brought to an end and that they take effective action to combat and eliminate the 
phenomenon in all its forms; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates </i>the obligation of all States to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to 
identify and bring to justice those responsible, while ensuring the right of every person to a fair 
and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, to 
grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to 
adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring an end to 
impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions, as stated in the Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions (A/HRC/8/3), as well as of the recommendations made in previous years, 
and invites States to give them due consideration; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Commends</i> the important role the Special Rapporteur has played towards the 
elimination of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and encourages the Special 
Rapporteur to continue, within the framework of the mandate, to collect information from all 
concerned, to respond effectively to information that comes before her or him, to follow up on 
communications and country visits and to seek the views and comments of Governments and to 
reflect them, as appropriate, in the elaboration of her or his reports; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>7. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur, in carrying out her or his mandate: </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To continue to examine situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
and to submit her or his findings on an annual basis, together with conclusions and 
recommendations, to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, as well as such other 
reports as the Special Rapporteur deems necessary in order to keep the Council or the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights informed about serious situations of extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions that warrant immediate attention or where early action might prevent further 
deterioration; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To respond effectively to information which comes before him or her, in particular 
when an extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution is imminent or threatened or when such 
an execution has occurred; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To enhance further his or her dialogue with Governments, as well as to follow up on 
recommendations made in reports after visits to particular countries; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To continue to pay special attention to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context 
of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or 
against persons belonging to minorities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To pay special attention to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions where the 
victims are individuals who are carrying out peaceful activities in defence of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To continue to pay special attention to killings, including those targeted at specific 
groups of persons, such as racially motivated violence leading to the death of the victim, killings 
of all members of national, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities, of refugees, internally 
displaced persons, migrants, street children or members of indigenous communities, killings of 
persons for reasons related to their activities as human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists or 
demonstrators, killings committed in the name of passion or in the name of honour, extrajudicial </p>

violated; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To continue monitoring the implementation of existing international standards on 
safeguards and restrictions relating to the imposition of capital punishment, bearing in mind the 
comments made by the Human Rights Committee in its interpretation of article 6 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the Second Optional Protocol 
thereto; 
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) To apply a gender perspective in her or his work; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Strongly urges</i> all States to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur so that 
her or his mandate may be carried out effectively, including, where appropriate, by responding 
favourably to visits<b> </b>when she or he so requests, and to respond to the communications 
transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Expresses its appreciation</i> to those States that have invited the Special Rapporteur to 
visit their countries, asks them to examine carefully the recommendations made by the Special 
Rapporteur, invites them to provide information to the Special Rapporteur on the actions taken 
on those recommendations and requests other States, including those mentioned in reports of the 
Special Rapporteur, to cooperate in a similar way;<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 10. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that a number of States mentioned in the report of the Special 
Rapporteur have not replied to specific allegations, based on credible information, and to reports 
of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Welcomes </i>the cooperation established between the Special Rapporteur and other 
United Nations mechanisms and procedures in the field of human rights, and encourages the 
Special Rapporteur to continue efforts in that regard; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with adequate 
human, financial and material resources in order to enable her or him to carry out the mandate 
effectively, including through country visits; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 13. <i>Also requests</i> the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to continue to use 
their best endeavours in cases where the minimum standard of legal safeguards provided for in 
articles 6, 7, 9, 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights appears not 
to be respected; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions<b> </b>for three years; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Also decides</i> to continue to consider this matter in conformity with its programme of 
work.
