VERY IMPORTANT </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-size:8pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">On August&nbsp;9, 2013, Pioneer Natural Resources 
Company (&#147;Pioneer&#148;), Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. 
(&#147;Pioneer USA&#148;),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pioneer, PNR Acquisition Company, LLC 
(&#147;MergerCo&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pioneer, Pioneer Southwest 
Energy Partners L.P. (&#147;Pioneer Southwest&#148;) and Pioneer Natural 
Resources GP LLC
(&#147;Pioneer Southwest GP&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pioneer USA and
the general partner of Pioneer Southwest, entered into a merger agreement (the 
&#147;merger agreement&#148;). Pursuant to the merger agreement, MergerCo will 
merge with
and into Pioneer Southwest (the &#147;merger&#148;), with Pioneer Southwest 
surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pioneer USA, and all common
units representing limited partner interests in Pioneer Southwest (&#147;Pioneer
Southwest
common units&#148;) outstanding at the effective time of the merger and not 
owned by Pioneer USA will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive 
0.2325 of a share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Pioneer (&#147;Pioneer 
common
stock&#148;). No fractional shares of Pioneer common stock will be issued in the
merger. In lieu of receiving any fractional share of Pioneer common stock to 
which any Pioneer Southwest unitholder would otherwise have been entitled, after
aggregating all fractions of shares to which such unitholder would be entitled, 
any fractional share will be rounded up to a whole share of Pioneer common 
stock. Pioneer stockholders will continue to own their existing shares of 
Pioneer common
stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:3%; font-
size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on the estimated number of shares
of Pioneer common stock and the estimated number of Pioneer Southwest common 
units that
will be outstanding immediately before the closing of the merger (other than 
Pioneer Southwest common units owned by Pioneer USA), we estimate that, upon the
closing, the number of shares of Pioneer common stock issued in exchange for 
Pioneer
Southwest common units will represent approximately 3% of shares of Pioneer 
common stock outstanding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; 
text-indent:3%; font-size:8pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pioneer Southwest 
will hold a
special meeting of its unitholders in connection with the proposed merger. At 
the special meeting of Pioneer Southwest unitholders, Pioneer Southwest 
unitholders will be asked to vote on the proposal to approve the merger 
agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby (the &#147;merger transactions&#148;), 
including the merger (the &#147;merger proposal&#148;). The merger proposal will
be approved if the holders, as of the record date of the Pioneer Southwest 
special meeting, of
a majority of the outstanding Pioneer Southwest common units vote in favor of 
the merger proposal at the Pioneer Southwest special meeting. Pioneer, Pioneer 
USA, MergerCo, Pioneer Southwest and Pioneer Southwest GP have entered into a 
voting
agreement (the &#147;voting agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Pioneer, Pioneer 
USA and MergerCo have agreed to vote the Pioneer Southwest common units owned by
them in favor of the merger proposal, including the 18,721,200 Pioneer Southwest
common
units currently held by Pioneer USA, which units represent 52.4% of the 
outstanding Pioneer Southwest common units and therefore constitute a sufficient
number of Pioneer Southwest common units to approve the merger proposal at the 
Pioneer Southwest
special meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-

committee (the &#147;Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee&#148;) of the Pioneer
Southwest GP board of
directors (the &#147;Pioneer Southwest GP Board&#148;) unanimously approved the 
merger agreement and the merger transactions and determined that the merger 
agreement and the merger transactions are fair and reasonable to and in the best
interests of
the holders of Pioneer Southwest common units who are unaffiliated with Pioneer 
(the &#147;Pioneer Southwest unaffiliated unitholders&#148;) and Pioneer 
Southwest. This action of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee constitutes 
&#147;Special
Approval&#148; of the merger agreement and the merger transactions under Pioneer
Southwest&#146;s partnership agreement. The Pioneer Southwest Conflicts 
Committee recommended that the Pioneer Southwest GP Board make the same approval
and
determination as the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee. Based in part on 
this approval and determination, Special Approval and recommendation, the 
Pioneer Southwest GP Board approved the merger agreement and the merger 
transactions (such
approval being unanimous among the independent directors, with the non-
independent directors of Pioneer Southwest GP recusing themselves from the 
consideration and vote on such approval) and determined that the merger 
agreement and the merger
transactions are fair and reasonable to and in the best interests of the Pioneer
Southwest unaffiliated unitholders and Pioneer Southwest. The Pioneer Southwest 
GP Board caused Pioneer Southwest GP to approve the merger agreement and the 
merger
transactions and directed that the merger agreement and the merger transactions 
be submitted to the Pioneer Southwest unitholders at the Pioneer Southwest 
special meeting for approval. The Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee and the 
Pioneer
Southwest GP Board recommend that the Pioneer Southwest unitholders vote in

merger will benefit both Pioneer and Pioneer Southwest because Pioneer is 
believed to be better suited to take advantage of the development of Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s
leasehold acreage, especially through horizontal drilling, due to certain 
limitations to horizontal development that Pioneer Southwest faces. The 
potential for Pioneer Southwest to develop all of its acreage through horizontal
drilling is limited by
the non-contiguous nature of some of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s acreage and by 
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s limited rights across some of its acreage. Furthermore,
the potential for horizontal drilling locations can be adversely affected by the
location
of existing or future vertical wells, which may limit or eliminate Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s ability to drill a horizontal well. Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
non-contiguous leasehold acreage is contiguous with Pioneer leasehold acreage 
and could
potentially be developed by Pioneer if all the property was owned by Pioneer.

constitutes &#147;Special Approval&#148; of the merger agreement and the merger

Southwest Conflicts Committee recommended that the Pioneer Southwest GP Board 
make the
same approval and determination as the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee. 
Based in part on the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee&#146;s approval and 
determination, Special Approval and recommendation, the Pioneer Southwest GP 
Board approved
the merger agreement and the merger transactions (such approval being unanimous 
among the independent directors, with the non-independent directors of Pioneer 
Southwest GP recusing themselves from the consideration and vote on such 
approval) and
determined that the merger agreement and the merger transactions are fair and 
reasonable to and in the best interests of the Pioneer Southwest unaffiliated

Southwest GP
to approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions and directed that

expects that it will continue to operate its business as it has in the past, 
including the continuation of its three-rig drilling program through the 
remainder of 2013.
Pioneer Southwest expects that quarterly distributions of available cash will 
continue if the merger agreement is terminated and the merger does not occur, 
consistent with past practice and in accordance with the terms of Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s
partnership agreement. In the future, because Pioneer Southwest&#146;s proved 
reserves and production decline continually over time, Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
ability to maintain current levels of quarterly cash distributions will depend 
on its
ability to mitigate these declines through drilling initiatives, production 
enhancement, and/or acquisitions of income producing assets that provide 
adequate cash margins, as well as on the prices of oil, NGLs and gas and on the 
availability of
capital, such as Pioneer Southwest&#146;s credit facility or future private and 
public equity and debt offerings. At current quoted forward NYMEX prices for 
oil, NGLs and gas and current acquisition and drilling costs, there is 
significant
uncertainty regarding Pioneer Southwest&#146;s ability to maintain or increase 
its levels of quarterly distributions in the long term. Furthermore, Pioneer 
Southwest may be unable to maintain current levels of distributions without 
incurring
significant additional debt. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to

Pioneer formed Pioneer Southwest in 2007, and Pioneer Southwest completed its 
initial public
offering in 2008. The operations and activities of Pioneer Southwest are managed
by its general partner, Pioneer Southwest GP, an indirect wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Pioneer. Pioneer indirectly owns a 52.5% interest in Pioneer 
Southwest, including
the 0.1% general partner interest. Pioneer Southwest, its operating subsidiary 
and Pioneer Southwest GP have no employees. Pioneer Southwest, Pioneer Southwest
GP and Pioneer have entered into an administrative services agreement pursuant 
to which
Pioneer manages all of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s assets and performs 
administrative services for Pioneer Southwest. Please see &#147;Summary &#151;

indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Pioneer, and each outstanding Pioneer 
Southwest common unit, other than those Pioneer Southwest common units owned by 
Pioneer USA, will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive 0.2325 of a share of 
Pioneer common stock. This merger consideration represents a 19% premium to the 
closing price of the Pioneer Southwest common units based on the closing prices 
of the Pioneer
Southwest common units and shares of Pioneer common stock on May&nbsp;6, 2013, 
the last trading day before Pioneer announced its proposal to acquire all of the

associated with the merger are complicated. Under current law, it is anticipated
for U.S.
federal income tax purposes that Pioneer Southwest unitholders generally will 
recognize gain with respect to the exchange of Pioneer Southwest common units 
for shares of Pioneer common stock in the merger in an amount equal to the 
excess of
(1)&nbsp;each Pioneer Southwest unitholder&#146;s &#147;amount realized&#148; 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which equals the sum of the fair market 
value of the shares of Pioneer common stock received, plus the unitholder&#146;s
allocated
share of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s pre-merger liabilities (it being understood 
that no Pioneer Southwest unitholder bears any personal responsibility or 
liability in respect of such allocated liabilities), over (2)&nbsp;the 
unitholder&#146;s
aggregate adjusted tax basis in Pioneer Southwest common units (including basis 
attributable to the unitholder&#146;s share of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s pre-
merger liabilities). Pioneer Southwest unitholders generally will recognize loss
to the
extent that the amount of their basis described in clause (2)&nbsp;above exceeds
the amount realized described in clause (1)&nbsp;above. A portion of any amount 
realized by a unitholder will be treated as income subject to U.S. federal 
income tax at
ordinary rates (up to 39.6% under current law) rather than capital gains rates 
due to the operation of the recapture rules applicable to depreciation, 
depletion and intangible drilling cost deductions allocable to the Pioneer 
Southwest unitholders,
even if the Pioneer Southwest unitholder&#146;s aggregate adjusted basis in 
Pioneer Southwest common units exceeds the amount realized in the exchange. In 
addition, certain Pioneer Southwest unitholders may be subjected to the 3.8% 
Medicare tax on
unearned income in respect of any net gain from the exchange. Pioneer Southwest 
unitholders are urged to consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of 
the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the merger that 
will be
applicable to them. Please read &#147;Material U.S. Federal Income Tax

Court for the Northern District of Texas (the &#147;Beverly Lawsuit&#148;). The 
Beverly
Lawsuit alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing 
to the merger by means of an unfair process and for an unfair price. 
Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that the director defendants: (i)&nbsp;failed 
to maximize the
value of Pioneer Southwest to its public unitholders and took steps to avoid
competitive bidding; (ii)&nbsp;failed to properly value Pioneer Southwest; and 
(iii)&nbsp;ignored or failed to protect against the numerous conflicts of

Section 7.9
of the Pioneer Southwest partnership agreement fails to alter or eliminate the 
defendants&#146; common law fiduciary duties owed to Pioneer Southwest 
unitholders in the context of the merger. Specifically, the lawsuit alleges: (1)
that Pioneer, as
controlling unitholder, failed to fulfill its fiduciary duties in connection 
with the merger because it purportedly cannot establish that the proposed merger
is the result of a fair process that will return a fair price to the Pioneer 
Southwest
unaffiliated unitholders; (2) that the director defendants breached their 
fiduciary duties by failing to exercise due care and diligence in connection 
with the proposed merger because the proposed merger is purportedly not the 
result of a fair
process that will return a fair price to the Pioneer Southwest unaffiliated 
unitholders; and (3) that the non-director defendants aided and abetted the

initial public offering of 9,487,500 common units representing limited 
partnership interests (the &#147;2008 Offering&#148;). To effect the 2008 
Offering, Pioneer contributed
a portion of its ownership of a subsidiary that owned interests in oil and gas 
properties located in the Spraberry field and sold to Pioneer Southwest its 
remaining ownership interest in the subsidiary. During August 2009, Pioneer 
Southwest acquired
certain additional oil and gas property interests in the Spraberry field from 
Pioneer that, together with the property interests conveyed to Pioneer Southwest
in 2008 (the &#147;Conveyed Interests&#148;), represented transactions between 
entities
under common control and are reported in Pioneer Southwest&#146;s financial 
statements similar to a pooling of interests. Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
statements of operations for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008 
include the results of
operations of the Conveyed Interests (being the results of operations of the 
Pioneer Southwest predecessor) prior to their ownership by Pioneer Southwest.

it is
interested only in acquiring the outstanding publicly held Pioneer Southwest

Therefore, even if a proposal or offer to acquire the assets or common units of

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">There has been a recent trend in Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s operating area toward horizontal drilling, which requires 
greater amounts of capital
than vertical drilling but potentially provides higher production and investment
returns. Pioneer Southwest&#146;s leasehold acreage and wellbore assignment 
rights (&#147;Virtual 40s&#148;) are located in good potential resource areas, 
and Pioneer
has identified 125 horizontal locations on Pioneer Southwest&#146;s leasehold 
acreage with drillable lateral lengths in excess of 5,000 feet as having a 
potentially attractive value based on geologic analysis and Pioneer&#146;s 
limited drilling
results to date. Under current conditions, Pioneer Southwest would likely be 
unable to develop certain portions of its remaining leasehold acreage (such 
acreage, the &#147;stranded leasehold acreage&#148;) and its Virtual 40s through
horizontal
drilling due to its stranded leasehold acreage position being non-contiguous and
not of sufficient size to permit drilling of horizontal wells of sufficient 
length to be economic. Such stranded leasehold acreage and Virtual 40s are 
contiguous with
Pioneer leasehold acreage and could potentially be developed by Pioneer 
following the merger. However, there are significant risks and uncertainties 
associated with horizontal drilling. Following the merger, Pioneer may not be 
successful in
developing the potential horizontal locations it has identified on Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s leasehold acreage or the Virtual 40s. If Pioneer is unable to 
develop these locations for horizontal drilling or otherwise, it could have an 
adverse effect
on Pioneer&#146;s operations, financial results and the price of its common 
stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-

be governed by Pioneer&#146;s certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In
addition, whereas Pioneer Southwest is a Delaware limited partnership governed 
by the Delaware
Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, Pioneer is a Delaware corporation 
governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. As a result, there will be 
material differences between the current rights of Pioneer Southwest unitholders
and the rights
they can expect to have as Pioneer stockholders, as well as differences in how 
stockholders and unitholders are taxed. For example, profits at Pioneer 
Southwest flow through Pioneer Southwest and are taxed once at the unitholder 
level, regardless of
whether distributions are made to Pioneer Southwest unitholders. Profits of 
Pioneer are subject to tax at the corporation level and potentially again, if 
and when distributed to Pioneer stockholders, at the stockholder level. For a

unable to fully develop all of its leasehold acreage through horizontal

potential for Pioneer Southwest to develop all of its acreage through horizontal

its acreage.
Additionally, a portion of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s acreage is not of sufficient
size to permit drilling of horizontal wells of sufficient length to be economic.
Furthermore, the potential for horizontal drilling locations can be adversely 
affected
by the location of existing or future vertical wells, which may limit or

available to Pioneer Southwest for distributions. In addition, the continuation 
of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s vertical
drilling program would likely reduce or eliminate the horizontal potential that 
may exist on Pioneer Southwest&#146;s leasehold acreage as a result of 
increasing the density of vertical wells, which could result in future 
diminution in the value of

and the merger does not
occur, Pioneer Southwest expects that quarterly distributions of available cash 
will continue, consistent with past practice and in accordance with the terms of
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s partnership agreement. In the future, because Pioneer
Southwest&#146;s proved reserves and production decline continually over time, 
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s ability to maintain current levels of quarterly cash 
distributions will depend on its ability to mitigate these declines through 
drilling
initiatives, production enhancement, and/or acquisitions of income producing 
assets that provide adequate cash margins, as well as on the prices of oil, NGLs
and gas and on the availability of capital, such as Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
credit
facility or future private and public equity and debt offerings. At current 
quoted forward NYMEX prices for oil, NGLs and gas and current acquisition and 
drilling costs, there is significant uncertainty regarding Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s ability to

attributable

the merger, it is possible that the amount of gain Pioneer Southwest unitholders
recognize, or even their resulting tax liability, could exceed the fair market 
value of
the shares of Pioneer common stock. The application of other complicated tax 
rules also may give rise to adverse tax consequences to Pioneer Southwest 
unitholders. Because the tax consequences of the merger to a Pioneer Southwest 
unitholder will
depend on the unitholder&#146;s particular factual circumstances and are

Pioneer Southwest common units and shares of Pioneer common stock on May&nbsp;6,
2013, the last trading day before Pioneer announced its proposal to acquire all 
of the

a 58% premium to the closing price of the Pioneer Southwest common units based 
on the
closing price of the Pioneer Southwest common units on May&nbsp;6, 2013, and the

Southwest is a master limited partnership formed by Pioneer in June 2007 to own 
and acquire oil and gas properties in Texas and eight counties in the southeast 
region of New Mexico. Pioneer Southwest completed an initial public offering of 
9,487,500
Pioneer Southwest common units on May&nbsp;6, 2008. Before the initial public 
offering, Pioneer owned all of the general and limited partner interests in 
Pioneer Southwest. Prior to the initial public offering, Pioneer contributed 
certain oil and
gas properties located in the Spraberry field to Pioneer Southwest by way of the
transfer to Pioneer Southwest of all of the membership interests in an operating
entity holding such oil and gas assets. The contributed assets consisted only of
wellbore assignment rights and certain limited contractual rights to develop the
acreage around those wellbores, referred to herein as Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
&#147;Virtual 40s.&#148; Specifically, the rights Pioneer Southwest received 
were limited
to (1)&nbsp;only those rights that were necessary to produce hydrocarbons from 
the particular wellbores, but not the right to drill additional wells or to 
extend the horizontal reach of the wellbore interests (often referred to as 
wellbore
interests), and (2)&nbsp;a contractual right to propose wells within the same 40
acre section of land, or &#147;Virtual 40,&#148; in which the parent wellbore is
located, limited to the interval from the surface to the depth of the deepest 
producing
perforation in the parent wellbore, and to participate in wells proposed by 
Pioneer, if any, in the Virtual 40; provided that, if Pioneer&#146;s proposed 
well would be drilled to depths deeper than the parent wellbore, Pioneer 
Southwest would be
required to pay the fair market value for its pro rata share of the interests

November&nbsp;16, 2009, Pioneer Southwest completed a public offering of 
3,105,000 Pioneer Southwest common units (the &#147;2009
Offering&#148;). Following the 2009 Offering, Pioneer owned a 62.0% interest in 
Pioneer Southwest, including the 0.1% general partner interest and a 61.9% 
limited partner interest. The successful drilling program resulting from the 
2009 Acquisition
and the 2009 Offering enabled Pioneer Southwest to increase its distributions 
per common unit in May 2011 from $0.50 to $0.51. In addition, as Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s drilling program continued, Pioneer Southwest benefitted from 
the knowledge
gained by Pioneer in its drilling program, with Pioneer Southwest&#146;s wells 
being drilled to deeper depths for better rates of return despite the greater

font-family:Times New Roman">During 2012, Pioneer and third parties in the 
vicinity of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s area of operations began to focus on 
drilling horizontal
wells rather than vertical wells. Horizontal wells, while providing higher 
production and investment returns than vertical wells in the same areas, are 
more expensive to drill, and require larger contiguous tracts of acreage. As 
Pioneer developed
its horizontal drilling program, management of Pioneer became aware that Pioneer
Southwest&#146;s potential to fully develop its acreage as a standalone entity 
through horizontal drilling was uncertain due to potential capital constraints, 
the
non-contiguous nature of some of its acreage, and some of its acreage being not 
of sufficient size to permit drilling of horizontal wells of sufficient length
to be economic. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">In early 2013, due to a combination of lower 
commodities prices, higher operating costs, and the effects of derivatives that 
were entered into
in 2009, management&#146;s financial forecasts projected that net cash flows 
from Pioneer Southwest&#146;s operations would be insufficient to fund its 
three-rig vertical drilling program, which would require additional borrowing 
under Pioneer
Southwest&#146;s credit facility to maintain then current levels of 
distributions for the remainder of 2013. Management believed that, at then 
current commodities prices and costs, Pioneer Southwest could continue with its 
current drilling strategy
while maintaining distribution levels through the end of 2014, although that 
would result in increased borrowing levels and reduced liquidity. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt;

update of management&#146;s outlook for Pioneer Southwest. As discussed at the 
Board&#146;s prior meeting in March, Mr.&nbsp;Dealy stated that, under current 
commodities prices and costs, management believed Pioneer Southwest could 
continue its
3-rig program for the near and medium term, but that Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
financial leverage would continue to increase. Furthermore, management expected
that Pioneer Southwest would be unable to continue to run a 3-rig vertical 
program over the
long-term and fund distributions without adding significant incremental debt. 
Mr.&nbsp;Dealy also noted the trend in Pioneer Southwest&#146;s operating area 
toward horizontal drilling. Mr.&nbsp;Dealy pointed out that

Pioneer Southwest&#146;s leasehold acreage and wellbore assignment rights 
(Virtual 40s) were located in good potential resource areas and that Pioneer had
identified 125 horizontal locations on
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s leasehold acreage with drillable lateral lengths in 
excess of 5,000 feet as having a potentially attractive value based on geologic 
analysis and limited drilling results by Pioneer and other industry participants
to date.
Mr.&nbsp;Dealy also pointed out, however, that, other than the aforementioned 
125 horizontal locations on Pioneer Southwest&#146;s leasehold acreage with 
potentially attractive value, Pioneer Southwest would likely not be able to 
develop significant
portions of its remaining leasehold acreage (such acreage, the &#147;stranded 
leasehold acreage&#148;) and its Virtual 40s through horizontal drilling because
Pioneer Southwest did not hold sufficient contiguous acreage or sufficient 
rights that
would be needed to drill horizontal wells of sufficient length to be economic 
(Mr.&nbsp;Dealy noted that such stranded leasehold acreage and Virtual 40s that 
are contiguous with Pioneer leasehold acreage could potentially be developed by 
Pioneer if
all the property was owned by Pioneer). Mr.&nbsp;Dealy further noted that the 
continuation of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s vertical drilling program would likely 
reduce or eliminate the horizontal potential that may exist on Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s
leasehold acreage as a result of increasing the density of vertical wells, which
could result in future diminution in the value of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
leasehold acreage if horizontal drilling locations were no longer viable. </P>

was held and the analysis of a potential business combination with Pioneer 
Southwest was presented. Mr.&nbsp;Dealy presented management&#146;s analysis of 
the potential transaction between Pioneer and Pioneer Southwest, including 
management&#146;s
financial analyses regarding Pioneer Southwest&#146;s current outlook and 
properties. The presentation also included an update of management&#146;s
outlook for Pioneer Southwest&#146;s net asset value, taking into account 
management&#146;s recent
technical work regarding the potential of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s properties 
for horizontal development. The Pioneer Board was presented with a draft 
proposal letter to the Chairman of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee 
proposing a
combination of Pioneer and Pioneer Southwest. An exchange ratio of 0.2234 of a 
share of Pioneer common stock per Pioneer Southwest common unit was established 
based on management&#146;s analysis of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s net asset value,
taking
into consideration various comparable financial and industry valuation metrics. 
After extensive discussion, the Pioneer Board unanimously authorized and 
approved the proposal and authorized Pioneer management to deliver the proposal 
to the Chairman
of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt;

Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Pioneer and Pioneer Southwest 
GP, had dinner in Dallas, Texas, with the independent members of the Pioneer 
Southwest GP Board, before the regularly scheduled Pioneer Southwest 
GP&nbsp;Board meeting the

the offices of
Pioneer Southwest in Irving, Texas. Mr.&nbsp;O&#146;Leary was present at the 
board meeting by invitation. At the meeting, Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield presented Arthur
L. Smith, Chairman of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee, with a written 
proposal
from Pioneer pursuant to which Pioneer would acquire all of the outstanding 
Pioneer Southwest common units not already owned by Pioneer or its subsidiaries.
Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield explained that the proposed transaction would be structured 
as a merger
between Pioneer Southwest and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pioneer, with a 
proposed exchange ratio of 0.2234 of a share of Pioneer common stock for each 
outstanding publicly held Pioneer Southwest common unit. Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield 
noted that, in
proposing the exchange ratio, Pioneer had assumed for valuation purposes that a 
regular quarterly Pioneer Southwest common unit distribution of $0.52 per 
Pioneer Southwest common unit would be declared in July with respect to the 
second quarter of

the transaction was pending. Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield further explained that the 
proposal was non-binding and subject to final Pioneer Board approval and 
negotiation of definitive agreements.
Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield stressed that the written proposal stated that Pioneer was 
interested only in acquiring the outstanding publicly held Pioneer Southwest 
common units and was not interested in selling the Pioneer Southwest common
units held by
Pioneer USA or Pioneer USA&#146;s interest in Pioneer Southwest GP. 
Mr.&nbsp;Dealy then led a discussion of Pioneer&#146;s valuation methodology. 
Mr.&nbsp;Dealy discussed the resulting estimated net asset value for Pioneer 
Southwest, the assumed
value of shares of Pioneer common stock based on a 60-trading day trailing 
average price, and various metrics represented by the proposed exchange ratio. 
Mr.&nbsp;Dealy also noted that, at the proposed exchange ratio, based on the 
trading prices of
the Pioneer Southwest common units and distributions since Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s IPO, no Pioneer Southwest unitholder was expected to experience
a cash loss on its investment. </P>

Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee. Following the executive session, the 
participants in the
regular session of the Pioneer Southwest GP Board meeting discussed the role of,
and the criteria for membership on, the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee. 
Mr.&nbsp;Thomas Murphy, an in-house attorney of Pioneer, led a discussion of 
each of the
elements required under the Pioneer Southwest partnership agreement for a 
director to be eligible to serve on the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee. 
In particular, Mr.&nbsp;Murphy noted that eligibility requirements for a 
director of Pioneer
Southwest GP to serve on the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee are as 
follows: (1)&nbsp;the director must not (a)&nbsp;be a security holder, officer 
or employee of Pioneer Southwest GP or any of its affiliates, including Pioneer

subsidiaries (other than holding Pioneer Southwest common units), (b)&nbsp;be a 
director of any affiliate of Pioneer Southwest GP, including Pioneer and its 
subsidiaries, or (c)&nbsp;hold an ownership interest in Pioneer Southwest or its
subsidiaries (other than holding Pioneer Southwest common units); (2)&nbsp;the 
director must meet the independence standards required to serve on an audit 
committee of a board of directors established by the Exchange Act and the rules 
and
regulations of the SEC and the NYSE, including the requirement under the NYSE 
Listed Company Manual that &#147;no director qualifies as 
&#145;independent&#146; unless the board of directors affirmatively determines 
that the director has no material
relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, 
shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the 
company)&#148; (where &#147;listed company&#148; and &#147;company&#148; are 
understood to include any

(3)&nbsp;the director must not have any relationship that would be required to 
be disclosed by Pioneer Southwest GP pursuant to Item&nbsp;404(a) of Regulation

met in person with representatives of Evercore and Andrews Kurth, with Messrs. 
Gosule and
Mitchell joining by telephonic conference call. Evercore presented an overview 
of the recent price performance and current trading conditions of Pioneer 
Southwest and Pioneer as they related to the exchange ratio of 0.2234, and 
discussed its
preliminary analysis with respect to various valuation methodologies that 
Evercore would use in order to evaluate the proposed transaction. Evercore also 
discussed the opportunity and valuation implications of developing the Wolfcamp 
Shale
formation, and also stated that it was awaiting the analysis of Russell K. Hall 
in order to finalize its own analyses. Following the discussion with Evercore, 
the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee discussed aspects of a potential 
counteroffer,
including an increase in the exchange ratio, the committee&#146;s desire that a 
vote of a majority of the Pioneer Southwest unaffiliated unitholders (i.e. 
&#147;majority of the minority&#148;) be a condition to consummation of any 
transaction with
Pioneer, and a continuation of the regular quarterly distributions that might
occur before the consummation of the proposed transaction. At this time, the 
Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee decided that it would wait for Russell K.

Mr.&nbsp;O&#146;Leary that it was Pioneer&#146;s expectation that if the merger 
agreement were
terminated, Pioneer Southwest would declare a catch-up distribution for all 
quarters during which regular quarterly distributions had been suspended, and

Vinson&nbsp;&amp;

July&nbsp;17, 2013, the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee held a meeting to 
discuss the terms of the proposed transaction. Evercore provided an update on 
market conditions, noting that Pioneer Southwest&#146;s common unit price had 
increased
38.2% from the date of the announcement of the proposed transaction to 
July&nbsp;16, 2013, while a selected peer group (identified under &#147;The 
Merger &#151; Opinion of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee&#146;s 
Financial Advisor &#151;
Valuation of Pioneer Southwest &#151; Peer Group Trading Analysis&#148;) of 
publicly traded exploration and production partnerships had declined by 5.3% on 
average during the same time period. Evercore also noted that the implied offer 
price of
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s common units calculated by using the exchange ratio of 
0.2234 was slightly below the market price of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s common 
units, signaling that investors were expecting an increase in the exchange ratio
going
forward. The Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee and its advisors considered 
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s large base of retail investors, and the risk of not 
getting sufficient voter turnout by Pioneer Southwest unaffiliated unitholders 
in connection
with a majority of the minority vote, which could result in the voting condition
not being met due to low voter turnout. Since the risk of low voter turnout is 
high, the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee considered that a more practical
and
appropriate vote requirement would be to condition the approval of the merger 
proposal on a special vote of the &#147;majority of the minority&#148; of the 
Pioneer Southwest unitholders actually voting at the special meeting (i.e. 
&#147;majority of
unaffiliated units cast condition&#148;). The Pioneer Southwest Conflicts 
Committee and Evercore also discussed potential alternatives to the proposed 
transaction, and considered whether it would be appropriate to shop the company 
to prospective
bidders and to make further inquiry of Pioneer with respect to other 
alternatives. The committee considered that Pioneer had indicated that it would 
not sell its Pioneer Southwest common units, sell the general partner interest 
or sell the operating
rights with respect to Pioneer Southwest&#146;s acreage, meaning that a 
prospective bidder would not be able to gain control of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s
operations. The committee concluded that prospective bidders would not be 
interested in
purchasing the outstanding unaffiliated common units without gaining control of 
operations, and directed Evercore to analyze other strategic alternatives for 
the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee to consider. The Pioneer Southwest 
Conflicts
Committee also discussed that it was still awaiting the completion of Russell K.
Hall&#146;s analysis before moving forward with discussions with Pioneer 
regarding the proposed transaction. </P>

the northern portions of the Wolfcamp formation performed better than the wells 
in the southern portion, thus Russell
K. Hall utilized higher estimated ultimate reserve numbers in its analysis than 
those utilized for the Wolfcamp formation by Pioneer. Russell K. Hall concluded 
that this divergence meant that more value could be attributed to Pioneer
Southwest&#146;s acreage than had been previously contemplated. Evercore 
discussed the valuation implications of Russell K. Hall&#146;s analysis and 
updated the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee on market conditions. Evercore
next led the
Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee through its analysis of standalone and 
transactional strategic alternatives. Evercore&#146;s standalone alternative 
involved maintaining the status quo, which was considered in terms of the 
ability of Pioneer
Southwest to develop the Wolfcamp formation with horizontal drilling. It was 
noted that the implied offer price using the exchange ratio of 0.2234 was higher
than the estimated valuation of Pioneer Southwest under this scenario based on 
the most
favorable assumptions regarding Pioneer Southwest&#146;s ability to drill the 
horizontal locations, some of which would have required the approval of Pioneer.
The transactional alternatives presented by Evercore included conducting a 
leveraged
recapitalization, accelerating Pioneer Southwest&#146;s drilling program, as 
well as shopping Pioneer Southwest&#146;s unaffiliated common units to 
prospective third party bidders. It was noted that if Pioneer Southwest 
conducted a leveraged
recapitalization, the additional leverage incurred by Pioneer Southwest would 
limit its ability to pursue growth projects. The Pioneer Southwest Conflicts 
Committee also considered that the estimated valuation of Pioneer Southwest 
under this
scenario was lower than the implied valuation of Pioneer Southwest using the 
exchange ratio of 0.2234. Evercore then reviewed the alternative of accelerating
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s drilling program, which would have to be financed in 
part by
decreasing the distribution to Pioneer Southwest unitholders. The Pioneer 
Southwest Conflicts Committee discussed the negative effect that such a decrease
would have on the trading price of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s common units and its
unaffiliated
unitholders. Evercore then discussed with the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts 
Committee the alternative of shopping Pioneer Southwest&#146;s unaffiliated 
common units to potential third party bidders. Evercore and the Pioneer 
Southwest Conflicts
Committee reaffirmed the conclusion reached at their previous meeting that this 
was not a feasible alternative. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

morning of
August&nbsp;1, 2013, the Pioneer Southwest Conflict Committee met telephonically
with representatives of Evercore and Andrews Kurth to review the financial 
analyses supporting various exchange ratios, Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
alternatives if it
chose not to proceed with a transaction with Pioneer (noting the obstacles to 
transactions involving third parties or a leveraged recapitalization) and issues
pertaining to a majority of the minority voting condition. At the conclusion of 
the
meeting, the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee directed Evercore to first 
ask Pioneer whether it would: (1)&nbsp;sell its general partner interest in 
Pioneer Southwest; (2)&nbsp;allow farm-outs; and (3)&nbsp;consider a reduction 
of regular
quarterly distributions to finance a horizontal drilling program. Only if those 
responses were firmly negative would Evercore then deliver a formal counteroffer
that would include an exchange ratio of 0.2500, a majority of unaffiliated votes
cast
condition, and a confirmation that regular quarterly distributions after the 
second quarter regular distribution payable in August would continue to be paid 
until the consummation of the proposed transaction. </P>

interest in Pioneer Southwest; (2)&nbsp;allow farm-outs; and (3)&nbsp;consider a
reduction of regular quarterly distributions to finance a horizontal drilling 
program. To
the first question, Mr.&nbsp;Dealy stated that Pioneer would not sell the 
general partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. Regarding questions (2)&nbsp;and 
(3), Mr.&nbsp;Dealy indicated to Mr.&nbsp;Strong that the Pioneer Southwest 
Conflicts Committee
should evaluate Pioneer&#146;s proposal, but that questions (2)&nbsp;and 
(3)&nbsp;regarding whether to allow farm-outs and whether to consider reducing 
regular quarterly distributions to finance a horizontal drilling program were

a
telephonic meeting of the Pioneer Board was held to consider the proposed merger
on the terms that had been agreed to earlier that day. All of the directors on 
the Pioneer Board were present at the meeting. Representatives of 
Vinson&nbsp;&amp;
Elkins and members of Pioneer management were also in attendance. At the 
meeting, Mr.&nbsp;Sheffield informed the Pioneer Board that representatives of 
Pioneer had been in discussions with the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee 
and its advisors
and had agreed in principle to the terms of a transaction, subject to required 
approvals. He then discussed the agreed upon financial and voting terms and the 
premium that the financial terms represented over the value of Pioneer&#146;s 
original
proposal on May&nbsp;7, 2013. Mr.&nbsp;Dealy described the negotiations that had
taken place over the prior week, and he reviewed the key terms of the proposed 
transaction as agreed to by the parties. The Pioneer Board discussed with 
management the
negotiation process, transaction terms, status of the litigation, and the 
benefits of and reasons for the merger (as set forth under the heading &#147;The
Merger <B>&#151; </B>Pioneer&#146;s Reasons for the Merger&#148;). Mr.&nbsp;Berg
reviewed the
key terms of the proposed merger agreement, including the terms setting forth 
conditions to closing, representations and warranties, covenants and deal 
protections. The fiduciary duties of directors in considering the transaction 
were then reviewed
and discussed. The Pioneer Board also discussed procedural matters in connection
with its approval of the proposed transactions. After these discussions and 
deliberation, the Pioneer Board approved the merger agreement and related 
documents and the
issuance of shares of Pioneer common stock in connection with the proposed 
merger, which vote was unanimous among the directors voting on the proposal. 
Directors Larry R. Grillot, Stacy P. Methvin and Phoebe A. Wood, who had 
recently joined the
Pioneer Board and who were not familiar with the background of the initial 
proposal, abstained from the vote. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

August&nbsp;9, 2013, a
telephonic meeting of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee was held for the
committee&#146;s consideration of the proposed transaction. Present at the 
meeting were the members of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee, members 
of Evercore,
members of Andrews Kurth and members of Richards Layton. Prior to the meeting, 
the committee members had received a presentation by Richards Layton, the 
financial analyses from Evercore, a meeting agenda, and current draft versions 
and summaries of
the merger agreement and voting agreement for the proposed transaction. </P> <P

presentation
with the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee and discussed the Pioneer 
Southwest Conflicts Committee&#146;s fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the 
modifications of fiduciary duties that may be made under the Delaware Revised 
Uniform Limited
Partnership Act and the standards for approval of the proposed transaction under
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s partnership agreement. Andrews Kurth led the Pioneer 
Southwest Conflicts Committee through a discussion of the merger agreement and 
voting
agreement, and responded to the committee&#146;s questions. Evercore reviewed 
its financial analyses with the committee and responded to the committee&#146;s 
questions. Evercore also reviewed with the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee
the
contents of the written fairness opinion Evercore was prepared to deliver, 
following which Evercore rendered its oral opinion to the committee (which was 
confirmed in writing by delivery of Evercore&#146;s written opinion dated 
August&nbsp;9, 2013)
to the effect that, as of August&nbsp;9, 2013, and based upon and subject to the
factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in 
its opinion, the proposed exchange ratio was fair, from a financial point of 
view, to the
Pioneer Southwest unaffiliated unitholders. The Pioneer Southwest Conflicts 
Committee discussed whether it was prepared to recommend that the Pioneer 
Southwest GP Board approve the proposed merger and merger agreement, including 
in its discussion a
review of the factors and considerations set forth under the heading &#147;The 
Merger &#151; Recommendation of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee and 
the Pioneer Southwest GP Board and Reasons for the Merger.&#148; At the 
conclusion of this

Southwest Conflicts Committee meeting, a telephonic meeting of the Pioneer 
Southwest GP
Board was held to consider the proposed transaction. The independent members of 
the Pioneer Southwest GP Board, members of Evercore and members of Andrews Kurth
were among those present at the meeting. Messrs. Sheffield and Dealy and 
director Danny
L. Kellum recused themselves from the meeting given their roles as both 
directors on the Pioneer Southwest GP Board and directors or executive officers
of Pioneer. Since all of the directors present had also been present at the 
preceding meeting of
the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts Committee, the directors determined to dispense 
with certain presentations and discussions that had been made at such prior 
meeting, including a presentation of financial analyses by Evercore, a review 
and discussion
of the positive and negative factors relating to approval of the merger 
agreement and the merger transactions, and a summary by members of Andrews Kurth
and Richards Layton of the terms of the merger agreement and the voting 
agreement, due diligence
items, and the standards for approval of the merger agreement, the voting 
agreement and the merger transactions under Pioneer Southwest&#146;s partnership
agreement and applicable law and related duties. Mr.&nbsp;Strong of Evercore 
orally delivered
Evercore&#146;s fairness opinion to the independent directors of the Pioneer 
Southwest GP Board acting in such capacity, and confirmed that such members are 
authorized to rely on Evercore&#146;s fairness opinion in such capacity. 
Following this, the
Pioneer Southwest GP Board, by unanimous resolution of the members of the 
Pioneer Southwest GP Board in attendance, approved the merger agreement and the 
merger transactions, determined that the merger agreement and the merger 
transactions are fair
and reasonable to and in the best interests of the Pioneer Southwest 
unaffiliated unitholders and Pioneer Southwest, directed that the merger

each company
developed their respective company&#146;s projected drilling program, each of 
which is reflected in the projections disclosed in this section. The capital 
expenditures of Pioneer were adjusted to reflect drilling activity in each 
pricing scenario to
match capital expenditures more closely to cash flow. Management&#146;s 
projections did not account for any transaction expenses related to the merger.

most are beyond
the control of Pioneer and Pioneer Southwest. Although management of Pioneer and

uncertain, and the risk of inaccuracy increases with the length of the 
forecasted period. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-

projections provided by
Pioneer (the &#147;Pioneer Reserves Case&#148;), as well as the reserve report 
provided by Russell K. Hall (the &#147;Russell Hall Reserves Case&#148;). 
Evercore evaluated four pricing scenarios for each report in which the principal
variables were
oil and gas prices. The four pricing scenarios were based on benchmarks for spot
sales of West Texas Intermediate oil and for spot sales of Henry Hub gas. One 
scenario was based on the annual average of oil and gas futures contract prices 
quoted on
the New York Mercantile Exchange for five years and held flat thereafter. 
Benchmark prices for the other three scenarios were projected to be flat at 
$85.00, $100.00, and $105.00 per barrel of oil and $4.25, $4.25, and $5.00 per 
million British
thermal units for gas. Applying various discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 
20.0%, depending on reserve category, to the before-tax cash flows of the proved
and non-proved reserve estimates, and adjusting for the present value of the 
future
estimated effects of hedging at discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 9.0% and 
general and administrative expenses at discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 
15.0%, Evercore calculated the following implied net asset value for Pioneer

described above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an 
incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore&#146;s opinion. In arriving
at its fairness determination,
Evercore considered the results of all the analyses and did not draw, in 
isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor 
considered by it for purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its 
determination as to fairness on
the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the 
results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various 
analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and 
may have deemed
various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, 
the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination 
of analyses described above should not be taken to be the view of Evercore with 
respect to
the actual value of Pioneer Southwest common units or the Pioneer common stock. 
No company or partnership used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly
comparable to Pioneer Southwest or Pioneer, and no precedent transaction used is
directly comparable to the merger. Furthermore, Evercore&#146;s analyses involve
complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating 
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public 
trading or other
values of the companies, partnerships or transactions used, including judgments 
and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the

unitholder of Pioneer Southwest, filed a class action petition on behalf of the 
Pioneer
Southwest unitholders and a derivative suit on behalf of Pioneer Southwest 
against Pioneer USA, Pioneer Southwest GP and the directors of Pioneer Southwest
GP, in the 134th Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas (the &#147;Flecker 
Lawsuit&#148;).
A similar class action petition and derivative suit was filed against the same 
defendants on May&nbsp;20, 2013, in the 160th Judicial District of Dallas 
County, Texas, by purported unitholder Vipul Patel (the &#147;Patel 
Lawsuit&#148;). On
August&nbsp;27, 2013, the plaintiff in the Flecker Lawsuit filed an amended 
petition. On September&nbsp;3, 2013, the court consolidated the Patel Lawsuit 
into the Flecker Lawsuit (as consolidated, the &#147;Texas State Court 
Lawsuit&#148;), and the
plaintiffs filed a consolidated derivative and class action petition on 
September&nbsp;5, 2013. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-

Lawsuit alleges,
among other things, that the consideration offered by Pioneer is unfair and 
inadequate and that, by pursuing a transaction that is the result of an 
allegedly conflicted and unfair process, the defendants have breached their 
duties under Pioneer
Southwest&#146;s partnership agreement as well as the implied covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing, and are engaging in self-dealing. Specifically, the 
lawsuit alleges that the director defendants: (i)&nbsp;engaged in self-dealing, 
failed to act
in good faith toward Pioneer Southwest, and breached their duties owed to 
Pioneer Southwest; (ii)&nbsp;failed to properly value Pioneer Southwest and its
various assets and operations and ignored or failed to protect against the 
numerous conflicts

engaging in a flawed merger process. The Texas State Court Lawsuit also alleges 
that defendants Pioneer, Pioneer USA and Pioneer Southwest GP aided and abetted 
the director defendants in their
purported breach of fiduciary duties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based 
on these allegations, the plaintiffs in the Texas State Court Lawsuit seek to 
enjoin the
defendants from proceeding with or consummating the proposed transaction. To the
extent that the merger is implemented before relief is granted, the plaintiffs 
seek to have the merger rescinded. The plaintiffs also seek money damages and
attorneys&#146; fees. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the Texas 
State Court Lawsuit based on improper forum. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; 
margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New

August&nbsp;21, 2013, Allan H. Beverly, a purported Pioneer Southwest 
unitholder, filed a class action complaint against Pioneer Southwest, Pioneer, 
Pioneer USA, MergerCo and the directors of Pioneer Southwest GP in the United 
States District Court
for the Northern District of Texas (the &#147;Beverly Lawsuit&#148;). The 
Beverly Lawsuit alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by 
agreeing to the merger by means of an unfair process and for an unfair price. 
Specifically, the
lawsuit alleges that the director defendants: (i)&nbsp;failed to maximize the 
value of Pioneer Southwest to its public unitholders and took steps to avoid 
competitive bidding; (ii)&nbsp;failed to properly value Pioneer Southwest; and
(iii)&nbsp;ignored or failed to protect against the numerous conflicts of 
interest arising out of the proposed transaction. The Beverly Lawsuit also 
alleges that defendants Pioneer, Pioneer USA and MergerCo aided and abetted the 
director defendants
in their purported breach of fiduciary duties. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; 
margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New

Southwest
unitholder, filed a class action complaint against the same defendants in the 
Beverly Lawsuit (as well as Pioneer Southwest GP) in the same court as the 
Beverly Lawsuit (the &#147;Shelton Lawsuit&#148;). The Shelton Lawsuit makes 
similar allegations
to the Beverly Lawsuit, and also alleges that Section&nbsp;7.9 of the Pioneer 
Southwest partnership agreement fails to alter or eliminate the defendants&#146;
common law fiduciary duties owed to Pioneer Southwest unitholders in the context
of the
merger. Specifically, the lawsuit alleges: (1)&nbsp;that Pioneer, as controlling
unitholder, failed to fulfill its fiduciary duties in connection with the merger
because it purportedly cannot establish that the proposed merger is the result 
of a
fair process that will return a fair price to the Pioneer Southwest unaffiliated
unitholders; (2)&nbsp;that the director defendants breached their fiduciary 
duties by failing to exercise due care and diligence in connection with the 
proposed merger
because the proposed merger is purportedly not the result of a fair process that
will return a fair price to the Pioneer Southwest unaffiliated unitholders; and 
(3) that the non-director defendants aided and abetted the director defendants 
in their
purported breach of fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs in the Beverly Lawsuit and 
the Shelton Lawsuit seek the same remedies as the plaintiffs in the Texas State 
Court Lawsuit. </P>

reserves. In so doing, Pioneer sells homogenous oil, NGL and gas units that, 
except for geographic and relatively minor quality differences, cannot be 
significantly differentiated from units offered for sale by Pioneer&#146;s 
competitors.
Competitive advantage is gained in the oil and gas exploration and development 
industry by employing well-trained and experienced personnel who make prudent 
capital investment decisions based on management direction, embrace 
technological
innovation, and focus on price and cost management. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

strategies that maximize Pioneer&#146;s long-term profitability and net asset 
value. The strategies employed to achieve this mission are predicated on 
maintaining financial flexibility, capital allocation discipline and enhancing 
net asset value
through accretive drilling programs, joint ventures and acquisitions. These 
strategies are anchored primarily by drilling in the Spraberry field, the 
liquid-rich Eagle Ford Shale field located in South Texas, the Barnett Shale 
Combo field in North
Texas and, to a lesser extent, Alaska. Complementing these growth areas, Pioneer
has oil and gas production activities and development opportunities in the Raton
gas field located in southern Colorado, the Hugoton gas and liquid field located
in
southwest Kansas, the West Panhandle gas and liquid field located in the Texas 
Panhandle, and the Edwards gas field located in South Texas. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Set forth below are descriptions of certain 
agreements between Pioneer and Pioneer Southwest, some of which were entered 
into in connection
with Pioneer Southwest&#146;s initial public offering in May 2008. The full text
of the agreements have been filed by Pioneer Southwest as exhibits to its 
filings with the SEC and are available for review without charge on the 
SEC&#146;s website at
www.sec.gov. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:2%;

Agreement </I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Pioneer, Pioneer Southwest and Pioneer Southwest GP
have entered into an administrative services agreement (the &#147;Administrative
Services
Agreement&#148;) pursuant to which Pioneer agreed to perform, either itself or 
through its affiliates or other third parties, administrative services for 
Pioneer Southwest, and Pioneer Southwest agreed to reimburse Pioneer for its 
expenses incurred
in providing such services. Currently, expenses are reimbursed based on a 
methodology of determining Pioneer Southwest&#146;s share, on a per BOE basis, 
of certain of the general and administrative costs incurred by Pioneer. Under 
this methodology,
the per BOE cost for services during any period is determined by dividing 
(i)&nbsp;the aggregate general and administrative costs, determined in 
accordance with GAAP, of Pioneer (excluding Pioneer Southwest&#146;s general and
administrative costs),
for its United States operations during such period, excluding such costs 
directly attributable to Pioneer&#146;s Alaskan operations, by (ii)&nbsp;the sum
of (x)&nbsp;the United States production during such period of Pioneer Southwest
and Pioneer,
excluding any production attributable to Alaskan operations, plus (y)&nbsp;the 
volumes delivered by Pioneer and Pioneer Southwest under all volumetric 
production payment obligations during such period (which obligations terminated 
on
December&nbsp;31, 2010). The costs of all awards to Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
independent directors under the Pioneer Southwest LTIP are borne by Pioneer 
Southwest and are not included in the foregoing formula. The administrative fee 
is determined by
multiplying the per BOE costs by Pioneer Southwest&#146;s total production 
(including volumes delivered by Pioneer Southwest under volumetric production 
payment obligations, if any) during such period. The administrative fee may be 
based on amounts
estimated by Pioneer if actual amounts are not available. In addition, Pioneer 
is reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses it incurs on Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s behalf. The Administrative Services Agreement can be terminated
by Pioneer Southwest or
Pioneer at any time upon 90 days notice. Pioneer Southwest paid a total of $4.9 
million to Pioneer under this agreement during 2012. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Pioneer is the operator of all of Pioneer 
Southwest&#146;s properties. Upon the closing of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
initial public offering in
May 2008, Pioneer Southwest and Pioneer entered into an Omnibus Agreement (the 
&#147;Omnibus Agreement&#148;) and an Omnibus Operating Agreement (the &#147;IPO
Omnibus Operating Agreement&#148;) to govern their relationship with respect to 
the
properties Pioneer Southwest acquired in connection with the initial public 
offering. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of properties by 
Pioneer Southwest from Pioneer in August 2009, Pioneer Southwest and Pioneer 
entered into an
Omnibus Operating Agreement (the &#147;2009 Omnibus Operating Agreement&#148;) 
to govern their relationship with respect to the properties Pioneer Southwest 
acquired in connection with that acquisition. </P>

Agreement limits Pioneer Southwest&#146;s area of operations to onshore Texas 
and the southeast region of New Mexico, comprising Chaves, Curry, De Baca, Eddy,

Southwest&#146;s oil and gas properties. Overhead charges are usually paid by 
third parties to the operator of a well pursuant to operating agreements. 
Pioneer Southwest also pays Pioneer for its
direct and indirect expenses that are chargeable to the wells under their 
respective operating agreements. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-
bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 
addition, pursuant to the
IPO Omnibus Operating Agreement and the 2009 Omnibus Operating Agreement, 
Pioneer Southwest has agreed to certain restrictions and limitations on its 
ability to exercise certain rights that would otherwise be available to it under
the operating
agreements that govern Pioneer Southwest&#146;s properties where Pioneer is the 
operator. For example, Pioneer Southwest will not object to attempts by Pioneer 
to develop the leasehold acreage surrounding Pioneer Southwest&#146;s wells; 
Pioneer
Southwest is restricted in its ability to remove Pioneer as the operator; 
Pioneer-proposed operations will take precedence over any conflicting operations
that Pioneer Southwest proposes; and Pioneer Southwest must allow Pioneer to use
certain of
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s production facilities in connection with other 
properties operated by Pioneer, subject to capacity limitations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">As previously noted, Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
interest in a number of its wells is limited to only those rights that are 
necessary to produce
hydrocarbons from those particular wellbores (often referred to as wellbore 
interests), and do not include the right to drill additional wells (other than 
replacement wells or down-spaced wells, such as 20-acre infill wells) within the
area covered
by the mineral or leasehold interest to which that wellbore relates. In 
addition, Pioneer Southwest&#146;s operations with respect to these wellbore 
interests are limited to the interval from the surface to the depth of the 
deepest producing
perforation in the wellbore, plus an additional 100 feet as a vertical easement 
for operating purposes only. The IPO Omnibus Operating Agreement gives Pioneer 
Southwest the contractual right to participate in down-spaced wells proposed by
Pioneer on
the same working interest percentage basis as it has in the related wellbore 
interest. However, the agreement provides that, if the new well proposed by 
Pioneer is to be drilled to deeper formations than Pioneer Southwest has a right
to with respect
to the related wellbore interest and completed in or commingled with production 
from a producing perforation in the Pioneer Southwest wellbore, Pioneer 
Southwest has the right to participate in the new well and would be required to 
pay the fair
market value for its pro rata share of the interests associated with those 
greater depths. As of December&nbsp;31, 2012, Pioneer Southwest had elected to 
participate in three such down-spaced wells, and of the wells to be drilled in 
2013, Pioneer
Southwest anticipates it will participate in up to five such down-spaced wells. 
Pioneer Southwest, with the approval of the Pioneer Southwest Conflicts 
Committee, and Pioneer have agreed to assign a fair market value to the 
additional depths based
on the average cost of Pioneer&#146;s acquisition of the right to drill in the 
surrounding areas over the prior 12 months, subject to an independent review of 
the supporting data. In 2012, the cost to Pioneer Southwest for such additional 
rights
totaled $62,000, and Pioneer Southwest anticipates that the aggregate cost for 
such additional rights for the five wells to be drilled in 2013 will be 
approximately $100,000. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">During 2012, Pioneer entered into agreements with 
an unaffiliated third party to enter into oil and gas leases for certain 
undeveloped acreage
in Midland County in West Texas, and agreed with Pioneer Southwest to assign an 
undivided 94% of Pioneer&#146;s interest in the leases in consideration for the 
payment to Pioneer of a pro rata share of Pioneer&#146;s acquisition costs. In 
October
2012, Pioneer completed oil and gas leases for 3,063 acres and assigned to 
Pioneer Southwest an undivided 94% of Pioneer&#146;s interest in the leases in 
consideration for the payment to Pioneer of a pro rata share of Pioneer&#146;s 
acquisition
costs for a total of $6.3 million. In August 2013, Pioneer completed the oil and
gas lease for the remaining 1,200 acres and assigned to Pioneer Southwest an 
undivided 94% of Pioneer&#146;s interest in the lease in consideration for the 
payment to
Pioneer of a pro rata share of Pioneer&#146;s acquisition costs for a total of 
$2.5 million. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%;

as compensation 16% and 20%, respectively, of the dry gas residue and NGL value.
Substantially all of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s total NGL and gas sales revenues 
in 2012
were from the sale of NGL and gas processed through the Midkiff/Benedum and Sale

with each of the independent directors of Pioneer Southwest GP, Pioneer 
Southwest is
required to indemnify each indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by Pioneer
Southwest&#146;s partnership agreement. This means, among other things, that 
Pioneer Southwest must indemnify the director against expenses (including 
attorneys&#146;
fees), judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement that are 
actually and reasonably incurred in an action, suit or proceeding by reason of 
the fact that the person is or was a director of Pioneer Southwest GP or is or 
was serving at
Pioneer Southwest GP&#146;s request as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or other entity if the indemnitee meets the standard of 
conduct provided in Pioneer Southwest&#146;s partnership agreement. Also, as 
permitted under
Pioneer Southwest&#146;s partnership agreement, the indemnification agreements 
require Pioneer Southwest to advance expenses in defending such an action 
provided that the director undertakes to repay the amounts if the person 
ultimately is
determined not to be entitled to indemnification from Pioneer Southwest. Pioneer
Southwest will also make the indemnitee whole for taxes imposed on the 
indemnification payments and for costs in any action to establish the 
indemnitee&#146;s right to
indemnification, whether or not wholly successful. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect as of the

possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion assumes that Pioneer Southwest

that may be relevant to particular Pioneer Southwest unitholders in light of 
their individual circumstances, including potential application of the 
alternative minimum
tax, or any aspect of U.S. federal, state or local tax laws to Pioneer Southwest
unitholders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws 
(such as insurance companies, financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations,

transaction&#148; for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, or as part of some other integrated investment, expatriates
or persons whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar). 
If a partnership holds Pioneer Southwest common units, the tax treatment of a 
partner
generally will depend on the status of the partner and upon the activities of 
the partnership. Persons who are partners in a partnership holding Pioneer 
Southwest common units should consult their tax advisors. This summary also does
not discuss any
tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other 
tax jurisdiction or, except to the extent provided below, any tax consequences 
arising under U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws. We

any matters discussed in this section, and the statements in this proxy

receivables and inventory items may exceed overall net taxable gain realized

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;465(e) of the Internal Revenue Code 
requires individuals and closely held corporations to recapture losses 
previously allowed with
respect to their interests in a partnership in the event their amount &#147;at 
risk&#148; with respect to that partnership becomes less than zero. The 
consequence of recapture is that a taxpayer must recognize income equal to the 
negative at-risk
amount. A unitholder&#146;s at-risk amount, or &#147;at-risk basis,&#148; 
generally is equal to such holder&#146;s basis in the Pioneer Southwest common 
units, adjusted to exclude certain non-qualified partnership liabilities that 
otherwise would be
included in such holder&#146;s basis. In addition, although guidance is sparse, 
a unitholder&#146;s at-risk basis likely will be increased by the amount of any 
gain recognized with respect to such Pioneer Southwest common units, including 
gain
recognized in the merger. Assuming such gain increases a unitholder&#146;s at-
risk basis, such holders should not recognize recapture income under 
Section&nbsp;465(e) of the Internal Revenue Code solely as a result of 
exchanging Pioneer Southwest
common units in the merger. The at-risk limitation applies on an activity-by-
activity basis, and in the case of gas and oil properties each property is 
treated as a separate activity. Thus, a taxpayer&#146;s interest in each oil or 
gas property is
generally required to be treated separately so that a loss from any one property
is limited to the at-risk amount for that property and not the at-risk amount 
for all the taxpayer&#146;s gas and oil properties. It is uncertain how this 
rule is
implemented in the case of multiple gas and oil properties owned by a single 
entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. However, for 
taxable years ending on or before the date on which further guidance is 
published, the IRS
will permit aggregation of oil or gas properties Pioneer Southwest owns in 
computing a unitholder&#146;s at-risk limitation with respect to Pioneer 
Southwest. If a unitholder must compute his at-risk amount separately with 
respect to each oil or gas
property Pioneer Southwest owns, such holder may not be allowed to utilize his
share of losses or deductions attributable to a particular property even though 
he has a positive at-risk amount with respect to his Pioneer Southwest common 
units as a
whole. Unitholders that may be subject to these &#147;at-risk&#148; rules should
consult their tax advisors concerning their shares of Pioneer Southwest&#146;s 
qualifying indebtedness and the application of these rules to their particular
circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-

limitation rules under the Internal Revenue Code generally provide that certain

individuals, estates, trusts and certain corporations, are permitted to deduct 
losses from passive activities, which are generally defined as trade or business
activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate, only to the 
extent of
the taxpayer&#146;s income from those passive activities. Any gain or ordinary

Pioneer Southwest unitholders to make proposals at the Pioneer Southwest special

agreement establishes a procedure for calling meetings whereby limited partners

call a meeting. In any case, limited partners are not allowed to vote on matters
that would cause the limited partners to be deemed to be taking part in the

so would
jeopardize the limited partners&#146; limited liability under the Delaware LP

font-family:Times New Roman">Pioneer, Pioneer USA, MergerCo, Pioneer Southwest 
and Pioneer Southwest GP entered into the merger agreement on August&nbsp;9, 
2013, pursuant
to which MergerCo will merge with and into Pioneer Southwest, with Pioneer 
Southwest surviving the merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Pioneer, and all Pioneer Southwest common units outstanding at the effective 
time of the merger and
not owned by Pioneer USA will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive 0.2325 of a share of Pioneer common stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-
top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman">The
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared to assist in analysis of the financial effects of the merger.
These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are 
derived in part
from, and should be read in conjunction with, Pioneer&#146;s financial 
statements included in Pioneer&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, and Pioneer&#146;s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q 
for the period ended
June&nbsp;30, 2013. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012, and the six months ended 
June&nbsp;30, 2013, have been prepared to give effect to the proposed merger as 
if it had
occurred on January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2012. The unaudited pro forma condensed 
consolidated balance sheet has been prepared to give effect to the proposed 
merger as if it had occurred on June&nbsp;30, 2013. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated 
financial statements are based on assumptions that Pioneer and Pioneer Southwest
believe are
reasonable under the circumstances and are intended for informational purposes 
only. They are not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would 
have occurred if the merger transactions had taken place on the dates indicated,
nor are
they indicative of the future consolidated results of Pioneer. They also do not 
reflect non-recurring items arising directly from the merger or any cost savings
that the combined entity may achieve. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; 
font-family:Times New Roman">The merger will be accounted for in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 810,
<I>Consolidations &#151; Overall &#151; Changes in Parent&#146;s Ownership 
Interest in a Subsidiary</I>, which is referred to as ASC 810. As Pioneer will 
control Pioneer Southwest before and after the merger, the changes in 
Pioneer&#146;s ownership
interest in Pioneer Southwest will be accounted for as an equity transaction and
no gain or loss on the merger will be recognized in Pioneer&#146;s consolidated 
statements of operations. </P>

under Delaware law, the indemnification agreements require Pioneer to advance 
expenses in defending any such action provided that the director or executive

undertakes to repay the amounts if the person ultimately is determined not to be
entitled to indemnification from Pioneer. Pioneer has additionally agreed to

in control or potential change in control has occurred. In addition, the 
indemnitee can require Pioneer to establish a trust fund with a third-party

procure up to a six-year run-off policy in the event of a change in control or 
termination of the
person in the year following a change in control of Pioneer. The indemnification
agreements also limit the period in which Pioneer can bring an action against
