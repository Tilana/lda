<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Kyrgyzstan was held at the 1st meeting on 19 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Kyrgyzstan was headed by the Vice Prime Minister of 
</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan, Abdyrakman Mamataliev. At its 10th meeting, held on 23 January 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group adopted the report on Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Kyrgyzstan: Montenegro, Morocco and the 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>

</p>
<p>Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland and the United States of America was transmitted to Kyrgyzstan through 
</p>
<p>the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>(UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation reaffirmed the commitment of Kyrgyzstan to the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights. Democratization and the protection of human rights remained a 
</p>
<p>national priority. Since its first review in 2010, Kyrgyzstan had reaffirmed its adherence to 
</p>
<p>democratic change. During the reporting period, the country had faced serious challenges, 
</p>
<p>testing the strength of national unity. Despite those challenges, Kyrgyzstan had managed to 
</p>
<p>maintain stability. 
</p>
<p>6. Kyrgyzstan had taken the path of building parliamentary democracy. To that end, a 
</p>
<p>new Constitution had been adopted and a coalition Government formed. A tradition of 
</p>
<p>peaceful transfer of power had been established thanks to the democratic elections of 
</p>
<p>October, 2011. The Government recognized that holding fair and transparent parliamentary 
</p>
<p>elections in 2015 would be an important factor in ensuring the stability of the country.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation highlighted the Government&#8217;s commitment to strengthening the rule 
</p>
<p>of law and democratic institutions. Fully aware of the existing human rights issues, the 
</p>
<p>Government had strengthened its efforts to improve the respect of human rights and of the 
</p>
<p>rule of law in past years. Substantive work had been done to bring legislation into 
</p>
<p>conformity with the Constitution and international human rights standards. </p>


<p>8. The Constitution was adopted by referendum in 2010 in an open and transparent 
</p>
<p>process of constitutional reform. The Constitution affirmed the principle of the rule of law, 
</p>
<p>guaranteed the principles of separation of powers and the independence of courts, and 
</p>
<p>established safeguards for the protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>9. The norms enshrined in the Constitution asserted the utmost importance of human 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms. International human rights instruments were directly applicable and 
</p>
<p>took precedence over other international agreements. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation explained that the independence of the judiciary was guaranteed by 
</p>
<p>the Constitution and judges were independent and subordinate only to the Constitution and 
</p>
<p>the law. Citizens were entitled to judicial protection and to legal aid in cases prescribed by 
</p>
<p>law. Kyrgyzstan had intensified efforts to create the institution of a grand jury so the 
</p>
<p>citizens could take part in the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>11. The judicial system continued to face various challenges. The Judicial Reform 
</p>
<p>Council, an advisory and consultative body, had been set up to coordinate the priority 
</p>
<p>measures of the judicial reform. The Council of Judges had developed the comprehensive 
</p>
<p>National Programme for the Development of the Judicial System 2013&#8211;2017, which 
</p>
<p>provided a thorough analysis and specific recommendations related to key issues of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary and of access to justice. 
</p>
<p>12. In 2010, the country had experienced ethnic conflict in the south of the country that 
</p>
<p>resulted in casualties. The Government managed to stabilize the situation and stopped the 
</p>
<p>conflict. The Government had implemented a policy framework for harmonization of inter-
</p>
<p>ethnic relations and for long-term integration. The National Sustainable Development 
</p>
<p>Strategy 2013&#8211;2017 and the Policy Framework on Strengthening National Unity and Inter-
</p>
<p>Ethnic Relations  had been developed and adopted through open and wide discussion of the 
</p>
<p>situation after the 2010 conflict. 
</p>
<p>13. The process of improving the electoral legislation before the 2015 parliamentary 
</p>
<p>elections had aimed to improve the representation of women and ethnic minorities in 
</p>
<p>elected bodies by applying a quota to candidate lists. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation highlighted the establishment of the Human Rights Coordinating 
</p>
<p>Council, attached to the Government as an interministerial consultative and advisory body. 
</p>
<p>The Coordinating Council was authorized, inter alia, to conduct regular monitoring of the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation, take measures to implement recommendations of international 
</p>
<p>human rights bodies, engage with civil society and other stakeholders and to discuss and 
</p>
<p>develop recommendations in order to ensure the protection of human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p>15. Following the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
</p>
<p>and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT) in 2008, the 
</p>
<p>National Centre for the Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment or Punishment had been established. That national preventive mechanism 
</p>
<p>consisted of representatives of civil society, the Ombudsman and the Parliament. The 
</p>
<p>Centre had been facing some challenges, including a lack of sufficient funding for its 
</p>
<p>effective functioning. Despite the challenges, two offices of the Centre had already been 
</p>
<p>opened. 
</p>
<p>16. An interministerial working group had been established for the preparation of the 
</p>
<p>national report for the second cycle of UPR. Legal and comparative analysis of law and 
</p>
<p>practice as well as an analysis of root causes of human rights violations had been conducted 
</p>
<p>in the process of the preparation of the national report. The national report documented 
</p>
<p>achievements and remaining challenges. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government had followed the recommendations that were put forward during 
</p>
<p>the 2010 review calling for an open and transparent process of constitutional reform and </p>


<p>strong human rights provisions in the Constitution. In the framework of the follow-up to 
</p>
<p>UPR, the Children&#8217;s Code had been adopted to strengthen the national child protection 
</p>
<p>system. Additionally, the Peaceful Assembly Act had been adopted in line with the 
</p>
<p>provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The 
</p>
<p>national report provided information about measures undertaken to combat gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, bride-kidnapping and trafficking in human beings, and about the impact of anti-
</p>
<p>corruption initiatives. 
</p>
<p>18. The delegation pointed out that the report had been prepared during a process of 
</p>
<p>wide-ranging national consultations that had included representatives of State bodies and 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Government planned to discuss new 
</p>
<p>methods and approaches for the implementation of the recommendations of the review. 
</p>
<p>19. Since the establishment of the Human Rights Coordinating Council in 2013, the 
</p>
<p>issue of a standing invitation to the special procedure mandate holders was being discussed 
</p>
<p>within the relevant government bodies.  
</p>
<p>20. The delegation reiterated the firm commitment of Kyrgyzstan to improving the 
</p>
<p>human rights protection system and ensuring the compliance of national law with the 
</p>
<p>international human rights system. UPR was not a one-off event but a continuous process 
</p>
<p>and required determined efforts by the Government. 
</p>
<p>21. Kyrgyzstan had presented its candidacy for membership of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council for the period 2016&#8211;2018. The Regional Office for Central Asia of the Office of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) had been established 
</p>
<p>in Bishkek. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Assistant 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for Human Rights had visited Kyrgyzstan during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan cooperated actively with the United Nations treaty bodies and submitted its 
</p>
<p>reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Human Rights Committee, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, the Committee against Torture and the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation provided its responses to advance questions. In respect of the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Kyrgyzstan had 
</p>
<p>been following the work of ICC and some additional time was required for it to become 
</p>
<p>confident in the effectiveness of the Court before making a final decision on the ratification 
</p>
<p>of the Rome Statute. At the same time, the national legislation envisaged criminal 
</p>
<p>responsibility for crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>23. Regarding the questions on a standing invitation to the special procedure mandate 
</p>
<p>holders of the Human Rights Council, the delegation highlighted the continuing 
</p>
<p>cooperation of Kyrgyzstan with mandate holders. It recalled that, in the past 14 years, eight 
</p>
<p>special mandate holders had visited Kyrgyzstan, and two special rapporteurs had paid a 
</p>
<p>visit during the reporting period. Kyrgyzstan had agreed in principle to the visits of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. The Government was 
</p>
<p>looking forward to those visits and the date of the visits depended on the proposals of the 
</p>
<p>special procedure mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>24. Kyrgyzstan was a party to eight out of the nine core human rights treaties. The 
</p>
<p>authorities has taken measures to study thoroughly the possibility and implications of 
</p>
<p>ratifying the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced </p>
<p>Disappearance (ICPPED), the only core international human rights instrument that 
</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan had not yet signed. In that respect, the upcoming visit of the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance or Involuntary Disappearances would be important.  </p>


<p>25. In 2014, the Government had updated the National Action Plan on the Prevention 
</p>
<p>and Reduction of Statelessness, which included specific actions for the ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and for harmonization of the legislation with 
</p>
<p>the relevant international standards. The Government had been jointly implementing a 
</p>
<p>project with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to register 
</p>
<p>stateless persons and persons without identity documents. More than two dozen mobile 
</p>
<p>units had been operating in rural areas, providing legal advice on how to apply for 
</p>
<p>citizenship or for obtaining relevant documents free of charge.  
</p>
<p>26. Kyrgyzstan recognized the competency of the Human Rights Committee and 
</p>
<p>CEDAW to consider and examine individual complaints. Pursuant to the Code of Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure, a decision of an international body constituted grounds for reopening criminal 
</p>
<p>proceedings in the light of new circumstances surrounding a case. Kyrgyzstan had been 
</p>
<p>working to develop a methodology for implementing the decisions of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights bodies on individual complaints. 
</p>
<p>27. The parliament had an important role in the realization of human rights, through 
</p>
<p>monitoring human rights issues and cooperating closely with the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Coordinating Council, the national preventive mechanism, the Ombudsman, civil society 
</p>
<p>and the international organizations. 
</p>
<p>28. The parliament had established a working group within the Parliamentary 
</p>
<p>Committee for Human Rights, Constitutional Law and State Structure in order to study and 
</p>
<p>discuss different versions of draft amendments to the Law on the Ombudsman submitted by 
</p>
<p>the Office of the Ombudsman and several members of the parliament.  
</p>
<p>29. Recognizing the importance of the freedom of religion and belief, the Government 
</p>
<p>had set up a working group to revise State policy on the freedom of religion. In 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court had removed from the legislation, declaring 
</p>
<p>it unconstitutional, a provision which made the registration of religious organizations 
</p>
<p>subject to the approval of local authorities. That would considerably simplify the process of 
</p>
<p>registration of religious organizations. The parliament had been paying special attention to 
</p>
<p>and had taken measures for the enjoyment of freedom of religion by individuals. 
</p>
<p>30. Regarding the bill on the prohibition on the formation of positive attitudes towards 
</p>
<p>lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons, the delegation stated that the bill 
</p>
<p>had been widely discussed within the society and by the parliament. Different views, 
</p>
<p>including negative and critical comments, had been expressed by members of the 
</p>
<p>parliament and by civil society representatives. A working group had been established 
</p>
<p>under the relevant parliamentary committee to study international experience and expertise 
</p>
<p>on that issue and to suggest relevant amendments to the draft law. The parliament was 
</p>
<p>committed to law-making through the process of wide and thorough discussions with 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders. 
</p>

<p>62. The delegation explained that the purpose of the new amendment to the Criminal 
</p>
<p>Code criminalizing the dissemination of statements about the commission of crimes had 
</p>
<p>been to prevent false statements being made knowingly about the commission of crimes. 
</p>
<p>The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court had ruled that the amendment was not in 
</p>
<p>conflict with the provisions of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>63. In response to questions regarding the draft law on reporting requirements of NGOs 
</p>
<p>receiving funding from foreign sources, the delegation explained that several deputies of 
</p>
<p>the parliament had initiated the draft law with the aim of ensuring transparency in the 
</p>
<p>functioning of non-profit organizations. Representatives of civil society and international 
</p>
<p>organizations had expressed concern that the draft law imposed unjustified restrictions on 
</p>
<p>the exercise of NGOs&#8217; freedom of association and thus was incompatible with international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards and the Constitution. In view thereof, the Parliamentary Committee 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights, Constitutional Law and State Structure had held a parliamentary hearing 
</p>
<p>on the draft law and had compiled recommendations for additions and changes to be made 
</p>
<p>before its adoption. 
</p>
<p>64. All draft laws directly affecting the rights and interest of citizens had been subject to 
</p>
<p>thorough consideration and wide discussion, taking into account the opinions of human 
</p>
<p>rights experts. 
</p>
<p>65. The delegation reported on the reform of the law enforcement agencies that had been 
</p>
<p>carried out in order to bring law enforcement work into line with international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards and to establish an effective system for maintaining public order and security. In 
</p>
<p>the framework of the reform, new criteria for assessing the work of the law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies had been developed with the active participation of civil society representatives, 
</p>
<p>and an internal and external monitoring system had been put in place to ensure transparency 
</p>
<p>and accountability in the work of the law enforcement agencies. Reforming the Academy 
</p>
<p>attached to the Ministry of Affairs, in particular improving its curriculum and teaching 
</p>
<p>methods, had been identified as a key factor for the effective implementation of a new 
</p>
<p>model for the work of the law enforcement agencies. New procedures and processes for the </p>


<p>recruitment and promotion of police officers had been developed in cooperation with civil 
</p>
<p>society. The reform&#8217;s objectives included the formation of a multi-ethnic police force and 
</p>
<p>gender equality within the law enforcement agencies. Nevertheless, significant work still 
</p>
<p>remained to be carried out in cooperation with civil society and international organizations, 
</p>
<p>as the reform was in its initial stage of implementation. 
</p>
<p>66. Regarding questions on domestic violence, the Ministry of Internal Affairs had 
</p>
<p>developed instructions and regulations to organize the law enforcement bodies to prevent 
</p>
<p>domestic violence effectively and implement the Social and Legal Protection against 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence Act. Amendments to the Administrative Code had also been drafted and 
</p>
<p>adopted at the initiative of the Ministry of Interior in order to ensure harsher administrative 
</p>
<p>penalties for domestic violence, including administrative detention up to five days. A 
</p>
<p>memorandum of understanding had been signed between the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
</p>
<p>and crisis centres to organize their cooperation in combating domestic violence and bride-
</p>
<p>kidnapping. The delegation referred to the significant increase in registered cases of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence in the period 2010&#8211;2014, owing to the effective response of police 
</p>
<p>officers and the cooperation established between local authorities, social and health workers 
</p>
<p>and civil society representatives. 
</p>
<p>67. The legal amendments to the Criminal Code provided harsher punishments for the 
</p>
<p>abduction of women and girls for the purpose of marriage, as well as for the forced 
</p>
<p>marriage of girls. Those legal amendments had been drafted during extensive consultations 
</p>
<p>with civil society representatives and international organizations. 
</p>
<p>68. Several measures had been taken to: ensure unhindered access to justice; protect 
</p>
<p>defence lawyers, witnesses and victims against threats and harassment during trials, 
</p>
<p>including those related to the 2010 ethnic conflict; and ensure public security and stability 
</p>
<p>after the violent events of June 2010. In that respect, a special unit within the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Interior Affairs had been established for the protection of the rights of witnesses. 
</p>
<p>69. Torture had become a criminal offence in 2003. However, no one had been 
</p>
<p>prosecuted for the crime of torture. The reason was that the occurrence of torture in 
</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan had been recognized at all levels only in 2010. Consequently, a number of 
</p>
<p>measures had been undertaken to combat torture and ill-treatment since 2010, in particular 
</p>
<p>the inclusion of anti-torture provisions in the Constitution and the adoption of the National 
</p>
<p>Plan to Combat Torture. Monitoring by the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to uncover cases of torture 
</p>
<p>and ill-treatment had been strengthened and the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office now conducted 
</p>
<p>systematic and unannounced visits to places of deprivation of liberty. A harsher penalty had 
</p>
<p>been established for torture, which had become a serious crime in law. Methodology and 
</p>
<p>instructions had been developed on how to investigate effectively cases of torture and ill-
</p>
<p>treatment. Almost all temporary detention sites and investigation cells had been equipped 
</p>
<p>with cameras for internal monitoring.  
</p>
<p>70. An important means of combating torture was the Memorandum on Cooperation in 
</p>
<p>Protecting Human Rights and Freedoms, signed in 2012 by the Ombudsman, the 
</p>
<p>Procurator-General, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice, the State Penal Correction Service, the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
</p>
<p>in Europe and human rights organizations. The signatories of the memorandum were 
</p>
<p>entitled to carry out joint visits to places of deprivation of liberty throughout the country 
</p>
<p>without prior authorization. The preventive measures had resulted in a decrease in reported 
</p>
<p>cases of torture and ill-treatment in 2013 and in 2014 as compared to previous years. 
</p>
<p>71. Several legal acts had been adopted to combat terrorism and extremism, given the 
</p>
<p>serious threats to public security, and sanctions against persons committing such crimes had 
</p>
<p>been stepped up. Nevertheless, the respective laws and regulations set clear rules and 
</p>
<p>conditions for the use of force and firearms by State security officers.  </p>

</p>
<p>special procedure mandate holders. It welcomed legislation that increased penalties for
