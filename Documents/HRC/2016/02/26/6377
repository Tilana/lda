</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its resolution 6/8 of 28 September 2007 and decision 2/104 of 
</p>
<p>27 November 2006 on human rights and equitable access to safe drinking water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 
</p>
<p>15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Council and 5/2 on 
</p>
<p>the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Council, of 18 
</p>
<p>June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his/her duties in 
</p>
<p>accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> relevant provisions of declarations and programmes with 
</p>
<p>regard to access to safe drinking water and sanitation adopted at major United Nations 
</p>
<p>conferences and summits and by the General Assembly at its special sessions and 
</p>
<p>their follow-up meetings, inter alia the Mar del Plata Action Plan on Water 
</p>
<p>Development and Administration, Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Conference on Environment and Development or the Habitat Agenda adopted by the 
</p>
<p>Habitat II conference, </p>

<p>  
 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> commitments made by the international community to fully 
</p>
<p>implement the Millennium Development Goals and stressing, in that context, the 
</p>
<p>resolve of the Heads of State and Government, as expressed in the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Millennium Declaration, to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without 
</p>
<p>sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution 61/192 of 20 December 2006, in 
</p>
<p>which the Assembly declared 2008 the International Year of Sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that over one billion people lack access to safe drinking 
</p>
<p>water and that 2.6 billion lack access to basic sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that international human rights law instruments, including the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child entail obligations in relation to access to safe drinking 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation, 
</p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>that certain aspects of human rights obligations related to the access to 
</p>
<p>safe drinking water and sanitation have yet to be further studied, as pointed out in the 
</p>
<p>report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the scope and 
</p>
<p>content of the relevant human rights obligations related to equitable access to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation under international human rights instruments 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/6/3), 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> the need to focus on local and national perspectives in considering 
</p>
<p>the issue, leaving aside questions of international watercourse law and all 
</p>
<p>transboundary water issues, 
</p>
