The registrant’s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent

control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
 
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the registrant’s control over financial reporting.
