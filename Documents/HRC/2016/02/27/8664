<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 At the invitation of the Government of Afghanistan, the Working Group on the use 
of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights 
of peoples to self-determination visited the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan from 4 to 9 
April 2009. The Working Group welcomed this opportunity to engage in a constructive 
dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on issues related to its mandate. 
</p>
<p> Afghanistan, together with Iraq, represents the largest theatre of operations for 
private military and security companies (PMSCs). The United States, which has the largest 
military and diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, is the principal employer of private 
security in the country. Since 2005, the deterioration of the security situation due to a 
growing insurgency has led to an increased demand for security, in particular from the 
international community. The Government of Afghanistan has acknowledged its limitations 
in providing adequate security to the international community present in its territory and 
allowed for foreign and national private security companies to supply additional security. 
</p>
<p> The Government of Afghanistan has also stressed the need for prompt adoption of 
procedures to regulate and monitor the activities of these companies, saying that the lack of

</p>
<p>rules governing the activities carried out by PMSCs created a culture of impunity 
dangerous for the stability of the country. Civil society had a negative perception of the 
large presence of PMSCs, in particular with regard to the difficulty of differentiating the 
legal army and police from foreign troops, PMSCs or even illegal armed groups. 
</p>
<p> A comprehensive regulation was adopted by the Council of Ministers in February 
2008 and is still in force today. The Regulation led to the licensing of 39 Afghan and 
foreign companies<b>1</b> and the registration of their personnel and weapons. The Regulation, if 
properly implemented, is an important step to ensuring monitoring and accountability of 
PMSCs. 
</p>
<p> However the adoption of a regulation is not sufficient in itself to ensure adequate 
oversight and improved human rights protection. The Working Group stresses the 
fundamental principle of the control of the State over the use of force and welcomes the 
willingness of the Government of Afghanistan to gradually increase capacity and training 
of the State army, police and security forces in order to ensure the safety and security of its 
population and of the international community present in its territory, while ensuring 
respect for the rule of law and human rights. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of its findings, the Working Group makes several recommendations to 
the Government of Afghanistan, including that it should investigate, disarm and prosecute 
all PMSCs operating without licences in the country and investigate all reported cases of 
incidents involving casualties committed by private security contractors, prosecute the 
perpetrators and ensure effective remedy for victims. It also recommends the establishment 
of an independent public complaints mechanism to which the local population and civilian 
international actors could submit complaints about violations committed by PMSCs. In 
addition, the Working Group addressed recommendations to the international community. 
In particular, it calls for the publication of statistics regarding private military and security 
casualties and civilian casualties resulting from the activities of PMSCs, and increased 
oversight over the PMSCs they employ. Finally, it encourages the Government of 
Afghanistan to seek the assistance of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 
(UNAMA) in the implementation of these recommendations.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Afghanistan, the Working Group visited 
Afghanistan from 4 to 9 April 2009. In accordance with general practice, the Working 
Group was represented by two of its members, in this case, Alexander Nikitin, and Amada 
Benavides de P&#233;rez.2  
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group is grateful to the Government of Afghanistan for its invitation 
and for its cooperation throughout the planning and conduct of its visit. Due to the volatile 
security situation in the country, the Working Group was only able to visit the capital Kabul 
and Jalalabad, in the eastern province of Nangarhar. The Working Group could not travel to 
the southern provinces, in particular to the province of Kandahar where there is a large 
presence of PMSCs.   
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/2, the Working 
Group is called upon to &#8220;monitor mercenaries and mercenary-related activities in all their 
forms and manifestations in different parts of the world&#8221; as well as to &#8220;study the effects of 
the activities of private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and security 
services on the international market on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly the right 
of peoples to self-determination, and to prepare draft international basic principles that 
encourage respect for human rights on the part of those companies in their activities&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>4. For the purpose of this report, the Working Group defines private military and 
security companies (PMSCs) as corporate entities which provide on a compensatory basis 
military and/or security services by physical persons and/or legal entities. Military and 
security services include, in particular, armed guarding and protection of persons and 
objects, such as convoys, buildings and other places; specialized services related to military 
actions including strategic planning, intelligence, investigation; prisoner detention; and 
advice to or training of local forces and security personnel. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group received information on the numbers, types, structures and 
activities of PMSCs operating in the country and on the scope and extent of their activities. 
It focused in particular on the system of regulation of activities of PMSCs registered in 
Afghanistan and the requirements, if any, for transparency and accountability of PMSCs 
and their personnel. The Working Group also examined events involving PMSCs which 
might have given rise to impunity on the part of contractors for violations of human rights. 
Finally, the Working Group looked at the issue of access to effective remedies for victims 
of violations. 
</p>
<p>6. During this visit, the Working Group met with representatives of the Office of the 
President, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Justice, the Interior and Defense, the office of 
the Attorney General and the chairs and members of the Committee on Legislative Affairs 
of the Wolesi Jirga (the National Assembly), the Committee on Internal Security, National 
Security and local organs of power of the Meshrano Jirga and the Prosecutor&#8217;s office of 
Military affairs. The Working Group also had the opportunity to meet with representatives 
of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and heard the views of civil society 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the 
</p>
<p>exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination was established by Commission on Human 
Rights resolution 2005/12. The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving in 
their personal capacities. Since March 2009, Shaista Shameem (Fiji) has been the Chairperson-
Rapporteur. The other members are Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia), Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del 
Prado (Spain), Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation), and Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya). </p>

</b></p>
<p>and representatives of PMSCs. In its visit to Jalalabad, the Working Group met with the 
provincial governor and other local authorities. Meetings were also held with 
representatives of the Embassies of the United States of America and the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Deputy Special Representative of the United 
Nations Secretary-General for Afghanistan and representatives of all United Nations 
agencies present in Afghanistan, including the United Nations Department of Safety and 
Security. The Working Group would like to thank the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
Afghanistan (UNAMA) and especially its Human Rights Unit for facilitating its mission. 
</p><p>7. The Working Group regrets the incident in which its convoy was stopped by a local 
private security company, and one of its vehicles and the occupants searched and 
fingerprinted by United States soldiers in violation of the privileges and immunities of 
United Nations officials on mission. The Working Group has received a copy of the formal 
letter of apology from the United States Army Commanding Major General sent on 10 May 
2009 to the UNAMA Special Representative of the Secretary-General and to the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights commitments 
</b></p>
<p>8. Afghanistan has ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women. Afghanistan is also a party to the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, 
and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography. It has ratified the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court as well as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide.  
</p>
<p>9. Afghanistan is not a party to the International Convention against the Recruitment, 
Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Private military and security companies operating in 
Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context 
</b></p>
<p>10. Afghanistan is currently one of the two biggest theatres of operations for PMSCs. 
The United States, which has the largest military and diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, is 
the largest employer of private security in the country. PMSCs have supported the military 
operations of the United Nations-mandated International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) 
and the United States-led &#8220;Operation Enduring Freedom&#8221; since their inception in 2001. The 
long process towards rebuilding the Afghan National Police and the Afghan National Army 
coupled with a growing insurgency, have led to an increased demand for the services of 
PMSCs in recent years. The increasing demand for security has also led to a burgeoning of 
local Afghan-owned PMSCs. Both local and international PMSCs have recruited widely 
among former militia members and various armed groups for experienced personnel.  
</p>
<p>11. After eight years of international efforts to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan, the 
general security situation remains very tense, with Afghanistan ranking seventh in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-14357 
</p>
<p>Failed States Index (FSI) of the United States-based Fund for Peace,3 immediately after 
Iraq. In 2009, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) recorded a 
14 per cent increase in civilian casualties compared to the previous year, making the death 
toll in 2009 the highest since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Anti-Government 
elements (AGEs) remain responsible for the largest proportion of civilian casualties.4 
</p><p>12. The rampant insecurity throughout the country has led many to call on the services 
of PMSCs to ensure their protection. For example, foreign Governments have contracted 
PMSCs to protect their embassies and interests while private businesses or contractors and 
some international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have hired PMSCs to ensure 
their protection when carrying out projects in zones where the insurgency is active. The 
United Nations has also been contracting individual private security contractors and local 
PMSCs to protect its compounds in several conflict-prone areas of the country, including 
Kabul and some other field offices. The use of PMSCs increased drastically prior to and 
during the 2009 elections.  
</p>
<p>13. The High Commissioner for Human Rights emphasized the impact of PMSCs on 
human rights in Afghanistan, in particular when unregulated, in her annual report dated 21 
February 2008. She stated that PMSCs were increasingly being drawn into military-type 
activities when operating in volatile areas and provided two examples of incidents in which 
they were involved in fighting.5  
</p>
<p>14. The presence and activities of PMSCs in Afghanistan are very much interconnected 
with the large number of unauthorized armed groups of various kinds on Afghan territory. 
The Ministry of the Interior (MoI) has estimated that no fewer than 2,500 unauthorized 
armed groups were operating in those provinces under governmental control, which 
represent less than half the territory of the country. Many de facto non-State armed groups 
have used the regularization process for PMSCs to disguise their groupings as private 
security companies, reinforcing the perception that PMSCs were a threat to stability.6 
</p>
<p>15. Existing PMSCs &#8212; especially local companies but also some international ones &#8212; 
became a &#8220;reservoir&#8221; for adoption and legalization of armed individuals with military skills 
who in the recent past had belonged to unauthorized military groupings. 
</p>
<p>16. Former armed elements, whether considered to be warlords or anti-Government 
elements, could either join the Government armed forces (Afghan National Police or 
Armed Forces), disband under the Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups (DIAG) 
programme, transform into a public protection force in an arrangement with local 
authorities (in specific regions), join the border monitoring brigades or register as 
employees of one of the officially licensed private security companies. Some also continued 
operating individually or in small groups as armed elements, and some were hired to 
provide security services, by international forces inter alia.

 The Fund for Peace has published multilateral ratings of failed States (estimating aggregated 
</p>
<p>parameters of loss of governmental control over the territory, growth of corruption, criminalization of 
society, etc.) annually since 2005; see www.fundforpeace.org. The Brookings Institution ranked 
Afghanistan second only to Somalia in its index of the 141 weakest States in the developing world 
(Rice, Susan E. and Patrick, Stewart, <i>Index of State Weakness in the Developing World </i>(The 
Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C., 2008). www.brookings.edu/reports/2008/~/media/Files 
/rc/reports/2008/02_weak_states_index/02_weak_states_index.pdf) while the United Nations Human 
Development Index ranks it 181 out of the 182 countries profiled (http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/).

<p>17. In Jalalabad, for example, the Working Group was informed that the Afghan 
National Police in the province of Nangarhar had counted 500 private security entities 
operating in the eastern region which were not registered with the MoI. These illegal 
entities, with a minimum of five men, fall under the definition of illegal armed groups and 
should be dismantled. By comparison, there were only six PMSCs registered with the MoI 
operating in the area.  
</p>
<p>18. Foreign PMSCs and international forces also used to recruit former militias, or still 
do so, in particular to guard Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and Forward 
Operating Bases (FOBs) and to work alongside Special Forces, especially in the south of 
the country and where international forces are based.7  
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group is particularly concerned about the information that the 
international military forces (IMF) are directly recruiting Afghan security guards operating 
under their command. In Nangarhar, these are known as the Shaheen unit and it is not clear 
whether it falls under the control and command of the Afghan MoI or not. Without 
transparency on structure and command, accountability cannot be guaranteed. This concern 
has been raised by the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), 
which stressed the lack of accountability of militia groups operating under the umbrella of 
PMSCs. AIHRC was also worried that those former warlords who also own important 
PMSCs could challenge the authority of the Government.  
</p>
<p>20. For example, a shooting incident occurred on 29 June 2009 between armed Afghan 
Special Guards (also referred to by the local population as &#8220;Afghan Special Forces&#8221;) and 
Afghan National Police (ANP) inside the Attorney General&#8217;s office in Kandahar. Reports 
state that the Afghan Special Guards opened fire and killed the Chief of Police, the head of 
criminal investigations and four other ANP officers. There were unconfirmed reports of 
civilian casualties. While the precise identity and chain of command of the Afghan Special 
Guards is unclear, according to information received they are an Afghan private entity 
operating as a security company. Information received indicates that they may be working 
with or led by American Special Forces in Afghanistan, or armed international intelligence 
services. According to reports quoting police records, 41 suspects were arrested in 
connection with the incident and were waiting to be charged before the court in Kabul. The 
Working Group sent a communication on 17 July 2009 to the Government of Afghanistan 
regarding this incident.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Mapping of private military and security companies operating in 
Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>21. It is difficult to estimate with accuracy the number of PMSCs in Afghanistan as 
there are reportedly some Afghan PMSCs not registered with the MoI. According to the 
information received, the estimated number of PMSCs operating in the country until early 
2008 varied between 60 and 90 companies. In addition to local companies, foreign PMSCs 
were in the majority registered in the United States and the United Kingdom, with some in 
Canada, Germany, South Africa and the Netherlands. Third-country nationals are also 
being recruited by international PMSCs.8 The number of PMSCs may increase given 
United States troop surges and NATO operations.

<p>22. The Regulation adopted in February 2008 (see following chapters) led to the 
licensing of 399 Afghan and foreign companies and the registration of their personnel and 
weapons. Of the 39 companies, 18 were Afghan owned and 21 were foreign or 
international, with 10 registered in the United States, 8 in the United Kingdom and 3 in 
other countries.10

<p>23. Following the example of Iraq and the establishment of a Private Security Company 
Association of Iraq (PSCAI) &#8220;to discuss and address matters of mutual interest and concern 
to the industry conducting operations in Iraq&#8221;,11 the main international companies in 
Afghanistan have been grouped together in a Private Security Company Association of 
Afghanistan (PSCAA). However, the PSCAA Chairman12 told the Working Group that 
PSCAA had not been registered formally as an association or an NGO in accordance with 
national laws and remained more of an informal club or network of international security 
companies. Its influence and role have remained limited to preserving the interests of the 
companies and it has not adopted a code of conduct for the industry and does not monitor 
the conduct of its members.  
</p>
<p>24. The exact number of PMSC personnel is difficult to ascertain and the Government 
was not able to provide the Working Group with statistics. According to academic studies, 
the estimated number of PMSC personnel varied from 18,000 to 28,000 before the adoption

<p>of the Regulation.13 The Regulation imposed a cap of 500 personnel per registered 
company, although it seems that was not rigorously enforced, with a number of companies 
employing a higher number of personnel. This number is likely to increase in the coming 
months given increased insecurity due to the growing insurgency attacks. The number of 
PMSCs will also increase to match the deployment of additional military forces as 
announced by the American President with the new United States strategy for Afghanistan. 
Already by August 2009, the total number of PMSC personnel contracted by the United 
States Department of Defense had increased by 19 per cent.14 At the end of October 2009, 
the Working Group was informed by the Government of Afghanistan that, with the increase 
in registered companies from 39 to 52, 24,690 personnel were operating in Afghanistan, of 
whom 19,928 were nationals and 4,772 international employees.  
</p>
<p>25. The Government of the United States is the main employer of PMSCs in 
Afghanistan, employing about a quarter of all private security personnel, according to the 
Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. The companies are usually 
managed by United States staff and employ about 85 per cent Afghan nationals with 
sometimes a small proportion of third-country nationals.15  
</p>
<p>26. The main services provided by PMSCs range from traditional guarding to more 
novel high-tech intelligence and risk management services. They are mainly known to 
provide static guarding of premises and construction projects (e.g. offices, residences, 
embassies, checkpoints, international organizations) and escort and protection services (e.g. 
VIPs, civilian and military convoys). These services are provided in Kabul as well as in 
active battle zones. For example, in July 2009 the United States Army solicited information 
from prospective contractors who would develop a security plan for 50 or more forward 
operating bases and smaller command outposts across Afghanistan, used to support tactical 
operations.16  
</p>
<p>27. In addition, PMSCs are also providing consulting services (e.g. policy development 
for the Ministries of the Interior and Defence), training (e.g. for the Afghan National Police 
and Army), logistics support (including for military support operations), intelligence and 
risk management services (for the military, private companies and non-governmental 
organizations), including electronic security and surveillance. Some companies are also 
specialized in demining and poppy eradication. 17 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group received allegations that one or possibly more PMSCs had been 
contracted to undertake interrogation of detainees. The Working Group has not obtained 
evidence of such allegation in Afghanistan but notes that, given their use in United States 
custody in Iraq, similar arrangements may have been in place.

<p>Working Group notes that by protecting Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) or individuals or 
projects in conflict zones, a civilian contractor may lose protection under international 
humanitarian law by protecting legitimate military targets. The International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC) stressed the extreme difficulty of determining whether the activity of 
a private security contractor is of a civilian or military nature: &#8220;The line between the 
defence of military personnel and other military objectives against enemy attacks (direct 
participation in hostilities) and the protection of those same persons and objects against 
crime or violence unrelated to the hostilities (law enforcement/defence of self or others) 
may be thin. It is therefore particularly important in this context to observe the general rules 
of [international humanitarian law] on precautions and presumptions in situations of 
doubt.&#8221;18 Others are even more explicit: &#8220;A civilian government employee or private 
contractor defending military personnel or military objectives from enemy attack directly 
participates in hostilities. His or her actions are indistinguishable from the quintessential 
duties of combat personnel.&#8221;19  
</p>
<p>30. The two examples below illustrate how the distinction between military and civilian 
activities can be blurred. In August 2008, Afghan employees of two private security 
companies (Compass, and US Protection and Investigations (USPI)) may have 
inadvertently killed a Canadian soldier during a firefight between insurgents and Canadian 
soldiers. The contractors thought insurgents were attacking them as they travelled along the 
Kandahar-Herat highway and returned fire, while the Canadian soldiers were engaged in an 
operation against the insurgents.20 In another incident in October 2008, the United States 
forces in Afghanistan killed up to 20 Afghan private security guards in an air strike after 
claiming they were attacked by the guards.21 
</p>
<p>31. Many PMSCs in Afghanistan hire armed staff owing to the problem of obtaining 
arms legally in Afghanistan. Currently, only the Government of Afghanistan, foreign 
military and embassies are allowed to import a limited number of weapons for use by their 
international staff.  
</p>
<p>32. According to data of the Kabul Police, 35 private security companies possessed 
4,968 units of registered weapons of various types in 2008 (registered under the names of 
1,431 employees). The police authorities informed the Working Group that private security 
companies possess no fewer than 44,000 registered and unregistered weapons. A total of 
17,000 weapons were confiscated by the Ministry of the Interior (MoI) within the 
framework of the DIAG (Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups) programme, while 
another 18,000 were officially registered as belonging to 39 licensed companies. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The regulation process 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Government of Afghanistan began its work towards regulating the industry in 
late 2004. In March 2005, the MoI issued a ministerial directive ordering the Criminal 
Investigation Unit to officially start registering PSCs.22 A year later, the newly appointed

 The Government of Afghanistan refers to Private Security Companies (PSCs) only and not to 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14357 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>MoI tasked a Commission composed of representatives from the Ministries of the Interior, 
Defence and Justice to continue working on a PSC law, in consultation with UNAMA, 
ISAF and embassies. However it was only after private security guards were found guilty of 
robbing several banks in Kabul that President Karzai passed a presidential decree (No. 
4549) on 5 February 2007 tasking a new commission to develop a regulation on PSCs.23 
</p><p>34. In February 2007, a resolution from the Council of Ministers gave authority to the 
MoI to undertake a survey and register PSCs operating in Afghanistan. In its draft 
Government Policy on Private Security Companies of August 2007,24 the Government 
stated that despite significant improvements and reforms in many areas, Afghanistan 
remained &#8220;an institutionally unstable and weak State&#8221; and allowed the Government and the 
international community present in the territory to hire international or local PMSCs to 
ensure their protection. It insisted that PMSCs should comply with Afghan laws and 
recognize international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>35. It also recognized the urgent need to regulate and monitor the activities of PMSCs in 
a coordinated and precise manner and through a set of clear mechanisms, stating that an 
excessive reliance on PMSCs could undermine the State&#8217;s legitimate monopoly on the use 
of force in the absence of effective regulatory and monitoring mechanisms to ensure 
accountability among all stakeholders.25 
</p>
<p>36. In response to this assessment of a legislative gap, the Joint Secretariat of the 
Disarmament and Reintegration Commission of the Ministry of the Interior began work on 
a regulation aimed at filling the existing legal gaps in the regulation of the activities of 
private security companies. These efforts led to the release by the Ministry of Interior in 
February 2008 of a &#8220;Procedure for Regulating Activities of Private Security Companies in 
Afghanistan.&#8221; The procedure states that its goal is &#8220;to ensure transparency, accountability 
and quality services by private security companies in accordance with the laws of 
Afghanistan&#8221;. The document also states that the Government cannot allow illegal armed 
groups to transform into private security companies.26 
</p>
<p>37. Several other draft laws on regulating PMSCs have also been submitted to 
Parliament, including one during the Working Group&#8217;s visit in April of 2009, but none has 
been adopted so far.27 The Parliament sent back the draft law without discussing it, arguing 
that the not-yet-established Independent Commission for Overseeing Implementation of the 
Constitution, once established, should examine the legitimacy of having PMSCs operate in 
the country. The Working Group did not receive a copy of the draft law but is of the 
understanding that the language of the new draft law broadly reflects the wording of the 
regulation.28

 The Working Group is of the understanding that the draft law under discussion in Parliament 
</p>
<p>proposes to change the word &#8220;security&#8221; to &#8220;protection&#8221;, which would make the wording, if adopted, 
&#8220;private protection company&#8221;. The Working Group recommends the adoption of a broader definition 
of PMSCs in the draft law which would include all military and security services in order to avoid 
situations where some companies could argue that the legislation does not apply to them. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-14357 
</p>
<p><b> D. The regulation and its implementation 
</b></p>
<p>38. The &#8220;Procedure for Regulating Activities of Private Security Companies in 
Afghanistan&#8221; was approved by the Council of Ministers at its meeting on 7 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>39. The first part of the regulation comprises 40 articles regulating private security 
companies while the second part is composed of guidance and samples of documents to 
assist companies in their compliance with the regulation. The implementation of the 
regulation led to the licensing of 39 Afghan and foreign companies and the registration of 
their personnel and weapons.29 
</p>
<p>40. The Procedure lists the activities that private security companies are not allowed to 
perform (art. 6: Illicit activities), the composition and functions of the High Coordination 
Board (arts. 8&#8211;10), responsible for issuing licences and monitoring compliance of PMSCs, 
the conditions for applying for an operational licence (arts. 11&#8211;17) and conditions of 
employment (art. 18). It goes on to define the monitoring and reporting obligations (arts. 
28&#8211;29), and the procedure in the case of violations (art. 31), including the conditions for 
licence cancellation and for stopping the activities of companies in violation of the 
Procedure (art. 32). The regulation also covers issues of legal registration and usage of 
vehicles, weapons and ammunition as well as the use of uniform. 
</p>
<p>41. It states clearly that PSCs must coordinate and cooperate with the Afghan security 
forces in conducting their activities. PSCs are prohibited from employing the staff of the 
Afghan National Army (ANA), Afghan National Police (ANP) and the National Directorate 
of Security (NDS) for their own activities. 
</p><p>42. Personnel from PSCs are required to wear uniforms and specific logos. The 
regulation prohibits the buying, selling and distribution of weapons, ammunition and 
explosives as well as the use and transport and transfer of medium to heavy weapons and 
&#8220;heavily&#8221; armoured vehicles (art. 21). 
43. Article 20 prohibits high-ranking government officials and their relatives up to the 
second degree from being the owner or partner of a security company. Despite this rule, the 
Working Group notes that in at least one case a company affiliated to a government official 
has been granted a licence in contradiction with this article. The company concerned is 
NCL Holdings, LLC., which was founded by Hamed Wardak, the son of the current 
Defence Minister.30 
</p>
<p>44. The regulation establishes a regulatory Board &#8212; the High Coordination Board 
(HCB) &#8212; responsible for monitoring the activities of PSCs, awarding licences and carrying 
out investigations in the case of violation of the Procedure. The Board shall investigate any 
violations committed by a PMSC and decide on possible suspension and/or dissolution of 
the company. It also has authority to process complaints from the general public, clients 
and individual members of PSCs in relation to violations by PSCs, to conduct 
investigations and to make case-by-case decisions. The Board consists of seven to nine 
members from the Government, appointed by the Ministry of Interior after approval of the 
President. It is stated that the Board should be chaired by a senior member of the MoI. 
Other members should include the heads of the Departments of Counter-Terrorism and 
Criminal Investigations, and representatives of NDS, the Ministry of Finance, the National 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 The regulation adopted by the Government defines security companies as &#8220;a profit making, non-
</p>
<p>political and non-governmental company that functions according to the provisions of this procedure 
to establish security of natural and real persons&#8221;.

<p>Security Council (NSC), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industries. A representative of UNAMA (or an independent international expert) with an 
advisory function could be included for the purpose of increasing transparency. At the time 
of the mission, the Board was being established and had not yet received any complaints. 
</p>
<p>45. Annex 1 to the Procedure is the &#8220;Law on Using of Force by Private Security 
Companies in Afghanistan.&#8221; It states in particular the obligation to cooperate with national 
and international security forces, limits the use of force to self-defence in accordance with 
the law, in the case that the person or property protected is under attack and in the case of 
attack against civilians. It also specifies the provision of training for the personnel of PSCs 
and underlines the need to take all necessary measures to prevent civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Licensing process 
</b></p>
<p>46. As stated above, the regulation on PSCs led to the licensing of 39 companies from 
February 2008 to April 2009, of which 20 are foreign owned and 19 Afghan owned. The 
MoI informed the Working Group that prior to the enactment of the regulation, 63 
companies were operating in the country but that 24 had not obtained authorization to 
continue their activities. The Working Group was told that, during this licensing process, 
eight PMSCs (seven Afghan and one British) operating illegally were forced to shut down 
by the Afghan police.31 However, several representatives from embassies told the Working 
Group that in the run-up to regulation, American and British PMSCs and their clients were 
being unnecessarily &#8220;harassed&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>47. During the Working Group&#8217;s meeting with the MoI, officials stated that the 
Government believed that the 39 companies licensed fulfilled the security demands of the 
country at the present stage and did not believe other companies would be licensed in the 
immediate future.32 In addition, a cap of a maximum of 500 personnel for companies was 
imposed. 
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group was informed that companies that were not licensed through 
this process had to cease their activities accordingly or would otherwise be considered to be 
illegal armed groups. The Government was not able to confirm whether all those companies 
that had not obtained licences had indeed ceased their operations in the country or if they 
were still operating illegally. No information was provided as to the measures taken by the 
Government to ensure that such companies would cease their activities in the country. 
However, as noted above, an additional 13 companies, including 9 local PMSCs were 
granted licences a few months later, indicating that the Government of Afghanistan was 
subject to internal and external pressure to open its market more widely. 
</p><p>49. The Working Group received information from other sources that illegal Afghan 
companies were still operating in the country without licences, in particular outside the 
capital. For example, the Working Group was told that there were reportedly a dozen local 
armed security groups operating without licences in the province of Nangarhar. The 
Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) confirmed that 
unauthorized companies were still operating in different parts of the country, in particular 
in areas outside Kabul. The Commission also underlined the lack of capacity within the 
Government to properly monitor the activities of PMSCs and the culture of corruption and 
lack of accountability. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31
 Information provided by UNAMA, 29 October 2007. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32
 Clearly this assessment changed with the licensing of 13 additional companies between April and 
</p>
<p>October 2009, including 5 international and 8 local companies. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-14357 
</p>
<p>50. The High Coordination Board (HCB) tasked with granting licences and monitoring 
the activities of PMSCs is supposed to be represented at the regional level, in each of the 
five provinces at the governor level. However, the Governor of Nangarhar informed the 
Working Group that licences were issued in Kabul without any coordination with the 
provincial authorities. The local authorities have no access to the contracts signed by the 
companies operating in their provinces and no capacity to disband PMSCs operating 
without licences. 
</p>
<p>51. Concerns were raised about the subjectivity and lack of transparency regarding the 
licensing process. The process of selection and registration of a limited number of 39 
PMSCs seemed to be responding more to commercial and personal interest than a 
competitive process taking into account human rights considerations, including individually 
issued permissions for some companies to exceed the established limit of 500 employees, 
and involving attempts by previously registered Afghan companies to exclude their 
competitors from registration. The very process of selection and imposition of limits has 
become the subject of political and commercial competition, and is currently being 
questioned by some of the ministries and agencies on the grounds that it was not based 
upon a law (which is still in the process of adoption), and therefore could be revised once 
the law is adopted. 
</p>
<p>52. Both the United States and United Kingdom representatives stated their support for 
the legislative efforts undertaken by the Government of Afghanistan. However, they raised 
concerns about a law that they considered would be too restrictive and that would impede 
free trade and freedom of choice. They told the Working Group members that they had 
conveyed their concern about the draft law to the authorities, stressing that over-restrictive 
legislation would be counterproductive. They insisted that foreign Governments should be 
free to decide which companies they could hire and that imposing a 500-employee cap on 
PMSCs was in effect putting hurdles in the way of large companies that provide high 
quality services.33 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights impact 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Impact of private military and security companies on the local 
population 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Working Group met with several international and local non-governmental 
organizations. The vast majority of these stressed that the high presence of armed private 
guards did not generate a feeling of increased security among the Afghan population and 
that, to the contrary, the large number of armed individuals, vehicles and weapons created a 
feeling of fear and insecurity. This was reiterated by AIHRC. Most NGOs pointed to the 
difficulty for Afghan citizens of distinguishing between international troops and 
international or local security contractors. This, they said, complicated the process of 
accurately reporting incidents and human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>54. In its draft Government Policy of August 2007, the Government of Afghanistan 
highlighted some of the main complaints received from the Afghan population regarding 
PMSCs and their personnel. These complaints included the lack of transparency and 
accountability; disrespect for local security forces and lack of collaboration; difficulty of 
distinguishing PMSCs from the regular armed forces given similar and indistinguishable 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33
 Recent information that 13 new companies have received licences since the visit of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group tends to demonstrate that these pressures for more flexibility were looked at positively. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-14357 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>uniforms and unmarked vehicles; the obstruction of access to official buildings and roads; 
and the intimidation suffered by local Afghans from PMSCs.34 
</p>
<p>55. A research fellow for the NGO swisspeace conducted a study on the perception of 
PMSCs by the local population in 2007, where she found that there was a feeling among 
those interviewed that the absence of regulation encouraged bad behaviour, bad business 
practices, corruption, lack of accountability and impunity for those working for PMSCs.35 
</p>
<p>56. Most civil society organizations recognized that the adoption of a specific procedure 
to regulate PMSCs was positively received by the population, which had asked for greater 
transparency and accountability. This was confirmed to us by the MoI, which stated that 
although the general perception remained mainly negative, the introduction of specific 
regulations had contributed to improving the situation. However, police sources said that 
about a dozen companies had been suspected of involvement in criminal activities and were 
expected to be closed or forced to cease operations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Lack of accountability and transparency 
</b></p>
<p>57. AIHRC conveyed to the Working Group the lack of clarity regarding the jurisdiction 
applicable to PMSCs and the lack of accountability when crimes have been committed. By 
contrast with the immunity accord granted to PMSCs working for United States forces in 
Iraq until the end of 2008, in Afghanistan all PMSC personnel are subject to Afghan laws. 
However, despite concurring reports of the involvement of PMSCs in human rights 
violations, the Working Group could not obtain documented and verifiable evidence of 
these violations. There has been no prosecution at the national level for human rights 
violations by PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>58. The Board set up by the regulation is designed to act as a central body for the 
registration and investigation of all incidents involving PMSCs. However, the mechanism 
was not yet functioning and the population was not aware of its role. AIHRC has set up its 
own special investigation team, but is already busy investigating many human rights abuses 
and lacks the capacity to investigate allegations of incidents involving PMSCs. 
</p>
<p>59. The Working Group received information about the involvement of PMSC 
contractors in robberies, kidnapping, interrogation, torture of detainees and irregular and 
abusive house inspections. The MoI confirmed cases of excessive use of force. 
</p>
<p>60. In one case, local private security contractors are alleged to have shot seven adult 
males and injured one child in what appear to have been extrajudicial killings. On 27 
October 2008, the international military forces (IMF) and Anti-Government elements 
(AGEs) engaged in an exchange of fire in the Haft Asyab area, Saydabad District, Wardak 
Province, which killed 11 AGEs and injured 12 others.36 During the fighting, private 
security contractors working for the RWA Road and Construction Engineering Company 
entered Hakim Khail village in the Haft Asyab area and, according to witnesses, entered a 
house, forced out the adult males inside and shot them one by one. A child who tried to run 
away was allegedly shot in the back.37 Other reports state that five people were killed by 
IMF air strikes during the operation. No information has been provided on whether this 
incident has been fully investigated and anyone prosecuted.

</p>
<p>61. The Prosecutor&#8217;s office of Military Affairs submitted to the Working Group a list of 
15 criminal activities carried out by PSCs that are currently under investigation by the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s office, concerning the smuggling and illegal transport of weapons and 
ammunition since 2006. Most cases concern local companies, including some that are not 
on the list of licensed companies. Several of these cases also relate to the United States 
company USPI accused of embezzlement and falsification as well as illegal carrying of 
weapons and ammunition. 
</p>
<p>62. The Deputy Attorney General emphasized that the main challenge for the local 
prosecutors was security. He said that some had been kidnapped or killed (with one 
beheaded) while on duty. He stressed the difficulty of assigning professional prosecutors to 
areas of insecurity, which led them to hire less well qualified people. He also stressed the 
lack of clear procedures for local prosecutors for informing Kabul about trials in their 
jurisdictions. 
</p><p>63. The Working Group also received information about cases where international 
PMSCs have flown personnel involved in human rights violations or criminal activity out 
of the country soon after the facts. For example, one American USPI supervisor, who shot 
and killed his Afghan interpreter after an argument, was quickly flown back to the United 
States and not handed over to Afghan officials for an investigation. To date he has not been 
charged or tried.38 This example illustrates the difficulties victims and their families can 
face in obtaining adequate remedies.  
</p>
<p>64. The only completed United States Government prosecution of any contractor for 
detainee abuse in Afghanistan concerned the case of David Passaro, a former Army Special 
Forces soldier, who had been contracted to work with a team of United States Special 
Forces and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel responsible for capturing and 
interrogating suspected terrorists in 2003. Abdul Wali, an Afghan who had voluntarily 
turned himself in, died in custody on 21 June, following two days of interrogation by 
Passaro. On 17 June 2004 &#8211; a full year after the event, the United States Attorney for the 
Eastern District of North Carolina charged Passaro with two counts of assault with a 
dangerous weapon and two counts of assault resulting in serious bodily injury. In August 
2006, Passaro was convicted on a single count of assault resulting in serious bodily injury 
and three counts of misdemeanour assault and was sentenced to serve eight years and four 
months in a federal prison.39 
</p>
<p>65. On 7 January 2010, the United States Department of Justice announced the arrest of 
two former Blackwater security guards on murder charges and firearms violations 
following a shooting in Afghanistan in May 2009 that killed two Afghans and wounded 
one. The men were working for Paravant LLC., a subsidiary of Blackwater, and were 
assigned under contract to train Afghan soldiers.40 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group regrets the lack of coordination between Kabul and the rest of 
the country. The provincial authorities in Jalalabad have no interaction with the High 
Coordination Board (HCB) and are not requested to report on the activities and violations 
committed by PMSCs.

<p>67. States contracting PMSCs also have a crucial role in ensuring the accountability of 
the PMSCs they have contracted and should assist the national authorities in investigating 
all incidents. They have an obligation to investigate, prosecute, extradite or surrender 
persons suspected of having committed crimes under international law, in accordance with 
their obligations under international law. Such prosecutions are to be carried out in 
accordance with international law, in the awareness that punishment should be 
commensurate with the gravity of the crime. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Vetting and training 
</b></p>
<p>68. PMSCs operating in Afghanistan do not have systematic vetting and training 
procedures. According to the Regulation, the chairman of each company seeking licensing 
has to sign a &#8220;Commitment letter&#8221; guaranteeing the qualifications of the personnel 
employed, to the effect inter alia that they &#8220;should not have been imprisoned or committed 
crimes and should not have had contact with terrorism and should not continue relations 
with other illegal armed groups&#8221;.41 
</p>
<p>69. The procedure provides for the involvement of AIHRC in the vetting process of 
local PMSC employees to ensure that no staff of private security companies have been 
suspected of or accused of human rights violations. AIHRC confirmed to the Working 
Group that they did participate in the vetting process at least during the initial phase of the 
regulatory process for the PMSCs but that this was not effective given the lack of accurate 
records. The PMSCs that the Working Group met with also acknowledged the difficulty of 
vetting Afghan personnel given the lack of police records. However, PMSCs stressed that 
they carried out reference checks as often as possible. 
</p>
<p>70. NGOs concluded that PMSC staff are generally not well trained and often abusive of 
their powers. They noted that private security personnel often carry their weapons outside 
their compounds when off duty and move about in vehicles without number plates. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b>71. <b>In conflict or post-conflict situation where national security forces have to 
rebuild to fulfil their role as the legitimate holder of the use of force in accordance 
with the rule of law, private military and security companies (PMSCs) often fulfil a 
demand for protection from a wide variety of clients, including national institutions, 
foreign forces, multinational companies, and governmental and non-governmental 
organizations. The majority of these actors told the Working Group that they would 
not be able to operate throughout Afghanistan without the assistance of PMSCs.</b> 
</p>
<p>72. <b>The Working Group commends the efforts made by the Government of 
Afghanistan to seriously address these issues and with regard to the adoption of a 
comprehensive regulation that led to the licensing of initially 39 and then 52 
companies. The Working Group acknowledges that Afghanistan is among the few 
countries to have drafted a specific directive to regulate national and international 
private security companies. It has also attempted to control &#8212; at least partially &#8212; the 
flow of weapons in coordination with the disarmament and demobilization 
programme.</b>

<p>73. <b>The Working Group notes, nevertheless, that the adoption of a regulation is not 
sufficient in itself to ensure adequate oversight. There is a lack of information on 
incidents and human rights violations committed by PMSCs. The Working Group 
urges the Government to ensure that the regulatory Board responsible for monitoring 
the activities of PMSCs systematically registers incidents and violations committed by 
PMSCs. It encourages the Board to carry out its monitoring functions with due 
diligence and transparency and calls on UNAMA to provide advice and report on the 
activities of the Board. The Government should ensure that the Board is sufficiently 
resourced to implement its functions and should encourage the Afghanistan 
Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), NGOs and civil society groups 
and the Afghan people to refer incidents and violations to the Board.</b> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>The Working Group stresses the responsibility of international forces present 
in the territory to ensure that the companies they contract do not infringe human 
rights and are held accountable when violations occur. This is also valid when 
subcontracting takes place. This principle is of particular importance at a time when 
the Government of the United States is considering the option of a surge in 
Afghanistan that will most probably be accompanied by a comparable increase in 
PMSCs.</b> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>The Working Group is concerned at the lack of prosecution in Afghanistan and 
in contracting States of private security contractors suspected of having committed 
human rights abuses. All States shall ensure that investigations are carried out 
promptly and efficiently and that those responsible are brought to justice in 
accordance with international law and sanctioned in a way that is commensurate with 
the gravity of the crime.</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>The Working Group observed linkages between the presence of a large number 
of illegal armed groups and the formation of local PMSCs operating with or without 
licences. Local PMSCs represented an opportunity for former warlords to continue 
their activities legally.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>The Working Group raised concerns at the lack of clear criteria and 
transparency during the licensing process. There were strong allegations that 
corruption was widespread. </b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>The Working Group reiterates the fundamental principle of State control over 
the use of force. The State should retain control and oversight over the legal use of 
force and should not hand it over to non-State actors without exercising proper 
control.</b> <b>In that regard, the Working Group welcomes the willingness of the 
Government of Afghanistan to gradually increase the State army, police and security 
force capacity and training in order to ensure the safety and security of its population 
and of the international community present in its territory, while ensuring respect for 
the rule of law and human rights.</b> <b>It notes with satisfaction the statement of President 
Karzai to the effect that PMSCs would have to cease operating in Afghanistan within 
the next two years and that their operations would be taken over by the army and 
police.</b>42

<p><b> VI. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> In the light of the above observations, the Working Group recommends to the 
Government of Afghanistan that it: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Investigate all PMSCs operating without licences in the country and take 
appropriate action to disarm them and other legal action as appropriate; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) Ensure credible investigation of incidents involving casualties committed 
by private security contractors, prosecution of the perpetrators and adequate 
remedies for victims; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) Strengthen the investigative capacity of the Afghanistan Independent 
Human Rights Commission, in particular its special investigation team; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d)</b> <b>Establish a credible enforcement mechanism for regulation, with regular 
oversight and control of the PMSCs that have been licensed; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) Establish an independent, public and easy to access complaints 
mechanism through which the local population and civilian international actors can 
submit their complaints regarding any violations committed by PMSCs; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f) Establish lines of cooperation between the High Coordination Board and 
the Ministry of Finance responsible for collecting taxes to avoid corruption and 
enhance transparency; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(g)</b> <b>Ensure the speedy adoption of legislation on PMSCs following a broad 
consultation process and adequate awareness campaign. All types of activities de facto carried out by PMSCs are covered by the new legislation; the Government should also 
take all necessary steps to ensure its full implementation once a new law is adopted; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(h) Ensure the process of licensing of PMSCs uses open and transparent 
procedures; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(i)</b> <b>Invite DIAG to establish clear guidelines to prevent illegal armed groups 
from transforming into PMSCs or former warlords being employed as PMSC 
personnel; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(j) Consider acceding to the 1989 International Convention against the 
Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(k) The Government is encouraged to seek the assistance of UNAMA in the 
implementation of these recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Working Group presents the following recommendations to the 
international community: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Ensure that PMSCs contracted by the international community and 
alleged to have committed human rights violations and other crimes are fully 
investigated, and ensure that perpetrators are promptly brought to justice; 
</b> <b>(b) Provide necessary advice and resources to the High Coordination Board 
monitoring the activities of PMSCs to ensure it is carrying out its functions in an 
effective and transparent manner; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c) Ensure adequate oversight of the PMSCs they have contracted, in 
particular by making regular background checks of PMSCs they hire, by screening 
PMSC records, in particular regarding any human rights violations, by practising 
transparent bidding processes and by ensuring transparency through releasing 
publicly the operative clauses of contracts with PMSCs; </b></p>

</p>
<p> <b>(d) Invite the International Security Assistance Force</b> (<b>ISAF) and all States 
concerned to publicly report any military and civilian casualties resulting from the 
activities of PMSCs; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(e) Invite ISAF and all States concerned to publicly release statistics of 
private military and security casualties; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f) Invite the international community, in coordination with the Afghan 
authorities, to develop standard training packages on human rights and international 
humanitarian law that would be provided to PMSCs by national institutions or local 
NGOs with the assistance of the United Nations.</b>
