<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council

<p><b>National policies and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard 
</p>
<p>of achievement for all peoples and all nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all relevant international human rights treaties, including the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council resolution 23/19 of 23 June 2013 on national 
</p>
<p>policies and human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> that States emphasized in the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
</p>
<p>of Action and the 2005 World Summit Outcome1 that they bear the responsibility, in 
</p>
<p>conformity with the Charter, to develop and encourage respect for human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, 
</p>
<p>language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
</p>
<p>other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that States should integrate their obligations under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law into their national legislation in order to ensure that State action at the 
</p>
<p>national level is effectively directed towards the promotion and protection of all human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that State action aimed at the promotion, protection and full realization of 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national level is most effective when fully 
</p>
<p>integrated into national policies based on a human rights perspective, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are inalienable, universal, indivisible, 
</p>
<p>interdependent and interrelated and that, therefore, national policies aimed at their 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection will also have a mutually reinforcing effect on their realization, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that each State has the right to choose the framework that is best suited 
</p>
<p>to its particular needs at the national level, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of international cooperation to support States in the 
</p>
<p>process of integrating their obligations and commitments under international human rights 
</p>
<p>law into national legislation, and drawing up and carrying out national policies aimed at the 
</p>
<p>full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the important and constructive role that national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and civil society can play in the process of drawing up and assessing the impact 
</p>
<p>of national policies aimed at the promotion, protection and full realization of human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that technical cooperation offered by the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, upon request of and in close cooperation 
</p>
<p>with States, with the aim of integrating human rights into national policies and programmes 
</p>
<p>can be a useful vehicle to support States&#8217; compliance with their human rights obligations, as 
</p>
<p>well as their follow-up to recommendations made by the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, 
</p>
<p><i>Affirming</i> that the participation of members of all sectors of society in debating and 
</p>
<p>developing policies and programmes affecting the population is critical for the success of 
</p>
<p>such processes, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that public policies planned and formulated through participatory 
</p>
<p>approaches are key for promoting respect for, and safeguarding of, the realization of human 
</p>
<p>rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights on technical assistance and capacity-building 
</p>
<p>options for integrating human rights into national policies;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/27/41. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Acknowledges</i> the efforts made by the Office of the High Commissioner, in 
</p>
<p>both technical assistance and capacity-building, upon request and in close cooperation with 
</p>
<p>States, to align laws, policies, institutions and practices with their human rights obligations 
</p>
<p>and commitments, to implement accepted universal periodic review recommendations and 
</p>
<p>to follow up on recommendations made by other United Nations human rights mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Recommends</i> that States integrate into their national policies a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective aimed at the promotion, protection and full realization of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Decides </i>to convene, at its twenty-eighth session, a panel discussion on the 
</p>
<p>issue of national policies and human rights, with a particular focus on the findings of the 
</p>
<p>report,

</p>
<p>human rights in national policies and programmes; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
