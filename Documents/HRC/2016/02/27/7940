<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In his last report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/15/32, July 2010), the 
former Independent Expert Rudi Muhammad Rizki stressed the selected areas of focus and 
emerging areas in which international solidarity should take a more central role, including 
in sustainable development, Financing for Development and South-South cooperation. In 
this regard, he emphasized the importance of following major global summits and 
ministerial meetings in the economic, social and climate fields with a view to promoting the 
right to international solidarity, and the conduct of country study visits to learn about and 
observe, the various good practices undertaken by different actors. The current Independent 
Expert, Ms. Virginia Dandan, recognizes that this view has important implications in her 
task of preparing a draft declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international 
solidarity, to be presented to the Human Rights Council by 2014. 
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert affirms that, while international cooperation plays a central 
role in international solidarity, international solidarity is not limited to international 
assistance and cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance. International solidarity 
should be understood as a broader concept that includes (a) sustainability in international 
relations, especially international economic relations; (b) the peaceful coexistence of all 
members of the international community; (c) equal partnerships and the equitable sharing 
of benefits and burdens; and (d) refraining from doing harm or posing obstacles to the 
greater well-being of others, including in the international economic system and to our 
common ecological habitat, for which all are responsible. A preventive solidarity must be 
put in place to confront global and local challenges, notably the alarming increase of natural 
and man-made disasters, and the continuing rises in poverty and inequality. She also notes 
that the notion of solidarity has defined the work of the United Nations since its inception, 
drawing together nations and peoples to promote peace and security, human rights and 
development. It is equally important to mention that the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration identified international solidarity as one of the fundamental values 
indispensable to international relations in the twenty-first century.1  
</p>
<p>3. In her statement to the Human Rights Council,2 Ms. Dandan expressed her view that 
solidarity &#8213;... is a persuasion that combines differences and opposites, holds them together 
</p>
<p>into one heterogeneous whole, and nurtures it with the universal values of human rights. 
International solidarity therefore does not seek to homogenize but rather, to be the bridge 
across those differences and opposites, connecting to each other diverse peoples and 
countries with their heterogeneous interests, in mutually respectful, beneficial and 
reciprocal relations, imbued with the principles of human rights, equity and justice&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>4. International solidarity is an elusive concept, and is particularly resistant to 
definition, rendering it almost an abstraction. But where it exists, it is unmistakable, 
permeating thought and action, its effects observable. Therefore, the task of developing 
norms and standards for what will eventually lead to the formulation of a draft declaration 
of the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity, calls for dialogue with 
States, United Nations and other international agencies, and as many stakeholders as 
possible.

and Practice&#8214;, seventh plenary meeting, eighteenth session of the Human Rights Council, 14

</p>
<p>5. Beyond this important consideration, it is critical to take into account the policy and 
actual practice of States, which are the vital conduits of international solidarity, and of 
international cooperation. The Independent Expert therefore considers that the most 
effective and appropriate way to understand policy on, and practice of, international 
solidarity is through empirical methods of study and observation on the ground. 
</p>
<p>6. In this context, the mission to Brazil, the first-ever conducted by this mandate, 
considered specific modalities arising from broad subject areas related to international 
solidarity such as (a) strategies and programmes relating to the attainment of the 
Millennium Development Goals, in particular Goal 8 (global partnerships), informed by a 
gender perspective in all areas of concern; (b) elements of &#8213;solidarity diplomacy&#8214; and 
international cooperation initiatives including transfer of technology and building capacity 
in least developed countries (LDCs), cultural, scientific and educational exchange and 
scholarship programmes; (c) national-level implementation of political commitments to 
international agreements.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General overview: in search of good practices 
</b></p>
<p>7. In the present report, the Independent Expert documents the observations of her 
study visit to Brazil from 25 to 29 June 2012, for the purpose of exchanging views with the 
Government, civil society, academia, and regional and international stakeholders, to gather 
information on the experiences of Brazil in international solidarity, including and in 
particular in the context of its international cooperation activities. This report complements 
the summary version presented to the twenty-first session of the Human Rights Council 
held in September 2012 (A/HRC/21/44).  
</p>
<p>8. The study visit was facilitated by the Office of the United Nations Resident 
Coordinator and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, who were focal points of the 
visit, which took place for the most part in the capital city of Brasilia, home to Government 
ministries and agencies. The Independent Expert, being in Rio de Janeiro in the previous 
week to attend the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), was 
able to intersperse her activities at the Conference, with visits to a Government institution 
and to a regional agency whose offices are based in Rio de Janeiro. Subsequent to her visit, 
the Independent Expert continued her engagement with Government officials to gather 
further information on recent developments prior to the submission of this report.  
</p>
<p>9. The Independent Expert valued the warm reception she received from the 
Government of Brazil and its institutions dealing with international cooperation, as well as 
its openness in discussing a range of topics relevant to her mandate. She notes with 
appreciation that &#8211; while the Government officials she met with expressed their pride, and 
rightfully so, when speaking of the numerous high profile achievements of Brazil, including 
the attainment of a number of Millennium Development Goals well before the deadline of 
2015 &#8211; they also readily acknowledged and identified the many difficulties and obstacles 
that remain to be addressed and surmounted.3 
</p>
<p>10. During the mission, the Independent Expert met with officials of Government 
engaged in policy matters and activities in international cooperation. At the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs in Brasilia, she met with (a) the Director of the Brazilian Cooperation 
Agency (ABC); (b) the Secretary for Cooperation and Trade Promotion; (c) the Under-
Secretary General for Political Affairs; (d) the Under-Secretary General for Policy; (e) the

</p>
<p>12. At the Presidency of the Republic, the Independent Expert met with the Special 
Advisor to the Foreign Policy Unit of the Office of the President of Brazil and his team. 
She also met with the President of the Institute for Applied Economic Research and her 
team. She attended the National Council on Food Security, where she made a brief 
presentation on her mandate and the objectives of her study visit. 
</p>
<p>13. At the Brazilian Congress, the Independent Expert met with the Chair of the Human 
Rights Committee of the Senate and the Vice-Chair of the Human Rights Committee of the 
Lower House. She also met with another Member of Parliament who was twice Chair of the 
Committee. A meeting was also held with the Vice-President of the Committee on External 
Relations and Defence of the Senate, concurrently, president of the Permanent 
Subcommittee for Monitoring the Implementation of the Measures Adopted in Rio+20 and 
the International Regime on Climate Change, and also former Minister of Education and 
rector of the University of Bras&#237;lia. 
</p>
<p>14. In Rio de Janeiro, the Independent Expert met with the Executive Director of the 
South American Institute of Government in Health (ISAGS), a former Minister of Health of 
Brazil and his team, and with the Director of the Centre for International Relations of the 
Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) and his colleagues. 
</p>
<p>15. Consultation meetings were held with representatives of United Nations agencies in 
Brazil and with civil society organizations. A meeting was also held with the United 
Nations Resident Coordinator. 
</p>
<p>16. The Independent Expert thanks all of the above for their courtesies and the time 
shared with her. She is grateful to the following for their support and assistance: (a) Carlos 
da Cunha Oliveira and his team, the focal point at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
responsible for the country study mission; (b) United Nations Resident Coordinator in 
Brazil Jorge Chediek and his team; and (c) Maria Nazareth Farani Azev&#234;do, Permanent 
Representative of Brazil to the United Nations in Geneva, and her team at the Permanent 
Mission. 
</p>
<p>17. The consultations and dialogues of the Independent Expert with officials of the 
Government of Brazil have been consolidated into this report, the primary consideration 
being given to the relevance of such information to the policy and practice of international 
solidarity. 
</p>
<p>18. The Independent Expert expresses her deep appreciation to the Government of 
Brazil for providing her the opportunity to observe and learn first-hand what she had only </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>previously read and heard about regarding the solidarity diplomacy of Brazil, which has 
generated a growing interest on the part of the international community.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Solidarity in the Brazilian context 
</b></p>
<p>19. Brazil is one of the few countries in the world to have achieved most of the 
Millennium Development Goals ahead of the 2015 deadline.4 During the past decade, the 
country has embarked on a path of sustained economic growth and financial stability, with 
full exercise of democracy and social inclusion resulting in considerable progress in its 
human rights agenda. Economic policies and innovative social policies implemented in the 
past decade have contributed to lift 40 million Brazilians out of poverty, creating a robust 
middle class which today serves as the engine of growth in the country. A good example of 
a successful social programme is the Bolsa Fam&#237;lia, the largest cash transfer programme in 
the world implemented under the Zero Hunger Strategy in 2003.  
</p>
<p>20. Brazilians like to identify themselves as a solidarity nation.5 They claim that 
solidarity is expressed in the simple everyday practices of ordinary Brazilians and has been 
incorporated into major social policies such as those implemented in the past decade to 
combat socio-economic inequalities in the country. There is a common understanding 
among everyone of the need to work together for a more equal and inclusive society. The 
Independent Expert observed in her visit a strong sense of unity pervading Brazilian 
society, driving it towards a common goal of better conditions that will benefit all 
Brazilians. Solidarity movements emerged from their fight against hunger and poverty in 
the 1990s to a constituency of a solidarity economy. Some of the best examples include the 
cooperatives of &#8213;<i>catadores</i>&#8214;6&#8212;self-designed pickers of recyclable materials in the garbage 
dumps of big cities such as Rio de Janeiro and S&#227;o Paulo, and the various social 
mobilization movements against deforestation in the Amazon and the fight against 
corruption. The level of engagement between the Government, private sector and civil 
society in setting up innovative social policies provides valuable lessons in solidarity. 
</p>
<p>21. Despite achievements, challenges still persist in the largest South American country. 
The sixth largest economy in the world, Brazil has a population of 200 million inhabitants, 
of which 16 million are still living in extreme poverty, and the level of inequality is one of 
the highest in the world. The newest programme, Brazil sem Mis&#233;ria (Brazil without 
Misery), which has incorporated the former Zero Hunger Strategy, through a series of 
programmes, envisages promoting progress towards socially equitable growth, eradicating 
extreme poverty by 2014.7 
</p>
<p>22. Brazil embarked on numerous cooperation projects, as a way of sharing with other 
countries, valuable lessons learned from its successful experiences as well as the challenges 
it faced in its implementation of social policies. Policymakers involved in these cooperation 
projects also believe the engagement of the country with other partners is a two-way 
learning process because Brazil has also learned from its partner countries&#8217; own 
experiences of successes and challenges, no matter what their economic situation. In fact, 
the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has emphasized that Brazil&#8217;s actions on the international 
stage have been driven by a sense of solidarity. Brazil is convinced that it is possible to

<p>have a humanist foreign policy, without losing sight of the national interest.8 The so-called 
&#8213;Solidarity Diplomacy&#8214; has been the driving force in this process.  
</p>
<p>23. The positive impact of the innovative approach in Brazilian cooperation has resulted 
in requests from numerous countries for Brazil&#8217;s support under South-South cooperation 
projects as well at the multilateral level, including with the United Nations under the 
modality of triangular cooperation. This report focuses on international cooperation 
initiatives particularly in the fields of agriculture and food security, health and the social 
determinant of health, education and social protection, and their impact on the realization of 
human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. </b>Constitutional principles governing Brazil&#8217;s foreign policy <b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. The 1988 Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil9 in its preamble 
encapsulates the commitment of the Brazilian people to solidarity. It states: 
</p>
<p>We, the representatives of the Brazilian People, convened in the national constituent 
assembly to institute a democratic state for the purpose of ensuring the exercise of 
social and individual rights, liberty, security, well-being, development, equality and 
justice as supreme values of a fraternal, pluralist and unprejudiced society, founded 
on social harmony and committed, in the internal and international orders, to the 
peaceful settlement of disputes, promulgate, under the protection of God, this 
Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil. 
</p>
<p>25. Article 1 states the key elements of the foundation of the Federative Republic of 
Brazil as the following: I &#8211; sovereignty; II &#8211; citizenship; III &#8211; the dignity of the human 
person; IV &#8211; the social values of labour and of the free enterprise; V &#8211; political pluralism. 
Article 3 states that fundamental objectives of the Federative Republic of Brazil are: I &#8211; to 
build a free, just and solidary society; II &#8211; to guarantee national development; III &#8211; to 
eradicate poverty and substandard living conditions and to reduce social and regional 
inequalities; IV &#8211; to promote the well-being of all, without prejudice as to origin, race, sex, 
colour, age and any other forms of discrimination. It also captures the essence of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>26. The 1988 Constitution lays down a number of principles that govern Brazilian 
international relations, among which are national independence, the prevalence of human 
rights, self-determination, non-intervention, and cooperation among peoples for the 
progress of mankind. These principles are underpinned by the solidarity of Brazilian 
society, which is also enshrined in the Constitution, and together are applied in building a 
policy of international cooperation integrated into foreign policy goals. 
</p>
<p>27. These Constitutional principles that govern international relations have shaped the 
features of Brazilian cooperation in the spirit of solidarity, as Brazil seeks to contribute to 
the social and economic progress of other countries through the sharing of lessons learned, 
knowledge gained from successful experiences, and best practices. Brazil makes use of 
solutions created and developed domestically to support other countries facing similar 
difficulties in overcoming obstacles to their development.

</p>
<p>Republic of Brazil at the Opening of the General debate of the sixty-fifth Session of the United 
Nations General Assembly, New York, 23 September 2010.

</p>
<p>28. Brazilian cooperation is based on requests received from other countries, with 
paramount consideration given to their specific needs, as well as in response to 
humanitarian appeals from international specialized agencies. There are no conditions 
imposed and it is not profit-oriented. The cooperation is driven by solidarity and adheres to 
the requirements of the Brazilian Constitution on non-intervention, respect for sovereignty 
and self-determination. 
</p>
<p>29. The head of the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) described Brazilian 
cooperation as an exchange between equals, rather than an interaction between donor and 
recipient. Brazilian cooperation is in the image of the Brazilian people, a nation with mixed 
societies that live in peace. They are in many ways idealistic, and despite the poverty, a 
strong feeling of solidarity, rather than pity, prevails. Cooperation should be seen as more 
than solving problems; it is a dialogue between nations and peoples to address problems 
together. 
</p>
<p>30. An important feature of Brazilian technical cooperation is that both partners learn 
from each other in the exchange of experiences and knowledge, affirming reciprocal 
solidarity among peoples. Partner countries are not passive recipients but are actively 
involved right from the stage of negotiation, ensuring that cooperation methodology is 
appropriate to the context of the local reality. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Brazilian International Cooperation and Solidarity Initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency, which is affiliated with the Ministry of External 
Relations, is the agency mandated to negotiate, coordinate, implement and monitor 
technical cooperation programmes in which Brazil participates. ABC provides guidance to 
other Brazilian agencies regarding cooperation opportunities involving Brazil, supporting 
the preparation of projects, coordinating negotiations between the parties involved, 
monitoring and evaluating project implementation, and publicizing information on project 
development and results. This has made it possible to propagate technical knowledge from 
Brazilian institutions to their counterparts in more than 80 developing countries. It therefore 
requires a commitment to cooperation on the part of public agencies and entities, private 
universities and civil society organizations involved in the partnership. 
</p>
<p>32. Brazilian international technical cooperation is a demand-driven process based on 
solidarity between developing countries, with the aim of helping partner countries to 
strengthen their institutions and human resources. Thus, the main goal of Brazilian South-
South technical cooperation is capacity development. Partner countries benefit from an 
effective transfer of knowledge, and from the exchange of experiences previously 
developed under similar socio-economic realities. 
</p>
<p>33. Technical cooperation, scholarships for foreigners, international humanitarian 
cooperation, and contribution to international organizations are the main modalities of what 
Brazil defines as Brazilian cooperation for international development. Agriculture, food 
security and nutrition, health, education and vocational training are the key areas of 
cooperation. Brazilian cooperation in Africa also aims to strengthen relations with African 
Portuguese-speaking countries (Pa&#237;ses Africanos de L&#237;ngua Oficial Portuguesa (PALOP)): 
Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe. The key 
focus for Asian cooperation projects is in Timor-Leste, with an emphasis on agriculture and 
food security, education, the judicial system, vocational training and public administration. 
Brazil has recently initiated relations with four Asian countries that belong to the Group of 
Least Developed Countries (LDCs: Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic and Myanmar. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>34. South-South cooperation contributes to consolidating the relations of Brazil with 
partner countries as it enhances general interchange; generates, disseminates and applies 
technical knowledge; builds human resource capacity; and, mainly, strengthens institutions 
in all nations involved while at the same time reinforcing public policies in Brazil. Brazilian 
cooperation agreements are in place with 30 developing countries in South, Central and 
North America and the Caribbean. It also maintains technical cooperation programmes with 
38 African countries, 22 of which belong to the group of LDCs. 
</p>
<p>35. Brazil implements triangular technical cooperation guided by the same principles 
that inform its South-South cooperation. Triangular cooperation makes it possible to match 
the comparative advantage from South-South cooperation and other development partners 
(bilateral and multilateral), leveraging the impact of knowledge sharing between developing 
countries. These factors result in greater positive impact in fostering local development 
processes. Brazil has implemented or is implementing agreements of triangular cooperation 
with the United States, the European Union and a number of its members, Japan, and in 
countries in Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean. United Nations agencies are 
also playing an important role in Brazilian international cooperation, including the 
International Labour Organization (ILO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations 
Population Fund. The World Health Organization (WHO), UNAIDS, the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of 
Women (UN-Women) are also partnering with Brazil in support of South-South 
cooperation initiatives. 
</p>
<p>36. Brazil is also engaged in other modalities of cooperation consistent with the 
principles applied to their other forms of cooperation and which are presently in the initial 
phase of implementation, including the following: 
</p>
<p>(a) In the interregional context, the India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum 
(IBSA)10 created in 2003 by the three countries, established the IBSA Fund for Alleviation 
of Poverty and Hunger, a pioneer initiative created in 2004 with the purpose of identifying 
replicable and scalable projects that can be jointly adapted and implemented in interested 
developing countries. Best practices of the three countries are shared with LDCs through 
projects financed by the IBSA Fund, in areas such as agriculture development and food 
security, safe drinking water, health care and infrastructure, waste collection and recycling, 
and building capacity to combat HIV/AIDS. Also in the interregional sphere, three 
important initiatives with growing importance are the Africa-South America Summit, Arab 
Countries-South America Summit, and the Forum for Dialogue and Cooperation between 
East Asia and Latin America. In addition, the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation and the 
Brazil-Russian-India-China and South Africa Summit (BRICS) have been established.11 
</p>
<p>(b) In the regional context, Brazil is engaged in three integration projects with 
different levels of cooperation. They are the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) 
composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay,12 Uruguay and the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela; the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) consisting of the 12 
countries of the subcontinent, and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States

2013 in Santiago, Chile.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Good practices in international solidarity and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>37. Good practices are cited in this report on the basis that their outcomes carry great 
potential for providing an enabling environment for the realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Empowering women: towards realizing gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>38. Brazil has successfully implemented policies and measures in combating violence 
against women, including sexual violence, achieving progress in health and education as 
well as social assistance, which have become important examples for policies in these 
fields. June 19, 2012, during the Rio +20 Conference, was marked by the signing ceremony 
of the Implementing Programme between UN-Women, through the UN-Women Office in 
Brazil, and the Brazilian Cooperation Agency of the Ministry of External Relations, for the 
promotion of South-South technical cooperation and the Brazil UN-Women Partnership 
Programme for the promotion of South-South cooperation in gender equality. Through this 
project, Brazil will share its experiences in the field of gender equality and women 
empowerment with African, Latin American and Caribbean countries. 
</p>
<p>39. According to the Brazilian Cooperation Agency &#8213;the implementation of the 
Partnership Programme will take into account the Brazilian South-South cooperation 
principles, based on the dissemination and exchange of successful experiences, good 
practices, and lessons learned in Brazil, to be shared and adapted to the situation and local 
needs of each country in the light of requests received&#8214;. In Haiti, Brazil is helping the 
construction of a Centre of Reference and Assistance for women and a Police Station for 
women, and is also supporting the preparation of a national plan for women in Haiti. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Social protection: towards realizing the right to an adequate standard 
</b></p>
<p><b>of living  
</b></p>
<p>40. Brazil has a longstanding experience with public policies for social protection. It 
began in the 1930s with the Labour Code, which consolidated labour laws in the country. In 
the past decades, it has progressively incorporated new labour sectors.14 The Constitution of 
1988 launched a model of Social Security based on citizenship rights with the goal of a 
broad social protection system that would coordinate contributory, non-contributory and 
targeted policies. The Constitution has three key components: Social Insurance 
(contributive pensions), Health (Unified National Health System) and Social Assistance. 
</p>
<p>41. In recent decades, income inequality has persisted in many countries throughout the 
world, despite the decline in absolute poverty. (See the report of the Secretary-General on 
the role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order and an assessment of 
the implications of inequality for development (A/67/394)). Being one of the most unequal 
countries in the world, Brazil is particularly challenged, as 16 million of its citizens are still 
living in extreme poverty despite its achievement in the last few years, during which time 
28 million Brazilians crossed the absolute poverty line and 36 million entered the so-called 
middle class. In order to face this challenge, Brazil launched in June 2011, the <i>Brasil Sem

</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><i>Mis&#233;ria</i> (Brazil without Misery) plan.15 The programme is coordinated by the Ministry of 
Social Development and Fight Against Hunger16 and involves more than 10 ministries, thus 
placing social policies at the core of its economic development strategy. 
</p>
<p>42. Previous initiatives to fight poverty such as the Bolsa Fam&#237;lia Programme and the 
Programme for the Acquisition of Food (Programa de Aquisi&#231;&#227;o de Alimentos) were 
expanded and reinvigorated. Brasil Sem Mis&#233;ria also introduced novelties such as the Bolsa 
Verde Programme (Green Purse), the Incentive to Rural Productive Activities (Fomento &#224;s 
Atividades Produtivas Rurais) and the Brasil Carinhoso Action &#8211; a drastic measure that 
allows the immediate reduction of 40 per cent in the number of families in a situation of 
extreme poverty, with 2.7 million children from 0 to 6 years of age being saved from 
misery.17 It also has a <i>Busca Ativa</i> strategy adopted by Brasil Sem Mis&#233;ria to find and 
register all extremely poor families that have not yet been located. The Brasil Sem Mis&#233;ria 
plan has three main axis of action: (a) the income guarantee axis, which refers to transfers 
for the immediate relief of the extreme poverty situation; (b) the productive inclusion axis, 
which offers job and income opportunities to the plan&#8217;s target public; and (c) the access to 
public services axis, for the provision or expansion of actions of citizenship and social 
welfare. 
</p>
<p>43. Social policies have contributed to the creation of a dynamic domestic market led by 
the middle-class and which generated certain resilience. Two public policy systems were 
created with universal coverage: the Unified Social Assistance System and the National 
System on Food and Nutritional Security. The Bolsa Fam&#237;lia Programme, a conditional 
cash transfer programme, launched in October 2003 and instituted by Federal Law, sets the 
strategic axis for the integration of policies and actions that are part of the Brazilian Social 
Protection and Promotion Network. 
</p>
<p>44. Given the positive results achieved in recent years, the Brazilian Government, 
through its Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger, has been encouraged 
to put a special effort on social policy technology transfer, and to strengthen social 
development beyond its borders, putting into practice the so-called diplomacy of social 
policy that is presently being implemented. International cooperation in the social field is 
guided by (a) a focus on building institutional capacities in partner countries; (b) the 
multiplier effect in cooperation projects; (c) cultural and linguistic similarities; and (d) the 
transfer of social technology adaptable to local contexts.  
</p>
<p>45. A few examples of ongoing cooperation include: 
</p>
<p>(a) The Brazil-Africa Programme for cooperation on social protection, the 
outcome of a partnership between the Ministry of Social Development, the United 
Kingdom&#8217;s Department for International Development (DFID) and the International Policy 
Centre for Inclusive Growth. The cooperation was developed in four areas: regional 
technical cooperation, technical assistance, study missions and distance learning. The 
countries involved are Angola, Ghana and Mozambique.  
</p>
<p>(b) Promotion of the right to adequate food through the reduction of social and 
food vulnerability of populations in African countries. This is accomplished by 
strengthening programmes for local purchase of food supply, such as government and 
United Nations agencies&#8217; strategy for assistance and food aid, including school feeding 
programmes, and also for humanitarian purposes, as in the case of the Agriculture Food

Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal and Zimbabwe.  
</p>
<p>(c) Cooperation between Brazil, the United Kingdom and Ghana to support the 
design of the Livelihoods Empowerment against Poverty programme of the Government of 
Ghana.  
</p>
<p>(d) In El Salvador: (a) a programme for promoting the institutional strengthening 
of entities involved in social policy management and implementation; (b) optimization of 
the decentralized management of social policies and programmes; promotion of the 
intersectoral commitment of all stakeholders to mobilize local, regional, national and 
international resources for implementation and management of social programmes and 
policies; (c) support for the formulation process of a normative proposal for the 
institutionalization of the Salvadoran social protection system; (d) the creation of 
mechanisms to improve the dialogue between Government and civil society; (e) 
improvement of effective capacity of Salvadoran social policies and programme managers; 
and (f) integration of the children and adolescents protection system in the country. 
</p>
<p>46. In 2007, the Brazilian Government and the International Labour Organization 
launched an initiative to promote specific South-South technical cooperation projects and 
activities that contribute effectively to the prevention and elimination of child labour, in 
accordance with the international obligations of each country.  
</p>
<p>47. A significant example of South-South solidarity is the IBSA Dialogue Forum, a 
major trilateral development initiative which has been a major driver of South-South 
cooperation and exchanges in social policies among the IBSA member countries and other 
countries. In a 2010 Summit, IBSA leaders reiterated the need to promote a job-intensive 
recovery from the economic slowdown and to create a framework for sustainable growth 
and a strong cooperation between ILO and IBSA countries. An IBSA International  
Conference on South-South Cooperation Innovations in Public Employment Programmes 
and Sustainable Inclusive Growth was held in New Delhi from 1 to 3 March 2012 to (a) 
share knowledge between countries; (b) ensure better cohesion for overall inclusive growth 
with equity; (c) contribute to the implementation of the Decent Work Agenda and its 
strategic objectives in the fields of employment, social protection, work-related rights and 
social dialogue; and (d) support and work with ILO&#8217;s South-South and Triangular 
Cooperation Initiative to foster greater solidarity and enhance equality among countries and 
peoples in the world of work. 
</p>
<p>48. Important initiatives are taking place also at the regional and subregional levels. One 
example is the establishment of the Instituto de Pol&#237;ticas P&#250;blicas em Direitos Humanos do 
MERCOSUL (Institute of Public Policy on Human Rights),18 a body of MERCOSUR, 
which operates as a forum for technical cooperation, research and coordination of public 
policies on human rights in the countries that make up this regional bloc.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Agriculture and food security: towards realizing the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>49. For decades Brazil, as one of largest agricultural producers and exporters in the 
world, faced a challenging contradiction. At the same time that the country was celebrating 
huge progress in agricultural terms, with its pioneering tropical agriculture research, 
production increases at historical levels and economic progress, hunger still persisted and 
represented a major social challenge. According to FAO's estimates, some 16.7 million 
Brazilians (10 per cent of the population) were chronically undernourished at the end of the

<p><b>A/HRC/23/45/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>1990s.19 This challenge and developments in the past year have been well documented by 
current and former special rapporteurs on the right to food.20  
</p>
<p>50. When elected for his first term, former President of Brazil Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva 
made eradication of hunger a key priority of his agenda, and a national cause. He called for 
a great national movement to fight for this cause. A national policy, termed Zero Hunger 
strategy, was implemented in 2003 with the aim of eradicating hunger by the end of the 
President&#8217;s term. Zero Hunger was grounded on solidarity and implemented through a cash 
transfer programme (Bolsa Fam&#237;lia) and a major school meal programme that strengthened 
family agriculture. The school meal programme was responsible for more than 70 per cent 
of total food consumed in the country. The Agriculture Food Purchase Programme (PAA) 
today buys 30 per cent of food for school meals, locally and from family farmers. 
</p>
<p>51. In 2006, a National Food and Nutritional Security Framework Law was approved by 
the Brazilian Congress (Law 11.346).21 The law acknowledges that adequate food is a basic 
human right and is indispensable in realizing other rights that are set forth in the country&#8217;s 
federal Constitution.22 The debate and institutionalization of a policy for food and 
nutritional security was considered as one of the most important achievements in the social 
policies of the last few years. Key areas of focus are strengthening of family agriculture, 
food supply and promotion of health and adequate food. 
</p>
<p>52. Brazilian foreign policy prioritized the fight against hunger and poverty as an 
instrument for promoting international solidarity. In January 2004, the Presidents of Brazil, 
Chile and France, with the support of the United Nations Secretary-General, launched an 
initiative to fight hunger and poverty, calling on the international community to create new 
sources of financing for development in order to make progress toward the achievement of 
the Millennium Development Goals. A Summit of World Leaders for Action against 
Hunger and Poverty was held later in September the same year on the eve of the General 
Assembly. It adopted the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty 
signed by 111 national Governments23 stating that at the present stage of technological 
progress and agricultural production worldwide, the persistence of this situation is 
economically irrational, politically unacceptable and morally shameful and called for a 
renewed political mobilization to fight these challenges. 
</p>
<p>53. Agriculture has become a central element of Brazilian cooperation along with health 
and education among others. This cooperation is taking place with not only Southern but 
also with Northern and multilateral partners, including the United Nations system. Food 
security, genetic improvement, agricultural technology transfer, soil conservation, family 
farming, rural development, irrigation, cooperatives, renewable and clean energy, and rural 
development are examples of Brazil&#8217;s cooperation initiatives.  
</p>
<p>54. The agro-ecological and climate similarities between Africa and Brazil have 
contributed to making agriculture one of the key axes of Brazilian solidarity diplomacy 
with Africa. Since 2002, more than 50 agreements were signed with nearly 20 countries,

<p>including Algeria, Angola, Cape Verde, Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, 
Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, the United Republic of Tanzania and Tunisia 24. An office 
of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Enterprise (Embrapa) was established in Accra, 
Ghana with a view to supporting the technological and productive improvement of 
savannah agriculture in Africa.  
</p>
<p>55. In Latin America and Caribbean region, Brazilian experiences in agriculture are 
providing examples for many initiatives under implementation in the regional and bilateral 
cooperation under MERCOSUR, UNASUR and CELAC regional integration processes, in 
areas such as family farming and transfer of technology, among others. The Hunger-Free 
Latin America and the Caribbean Initiative draws from the Brazilian experience and is a 
commitment by the countries and organizations of the region, with support from FAO, to 
contribute actively in creating the conditions that will lead to the eradication of hunger 
permanently by 2025.25  
</p>
<p>56. Brazil has also engaged in numerous agricultural cooperation projects in other 
developing countries in partnership with donor countries. The ProSavanna Project is a 
pioneer triangular partnership between Brazil, Japan and Mozambique to accelerate 
agricultural growth in Mozambique through the development of improved seeds of soybean 
and rice, improving soil health, and funding roads and other infrastructure. Agriculture 
remains largely the key sector for social-economic development in the country employing 
80 percent of the labour force.26 The EU&#8211;Brazil Strategic Partnership, set up in 2008, 
started to explore opportunities for triangular cooperation with developing countries in the 
field of agriculture, through promotion of innovation leading to a more efficient production 
within African countries.27  
</p>
<p>57. In the United Nations, key agencies such as FAO, WFP and the International Fund 
for Agricultural Development (IFAD) are engaged in cooperation  projects and initiatives 
with Brazil, which has become a major donor for international humanitarian cooperation in 
Latin America, for example in the case of Haiti, Palestine and the countries in the Horn of 
Africa. In 2011, WFP and the Government of Brazil launched a Centre of Excellence 
Against Hunger based in Bras&#237;lia, which will assist countries to improve, expand and 
eventually run their own national school meal programmes.  
</p>
<p><b>  The example of Embrapa 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) under the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply, has been one of the most important actors in the 
field of the country&#8217;s technical cooperation in agriculture. It was set up in 1973 with the 
mission to provide research, development and innovation towards finding feasible solutions 
for the sustainable development of agriculture for the benefit of Brazilian society. Embrapa 
was established when Brazilian agriculture was marked by low production and yields, 
economic instability, lack of specific knowledge about tropical agriculture and institutional

<p>void, among other challenges.28 The establishment of Embrapa led to the building of a 
pioneer research capability on agriculture in the country that has global dimensions.  
</p>
<p>59. Today, Embrapa has 10,000 personnel including 2,500 researchers conducting 
studies from technologies for family farming in the poorest north-east region of the country, 
to highly advanced research such as nanotechnology. There are currently 45 Research 
Centres on different themes all over the country, which have a presence through their so-
called virtual laboratories in the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the 
Netherlands and the Republic of Korea. Physical offices have been established in the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Ghana. Embrapa is contributing to the 
democratization of knowledge in agricultural sciences and related areas.  
</p>
<p>60. Embrapa&#8217;s work has been key to the success of Brazilian tropical agriculture, 
motivating other countries with similar problems and challenges to seek information and 
partnership with Embrapa. International cooperation has been crucial in the establishment 
and consolidation of Embrapa, today considered the most advanced tropical agriculture 
research institute in the world.  
</p>
<p>61. It has a strong post-graduate programme, which has sent hundreds of young 
professionals to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, the Netherlands, 
Germany and Australia. Projects funded by the World Bank, Inter-American Development 
Bank and the Japanese Government have been very important in financing this human 
development programme and also in equipping the research units. Embrapa is a major 
conduit for the cooperation of Brazil with a number of countries, to transfer its experiences 
and technology, and to adapt these to local conditions in partner countries.  
</p>
<p>62. Brazil has shared with partner countries its expertise in access and food production &#8211; 
(a) genetic improvement; (b) enhanced planting, irrigation and harvest methods; (c) use of 
agricultural machinery; (d) animal husbandry; and (e) animal product processing &#8211; and in 
marketing. It has sought to enhance food security and nutrition through strengthening 
family agriculture, and has been particularly successful in establishing farmer cooperatives 
in order to add value to their produce and to increase family income. Sharing of best 
practices consolidated by the Brazilian Government with developing countries expands the 
geographic scope of Brazilian cooperation and introduces policies and programmes that 
were implemented successfully in Brazil to lift its people out of poverty. Brazilian 
cooperatives are exemplars in the solidarity economy.  The 1,600 agricultural cooperatives 
in Brazil have almost a million members, generating 160,000 jobs and representing 30 per 
cent of agricultural gross domestic product, with its agri-food exports bringing in revenues 
of $6 billion in 2012.29 Brazil&#8217;s experience with cooperatives is now being shared with 
African countries and has inspired similar models in other countries. The Brazilian 
Cooperation Agency and the Brazilian Cooperatives Organization undertook a mission to 
Botswana in 2011, to explore the possibilities of developing agricultural cooperatives in 
that African country. 
</p>
<p>63. The Africa-Brazil Agricultural Innovation Marketplace initiative is a process that 
focuses on generating benefits for smallholder farmers and producers. Its objective is to 
enhance agricultural innovation for development on the African continent by establishing 
and strengthening partnerships between African and Brazilian organizations.  
</p>
<p>64. The Marketplace will open a new source of expertise to Africa, to identify and target 
pro-poor, smallholder-based project utilizing Brazilian innovation research. The

(FARA), with support from the United Kingdom&#8217;s DFID, IFAD, the World Bank, the ABC, 
and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This South-South collaboration with active 
Northern support is making an important contribution to more productive agriculture and 
more affordable food for the poor in Africa, complementing other ongoing efforts. The 
same initiative has recently started implementation in another region, the Latin-American 
and Caribbean (LAC) region. It is known as the LAC-Brazil Agricultural Innovation 
Marketplace. 
</p>
<p>65. A programme to provide support for the development of the cotton industry in C4 
Countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali), also known as the Cotton 4 Project, was 
set up in 2008 with the official support of the Brazilian Government for the World Trade 
Organization Cotton Initiative, brought forward by C4 countries as a result of their losses 
due to subsidy policies used in the international cotton market. The objectives of the project 
included (a) the development of the cotton industry in C4 countries; (b) the transfer of 
Brazilian technology to increase the profitability of the cotton supply chain; and (c) 
improvement of the quality of life, food security and nutrition levels in beneficiary 
countries. Under the framework of this project, Brazil is also cooperating with Mali to 
revitalize the Sotuba Research Centre outside of Bamako. 
</p>
<p>66. In 2012, the Brazilian Government signed a project with FAO aiming to provide 
financial support for a new local food purchase programme to be set up by FAO and WFP. 
The programme will initially benefit small farmers and vulnerable populations in five 
African countries &#8211; Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger and Senegal.30 The project 
envisages the sharing of Brazil&#8217;s experiences with its own national Agriculture Food 
Purchase Programme (PAA), a programme that buys agricultural products from 
smallholders and delivers them to at-risk categories, including children and youth, through 
school feeding programmes. The PAA is considered by FAO to be a cornerstone of the 
country's Zero Hunger strategy. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Health and the social determinants of health: towards realizing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to health 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988 established health as a right of all 
citizens and a public duty leading to strong policy on the right to universal access to health 
services. It reflected the strong commitment of the Government and support by civil society 
through a well-organized social movement mobilization. The Unified Health System (SUS) 
was created as the primary network of public health institutions aiming to provide, finance 
and manage health services. SUS is one of the largest public health systems in the world, 
with a wide coverage, from outpatient care to complex procedures such as organ 
transplants, guaranteeing full, universal and free access for the entire country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>population.31 Policy also focused on prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, with a 
compulsory licensing of patents related to an anti-retroviral medicine used by the National 
STD/AIDS Programme being implemented in 2007 to ensure free treatment for all 
Brazilians infected with HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>68. Currently, SUS attends to the care of 145 million citizens32 and represents a world 
example of universal health coverage programme funded through solidarity taxes

</p>
<p><b> 1. Building strong public institutions: the case of Fiocruz 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) was established in 1900 in Rio de Janeiro, 
with the task of addressing public health problems in Brazil. Fiocoruz is attached to the 
Ministry of Health and is considered as one of the leading science and technology health 
institutions in the world. It is responsible for research, production of vaccines and 
medicines, and controlling the quality of products and services. Its activities include 
provision of hospital and outpatient services, implementation of social programmes, 
teaching activities and the training and qualification of professionals and researchers. 
Fiocruz mission is to promote health and social development, to forge and disseminate 
scientific and technological knowledge, and to be an agent of citizenship.  
</p>
<p>70. Fiocruz has become renowned as a leading research centre for the control of diseases 
such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. It manufactures pharmaceutical products for 
SUS. With one of the largest public pharmaceutical laboratories in the country &#8211; the Drug 
Technology Institute (Farmanguinhos) &#8211; Fiocruz has achieved vast experience in 
production technologies for drugs used in HIV/AIDS treatment. Fiocruz is presently 
involved in the establishment of an antiretroviral production plant in Mozambique. The 
project includes multidisciplinary implementation such as training of local technical staff in 
surveillance, inspection, certification and control of medication, and also its production and 
commercialization processes, so that the Mozambican regulatory agency can efficiently 
implant the antiretroviral (ARV) production plant. 
</p>
<p>71. Brazil&#8217;s first Human Milk Bank (HMB) was opened in 1943 as a result of research, 
technology development, teaching and consultancy work by Fiocruz. HMBs have 
developed to become what is known today as the world&#8217;s largest and most complex HMB 
</p>
<p>network, the foremost Government strategy to reduce infant mortality. It is a model that 
combines high reliability and technical accuracy at a low operating cost. In 2001, WHO 
awarded the HMB network for its major contribution in reducing infant mortality and 
promoting breastfeeding in the 1990s. The Brazilian Cooperation Agency has 19 HMB 
projects already being implemented in Latin America and the Caribbean, along with 
initiatives of this Brazilian model in African countries. European countries such as Portugal 
and Spain have also adopted the HMB technology initiated and developed by Brazil. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Engagement in global health diplomacy  
</b></p>
<p>72. Brazil believes that international solidarity should have a global perspective on 
health and human rights, and has thus made a strong commitment to share its own 
experiences and challenges through international cooperation towards strengthening 
internal public health policies and practices worldwide. This conviction was expressed by 
former President Lula da Silva in his early interaction with G8 leaders in his statement: &#8213;In 
</p>
<p>a globalized world, in which global threats come mainly from poverty, alienation and social 
exclusion, solidarity is not only a moral duty, it is a display of enlightened self-interest.&#8214; 33  </p>
<p>73. Brazil has since become a key player in health diplomacy by (a) defending universal 
health coverage; (b) widening access to medicines, in particular for vulnerable

<p>communities; (c) strengthening health systems; (d) combating chronic non-transmissible 
diseases; (e) controlling tobacco; and (f) giving attention to the social determinants of 
health. Health was placed at the core of the Action against Hunger and Poverty, launched in 
2004 by President Lula da Silva and other world leaders in New York, where the President 
stated that health was key to development and to combating poverty.34 Together with 
France, Chile, Norway and the United Kingdom, Brazil has launched the International Drug 
Purchase Facility, UNITAID.35 This initiative marked a major example of the potential of 
international solidarity in creating an innovative mechanism to fund access to high-quality 
drugs and the diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. 
</p>
<p>74. Brazil was one of the countries that led the initiative on Global Health and Foreign 
Policy, launched in September 2006 in New York, on the sidelines of the General 
Assembly, which led to the Oslo Ministerial Declaration a year later, urgently calling for a 
more expansive foreign policy to create a new paradigm of cooperation, and outlining the 
linkages between foreign policy and health.36 In 2011, Brazil hosted the WHO World 
Conference on Social Determinants of Health. The Rio Political Declaration on Social 
Determinants of Health that was consequently adopted, was a global political commitment 
to reduce health inequities and to achieve other global priorities by building momentum 
within countries for the development of dedicated national action plans and strategies.37 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Bringing the health agenda across borders 
</b></p>
<p>75. Health is a priority both on the Brazilian domestic agenda and for international 
cooperation, where it applies its structural approach, characterized by efforts to develop 
individual and institutional capacity in partner countries, with sustainable results. Health as 
a right of all and as a duty of the State, drives Brazilian cooperation, and is implemented 
based on mutual respect and a commonly agreed agenda.  
</p>
<p>76. The main Brazilian cooperation projects in Africa and South America focus on 
human resource training, capacity-building in research, teaching or services, and on 
strengthening or setting up health system institutions, including ministries of health, 
schools of public health, national health institutes, faculties for higher professional training, 
polytechnic health colleges, technological development, and production institutes and 
factories. The public health system of Brazil and its international health cooperation are 
based on the principle of universal access to the public health system. 
</p>
<p>77. In the regional context, Brazil has advocated for a strong regional cooperation on 
health. It took the lead in establishing the South American Institute of Government in 
Health (ISAGS) with its main office in Rio de Janeiro. ISAGs,38 inaugurated in 2011, is an 
intergovernmental entity and a member of the South American Health Council of the Union 
of South American Nations (UNASUR).39 ISAGs is a key institution for strengthening 
coordination and exchange between the health authorities and other Government 
authorities. The focus areas of the UNASUR Five-Year Health Plan are the South 
American health vigilance and response network, universal health system development, 
universal access to medication, health promotion and health determinants, human resources

<p>and management. Committed to implementing the South American Health Agenda and the 
scope of priorities in the UNASUR 2010&#8211;2015 Five-Year Health Plan, ISAGS accordingly 
focuses its actions on the following strategies: (a) interchange and training of human 
resources; (b) lines of research and diagnostics; (c) accumulation and dissemination of 
knowledge on governance in health; (d) organization of the supply and demand for 
cooperation; and (e) promotion of networking. 
</p>
<p>78. A trilateral agreement between Haiti, Cuba and Brazil is focused on the 
implementation of Haitian health structures, the establishment of a national outpatient 
system, the training of health workers, especially middle-level staff that the system urgently 
needs, and the control of infectious diseases. It involves the complete rebuilding of the 
health system to make it more capable of meeting the health needs of the Haitian people. 
The day after the earthquake, parameters were established to guide the reconstruction of the 
Haitian health system. One of the aims of the agreement is the provision of universal 
access, and the achievement thereof is based on the population&#8217;s wish to participate in the 
rebuilding of the country and its ability to develop innovative forms of solidarity.  
</p>
<p><b> E. The full development of the person: towards realizing the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 declared education as a right of all, and duty of 
the State and of the family, to be promoted and fostered with the cooperation of society, 
with a view to the full development of the person, his preparation for the exercise of 
citizenship and his qualification for work (Article 205).40 The Brazilian Constitution of 
1946 had already stated in its article 166 that education was a right of all which should be 
inspired by the principles of freedom and ideals of human solidarity,41  both endorsed in the 
later National Education and Guidelines Framework Law adopted in 1996.42 
</p>
<p>80. In an effort to ensure the education of Brazilians, social programmes recently 
implemented have included education as a key element. This is the case of the Bolsa 
Fam&#237;lia, in which beneficiaries must accomplish certain requirements, including school 
enrolment and minimum attendance. A programme called PROUNI43 was implemented to 
enable poor students to have access to higher education through grants that cover their 
costs. Recent developments in the field of education include a new Government policy 
requiring the 56 public federal universities to guarantee 50 per cent of their admissions to 
be filled by students coming from public secondary schools. Special attention has also been 
given to ethnic groups with lower participation in higher education such as Afro-Brazilians. 
The Open University of Brazil44 has been created to offer distance education.  
</p>
<p>81. A pioneer programme for international exchange and mobility in higher education is 
being implemented under the Ci&#234;ncia sem fronteiras programme (Science without Borders) 
established in 2012.45 The strategy is to (a) increase the presence of students, scientists and 
industry personnel from Brazil in international institutions of excellence, negotiating the 
extension of support from the private sector for the payment of the fees involved or the

<p>exemption of these fees with universities or local governments; (b) encourage young talents 
and highly qualified researchers from abroad to work with local investigators in joint 
projects, contributing to the capacitation of human resources and promoting the return of 
Brazilian scientists working overseas; and (c) induce the internationalization of universities 
and research centres in Brazil by encouraging the establishment of international 
partnerships and a meaningful review of their internal procedures in order to make the 
interaction with foreign partners feasible. The programme aims to provide 75,000 grants 
offered by the federal Government and another 26,000 will be offered by the private sector, 
which reinforces the role of private sector in supporting Government actions on science and 
technology development.  
</p>
<p>82. Two federal universities were created with regional and interregional dimensions 
and are examples of solidarity cooperation undertaken by Brazil in the field of education. 
The Universidade Federal da Integra&#231;&#227;o Latino-Americana (UNILA),46 located in Foz do 
Igua&#231;u in the State of Paran&#225; was established in 2010. The objective of the university is to 
pursue interregional trans-disciplinary research and teaching in the areas of joint interest of 
MERCOSUR member countries47 focusing, for example, on the use of natural resources, 
trans-border biodiversity, social sciences and linguistic research and international relations, 
as well as relevant disciplines for strategic development. Half of its student quota is for 
Brazilians, while the other half is for other Latin Americans subsidized by Brazil. 
</p>
<p>83. The Universidade da Integra&#231;&#227;o Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira 
(UNILAB),48 is another example of cooperation solidarity and a boost for South-South 
cooperation in higher education.49 It is based in Reden&#231;&#227;o, in the north-east of Brazil, a 
place with historical importance as it was the first city to abolish slavery in Brazil. Half its 
students are Brazilian, and half are from Portuguese-speaking African countries, subsidized 
by Brazil. The teaching staff is comprised of Brazilian and African professors. In five years, 
UNILAB expects to have 5,000 Brazilian and African students in undergraduate and 
graduate courses in the fields of Health, Agronomy, Teacher Training, Engineering and 
Public Administration.50  In October 2012, UNILAB and the Brazilian Cooperation Agency 
signed an agreement to implement a pioneer project to provide the structuring of the 
network&#8217;s cultural and academic cooperation through partnerships with universities and 
research centres in the eight Portuguese-speaking countries of the Community of 
Portuguese-Speaking Countries (Comunidade dos Pa&#237;ses de L&#237;ngua Portuguesa).51

<p><b>greatly to the success of the first country study mission of this mandate on human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights and international solidarity.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Independent Expert commends the Government of Brazil for its policy and 
practice of solidarity that define its international cooperation programme in all its 
</b></p>
<p><b>modalities, both in South-South and triangular cooperation contexts. She finds it 
</b></p>
<p><b>remarkable how consistently solidarity was credited as the driving force of Brazilian 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation, across all ministries and offices of Government she visited.  More than 
</b></p>
<p><b>simply solving problems, cooperation was seen as a dialogue between nations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>peoples to address problems together, fostering equality and mutual respect.</b>  
</p>
<p>86. <b>The Independent Expert notes with admiration how Brazilian society is 
strongly attached to the values and principles of solidarity that are enshrined in its 
</b></p>
<p>Constitution, and which have become the driving force in Brazil&#8217;s international 
</p>
<p><b>cooperation. Overcoming inequality and persistent poverty, along with the problems 
</b></p>
<p><b>rooted in them, will require time and enormous effort on the part of the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>of Brazil and its people. These complex and interconnecting problems have spurred 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government to respond with numerous innovative and multifaceted programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>described in this report, designed to simultaneously address a number of concerns.</b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>The Independent Expert has observed how these efforts to overcome 
tremendous difficulties are sustained by a strong sense of solidarity, the same spirit 
</b></p>
<p><b>that has become the hallmark of Bra</b>zil&#8217;s international cooperation initiatives and that 
</p>
<p>has inspired others to reciprocate accordingly. Many of Brazil&#8217;s problems endure, but 
</p>
<p><b>many have also been overcome. Brazil deploys the lessons learned from both its 
</b></p>
<p><b>triumphs and failures, to enrich its international cooperation strategies upon request, 
</b></p>
<p><b>which its development partners have the free choice to adapt to their own context.</b> 
</p>
<p>88. <b>The international cooperation programme of Brazil described in this report in 
the fields of agriculture and food security, health, social protection and education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>play an important role in creating a global impact towards the realization of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, the goal of international solidarity in development cooperation. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Independent Expert has observed how international solidarity in the case of Brazil 
</b></p>
<p><b>emanates from the experience of the national Government in implementing its 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights within its own territories, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>shared with international development partners.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>The first country study mission of the Independent Expert that took place in 
Brazil has shown that international solidarity possesses instrumental value, while at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the same time it is an end in itself. It has also supported the value of best practices as 
</b></p>
<p><b>portals to the inherent interface between the policy and practice of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>solidarity and the realization of human rights, and how such good practices of 
</b></p>
<p><b>collective action on the ground</b>&#8212;<b>whether among individuals, groups of individuals or
